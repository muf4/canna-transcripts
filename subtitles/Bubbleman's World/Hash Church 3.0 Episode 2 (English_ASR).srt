to pick them up so so blessings yeah

49
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,379
it's interesting it's interesting as a

50
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,510
man growing older and just just slowly

51
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,569
losing the ability to do certain things

52
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:50,789
right it's a big challenge Marcus it

53
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,739
really is well because we don't feel

54
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:55,439
older

55
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:58,200
no I've raised like a kid yeah like a

56
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,939
kid yeah I look in the mirror and it's

57
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,989
like who the hell is that guy and and

58
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:07,169
yeah when I out on the farm and you know

59
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:10,200
there's there's a big tree has fallen

60
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:12,509
and I want to drag it out of the way so

61
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,909
I keep going on what I'm doing and I

62
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:17,280
can't do it I gotta go ask somebody else

63
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:19,680
to help me there's a real challenge for

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,240
somebody who's used to being able to do

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,040
whatever the hell he wants well I

66
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,920
discovered it I mean I'm not quite there

67
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,509
yet but at 47 a couple of years ago

68
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,699
almost three years ago I destroyed

69
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:32,939
myself on my dirt bike

70
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,069
and I I really damaged like an input

71
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:39,750

recently we got to hang out in Jamaica

82
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:12,409

83
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:15,810

84
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:17,939
aficionado women in the room right now

85
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,649
which I have a real fondness for in an

86
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:21,540
appreciation for and there are

87
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,939
incredible activists they're from Brazil

88
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,650
but they've been traveling around and

89
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,779
I'll kind of I kind of want you guys if

90
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:29,269
you can to

91
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:31,128
you know maybe give a little history of

92
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,439
your of yourselves how you guys got into

93
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:35,030
cannabis and where it's sort of led you

94
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,709
in the in these last couple of years

95
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:40,038
because I really dig what you guys are

96
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:43,310
doing first of all I would just like to

97
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:45,259
say it is an honor to be here because I

98
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,449
mean at least I can say for myself when

99
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:49,280
I fell in love with all this hash making

100
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:51,919
world like I used to watch that hash

101
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,809
search like a long long time ago so it

102
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,389
is an honor to be here today together

103
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,668
with Maria anymore super grateful and

104
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:02,720
happy thank you guys for having us

105
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:05,568
actually I haven't known past church for

106
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,780
as long as Alice but since I've known it

107
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:10,879
I've seen that it's like amazing that

108
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:13,758
putting so many people together in a

109
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:17,089
chatroom can make different

110
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,430
conversations come like unexpectedly and

111
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:24,288
everyone giving in their opinion so I

112
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:27,050
think it's a very very very effective

113
00:05:24,288 --> 00:05:30,050
and new way of doing communication in

114
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,270
Internet and it's an honor absolutely

115
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,530
well it's great to have you both and you

116
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:35,089
know one of the things I love that you

117
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:37,668
guys are doing is that you're sort of

118
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:39,429
you know Brazil is this incredible

119
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:42,288
country it just has these incredible

120
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,870
people it has this incredible terroir

121
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:46,728
it's I've never been able to visit but

122
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,439
I'm going to absolutely get down there

123
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:51,019
now that I've got some great Brazilian

124
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:53,209
friends and what I like about it you

125
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:55,879
know Brazil is almost cut off in a sense

126
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:58,038
that the people speak Portuguese and a

127
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:01,370
lot of people don't speak English so the

128
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:03,709
information of cannabis really is not as

129
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,528
accessible to the majority of the people

130
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:09,709
as it maybe should be and so this is why

131
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:11,718
I started with with Yao with the ganja

132
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:13,278
talks University to try and you know do

133
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:14,990
a little thing where he would translate

134
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:16,879
everything into Portuguese and then I

135
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,978
could help educate some of the Brazilian

136
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,589
people but you guys have taken it away

137
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:23,750
step further in the sense that you know

138
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,519
you guys have really good English as a

139
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,408
Second Language you're out in the world

140
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,930
I seen you guys in like California

141
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:32,028
working on grows and Humboldt and trim

142
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,860
and plants and growing plants and so I

143
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:35,709
love that you guys are out there doing

144
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,788
that and then bringing that back

145
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:39,509
consistently nine out of ten times when

146
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:41,219
I see you guys post

147
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:42,990
it's important ease and I can't

148
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,390
understand it but it makes me feel happy

149
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,199
that all of those other people can

150
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:50,699
understand it so great job on that it's

151
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,649
a bunch of information in English for

152
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,599
sure and you really reach one of the

153
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:56,429
most important things of our work which

154
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,180
is like getting all this information

155
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:02,220
that we have the privilege to to get in

156
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,990
touch with outside with our travels with

157
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,030
like me leaving awesome in California

158
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,920
and then translating it in a simple

159
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:10,289
language for Brazilians because we do

160
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,120
have a huge country and we do have a

161
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:15,060
bunch of stoners in Brazil especially

162
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:20,370
cannabis this would be like an amazing

163
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:23,850
and huge market and is there a lot of

164
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:27,389
hashish in Brazil and if there is is it

165
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:32,340
important or is it made in Brazil no

166
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:35,180
actually uh okay so Brazil has more or

167
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:38,869
less two hundred and ten million people

168
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:41,129
I would say I have no idea how much

169
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:44,160
percent of the population actually

170
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:47,219
smokes but of the population that does

171
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,250
Moke eighty percent I would guess like

172
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:53,550
but it's a good guess smoke something

173
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:56,399
that probably you guys if you're all in

174
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:59,069
Canada I don't know if you have seen but

175
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,289
it's like Greek meat brick meat from

176
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:04,980
kuala krai that one from the like and

177
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:08,819
these are seventies i don't even know so

178
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:12,300
no unfortunately the answers like there

179
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:15,180
is hash yes there is so for those of us

180
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,560
who like it and have the privilege to

181
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,819
buy it have a connection honestly guys

182
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,889
do you think that we just went to

183
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,659
humboldt like straight up like that no

184
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:31,979
we knew where the hash is coming from

185
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:33,810
and then we reach so how did you guys

186
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,639
get started on your your sort of hash

187
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:37,228
path because you guys are hardcore like

188
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,110
when I when I bumped into guys in

189
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,759
Jamaica you guys had all the times

190
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,529
resins you know like light-colored and

191
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,419
amber colored and like you guys are

192
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:47,490
connoisseurs like not everyone I bump

193
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:49,409
into pulls out like the straight fire

194
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,580
then I thought if you want to hit you

195
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:51,069
want to hit some of this like I have

196
00:08:50,580 --> 00:09:23,500
this

197
00:08:51,070 --> 00:09:26,410
I have this everywhere while I listen to

198
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:29,649
my talk about the story we have like I

199
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:34,088
think girls agree started because we are

200
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:36,850
good friends for like a while now and we

201
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:40,690
were like cannabis affections actually

202
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,639
and we started growing sheep started

203
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,339
growing with her boyfriends I went to

204
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:48,459
live in Barcelona and they started going

205
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:50,410
a lot to strain hunters and like met the

206
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:53,888
guys there and like they started talking

207
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:56,409
me so much and we were like exchanging

208
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:58,690
pictures every day and and then we said

209
00:09:56,409 --> 00:10:02,708
okay let's just roll on Instagram and

210
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:07,750
find out more about cannabis and both of

211
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:11,349
us from the starts looked smoking hash I

212
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:14,679
smoked tobacco a lot so for me it was

213
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:17,230
like get away from tobacco from likes

214
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:27,458
smoking Mobile's Marcus doesn't like

215
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:29,110
that but it's like and then starting to

216
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:32,078
know more and then Ellis went to

217
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:34,629
California I started dreaming so she

218
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,370
started teaching girls Irina lots and

219
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:38,438
then he started the process that Marcus

220
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,480
said of translating so much for the

221
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:42,068
Brazilian culture they're already doing

222
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,750
some experiments like the other day

223
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:45,879
actually when we were in Jamaica I

224
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:50,139
showed Marcos like first time we watched

225
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:53,500

232
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,720

233
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,410
message about how they're about to do

234
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,080
their first batch they are terrified to

235
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:18,579
make a mistake and I get it you don't

236
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,560
want to grow this beautiful crop and

237
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,970
make a mistake with your thing but

238
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,250
please I implore everyone that's

239
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,350

241
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,950

242
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,750
face don't be afraid to make mistakes

243
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,840
because that's where all of our

244
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:36,340
revelations literally come from and some

245
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,280
of the biggest innovations have come

246
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:42,160
from some pretty amazing sized mistakes

247
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,709
so don't be afraid to make mistakes I

248
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,259
know in the Instagram world of posting

249
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:49,840
only the perfect angles and the perfect

250
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:52,659
hash and the perfect colors we all

251
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,700
create this sort of illusion that that's

252
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:56,649
the world but the real reality behind

253
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,509
all of that that there's a bunch of

254
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,039
ugliness and there's a bunch of mistakes

255
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,860
and there's a bunch of disappointment

256
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:05,439
and there's a bunch of adversity that

257
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,879
actually will lead us to our successes

258
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,950
in life so use me more programís takes

259
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:14,320
absolutely oh my god and that's coming

260
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,770
from about that just came from skunk man

261
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,330
Sam and we all know that he's forgotten

262
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:21,759
more than most of us will ever know

263
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,070
about cannabis so that's a profound

264
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,289
statement for him to say so thanks for

265
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,270
backing me up on that and welcome to

00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,650
to the girls in green that we're showing

274
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,539

it's beautiful ready for people oh I'm

281
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,490
really envious let me tell you we we had

282
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,939
a good thing going for a long time I

283
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,889
opened my vape herb our Gees in 2003

284
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,980
quite quite a bit ahead of its time

285
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:37,080
really and Marc Emery opened one up not

286
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,639
too long later and it's still kind of

287
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,670
going but a lot of the lounges in our

288
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,009
city that opened up unfortunately have

289
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:45,990
sort of disappeared and closed down and

290
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:47,519
even a couple of puff Wednesday's ago

291
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,129
with John Breaux fellow what we found

292
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,710
ourselves in the rain under a bridge

293
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:56,850
having a session because there was

294
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:58,680
nowhere for us to disappointment you

295
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:27,149
know it's like look it's legal we have a

296
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:29,279
federal law it's like welcome Colin I'd

297
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:31,019
muted you so if you go to talk I just

298
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,149
needed you I I thought your mic was

299
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:35,149
affecting Debbie's but I think it was

300
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:37,379
just her connection so hopefully she can

301
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:39,059
she can make it back that he always has

302
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:43,259
a bit of a hard time on hash search but

303
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:45,629
once it works out she's she is an OG in

304
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:48,779
the in the community down in California

305
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:50,820
for sure she was one of I guess she

306
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,919
started with H an originally at the

307
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,440
Berkeley patients group but even before

308
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:57,299
that I knew I knew Debbie I met Debbie

309
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,570
through Hillary Black who started the BC

310
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:03,539
compassion Club and I met her and one of

311
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:06,090
her partners at the time here right

312
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:10,980
actually two doors two doors over from

313
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:14,910
the house I'm in right now 20 to 23

314
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:17,639
years ago is when I met Debbie so what a

315
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:19,620
kind of trippy small small little

316
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,149
community it is for those that like I

317
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,190
mean here's the thing about the cannabis

318
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:25,529
community it's it's there's a multitude

319
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,180
of pathways there's this sort of you

320
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:28,459
know there's the business aspect which

321
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:30,769
is like yes

322
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,050
that's not really the community you know

323
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:36,199
the community is is more like people

324
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:39,019
like like wait and like forest and like

325
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,450
Wendy Turner and like you know stuntman

326
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:43,460
Sam and I just I just see the community

327
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,910
as this wonderful incredible thing

328
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:49,519
that's growing daily every time I go to

329
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:53,689
events I meet new and interesting people

330
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:56,389
here's a trippy story I used to have a

331
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,730
neighbor that we didn't really connect

332
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,319
we were friendly to one another but I

333
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:03,980
always felt like I could have been his

334
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:07,040
friend and in the end I ended up finding

335
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:10,430
him had left two days ago and I walked

336
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,319
by and he was selling green houses and I

337
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:14,539
said hey Ted what what are you doing

338
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,160
here and he said oh well I I sell

339
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:18,139
greenhouses to the cannabis industry

340
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,819
industry and I'm like we'll have for how

341
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:23,169
long have you been doing that well I

342
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:26,629
sold my first greenhouse probably in

343
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:28,789
2008 for cannabis and I was just like

344
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:31,309
this guy was my neighbor for like two

345
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:32,838
years and we never hung out and he I'm

346
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:34,939
like making all the hash and he's

347
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,360
selling all the greenhouses we got there

348
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,220
wait little tincture down the hatch

349
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,600
Waits dosing there live on hash search

350
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:47,480
good to see you good to see I found that

351
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,570
a little bit of CBD and THC a couple

352
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,220
times a day helps a man feel good

353
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:55,278
ace I felt like you were gonna do some

354
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,170
sort of Mary Poppins play on a little

355
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,409
bit of sugar and helps the medicine go

356
00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:02,088
down and there it was man I appreciate

357
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:04,068
that I feel like that was a psychic

358
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:06,140
moment and now the dragonfly earth

359
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:11,359
medicine has come into the hash search

360
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:13,640
room about that good morning I'm solar

361
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:17,389
for right now super happy to join you I

362
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,309
was left lift was great no like I made

363
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,350
lifts wonderful because I smoked hash

364
00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:23,808
everywhere I went I walked around with

365
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:26,869
my pipe and my torch like this and then

366
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:29,149
I just blazed inside and at large groups

367
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:31,069
like only one group told me to leave

368
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,290
their booth because I was puffing but I

369
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:35,509
have to say how many very large

370
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:38,899
companies were willing to allow me to

371
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:40,910
vaporize a dab of cannabinoids was was

372
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,620
good and it helped me realize look

373
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,150
obviously I was pushing that end

374
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:46,579
a little bit not trying to get anyone in

375
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,860
trouble but trying to push the envelope

376
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:51,619
that maybe if we had cannabis use that

377
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:55,519
these events rather than free alcohol we

378
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:57,589
might create a different vibe for for

379
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,720
you know for the business that we're

380
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:01,099
doing so I mean I think that's so

381
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,350
important because you're talking about

382
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:05,389
cannabis community and that is cannabis

383
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:08,418
community and it's sort of like hey here

384
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:10,250
we are and this is us and it's it sort

385
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:12,830
of helps in a way infiltrate the

386
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,240
community into the industry and I think

387
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:16,460
that that's important I'm glad that you

388
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,528
are pushing it well you know I always

389
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,509
knew that cannabis does help change the

390
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:22,640
way you think regardless of your

391
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:24,798
inhaling it into your lungs you could be

392
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,000
consuming it you could be wearing it you

393
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,470
could be driving down the highway and

394
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,640
see it growing on the side of the road

395
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,319
it'll have an effect on your

396
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,169
consciousness it's just the way the

397
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:35,569
plant works but if you are inhaling it

398
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:38,090
it's really like it's the one they're

399
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:40,788
the most afraid of they've kind of like

400
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:43,038
okay yeah okay maybe it's medicinal okay

401
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:45,679
it's maybe it's recreational but like

402
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:48,500
you know for God's sakes don't inhale it

403
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,169
into your lungs but would you like some

404
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,909
tequila that's just the mentality that

405
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:54,679
they're coming could that they're coming

406
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:57,500
from and I don't exactly know who they

407
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,700
are when I say BAE but I just I think

408
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,319
it's important for us to push the

409
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,090
envelope I don't want to be rude I would

410
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,250
never blow like create a smoky

411
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:06,048
environment but I'm vaporizing at low

412
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,778
temperatures I'm sharing this wonderful

413
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:12,259
resin with everyone at the event and and

414
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:15,278
all of us are at that event monetizing

415
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:19,339
this incredible you know beautiful

416
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:22,490
female aspect of the cannabis plant so

417
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:24,980
there should be a respect that that is

418
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:27,079
is there as well so I try to bring that

419
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,929
yeah you know when I went down to the

420
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:32,808
NCI a to do a presentation down there

421
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:34,730
there's a lot of you know suits a lot of

422
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:37,369
big sort of corporate industry people

423
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,470
and then you know after parties and

424
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:42,109
stuff and I was the only one there who

425
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,179
was smoking it was it was a trip to me

426
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:46,250
and I feel like it's important you know

427
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:49,278
like every time that we sit down to do

428
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:52,519
any type of a meeting or and because any

429
00:19:49,278 --> 00:19:54,200
type of signatures or you know gonna do

430
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,059
any mergers or anything like that I

431
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,430
always pull up a chair for the camera

432
00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:00,109
plant you know i say hey you know this

433
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,240
is this is such a big part of this

434
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:04,159
industry and we can't forget about you

435
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,559
know this plant so we always pull up the

436
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,180
chair for the plant as well and say this

437
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,279
is what we're all here for and i think

438
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,049
that it's important i mean i really got

439
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:14,059
to give it up to obviously i can say

440
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:17,539
this about everything for everything but

441
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:22,069
the OG to do it was was was spent man

442
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:24,649
sam like he just did not give [ __ ] he

443
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:26,990
would puff everywhere he was just like

444
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,460
and I was always like that - it's not

445
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,740
like I saw him and I was like I'm gonna

446
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,059
copy him and do that but it was one of

447
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,059
the things I was like I'm probably gonna

448
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:37,099
get along with this guy he does not give

449
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:39,440
a [ __ ] he's definitely going to be using

450
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:41,389
cannabis wherever he wants and he'll

451
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,660
gladly get into a loud discussion about

452
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:48,740
it I was I'm where we at a restaurant

453
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:51,050
one time you me and Rob and well I think

454
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:53,599
it was I think it was Simone's place I

455
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:54,889
think we were there and you were like I

456
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,669
want a smoke and he was like of course

457
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,960
you can smoke so of course Sam smokes as

458
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,940
we all do cuz Rob and I aren't going to

459
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,620
watch Sam smoke and not smoke and then

460
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,269
someone in the restaurant like that like

461
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:07,159
some Dutch people or whatever we're like

462
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,720
upset that we were smoking in the

463
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,970
restaurant and the owner of the

464
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:17,930
restaurant told them that they could

465
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:22,519
leave if that happened sort of happened

466
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:23,660
to us at the Roger Waters con we may

467
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:27,950
have gotten in trouble with the Roger

468
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:50,240
Waters concert - yeah yeah it seems to

469
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:53,230
happen everywhere I go that's very true

470
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,529
- Jack was very very much like that and

471
00:21:53,230 --> 00:22:00,289
almost equally as abrasive as Sam could

472
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:00,829
be about it like and I say that with

473
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:02,170
love

474
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:07,329
I definitely don't follow

475
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:12,420
he couldn't be I don't know man Jack

476
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:14,859
could be pretty a brace in a good way

477
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,630
anyway good to have these old memories

478
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:18,240
good to have you know everyone in the

479
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,890
room right now we kind of had a nice

480
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,529
quiet start to hash Church today like I

481
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:26,290
said we had no plans of discussion we

482
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:28,089
just were like let's gather and and talk

483
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:31,659
and so you know a little bit more about

484
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:34,990
lift I guess I didn't really see any uh

485
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,750
I did I did see one of our alumni one of

486
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,210
our congregation Jonathan's aid if you

487
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,980
remember this young fellow

488
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,870
Jonathan was maybe 15 years old when he

489
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,990
came on hashed Church I can't maybe he

490
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:50,199
was older but he was the kid who was

491
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:52,390
starting really intelligent kid very

492
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,490
much not from the cannabis world very

493
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:57,190
just like growing up in a Jos trading

494
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,319
environment and I'm just intelligent and

495
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,130
sort of got sick and started using

496
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:05,379
cannabis and then became like the face

497
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,450
for you know getting the insurance

498
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,910
companies to pay for it the same way

499
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:12,309
they do pharmaceutical drugs and so I

500
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:15,730
did see him speed a little bit I felt

501
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:16,419
bad that there was very few people in in

502
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,779
those seats

503
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:21,370
and I've had that I think I had that

504
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:22,869
with someone else I can't remember who

505
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:24,279
it was they were telling me they went up

506
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:26,169
to tell their story and their stories

507
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,329
super profound and it's like a patient

508
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,190
story and there was just very few people

509
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:32,980
there and then you know the the guy from

510
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,590
malboro or the tobacco Giants came and

511
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,390
spoke and it was standing room only you

512
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:38,799
know so that was kind of like I guess

513
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:45,490
that is a little bit of what's going on

514
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:51,309
in the campuses right now but yeah it's

515
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:52,690
our MMJ it started out pretty small but

516
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:54,579
yeah it's at the convention center it

517
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:58,269
happens in Toronto and it happens in

518
00:23:54,579 --> 00:24:00,339
Vancouver and you know it's it's a time

519
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:02,710
where an enormous amount of people from

520
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:04,419
the community come down um if you guys

521
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,430
remember the documentary I don't know if

522
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,920
I sent it out by email I find it meant

523
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:11,170
to I might have space called the need to

524
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,710
grow I sent it to Josh and Kelly for

525
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,779
sure

526
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,660
I may have sent it to you wait I'm not

527
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:18,039
sure it's password

528
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,720
it's a good documentary it's got some

529
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:22,928
sort of inspirational stuff in there and

530
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,058
I think it would be a good thing to have

531
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:26,830
a talk about it eventually and so I met

532
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:29,349
the one of the guys who was involved in

533
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:31,750
in that film and that was kind of valued

534
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:33,939
time that I spent with him and and I saw

535
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,099
you know good people from you know Ian

536
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,769
Davidson from Segre I got to spend a

537
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:40,808
bunch of time with him I bumped into

538
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:42,369
Aaron from DNA genetics and he's like oh

539
00:24:40,808 --> 00:24:45,609
I just you know we had a power failure

540
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:47,049
right before I left LA California and I

541
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,839
didn't bring a jacket and it was

542
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:51,190
freezing out so I gave him my jacket

543
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,079
whatever man you know I got you so I

544
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,299
gave my jacket off my back so he and

545
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:56,500
then I saw him in the city a day later I

546
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:58,480
was driving and I was like that looks

547
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,130
like my jacket and it's he's got the

548
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,650
hood up his hands in the pocket it's

549
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,390
pouring rain and cold and I'm like he

550
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,429
didn't see me but I laughed I was like

551
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:08,679
okay he's getting through he said of the

552
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:12,480
jacket and while I was talking to Aaron

553
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:15,809
from DNA sabo from ha new labs

554
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,289
walks in the door and I I loved Sabo

555
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:22,058
he's just such a great guy I'm always

556
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:23,799
wanting him to come on and share I love

557
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:27,069
the way he does these dialogues these

558
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:30,639
sort of parenting and cannabis use talks

559
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:31,990
that he's really sort of pioneered from

560
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,860
my perspective okay

561
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:38,410
did you see IRAs talk on on psychedelics

562
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:40,209
by any chance I unfortunately missed it

563
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:43,450
but I got the better cliff note version

564
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:46,029
from IRA herself while I chained fed her

565
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,500
dabs at a booth that had like a big

566
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:49,269
joint rolling machine she was like oh

567
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,069
let's go to my friends booth and that's

568
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:52,599
what I loved about lifted people that

569
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:55,659
had paid big money for these booths

570
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:58,029
people that had like interest in all

571
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,220
sorts of you know you know look we don't

572
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:03,069
want to be I'm not interested personally

573
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,440
with all licensing and what my companies

574
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:07,869
are going through to be like breaking a

575
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,299
bunch of laws but I do need to push the

576
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:12,428
envelope of civil disobedience to a

577
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:14,889
point where we understand like listen we

578
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:17,110
need lounges give us somewhere to do

579
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,809
this then if we can't do it wherever we

580
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:21,909
are we need not more often we gotta

581
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:23,049
break those boundaries down so those are

582
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:26,230
the rules that are made to be broken

583
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:28,058
like we're not doing our job if we're

584
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,620
following those rules like that they

585
00:26:28,058 --> 00:26:30,960
have

586
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:32,819
business being in town with their

587
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,960
corporate entities without a smoke and

588
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:41,069
lead all over the place oh the one not

589
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,329
good thing all these rules is like when

590
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:44,549
I was in high school

591
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:47,490
you got way higher when you smoked a

592
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:50,700
joint in the boys bathroom then if you

593
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:52,740
didn't a place else just the reality I

594
00:26:50,700 --> 00:27:12,029
mean that really is the truth right

595
00:26:52,740 --> 00:27:17,190
there a priority for cannabis so it's so

596
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:20,519
weird how people you know willing to

597
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:22,230
come above regulated it's nearly

598
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:30,359
impossible

599
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:32,970
god speed thing I go back to because I

600
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:35,549
hear that and it pains me it pains me to

601
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,470
hear things like Colton and his family

602
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:39,960
had to move away from their family to be

603
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:42,058
like in prison in Colorado basically

604
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,039
because the only place they could use

605
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:46,799
that that cannabis sort of safely it's

606
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:49,859
just it's just such a bummer but then I

607
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,159
think it's not quite as big of a bummer

608
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:56,039
as you know say Rick Dooley sees father

609
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:59,880
getting put in prison for the last 37

610
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:02,129
years or four when they would kick our

611
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,470
doors down and like shoot the dog and

612
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:06,510
then break up the family and then have

613
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,029
the wife have to visit the husband in

614
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:10,829
prison for 10 years on the other side of

615
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:12,660
the country you know because they

616
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:14,490
weren't doing all that sort of [ __ ] for

617
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,500
a long time too so I think what they're

618
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:19,140
doing now is complete and total [ __ ]

619
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,690
as well but it's such a more filtered

620
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,259
diluted version of the [ __ ] that we've

621
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:28,110
been dealing with for the last 30 years

622
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:33,289
that we we Trek on like you're doing it

623
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:33,289
Gaby you're just like no no I'm

624
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:41,089
legislation because it's far from

625
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,730
perfect and it created this ridiculous

626
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:46,490
tax scheme and and it should be obvious

627
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:48,049
that the underground economy is left out

628
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,730
of the above-ground markets it's too

629
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:51,589
crazy to get in and it's a lot of guys

630
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:54,890
in suits to be honest and it really does

631
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:56,629
suck but at the same time we're working

632
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,700
to improve it and we still do have a

633
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:07,370
flourishing underground economy like it

634
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:12,009
or not so worried that they're going to

635
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:14,599
shoot our dogs you know there's been so

636
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:16,400
in some ways I think like this like

637
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:18,679
gotta keep getting those suits don't

638
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,720
like isn't it the more high we get them

639
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:24,220
like the more they think like us doesn't

640
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,220
marijuana change the way that they're

641
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:45,350
like you're saying it's so curious he

642
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:47,539
wanted to dog even put a little drop on

643
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:49,250
the top of the puffs go that they take a

644
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:57,829
hit from if you really want to change

645
00:29:49,250 --> 00:30:00,380
the minds I follow I follow the Timothy

646
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:02,509
Leary school of thought not for many

647
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,190
things but for his two commandments of

648
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:07,250
thou shalt not keep people from taking

649
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:09,860
psychedelics and it matters about about

650
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,750
errs about ghosts yes and I shall not

651
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:18,859
give psychedelics without one's

652
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:20,900
knowledge yeah and I and and totally

653
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:22,549
agreed it does change the way people

654
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,519
think and that's why if you have the

655
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:27,349
opportunity to give someone who's never

656
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:30,559
been given a DAB that could you know

657
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:32,719
could affect things down the road and in

658
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,490
a really good way be responsible and

659
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,400
don't use that as an opportunity of

660
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:39,500
revenge to destroy the person but use

661
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,450
that as an opportunity to truly give

662
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,210
someone a special experience and show

663
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:46,160
them how incredible of an experience you

664
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:49,039
can have from this plant I'm I am the

665
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,380
master of the micro dab because I want

666
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,420
people to feel that the taste I

667
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,850
I certainly don't want to destroy them

668
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,800
like what that's really cool like give

669
00:30:55,849 --> 00:30:59,480
that person two hours of anxiety and

670
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:01,460
discomfort and then have them never want

671
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,250
to use cannabis again like give yourself

672
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:07,490
a check if you're doing that and what

673
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:11,769
have I done it yes okay I was joking

674
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,769
about that and I totally agree with you

675
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:23,869
people don't want to smoke so be it

676
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:26,990
help them make money off of cannabis

677
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:28,819
then change your mind also well that's

678
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:33,500
what's changed most of their minds right

679
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:35,720
now so many of them it's a good thing I

680
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,180
mean what would you rather have them

681
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:43,940
doing locking people up and putting them

682
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:46,460
in dude this is where this is where you

683
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,750
and I see eye to eye Sam because I say

684
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,490
this to people and they look at me like

685
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:52,400
I'm an alien they're like they're like

686
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,539
we can't let judges and cops be a part

687
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,370
of this industry and I'm like why would

688
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:56,899
you rather than be bashing people's

689
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:59,299
heads in and giving them ten year

690
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,430
sentences for cannabis of course we want

691
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:04,129
cops and judges to be involved in

692
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:06,500
cannabis oh my god we don't want them to

693
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,510
control it but we they should be allowed

694
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,220
to play and and everyone should be

695
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:13,490
allowed to play that's what I'm fighting

696
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:15,200
for I don't know I think no I would have

697
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,319
to disagree with you guys on this one

698
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,269
okay you know I think I think that it's

699
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,859
really important that the craft that

700
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:23,569
you're taking on and something that

701
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:25,309
you're making money on and something

702
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:27,049
that you're putting you know your whole

703
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:29,119
life work toward is something that you

704
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:31,129
should actually know about you know as a

705
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,659
heart surgeon somebody doesn't go in and

706
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,340
be like oh I'm studying all this heart

707
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,110
surgery I'm calling myself a heart

708
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:38,359
surgeon but hey I've never done heart

709
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:40,309
surgery before but I'm out there in the

710
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:43,639
world doing heart surgery you know or

711
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:45,950
like oh you know me in the naturopathic

712
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:49,280
world you know seeing all these you know

713
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:51,259
massive male doctors that are OBGYNs and

714
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,210
are trying to help women have babies and

715
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:54,529
they're saying it's gonna be okay go

716
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,210
ahead have your baby

717
00:32:54,529 --> 00:32:58,430
you know when they've never experienced

718
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,500
it before it's really hard for me to

719
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:04,759
feel like you have to make that bridge

720
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:06,950
in order to to embody something that

721
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:08,660
and feel really good about it and know

722
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:12,410
that you're doing the right thing that's

723
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:15,050
a very very good point that is very well

724
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:18,440
Marcus and I are really saying is it's

725
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:22,190
better for them to be selling growing

726
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:26,000
whatever then busting and putting people

727
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:27,500
in yes and and we need those people to

728
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,720
change the way they think and we want

729
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:33,019
those people to change and why would we

730
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,130
try to keep them from that change so

731
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:35,930
that's all you know what I mean there's

732
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:38,900
these counter points to it cuz when you

733
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:41,360
on that point that point makes all the

734
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:44,300
sense in the world of course we want

735
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:47,179
them to be in imagine they come to your

736
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:49,339
face probably I don't know why I was

737
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:51,590
doing it I just I would love to offer my

738
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:54,769
time and energy I want it like do we

739
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:56,329
hold people to the mistakes or to the

740
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:58,759
choices that they've made in their past

741
00:33:56,329 --> 00:34:01,669
or do we allow for growth in this world

742
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:04,099
are we here to grow or are we here to

743
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:07,009
you're either at the top at this level

744
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:09,739
right now or you can't be with us over

745
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:11,750
here because we've walked this walk it's

746
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:14,779
like no I walk the walk but I did it

747
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:17,449
like a Naga Bubba for everyone not just

748
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,450
for myself well that's what's important

749
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:23,119
this plant is an adaptogen it when you

750
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:25,579
ingest it when you grow it it adopts the

751
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,190
soil when when you're around it it

752
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:30,619
adapts your mind when a community takes

753
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,860
it on it adapts a community it's an

754
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:37,909
adaptogen so I think that it's really

755
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:41,809
important to see all different facets of

756
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:44,960
it you know one thing I would I would

757
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:47,360
argue the same you know way that a small

758
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,590
grower you know the industry and I would

759
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,899
say hey it's important for you to know

760
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:54,470
all parts of this now the plant is

761
00:34:50,898 --> 00:34:57,529
adapting it's okay to step to step in

762
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:59,509
the poor side a bit as well because then

763
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,390
you're seeing all sides of cannabis as

764
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:04,850
it is today just as if I would say that

765
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:06,440
to the corporate entities hey smoke a

766
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:08,449
little bit so you can see the whole

767
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,130
picture of it and it's not just a

768
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:12,319
born-again Christian thing where you can

769
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:15,860
just be like oh I'm changed forever hire

770
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,140
me yeah no for sure everyone yes great

771
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,670
points go ahead it's very it's very much

772
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:21,879
the red

773
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:23,950
thread it's it it draws a line where

774
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,559
everyone can kind of pay attention and

775
00:35:23,949 --> 00:35:28,000
come together on them it allows us you

776
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,859
know it's like the circle you know you

777
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,469
invite everyone and you try to invite

778
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:34,598
everyone into the circle and you you you

779
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:37,118
share in that but there's you know

780
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:39,068
there's it's delicate - you know I see

781
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,680
both sides of it and I appreciate both

782
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:43,150
sides of it but it's really delicate you

783
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,789
need to understand where we come from

784
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,889
and where we're going and you know we

785
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:49,329
want to include as many people as we can

786
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:51,429
but we also want to have you know

787
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:54,250
everyone's voice at the table - we don't

788
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:56,889
want to be you know just moving too

789
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,480
quickly it is delicate and at that point

790
00:35:56,889 --> 00:36:01,239
I'm glad we were able to have a

791
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,369
conversation where you know like we can

792
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:05,588
disagree but still like I like I stick

793
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:07,838
by my point and then Kelly said what she

794
00:36:05,588 --> 00:36:09,880
said and I was like I'd stand by her

795
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,519
point - so now I'm standing on both

796
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,760
sides of the fence like wow it's really

797
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:17,318
about having the discussion because it

798
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,119
changes and there there's really subtle

799
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:21,429
nuances and the changes that if you're

800
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,440
not continually having the dialogue and

801
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,419
we become afraid to have the

802
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,858
conversation that's like oh I I'm not

803
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,318
going to commit to that I don't want to

804
00:36:26,858 --> 00:36:31,449
get bashed on social media it's like

805
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:33,219
then then all of a sudden it just goes

806
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:34,960
away and it becomes a lot more shallow

807
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:36,879
and I think it's one of the values of

808
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,440
gestures that we're all willing to have

809
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,950
these conversations whatever they are

810
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,389
they take us down these rabbit holes and

811
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:45,219
doesn't necessarily mean we have to be

812
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:47,230
that person that we were three years ago

813
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:49,118
oh you said this three years ago yeah

814
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,710
and in those three years I grew and I

815
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,789
changed and I learned and now I'm saying

816
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:56,429
this does that allow god I hope so

817
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:59,529
[Music]

818
00:36:56,429 --> 00:37:02,289
people is it's not right that they make

819
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:05,230
a profit when they were anti cannabis

820
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:08,289
for so long well so what if they were

821
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:10,449
anti cannabis do you want them to stay

822
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:13,119
in that cannabis or would you like those

823
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:16,480
would be if the only thing that'll move

824
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:19,710
them is to be you know try to make money

825
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:25,269
off of cannabis I say more power to them

826
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:27,250
yeah I really don't care

827
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:29,500
no you never have the whole time I've

828
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,050
known you potent ponics steve is in the

829
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,340
room

830
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:34,710
Zimbabwe in Africa right now he's saying

831
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:37,079
you know they should be lining up behind

832
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:39,630
the cannabis veterans it's disrespectful

833
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:43,079
to those who hid and fought for decades

834
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:46,680
and I I see his point as well I've just

835
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:49,259
it's it's a hard thing to just pick one

836
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:51,059
side because I see I'm like yeah I don't

837
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,430
want them doing that anymore I'd way

838
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:56,579
rather than be like yeah like maybe I'll

839
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:58,379
do and when I say like oh if someone was

840
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:59,969
busting people for like the last 20

841
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,800
years and now they want to be in the in

842
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:03,419
the cannabis industry well maybe they're

843
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,039
not a cannabis grower but maybe they're

844
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,690
really good at security and they'll keep

845
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,789
your cannabis grow from getting ripped

846
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,500
off you know like it's not like I'm

847
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:25,590
saying they should get it and start

848
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:29,869
becoming our growers is that I feel like

849
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,869
cannabis is mad magical and

850
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:38,429
transformational before you use cannabis

851
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:40,530
you're one way you use it afterwards

852
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:42,779
even on facility we want it to be

853
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:44,790
transformational like that you feel one

854
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:57,300
way you come into the facility the way

855
00:38:44,789 --> 00:39:07,349
you're weak an entire industry we want

856
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:12,720
to transform drives those values by what

857
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:13,260
it does to our minds that's what's

858
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,939
missing

859
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,470
wear your damn suit but you gotta

860
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:23,220
realize this isn't corn this is a

861
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:24,809
magical plant we're transformational if

862
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:27,029
you're gonna say if you'd wanted to just

863
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:29,670
make money [ __ ] I don't know if we're on

864
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:32,849
the same page exactly I'm gonna try and

865
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:34,380
transform you yeah exactly it's doubtful

866
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:37,559
that it's gonna go the other way around

867
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:40,650
yawn yawn big time eight we're gonna

868
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:43,788
look at his tooth they need transfer

869
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:47,829
tape transformation

870
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:50,749
just like alcoholics need transformation

871
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:54,318
and mythical people of problems they

872
00:39:50,748 --> 00:39:58,248
need transformation well they're tied up

873
00:39:54,318 --> 00:40:00,798
people they need French donation we

874
00:39:58,248 --> 00:40:03,048
really do well we could flip the script

875
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:05,088
here really quick because Y on Big Time

876
00:40:03,048 --> 00:40:07,849
Inc my boy in Brooklyn just made a

877
00:40:05,088 --> 00:40:09,708
really good point and he said you know

878
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:12,199
in New York it's it's not about the

879
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:16,098
police and the and the the cannabis

880
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:17,778
veterans it's it's a race thing so now

881
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:19,939
we get into what about all the brown

882
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:21,409
people in prison for this still and all

883
00:40:19,938 --> 00:40:23,148
the white people who are profiting off

884
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:26,599
of it and who wants to have that

885
00:40:23,148 --> 00:40:29,418
discussion because that's where everyone

886
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:31,880
has go to art and tell in California

887
00:40:29,418 --> 00:40:34,548
this year there was actually a lot of

888
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,769
families that were held at gunpoint here

889
00:40:34,548 --> 00:40:39,380
and there there were police officers

890
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:42,888
that cut down people's green houses and

891
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:46,159
there were a lot of families afraid this

892
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:49,789
year and and so it is a little hard you

893
00:40:46,159 --> 00:41:38,148
know to be a radical family member and

894
00:40:49,789 --> 00:41:39,880
join with anyone but it doesn't process

895
00:41:38,148 --> 00:41:42,828
but it's not easy to pin down

896
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:47,269
legislatively equity you can't be like

897
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:51,729
you just can't get permits based on race

898
00:41:47,268 --> 00:41:51,728
that's not allowed either how do you

899
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:02,528
and out of it starts with people having

900
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,528
to work very hard

901
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:12,619
yeah and you know the the cost of the

902
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:14,598
permits and where you you know gonna get

903
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:17,568
your money in and how is it that you're

904
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,640
gonna start up and if you've been in you

905
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:22,369
know the black market or an illegal grow

906
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:24,409
for a really long time how is it you're

907
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:26,358
gonna form a corporation like here in

908
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:28,848
Canada you have to have a corporation

909
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:31,460
that's formed by you know the Government

910
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:33,349
of Canada but in order to have that you

911
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:36,108
know you have to show some kind of funds

912
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:38,509
in order to get an account up here in

913
00:42:36,108 --> 00:42:41,929
Canada that's listed under hemp or under

914
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:44,389
cannabis sorry you you have to be able

915
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:46,068
to show that you have funds and if you

916
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:48,528
don't show where those funds came from

917
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:49,788
and you've been in the black market and

918
00:42:48,528 --> 00:42:52,699
you weren't able to put it into

919
00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:54,200
something you know that made sense for

920
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:56,149
them to be able to accept your

921
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:58,219
application then you're [ __ ] out of

922
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:00,619
water it's it's it's a so well at this

923
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:02,419
point and I believe that you know a lot

924
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:05,298
of the cannabis culture is dealing with

925
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:08,778
with that as well as a lot of you know

926
00:43:05,298 --> 00:43:11,239
people of color all over the world you

927
00:43:08,778 --> 00:43:13,608
know I don't were women and even women

928
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:16,338
too a lot of women are in this industry

929
00:43:13,608 --> 00:43:19,518
and they didn't show where their cash

930
00:43:16,338 --> 00:43:21,858
was come from they you know just making

931
00:43:19,518 --> 00:43:23,568
cash and and now they can't step into

932
00:43:21,858 --> 00:43:25,848
the injury because they have zero credit

933
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:27,650
and so and that's a super huge you know

934
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:29,960
issue I believe in the in the brown

935
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:32,059
cultures as well is because you know

936
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:36,798
it's not credit in the same way so

937
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:38,960
there's not an equal playing field but

938
00:43:36,798 --> 00:43:41,599
to jump in together and become stronger

939
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,400
like if people of color are having a

940
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,650
hard time it doesn't mean you can't do

941
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,809
it it almost makes it even more amazing

942
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,389
when you do it so I would love to see

943
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:51,470
more you know brown people more women

944
00:43:50,389 --> 00:43:52,879
you know I don't like to just call it

945
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:55,338
brown people it just feels weird you

946
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,259
know but but any person that feels like

947
00:43:55,338 --> 00:43:59,239
they're not having an opportunity I

948
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:01,608
would love to see those people rise up

949
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:03,470
and and we're trying to help network you

950
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:06,139
know create that and you know another

951
00:44:03,469 --> 00:44:08,358
thing is within our pure collective when

952
00:44:06,139 --> 00:44:11,179
we sat down in Garberville and we had

953
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:13,308
these discussions bringing you know

954
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:16,190
more people into the industry that don't

955
00:44:13,309 --> 00:44:17,960
have opportunity was a really big part

956
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:20,690
of our list and how are we gonna do that

957
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:23,179
how are we going to help support small

958
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:24,980
farmers all over the globe be able to

959
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:27,289
come into the industry and share their

960
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:29,869
craft not only share their craft but

961
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:31,969
also talking about Appalachia you know

962
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:34,160
this term Appalachia is really only used

963
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:36,828
in Lisbon it's something that you really

964
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,949
can only gain if you're you know run to

965
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:43,430
their credibility and their you know

966
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:46,460
their rules and regulations and that

967
00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:49,129
might not include you know a culture

968
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,500
that's working up in mulana that has has

969
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:54,858
been you know making hash for centuries

970
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:57,489
do they deserve as farmers to be able to

971
00:44:54,858 --> 00:45:00,469
have an appellation in Canada cannabis

972
00:44:57,489 --> 00:45:03,379
absolutely they do so we need to be

973
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:05,808
creating an equality around the globe of

974
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:07,760
cannabis farmers and and cannabis

975
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:11,059
culture so that they can be a part of

976
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,190
this industry and moving forward and the

977
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:14,960
way that we can do that is by joining

978
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:17,119
together and the people that have power

979
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,099
and do have licenses right now to start

980
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,170
including them in on the conversations

981
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:22,730
and that's exactly what we're doing in

982
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:28,220
the peer collective right now is wearing

983
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:30,858
clean these cultures that might not have

984
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:33,169
ability to sign out applications and and

985
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:35,750
be able to have accreditation in in

986
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:43,280
banks to be able to have a voice and be

987
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:45,079
able to have so well said in you know

988
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,710
it's as someone who's had to navigate

989
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:54,019
the extreme learning curve of getting

990
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:56,358
into this this space you know it's to

991
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:59,088
your point it's confusing and it's you

992
00:45:56,358 --> 00:46:00,440
know you have to learn to to trust in a

993
00:45:59,088 --> 00:46:03,500
way that you've never learned to trust

994
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:06,500
before and there's so many facets of

995
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,059
this that you're just not gonna you're

996
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,039
not gonna know about you know because

997
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:12,230
you've been focusing on on what's really

998
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:14,690
important which is a plan and that's

999
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:17,719
that's it's really difficult to navigate

1000
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:19,400
all of it so it's so it's it's really

1001
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:21,409
important that we do band together we

1002
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,568
all come together in a way that is is

1003
00:46:21,409 --> 00:46:26,838
community forward and we

1004
00:46:23,568 --> 00:46:29,778
our experiences with one another in in

1005
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:32,719
sharing how to get our plant to more

1006
00:46:29,778 --> 00:46:35,989
people you know the industry is you know

1007
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:40,608
I hope we can make it community you know

1008
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:42,289
and community forward yeah and I think

1009
00:46:40,608 --> 00:46:45,199
that it's really truly the only way

1010
00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:47,119
because yeah it's pretty intimidating to

1011
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:48,889
look at these really large poly core

1012
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,949
critics that have stepped into the

1013
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:53,900
industry and you know you know they they

1014
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:56,028
are really making something of it we

1015
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,798
have a lot to learn from them we can we

1016
00:46:56,028 --> 00:46:59,809
can even join in with them but it's also

1017
00:46:57,798 --> 00:47:02,208
incredibly intimidating because you know

1018
00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:03,798
they may have a stop 400 and they're

1019
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:06,318
asking us how many you have and we're

1020
00:47:03,798 --> 00:47:08,958
like well before you know four people

1021
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:10,759
will work for our corporations but then

1022
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:12,409
but then you've got another small

1023
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:14,298
corporation and then another small

1024
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:16,759
corporation and then you've got this

1025
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:19,068
huge collective so we're adding up the

1026
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:21,739
amount of regenerative flour that our

1027
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:23,719
corporation as a group is growing and

1028
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:25,969
it's absolutely phenomenal and it's all

1029
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:27,949
over the world and then it makes us feel

1030
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:29,719
like oh okay we've got to stay in here

1031
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:32,329
we've got something and now we can truly

1032
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:34,309
make changes because if we want to go

1033
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:36,199
make legislation we can say you know

1034
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:38,749
this piece of legislation we strongly

1035
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:40,608
agree that you all should really you

1036
00:47:38,748 --> 00:47:44,088
know get behind because it's signed on

1037
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:47,150
by seventy scientists forty doctors a

1038
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:49,728
hundred seventy farmers and and and that

1039
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:52,068
really gives a you know a credibility to

1040
00:47:49,728 --> 00:47:53,958
be able to change the industry from the

1041
00:47:52,068 --> 00:47:55,608
inside out which is I know you Marcus

1042
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:57,889
you always talk about that changing

1043
00:47:55,608 --> 00:48:00,018
industry from the inside out and that is

1044
00:47:57,889 --> 00:48:02,298
a way that we can do it that has

1045
00:48:00,018 --> 00:48:03,978
incredible power and really we have a

1046
00:48:02,298 --> 00:48:06,650
lot of work to do outside of that like

1047
00:48:03,978 --> 00:48:07,189
we gotta find good hash strings you know

1048
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,349
we're trying

1049
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:12,798
good try Coneheads what's all this

1050
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:14,690
business you know yeah yeah it's the

1051
00:48:12,798 --> 00:48:17,478
qualitative tell you know gets to the

1052
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:19,699
quantitative to tell that story you know

1053
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:21,348
these people you know we can't we have

1054
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:23,719
the knowledge that we can bring to the

1055
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:25,699
table to a to let's say a bill for

1056
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:26,900
instance is unparallel you're gonna be

1057
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:30,108
able to speak on the plant

1058
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:33,889
you know the do's and don'ts in in how

1059
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:36,259
IPM should be done you know it it really

1060
00:48:33,889 --> 00:48:37,338
it stems into all these different facets

1061
00:48:36,259 --> 00:48:42,559
that goes way beyond

1062
00:48:37,338 --> 00:48:45,228
on numbers and you know bottom lines and

1063
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:48,499
and all the things that get so top line

1064
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:51,498
that are really secondary it's it's it's

1065
00:48:48,498 --> 00:48:53,209
all that stuff in terms of the industry

1066
00:48:51,498 --> 00:48:54,828
it's all about the planet and if you

1067
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,528
don't you know if you can't actually

1068
00:48:54,829 --> 00:48:59,269
grow the plant well all the rest doesn't

1069
00:48:57,528 --> 00:49:01,369
matter and if you don't know what the

1070
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:03,588
do's and don'ts of that aren't you just

1071
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:06,200
it just doesn't matter so that's where

1072
00:49:03,588 --> 00:49:09,619
community I see has all of the power and

1073
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:11,748
all of the knowledge and all of the the

1074
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:13,039
resources really to share and to really

1075
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:16,368
build this in the way that it really

1076
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:17,869
should be you know it's it's an

1077
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:21,079
ornamental that we're attempting to

1078
00:49:17,869 --> 00:49:22,969
industrial industrialized you just said

1079
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:25,249
it we're we're still finding cultivars

1080
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:27,259
that are really meant for making ash I'm

1081
00:49:25,248 --> 00:49:29,209
still going through I you know I'm still

1082
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:32,088
I've been growing the same for cultivars

1083
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:34,489
for hash making for over two decades at

1084
00:49:32,088 --> 00:49:37,460
this point and it's because there's very

1085
00:49:34,489 --> 00:49:39,769
few that make the cut you know and we

1086
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:41,679
can spend a lifetime searching and if we

1087
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:43,968
had more people around like ourselves

1088
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,889
sharing and the ideas that hey I have

1089
00:49:43,969 --> 00:49:48,409
this cultivar hey you should have that

1090
00:49:45,889 --> 00:49:50,778
cultivar well yes we'll get much further

1091
00:49:48,409 --> 00:49:53,239
let's start now with you telling what

1092
00:49:50,778 --> 00:50:00,528
for for cultivar so starting to even

1093
00:49:53,239 --> 00:50:03,699
make an hash so lemon cake is one this

1094
00:50:00,528 --> 00:50:08,150
particularly variety of Strawberry Cough

1095
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:09,798
it has since we've we've sequenced it

1096
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:12,710
with medicinal genomics we've learned

1097
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:18,199
that there's a e Caleo inside that

1098
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:23,599
variety I have a variety that is a chem

1099
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:28,218
dog x OG kb that is just just

1100
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:34,479
unbelievable that is just it's it's

1101
00:50:28,219 --> 00:50:39,829
phenomenal and i have a yes yes yes

1102
00:50:34,478 --> 00:50:41,598
years yes I've had this for the Ken dogs

1103
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:44,390
oh maybe a little bit a little bit less

1104
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:48,759
but the other two the lemon cake and the

1105
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:51,078
the strawberry and then this particular

1106
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:53,708
variety of Jack Herer

1107
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:56,450
chimes hash plant that is just

1108
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:58,899
unbelievable it's just it just dumps it

1109
00:50:56,449 --> 00:51:03,828
has this like for its beautiful

1110
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:06,380
beautiful heads so you know and just

1111
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:08,749
this week I just I just you know washed

1112
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:12,410
some of these varieties in a in a in a

1113
00:51:08,748 --> 00:51:16,009
facility and it just you know just it

1114
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:18,649
reminds me you know how simple it was

1115
00:51:16,009 --> 00:51:19,728
and how complex it's gotten and then at

1116
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,588
the end of the day we're still

1117
00:51:19,728 --> 00:51:22,728
collecting these heads and it's there's

1118
00:51:21,588 --> 00:51:24,558
there's not really nothing different

1119
00:51:22,728 --> 00:51:28,669
here other than the process has gotten

1120
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:32,680
bigger so on that note how about a bong

1121
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:32,680
rip all you mother lovers out there

1122
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:43,400
Marcus has a lot of knowledge about

1123
00:51:37,478 --> 00:51:50,509
varieties making water - using his bag

1124
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:52,700
system and that would drive should be

1125
00:51:50,509 --> 00:52:01,039
there's different groups people have

1126
00:51:52,699 --> 00:52:12,288
different clothes like that Sleestak

1127
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:16,039
crossed with skunk those varieties still

1128
00:52:12,289 --> 00:52:20,319
are with me now and they're growing

1129
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:24,650
right now and they're great phenomenal

1130
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:26,449
so we we have really amazing hash makers

1131
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:28,459
in our peer certification because we

1132
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:31,039
don't allow solvents and are in our

1133
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:35,448
certification and tensor of chemical

1134
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:38,660
solvents yeah and ganja Gill and and

1135
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:41,358
Brandon coach Kirk and and the families

1136
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:44,748
down there there's a lot of fun perilous

1137
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:47,150
cards John but recently we've been

00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:50,180
more and they're just amazing people you

1140
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:52,458
should check them out online they make

1141
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:54,348
incredible hash and and Ben also

1142
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:57,469
searching for hash strains and washing

1143
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:59,420
them a lot and stuff so recently we've

1144
00:52:57,469 --> 00:53:01,130
gotten some really good you know strains

1145
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:02,989
from them and other people in the family

1146
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:04,519
went out to Michigan engage Green we got

1147
00:53:02,989 --> 00:53:08,230
some really beautiful genetics

1148
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:12,980
them but we recently just cloned a

1149
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:23,990
strawberry guava and purple punch punch

1150
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:26,000

1173
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:44,809
rolling over there especially like dry

1174

00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:04,940
I'm pure certified she certainly is part

1182
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,769
of our collective and a part of our

1183
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,900
community and everything and Jesse

1184
00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:14,829
Bioware protects we got some really good

1185
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:17,220
genetics from him this year the GMO buy

1186
00:55:14,829 --> 00:55:22,348
banana at what

1187
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:24,719
ASF OG banana dog so it's the banana buy

1188
00:55:22,349 --> 00:55:26,340
the black dog and one thing that we've

1189
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:28,500
been really blown away with lately

1190
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:32,280
because we just really felt like we

1191
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:35,579
found the the unicorn on our farm last

1192
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:38,820
year was a coffee variety that we phyno

1193
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:40,889
hunted you know massive I know Marcus

1194
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:42,630
you saw that coffee I think you got to

1195
00:55:40,889 --> 00:55:44,429
smoke that and we even did a little Roz

1196
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:46,140
and pressed with that and I've got some

1197
00:55:44,429 --> 00:55:49,019
really nice stuff off of it well we kept

1198
00:55:46,139 --> 00:55:51,690
that varietal and we cloned it off and

1199
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:54,480
you know it's like anything else we'll

1200
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:56,840
have any type of a pathogen on it and

1201
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,949
that is just clean as can be it's

1202
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:02,250
unbelievable it doesn't seem to be

1203
00:55:58,949 --> 00:56:04,710
attacked by any type of yeast or molds

1204
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:06,300
or any so we're really gonna start

1205
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:09,539
sharing that with the community because

1206
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:12,780
it hashes out so that is that is a full

1207
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:15,179
melt certified cultivar you got to add

1208
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:17,849
the full mount certification on some of

1209
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:20,759
your de M pure because the cultivars

1210
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:22,650
that do you know that melt and liquefy

1211
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:26,690
that's that's full melt certified people

1212
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,690
need to know that that information

1213
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,000
because we are going to be doing

1214
00:56:35,449 --> 00:56:42,199
well is that no no you can finish sorry

1215
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,789
I think it we could we were done go

1216
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:47,119
ahead you got something to say jump in

1217
00:56:43,789 --> 00:56:50,509
oh yeah no I was gonna say some strange

1218
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:53,269
that I've seen here in rewind and Chile

1219
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:55,550
because you guys are up there and I have

1220
00:56:53,269 --> 00:56:58,730
been like wile Ellis has been living in

1221
00:56:55,550 --> 00:57:01,160
California and well doing an amazing job

1222
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:02,990
with hash making and growing plants I've

1223
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:05,089
been actually searching for things that

1224
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:07,429
are happening here in South America and

1225
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:10,579
recently I've come across like some

1226
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:13,399
amazing hash women hash makers in Chile

1227
00:57:10,579 --> 00:57:19,069
like copper design jizz which is like

1228
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:21,710
the NZ scope for hash like it had fired

1229
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:25,100
Chilean it's a Chilean cook yeah it had

1230
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:27,650
five judges three were them of them were

1231
00:57:25,099 --> 00:57:31,130
women and I was like what I had never

1232
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:34,940
seen that here like ever and well in

1233
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:36,950
Hawaii winter collective which are two

1234
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:40,250
Brazilians that have been growing there

1235
00:57:36,949 --> 00:57:43,759
they have like made one of the best hash

1236
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:47,440
I've smoked of a very very famous strain

1237
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:52,820
here in South America that is the 24k

1238
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:55,909
which is like yeah and popular here like

1239
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:59,120
every cup I go around here they some

1240
00:57:55,909 --> 00:58:01,759
kind of or a hash or the flour will get

1241
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:05,210
like first second or third place because

1242
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:09,590
here not so many people row and like we

1243
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:12,199
exchange a lot so you see wisdom we need

1244
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:14,870
to make like a seed thing for Brazil to

1245
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:16,669
you know because it is like this kind of

1246
00:58:14,869 --> 00:58:18,289
informations that we're discussing here

1247
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:20,119
and I hope that there are many

1248
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:21,650
Brazilians that actually speak English

1249
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:23,750
that have the privilege to speak lingers

1250
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:26,780
are watching like a bunch of people they

1251
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:29,150
they grow they grow to see that it comes

1252
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:31,100
from the briefie you know it's maybe

1253
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:32,720
like a land raised kind of something

1254
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:35,000
from part of web but they grow from that

1255
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:36,679
they don't know about Fino hunting they

1256
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,019
don't know about silletti genetics and

1257
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:41,210
they check things on our Instagram

1258
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:43,579
sometimes about hash making and they're

1259
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:45,559
just like doing hash with their like

1260
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:48,079
dreams from like plants that are not

1261
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:49,230
hash plants at all so if we bring this

1262
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,199
information if

1263
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:54,929
managed somehow to like exchange seeds

1264
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:56,250
and then give this to the people also

1265
00:58:54,929 --> 00:58:57,358
people are gonna have information

1266
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,858
they're gonna start like a whole

1267
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:01,980
different

1268
00:58:57,858 --> 00:59:05,099
I like dragonfly on your arm by the way

1269
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:10,360
if that's what I'm seeing that's really

1270
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:10,360
[Laughter]

1271
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:19,650
in South America is it water hashes it

1272
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:22,259
tricep is rosin is what are they doing

1273
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:24,180
how are they doing it the people they

1274
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:25,710
are doing most of them I feel like

1275
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:28,469
they're doing like so Mentalist

1276
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:31,139
extraction like so Mentalist ways and

1277
00:59:28,469 --> 00:59:33,419
but I mean I gotta say it is a huge

1278
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:36,449
privilege to be doing this like it's not

1279
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:39,150
everyone it's hard to grow the amount

1280
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:41,368
that you need to like make hatch like

1281
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:43,500
people are not like growing like six

1282
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:45,570
plants are there in their places like in

1283
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:48,480
the grow box so they can wash it don't

1284
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:50,670
you know no way yeah they wash it with

1285
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,309
the trim it's just a little bit it's

1286
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:55,650
just an experience but a bunch of people

1287
00:59:53,309 --> 01:00:01,230
do that's the dry seeds like the dry

1288
00:59:55,650 --> 01:00:03,930
said and people are still experiencing a

1289
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:07,469
lot with butane and some kind of

1290
01:00:03,929 --> 01:00:10,019
solvents but people better like that

1291
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:14,099
competing in cups and things like that

1292
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:15,809
they have already shipped so you see

1293
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:18,000
that the people that still don't have

1294
01:00:15,809 --> 01:00:20,849
much access to information and like

1295
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,858
scared of not having enough out of their

1296
01:00:20,849 --> 01:00:24,750
trim and they could be doing something

1297
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:28,920
that they know that they would have like

1298
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:31,679
a better amount like alcohol is still

1299
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:33,480
being used by mothers that are producing

1300
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:47,129
their medicine for your kids in your

1301
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:49,920
house like because there's not much like

1302
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:51,358
big cultivars it's hard for you not to

1303
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,240
have big cultivars for you to make a

1304
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:57,029
bunch of it new experiences yeah and

1305
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:59,579
Marcus you did a huge educational piece

1306
01:00:57,030 --> 01:01:01,800

1307
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:03,088

have watched that you've done like

1310
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,170
really gotten on ground level to really

1311
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:12,988
reach the Brazilians and I really

1312
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:16,469
commend you for that because I took time

1313
01:01:12,989 --> 01:01:18,449
to watch that educational pieces and it

1314
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:21,059
was really beautiful and the feedback

1315
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:23,608
that we we even got from that was like

1316
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:26,009
awesome and telling us how great you are

1317
01:01:23,608 --> 01:01:28,018
and and the education night before and

1318
01:01:26,009 --> 01:01:30,150
she was doing really beautiful work you

1319
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:32,788
talked about him before with with ganja

1320
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:34,650
toxin and he was telling us about the

1321
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:36,119
the ganja there the brick weed and

1322
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:38,130
everything and he was talking about how

1323
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:41,039
there was and maybe you can elaborate on

1324
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:44,190
the public about how there was a boat

1325
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:46,499
full of Thai weed that crashed off the

1326
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:49,469
coast of Brazil or something and a bunch

1327
01:01:46,498 --> 01:01:51,449
of bags of weed and went onto the coast

1328
01:01:49,469 --> 01:01:53,969
of Brazil and everyone said I was from

1329
01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:56,759
Thailand so any good any good eat in

1330
01:01:53,969 --> 01:01:58,650
Brazil is called Thai or skunk and

1331
01:01:56,759 --> 01:02:01,498
that's just the way it is and then it's

1332
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:02,940
not good and we don't condone this but

1333
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:05,278
he said that a lot of people just put

1334
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:06,749
terpenes on the brick weed in order to

1335
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:08,309
get like different flavors and really

1336
01:02:06,748 --> 01:02:10,649
Brazilians are just learning about

1337
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:12,180
different flavors so I'm just gonna wrap

1338
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:15,599
this up I want to hear you have to say

1339
01:02:12,179 --> 01:02:17,460
about this but we are corn you're really

1340
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,920

1341
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:28,588

kind of going on a world tour of

1344
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:35,700
conscious growing and conscious living

1345
01:02:33,509 --> 01:02:37,199
we're gonna be in and humbled we're

1346
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:39,149
gonna do all three signs of regenerative

1347
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:41,848
cannabis is the one in Maine in Michigan

1348
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:43,680
we're also going to Hawaii and we're to

1349
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:47,400
do the Hawaii cannabis Expo and do a

1350
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:48,960
whole pakalolo Aloha tour bringing about

1351
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,358
farming in Hawaii and then we're going

1352
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,400
to in May we're going to the flame of

1353
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:55,108
Thrones and Ireland I'm learning all

1354
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,028
about the you know work going on in

1355
01:02:55,108 --> 01:02:59,759
Ireland so and we're doing little cups

1356
01:02:57,028 --> 01:03:01,559
and little conscious growing cups the

1357
01:02:59,759 --> 01:03:03,599
whole place we would love to go to

1358
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:06,569
Brazil and South America to bring that

1359
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:08,700
that love and that that education to

1360
01:03:06,568 --> 01:03:11,190
there but I look first of all like tell

1361
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:15,169
us about the weed and anti weed and

1362
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:17,809
Brazil okay so I mean tough time

1363
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:20,450
is like a very old-school way of like

1364
01:03:17,809 --> 01:03:22,400
mentioning it like nowadays people smoke

1365
01:03:20,449 --> 01:03:25,219
either debris tweed or this look like

1366
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:27,980
some Columbia then you call it Columbia

1367
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:29,779
but it's like well at least that one you

1368
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:31,579
can see the but because a bunch of

1369
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:34,430
people in Brazil were not educated on

1370
01:03:31,579 --> 01:03:36,500
how cannabis looks if they see that if

1371
01:03:34,429 --> 01:03:37,969
they saw but they didn't know that that

1372
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:40,548
was me they thought that that was just

1373
01:03:37,969 --> 01:03:42,289
like a regular plant sometimes because

1374
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:44,838
they found that weed was too briefly and

1375
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:47,808
it shouldn't be green sheet shiny Brown

1376
01:03:44,838 --> 01:03:49,730
should be brownish so if you ever show

1377
01:03:47,809 --> 01:03:53,780
something that it's like a bit colorful

1378
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:55,130
it's like a normal flower or something

1379
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:58,190
different because it doesn't have the

1380
01:03:55,130 --> 01:04:00,858
shape and it doesn't Li smell or looks

1381
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:03,200
like so yeah I feel like in the last

1382
01:04:00,858 --> 01:04:05,210
like five years people were looking for

1383
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,129
more information into cannabis being

1384
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:09,650
educated about it and people were like

1385
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:12,260
on the people are on this drive of like

1386
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:15,980
wanting to grow quality weed wanting to

1387
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:17,900
fight for like regulations actually it

1388
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:19,699
is so nice to be here in many ways and

1389
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:22,068
just I mean just us are from South

1390
01:04:19,699 --> 01:04:24,048
America and like deal with like this

1391
01:04:22,068 --> 01:04:26,659
kind of prohibitionist government in

1392
01:04:24,048 --> 01:04:28,759
this place this way but it's crazy how

1393
01:04:26,659 --> 01:04:30,858
much we fight for legalization and

1394
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:33,740
regulations and then we we go to

1395
01:04:30,858 --> 01:04:36,199
California where we go to Canada and we

1396
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:39,108
see the amount of issues that actually

1397
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:41,838
what we have always dreamed of like

1398
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:43,759
bring us like yeah the next year's like

1399
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:46,759
that you know like we see like all these

1400
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,650
people in suits we see like just big

1401
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,510
corporations in Brazil we don't have the

1402
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:52,430
culture as like humble like people

1403
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:54,109
growing wheat for the past 30 40 years

1404
01:04:52,429 --> 01:04:56,509
like that like making a bunch of money

1405
01:04:54,108 --> 01:05:01,219
out of it but we do have like a cannabis

1406
01:04:56,510 --> 01:05:04,400
community the thing is this year things

1407
01:05:01,219 --> 01:05:07,279
changed a bit so like of what he said is

1408
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:11,780
perfect but it would apply a bit for

1409
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:14,900
like I would say before 2019 because

1410
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:18,099
this year actually popular media started

1411
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:20,869
covering a bit of the benefits of

1412
01:05:18,099 --> 01:05:23,869
medicinal cannabis or therapeutic or

1413
01:05:20,869 --> 01:05:25,869
cannabis is we prefer to refer yeah we

1414
01:05:23,869 --> 01:05:28,460
just got like therapeutical cannabis

1415
01:05:25,869 --> 01:05:32,660
legalized many

1416
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:36,030
there because it's like only imported

1417
01:05:32,659 --> 01:05:39,299
super-expensive Oh main floor like only

1418
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:41,790
an oil maybe like only decorated

1419
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:46,170
compound like separated cannabinoid like

1420
01:05:41,789 --> 01:05:47,969
very less than 0.3 percent of THC from

1421
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:50,519
the pharmaceutical industry you know

1422
01:05:47,969 --> 01:05:53,250
like not as like we could create a

1423
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:54,710
community of like people growing it in a

1424
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:57,539
very sustainable way in a very

1425
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:59,579
regenerative far away in a form like

1426
01:05:57,539 --> 01:06:04,019
that but not yet but we hope that we can

1427
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:07,019
bring back so once this happens people

1428
01:06:04,019 --> 01:06:08,789
can start normally my sustainably well

1429
01:06:07,019 --> 01:06:11,219
there's very there's very important

1430
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:14,429
research in cannabinoids that have been

1431
01:06:11,219 --> 01:06:17,519
done in Brazil and San Paulo for years I

1432
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:21,299
think the original study that mushroom

1433
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:24,509
worked on to show its efficacy against

1434
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:28,789
epilepsy was done in the late 70s and

1435
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:32,100
early 80s in San Paulo and I just I just

1436
01:06:28,789 --> 01:06:33,869
posted in our chat here a very important

1437
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:37,679
study that shows the connection between

1438
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:39,539
CBD and traumatic brain injury memory

1439
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:43,440
they again could be the thing that

1440
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:45,539
underpins PTSD treatment so truth be

1441
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,389
told there's been cannabinoid research

1442
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:50,219
going on in Brazil for years and and

1443
01:06:48,389 --> 01:06:54,179
these centers of excellence have

1444
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:56,609
generated very important data that show

1445
01:06:54,179 --> 01:07:00,029
you know clinical and preclinical office

1446
01:06:56,610 --> 01:07:04,760
efficacy of cannabinoids to treat a

1447
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:04,760
number of disorders including epilepsy

1448
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:14,099
oh just so you guys understand like all

1449
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:15,630
of this cannabinoids or not like room

1450
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:19,259
here or made here they're normally

1451
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:20,880
imported from America or Canada so they

1452
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:23,070
get a permit so they can import the

1453
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,170
substance not only CBD may even

1454
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:27,570
psychedelic research like they manage to

1455
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:30,420
import MDMA already they manage to

1456
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:32,610
import LSD already so there have been

1457
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:35,610
some researchers like next like like

1458
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:37,590
that but it's always important and now

1459
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:43,010
they're making one with people that have

1460
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:43,010
well some drug abuse with track

1461
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:48,629
people from North America come down to

1462
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:51,058
Brazil for ayahuasca treatment I know

1463
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:54,778
two people who claim that they would be

1464
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:56,400
dead if they did not go to Brazil for

1465
01:07:54,778 --> 01:07:58,949
their ayahuasca I know that that's been

1466
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,260
commercialized in some ways shapes and

1467
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:03,210
forms people are making money off the

1468
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:05,039
whole thing but yeah I mean if you think

1469
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:08,309
about it I mean why would we limit

1470
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:12,450
ourselves just to you know the elements

1471
01:08:08,309 --> 01:08:14,609
of ayahuasca or a a cannabis when

1472
01:08:12,449 --> 01:08:17,219
there's a whole rainforest of

1473
01:08:14,608 --> 01:08:20,338
possibilities of different medicinally

1474
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:22,619
active plants and and compounds that we

1475
01:08:20,338 --> 01:08:24,149
haven't even discovered yet so that's

1476
01:08:22,619 --> 01:08:28,198
part of the reason why I think we need

1477
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:29,849
to you know work like crazy until they

1478
01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:32,278
you know get rid of all of the

1479
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:34,710
rainforest to make sure that we've made

1480
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:36,710
all the discoveries of life-saving

1481
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:39,119
medicines before it all goes away

1482
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:40,980
because I think that you know again I

1483
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:44,488
there is a program down there to look at

1484
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:46,829
that but you somehow Brazil and the

1485
01:08:44,488 --> 01:08:49,439
government should be able to exploit

1486
01:08:46,829 --> 01:08:52,439
this basically pharmaceutical company

1487
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:54,358
that exists in the rainforests of all

1488
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:57,298
these unknown medicines that are yet to

1489
01:08:54,359 --> 01:09:00,509
be discovered and therein lies economic

1490
01:08:57,298 --> 01:09:04,139
empowerment and opportunity for jobs and

1491
01:09:00,509 --> 01:09:08,369
certainly new medicines from biology as

1492
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:11,338
opposed from you know drug companies our

1493
01:09:08,369 --> 01:09:14,460
governments right now is crazy and

1494
01:09:11,338 --> 01:09:17,130
doesn't invest in science there's an

1495
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:20,158
advance in new talents like the good

1496
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:22,469
people like that want to study they want

1497
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:26,809
to we even have someone that we really

1498
01:09:22,469 --> 01:09:26,810
like it wasn't a TV show here this week

1499
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:31,798
scientist and he said his canapes and

1500
01:09:29,639 --> 01:09:33,960
dreams like he's a very crazy dude

1501
01:09:31,798 --> 01:09:36,658
amazing person he was actually on

1502
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:41,929
psychedelic science in California

1503
01:09:36,658 --> 01:09:44,278
presenting a bit of his work he said

1504
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:45,869
scientists like people that do research

1505
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:49,710
they are just leaving Brazil because we

1506
01:09:45,869 --> 01:09:51,088
have no room for this like scientists

1507
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:54,859
and teachers they're being from their

1508
01:09:51,088 --> 01:09:54,859
own pocket because they don't get like

1509
01:09:58,909 --> 01:10:00,970
you

1510
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:03,650
you

1511
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:14,409
but I just said that happened happen

1512
01:10:10,329 --> 01:10:19,029
through a loophole which is like FDA

1513
01:10:14,409 --> 01:10:22,210
from America likes for a sanitarium is

1514
01:10:19,029 --> 01:10:24,819
saying look there is no way there's like

1515
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:28,000
at least 7,000 kids good eye

1516
01:10:24,819 --> 01:10:30,670
I already import them CBD or THC or

1517
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,909
whatever or both of them because they

1518
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:37,029
are gonna die or they have like this

1519
01:10:32,909 --> 01:10:40,479
proven cases which are they need to use

1520
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:43,059
this medically so even and then the

1521
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:46,929
government's when they work worth voting

1522
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:49,630
they changed the board they fired two

1523
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:53,200
people from the original board and put

1524
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:55,840
two military that's what happened and we

1525
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:58,119
still passed it but like with many many

1526
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,230
quotes as decided so that's what's

1527
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:05,349
happening here in Brazil we do have some

1528
01:11:01,229 --> 01:11:08,139
very very beautiful studies like see

1529
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:10,480
that tiny bit oh and scientists working

1530
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:14,770
but they're getting from like sometimes

1531
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:24,489
private investment sometimes their own

1532
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:25,960
pockets right now outside it's it's hard

1533
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:28,119
to be here doing this

1534
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:30,010
there's no ultimately they want to keep

1535
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:32,170
it separated you know I mean that's the

1536
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:34,090
thing you know keep it separated keep it

1537
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:36,130
illegal so then they can capitalize on

1538
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:38,289
the good information that's brought so

1539
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:41,560
really that's fine if that's the way

1540
01:11:38,289 --> 01:11:43,960
that it is it just takes people and the

1541
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:46,660
citizens and educated intelligence to

1542
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:49,569
rise up and create programs that that

1543
01:11:46,659 --> 01:11:50,289
are undeniable ones that make sense I

1544
01:11:49,569 --> 01:11:52,029
wouldn't say that

1545
01:11:50,289 --> 01:11:55,149
that the government paved the way for

1546
01:11:52,029 --> 01:11:57,460
maps to do their work I think that maps

1547
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:59,409
paved their own way to do their work and

1548
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:01,000
now they're doing work that's undeniable

1549
01:11:59,409 --> 01:12:02,619
that the government can't do anything

1550
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,319
about because it's now become a human

1551
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:07,720
rights issue so I think once we start

1552
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:09,639
using words like human rights and here

1553
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:12,159
we are we're taking on our own power

1554
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:13,420
back and you know we're we're doing this

1555
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:15,639
through intelligence and through

1556
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:17,529
education that I think that we we just

1557
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,990
have to continue to be smarter and more

1558
01:12:17,529 --> 01:12:20,179
Intel

1559
01:12:17,989 --> 01:12:22,399
and what's being presented to us yeah

1560
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:24,200
and yet again like we we continue to say

1561
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:26,210
is that you know the cannabis plant is

1562
01:12:24,199 --> 01:12:30,769
an incredible catalyst to push us and

1563
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:32,869
catapult us forward you know I love to

1564
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:35,720
separate the word community to come

1565
01:12:32,869 --> 01:12:37,849
unity and I think that that's really

1566
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:39,740
powerful because it's now is the time

1567
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:41,720
that we need to start unifying as

1568
01:12:39,739 --> 01:12:43,789
cannabis culture all over the world and

1569
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,930
we all know who we are no matter what

1570
01:12:43,789 --> 01:12:47,329
color we are no matter what

1571
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:49,100
socioeconomic background we come from

1572
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:50,989
here are somebody who uses cannabis you

1573
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:52,670
are part of the cannabis culture and I

1574
01:12:50,989 --> 01:12:54,710
think that it is time for us to come

1575
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:57,170
together and and also just a side note

1576
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:59,689
on you know I I don't I don't really

1577
01:12:57,170 --> 01:13:07,699
know very many governments that aren't

1578
01:12:59,689 --> 01:13:12,139
crazy right now really answer there

1579
01:13:07,699 --> 01:13:14,359
there is their own people we're getting

1580
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:16,190
an incredible mass and an incredible

1581
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:18,469
crisis and I truly believe that the

1582
01:13:16,189 --> 01:13:20,539
cannabis plant is making her her

1583
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:22,940
announcement and making her way into the

1584
01:13:20,539 --> 01:13:24,289
world because of this it's not just you

1585
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:26,750
know something that's happening by

1586
01:13:24,289 --> 01:13:29,149
coincidence you know all psychedelics

1587
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:30,829
are starting to to come out into

1588
01:13:29,149 --> 01:13:31,969
mainstream culture and cannabis is

1589
01:13:30,829 --> 01:13:34,640
coming out into mainstream culture

1590
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:37,420
because it is time for us as a critical

1591
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:40,340
mass to start questioning the rules and

1592
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:42,230
regulations of government unless so

1593
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:45,500
let's not think about our borders in our

1594
01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:47,000
countries even though we do have to live

1595
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:49,250
within the regulations that are being

1596
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,039
been given to us but if we forget about

1597
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:53,840
the borders and create common language I

1598
01:13:52,039 --> 01:13:56,449
think we're going to become stronger as

1599
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:59,360
an international group and that can be

1600
01:13:56,449 --> 01:14:01,670
done through education for sure one

1601
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:03,529
thing we don't have though like here we

1602
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:05,239
are a few of us in California our

1603
01:14:03,529 --> 01:14:07,429
California program just become widely

1604
01:14:05,239 --> 01:14:12,319
known for its failures as much as its

1605
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:14,600
successes right like just just this week

1606
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:16,460
a couple things happened the Bureau of

1607
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:19,100
cannabis control decided that they're

1608
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:21,710
gonna run taxation differently right it

1609
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:26,090
used to be done at distribution now

1610
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:27,859
they're moving it to retail very soon

1611
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:31,539
and then the governor just put out this

1612
01:14:27,859 --> 01:14:33,609
thing he's like this is a short story

1613
01:14:31,539 --> 01:14:37,329
the program's all messed up I'm going to

1614
01:14:33,609 --> 01:14:38,829
be doing a bunch of things to fix it but

1615
01:14:37,329 --> 01:14:40,809
they're considering cutting cultivation

1616
01:14:38,829 --> 01:14:44,829
tax at all they stacked so many taxes

1617
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:46,810
it's ridiculous equity so a big problem

1618
01:14:44,829 --> 01:14:49,319
we don't have a model that works

1619
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:51,400
we just don't you know we can target

1620
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:53,799
disadvantaged neighborhoods and stuff

1621
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:56,529
like that but I don't know how we're

1622
01:14:53,800 --> 01:15:17,470
gonna do this for example we don't have

1623
01:14:56,529 --> 01:15:19,239
a model to share with each other yeah

1624
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:21,010
well what we do have though Debbie and I

1625
01:15:19,239 --> 01:15:22,719
totally agree with you I feel like

1626
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:24,909
anytime you know a government is

1627
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,940
involved and we have as many problems as

1628
01:15:24,909 --> 01:15:29,559
we have solutions you know unfortunately

1629
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:31,989
because regulations are so steep but

1630
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:34,840
what we do have is we have the cannabis

1631
01:15:31,989 --> 01:15:37,359
community we have written SOPs on how

1632
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:39,100
you can run a 5 acre farm that we can

1633
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:42,819
share with anybody in the world we have

1634
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:45,310
SOPs on on how how to create healthy

1635
01:15:42,819 --> 01:15:47,079
extractions ones that you know are both

1636
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:50,860
medicinal and for the recreational

1637
01:15:47,079 --> 01:15:53,289
market as well yes that we can continue

1638
01:15:50,859 --> 01:15:55,989
to share so the war every bit of work

1639
01:15:53,289 --> 01:15:58,180
that we do in the cannabis community and

1640
01:15:55,989 --> 01:16:00,130
inside of these you know markets that

1641
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:01,930
we're living in around the world we can

1642
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:04,569
share with each other so that really

1643
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:06,630
gives a step up to the peep

1644
01:16:04,569 --> 01:16:06,630
you

1645
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:11,760
their countries

1646
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:14,050
you

1647
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:18,250
you cut it and then you stop talking who

1648
01:16:16,869 --> 01:16:20,920
was next who's next

1649
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:23,079
do we lose her no I think she was done

1650
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,940
talking but she froze just for the last

1651
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:26,069
little bit they're moving again so I

1652
01:16:24,939 --> 01:16:29,289
think we're good

1653
01:16:26,069 --> 01:16:31,929
we heard nice today creating a

1654
01:16:29,289 --> 01:16:33,698
repository for open source data sherry

1655
01:16:31,929 --> 01:16:38,050
you know we don't know where to go I

1656
01:16:33,698 --> 01:16:39,309
don't know where to go in the early days

1657
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:40,420
of the internet right it doesn't matter

1658
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:41,770
how they did it there was all the

1659
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:49,000
corporate guys and then there were the

1660
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:51,760
people creating things like hey Debbie

1661
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,738
Debbie could I share an analogy when

1662
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:57,550
when you were talking about an

1663
01:16:53,738 --> 01:16:59,229
experience like creating experience you

1664
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:01,329
know it reminded me of it I don't know

1665
01:16:59,229 --> 01:17:03,129
maybe it's because I'm wearing a Jerry

1666
01:17:01,329 --> 01:17:04,210
Garcia shirt it reminded me of a

1667
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:06,940
Grateful Dead concert

1668
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:08,920
you know that there were certain things

1669
01:17:06,939 --> 01:17:10,149
that were gonna be the same but there

1670
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,100
were certain things that were different

1671
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:15,698
every time and it created a unique

1672
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:18,400
experience and I keep on throwing this

1673
01:17:15,698 --> 01:17:20,349
Grateful Dead analogy in and even like

1674
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:23,079
their business model which was so

1675
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:25,030
counter like what the record industry

1676
01:17:23,079 --> 01:17:28,448
wanted them to do which was to sell

1677
01:17:25,029 --> 01:17:31,179
records they sold tickets because the

1678
01:17:28,448 --> 01:17:33,039
magic was created in front of human

1679
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:35,890
beings like Jerry Garcia used to say you

1680
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:37,238
can't manufacture intensity right you

1681
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:40,989
can't just go into the studio

1682
01:17:37,238 --> 01:17:44,439
turn on the knobs and automatically just

1683
01:17:40,988 --> 01:17:47,079
be intense right they did that in front

1684
01:17:44,439 --> 01:17:50,799
of an audience of people and it went

1685
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:53,649
back to the acid test days of where they

1686
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:58,360
made this connection with their audience

1687
01:17:53,649 --> 01:18:00,279
to really transport and again I would

1688
01:17:58,359 --> 01:18:02,769
when he said that I haven't really been

1689
01:18:00,279 --> 01:18:04,869
paying much attention to anything other

1690
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:07,660
than this analogy so I wanted to share

1691
01:18:04,869 --> 01:18:10,179
with you but I just you know I was so

1692
01:18:07,659 --> 01:18:13,329
lucky to grow up at the right time and

1693
01:18:10,179 --> 01:18:15,429
live in the right place to see the band

1694
01:18:13,329 --> 01:18:18,760
during the 70s and the 80s and it was

1695
01:18:15,429 --> 01:18:21,219
just such a magical transportation

1696
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:24,190
that's exactly what it was and cannabis

1697
01:18:21,219 --> 01:18:27,219
was a big undercurrent I'm dead to her

1698
01:18:24,189 --> 01:18:29,859
you know there's so many

1699
01:18:27,219 --> 01:18:32,969
so many stories like the chem dog story

1700
01:18:29,859 --> 01:18:35,948
from Deer Creek 91 and all that but um

1701
01:18:32,969 --> 01:18:38,109
yeah well you couldn't get good weed on

1702
01:18:35,948 --> 01:18:40,149
the East Coast it was brick weed it was

1703
01:18:38,109 --> 01:18:42,848
just just horrible stuff that was

1704
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:44,728
smuggled in gas tanks out to the East

1705
01:18:42,849 --> 01:18:48,219
Coast market it was easier to buy

1706
01:18:44,729 --> 01:18:50,739
cocaine and it was to buy weed in New

1707
01:18:48,219 --> 01:18:52,899
York the only place we found good weed

1708
01:18:50,738 --> 01:18:55,348
was on a Grateful Dead tour and it's

1709
01:18:52,899 --> 01:18:58,469
because all my heavy friends from NorCal

1710
01:18:55,349 --> 01:19:01,360
would would would be on the road

1711
01:18:58,469 --> 01:19:02,979
bringing their wheat and and everyone

1712
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:05,348
knew it like when the Grateful Dead

1713
01:19:02,979 --> 01:19:07,630
played at a venue you could have got

1714
01:19:05,349 --> 01:19:09,998
hassled at the Neil Young show or at the

1715
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:13,690
at the Zeppelin show yeah I'm old enough

1716
01:19:09,998 --> 01:19:15,158
to have seen Zeppelin so it's like you

1717
01:19:13,689 --> 01:19:17,228
know you could go to a Grateful Dead

1718
01:19:15,158 --> 01:19:19,058
show and automatically you're allowed to

1719
01:19:17,229 --> 01:19:21,249
smoke weed no one's getting busted for

1720
01:19:19,059 --> 01:19:23,288
smoking weed because it was just the

1721
01:19:21,248 --> 01:19:26,859
Grateful Dead it was just part of it and

1722
01:19:23,288 --> 01:19:30,849
it was always dank nor California weed I

1723
01:19:26,859 --> 01:19:32,679
had a good friend who I got weed from in

1724
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:35,769
the late eighties out our Grateful Dead

1725
01:19:32,679 --> 01:19:37,868
tour I hope he's still around Ron from

1726
01:19:35,769 --> 01:19:41,190
Shasta round the pizza man he had a

1727
01:19:37,868 --> 01:19:44,348
pizza oven in the back of an old

1728
01:19:41,189 --> 01:19:46,629
Econoline van and would make pizza out

1729
01:19:44,349 --> 01:19:48,460
on the Grateful Dead parking lot scene

1730
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:50,710
it was just such a cool place but yeah

1731
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:53,710
so my association again with this

1732
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:59,319
transportation thing was back to my days

1733
01:19:53,710 --> 01:20:01,328
as like spun-out kid on dead tour but it

1734
01:19:59,319 --> 01:20:03,880
was the smell of weed and it just like

1735
01:20:01,328 --> 01:20:07,149
like even like today I mean you could go

1736
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:09,639
to shows and you smell dank weed being

1737
01:20:07,149 --> 01:20:12,848
smoked and you knew that that was sort

1738
01:20:09,639 --> 01:20:15,368
of like the bridge and Jerry loved good

1739
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:17,979
weed right in fact I think that Garcia

1740
01:20:15,368 --> 01:20:20,319
state recently has partnered up with a

1741
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:21,909
production manufacturer they were bound

1742
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:24,908
to write so there'll be some Garcia

1743
01:20:21,908 --> 01:20:26,888
branded products out there I'm looking

1744
01:20:24,908 --> 01:20:29,529
at crashing quietly I know you guys know

1745
01:20:26,889 --> 01:20:32,170
Terry Kidwell not grass family too

1746
01:20:29,529 --> 01:20:34,689
because they really raised up you know a

1747
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:38,828
community out of out of out of the ashes

1748
01:20:34,689 --> 01:20:40,939
let's say - personalized Grateful Dead

1749
01:20:38,828 --> 01:20:42,979
snodgrass Bowl back in the day

1750
01:20:40,939 --> 01:20:45,259
it's somewhere in my collection that

1751
01:20:42,979 --> 01:20:47,319
smash so I gotta get it fixed again but

1752
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:50,900
yeah I mean it's so cool just that whole

1753
01:20:47,319 --> 01:20:52,880
thread that to me I mean I saw the dad

1754
01:20:50,899 --> 01:20:55,309
and an early age and I really didn't

1755
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:58,279
know what I was seeing when I was seeing

1756
01:20:55,310 --> 01:21:02,620
it but I'd go back to Debbie's analogy

1757
01:20:58,279 --> 01:21:05,869
of it being a transportation from the

1758
01:21:02,619 --> 01:21:08,750
Grateful Dead was open source there you

1759
01:21:05,869 --> 01:21:11,300
go like every single bit of it was open

1760
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:12,859
source and and and you know sort of to

1761
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,300
reflect on what you're talking about I

1762
01:21:12,859 --> 01:21:16,219
wouldn't have made it through University

1763
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:18,770
of Oregon without you know swinging bags

1764
01:21:16,219 --> 01:21:20,480
of weed at every single show and I'm so

1765
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:22,340
grateful for that you know at least I

1766
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:27,649
had the good stuff for sure coming from

1767
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:32,210
Oregon Garrett Ken Kesey's farm on 4th

1768
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:35,329
of July with Jerry in 1990 by the fire

1769
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:37,159
and he smoked his very first bud out of

1770
01:21:35,329 --> 01:21:40,340
a glass pipe and we had a conversation

1771
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:42,710
about it and we talked at that moment

1772
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:44,840
about the importance of cannabis and

1773
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:47,029
community and I feel like that would

1774
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:49,610
like really settled in me in it and it

1775
01:21:47,029 --> 01:21:50,960
made me know like yeah this is where I

1776
01:21:49,609 --> 01:21:56,869
need to be and it was the weed that I

1777
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:58,698
was swinging to so I think there's

1778
01:21:56,869 --> 01:22:00,619
there's Grateful Dead there's the

1779

Fair which started in the nineteen

1781
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:11,480
sixty-nine which was to create a new new

1782
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:14,090

1832

the time and we went the night before

1833
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:18,650
they played at the Hubert Humphrey Dome

1834
01:26:15,649 --> 01:26:21,920
in Minneapolis then the next night was a

1835
01:26:18,649 --> 01:26:26,629
Saturday night and the dead said no

1836
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:29,350
alpine valleys are on gig so Tom Petty

1837

and Bob Dylan played the night before

1838
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:36,350
the two dead shows in 86 and so did you

1839
01:26:33,649 --> 01:26:38,359
guys camp out for that the most of us

1840
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:40,220
were just at the park for luck no one

1841
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:43,099
bought tickets to go see Tom Petty or

1842
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:44,480
Bob Dylan I mean imagine that right yeah

1843
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:46,400
I didn't but that was

1844
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:49,579
Milwaukee didn't they play a gig in

1845
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:51,829
Milwaukee the night they played alpine

1846
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:54,439
valley the night before the dead played

1847
01:26:51,829 --> 01:26:56,899
and the dead refused to split up their

1848
01:26:54,439 --> 01:26:59,449
[ __ ] they're like now alpine valley is

1849
01:26:56,899 --> 01:27:02,119
our gig and it's funny because I had a

1850
01:26:59,449 --> 01:27:03,769
couple stops along that toward 86 was a

1851
01:27:02,119 --> 01:27:09,019
great year except Jerry getting sick

1852
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:11,920
right the Dead actually warmed up for

1853
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:14,480
Patty and Dylan so when we saw them in

1854
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:17,539
Minneapolis the dead went on first and

1855
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:19,279
played one long set which was very

1856
01:27:17,539 --> 01:27:21,529
unusual for the Grateful Dead didn't

1857
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:25,519
warm up for anybody right but you know

1858
01:27:21,529 --> 01:27:28,189
this is you know Tom Petty and Bob 10 so

1859
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:30,500
it was a big big production so a lot of

1860
01:27:28,189 --> 01:27:33,409
people actually after the dead got done

1861
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:36,020
playing in Minneapolis they just packed

1862
01:27:33,409 --> 01:27:38,930
off left didn't even stay for the Bob

1863
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:39,980
Dylan Tom Petty show we stayed for Bob

1864
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:41,989
Dylan Tom Petty

1865
01:27:39,979 --> 01:27:44,449
but then drove through the night and the

1866
01:27:41,988 --> 01:27:46,879
next night Bob Dylan and Tom Petty

1867
01:27:44,449 --> 01:27:49,069
played at Alpine by themselves one night

1868
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,590
and in the Dead played the next two

1869
01:27:49,069 --> 01:27:53,988
nights which was great those shows were

1870
01:27:51,590 --> 01:28:00,860
fantastic recordings of them are

1871
01:27:53,988 --> 01:28:02,629
wonderful you know you can't stop these

1872
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:06,109
markets in the parking lot of a Tom

1873
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:09,440
Petty and a Bob Dylan show we get busted

1874
01:28:06,109 --> 01:28:11,960
for smoking weed and you can't record at

1875
01:28:09,439 --> 01:28:14,839
the T I was a big thing too is that you

1876
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:17,630
know Bob Dylan does not allow recording

1877
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:20,150
and a Grateful Dead allow recording so

1878
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:22,909
it was a the taping section it was a big

1879
01:28:20,149 --> 01:28:25,909
thing at those shows there's very little

1880
01:28:22,909 --> 01:28:27,979
I guess recorded stuff of some of the

1881
01:28:25,909 --> 01:28:29,960
Dylan's stuff because he didn't want

1882
01:28:27,979 --> 01:28:31,488
people recording well as you know kind

1883
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:33,680
of going with the Grateful Dead business

1884
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:36,259
model we were discussing before they let

1885
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:39,050
people tape their shows and through

1886
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:41,270
those tapes they became the more most

1887
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:44,180
recorded band in all of human history

1888
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:47,960
there's more Grateful Dead recordings on

1889
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:50,060
this planet than any other band ever and

1890
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:51,680
there's no way anyone could even come

1891
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:54,350
close because if you think about it all

1892
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:56,390
the people who taped then there's second

1893
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:58,280
generation third generation there's so

1894
01:28:56,390 --> 01:29:00,619
many copies people

1895
01:28:58,279 --> 01:29:02,988
cassettes probably getting moldy in

1896
01:29:00,618 --> 01:29:05,118
their basements but the most recorded

1897
01:29:02,988 --> 01:29:07,968
band in all human history you know what

1898
01:29:05,118 --> 01:29:09,799
is really cool is all those tapes and

1899
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:12,980
everything that was done was done on an

1900
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:16,570
honor system no person was ever allowed

1901
01:29:12,979 --> 01:29:19,250
to sell 11 source like teller say

1902
01:29:16,569 --> 01:29:20,929
someone selling a bootleg and the

1903
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:23,389
[ __ ] parking lot they might as well

1904
01:29:20,929 --> 01:29:26,599
go move to [ __ ] somewhere no one care

1905
01:29:23,389 --> 01:29:27,980
like an artist and also about arts like

1906
01:29:26,599 --> 01:29:29,449
that one great thing about a Grateful

1907
01:29:27,979 --> 01:29:31,759
Dead parking lot is you could score the

1908
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:34,399
best weed the best mushrooms the best

1909
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:36,110
asset whatever good good thing that you

1910
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:38,058
wanted that was for family and if there

1911
01:29:36,109 --> 01:29:40,848
was ever a cop in the parking lot there

1912
01:29:38,059 --> 01:29:48,288

1913

1964
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,829
on the scene at the time and she had a

1965
01:32:34,909 --> 01:32:40,639
daughter he has a daughter named

1966
01:32:36,829 --> 01:32:43,640
sunshine with Ken Kesey I love the child

1967
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:46,550
in the early 60s when they went down to

1968
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:48,920
Mexico to just step out of the whole

1969
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:51,590
regime of the United States so they went

1970
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:58,130
down to live and and join a whole new

1971
01:32:51,590 --> 01:33:00,500
culture yes yes yes exactly and then got

1972
01:32:58,130 --> 01:33:03,380
together with Jerry afterwards and and

1973
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:07,130
have Annabel and Trixie amazing ladies

1974
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:09,020
who are in the community now Jenny had a

1975
01:33:07,130 --> 01:33:10,789
most amazing artist tricks he does

1976
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:13,910
amazing work all over the list another

1977
01:33:10,789 --> 01:33:17,689
friend of mine in California's father

1978
01:33:13,909 --> 01:33:19,189
was a judge the tenons cheesy for that

1979
01:33:17,689 --> 01:33:22,429
crime Wow

1980
01:33:19,189 --> 01:33:24,119
that's why he was on the run for right

1981
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:29,770
you know amazed

1982
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:31,359
was a stone cold you know honestly I

1983
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:34,540
think that we can almost just let

1984
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:36,969
Carolyn dry first out because we're

1985
01:33:34,539 --> 01:33:38,829
gonna be down in Oregon here really soon

1986
01:33:36,969 --> 01:33:40,869
and we'll just like the problem she was

1987
01:33:38,829 --> 01:33:42,369
having was with technical difficulties

1988
01:33:40,869 --> 01:33:46,569
and we can just help her out with that

1989
01:33:42,369 --> 01:33:48,939
and have her on without her her father

1990
01:33:46,569 --> 01:33:51,130
was a botanist she grew up you know

1991
01:33:48,939 --> 01:33:52,869
loving gardens and loving cannabis and

1992
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:54,699
she's always been a person who just

1993
01:33:52,869 --> 01:33:56,019
really soaks up information and that's

1994
01:33:54,698 --> 01:33:58,448
what we really love about her she's

1995
01:33:56,020 --> 01:34:00,820
incredibly intelligent and she did write

1996
01:33:58,448 --> 01:34:07,198
one of the first cannabis growing books

1997
01:34:00,819 --> 01:34:07,198
in 1900 or organic growing

1998
01:34:13,869 --> 01:34:15,930
you

1999
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:21,420
it frozen up here what

2000
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:26,939
or you know maybe we continue to talk

2001
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:29,310
about how we're recreating history we're

2002
01:34:26,939 --> 01:34:33,529
gonna be in Eugene actually in a couple

2003
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:36,600
weeks we could get Bob Snodgrass and

2004
01:34:33,529 --> 01:34:39,109
Carolyn Garcia in the same room and we

2005
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,110
could do a hash

2006
01:34:39,960 --> 01:35:04,529
I think that would be super cool where

2007
01:35:02,488 --> 01:35:07,709
were you living in 86 for that to have

2008
01:35:04,529 --> 01:35:09,960
been your first show I was a college kid

2009
01:35:07,710 --> 01:35:12,149

2010
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:26,369

2017
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:45,539
made and you know it was worth however

2018
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:49,350
many months I was grounded for it was

2019

01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:55,239
when I would see him at the table and

2092
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:57,100
like have a 20-minute conversation with

2093
01:38:55,239 --> 01:38:59,829
him or whatever we're all four of you

2094
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:01,000
there for the Camela they were not there

2095
01:38:59,829 --> 01:39:02,550
for the Maha kumbhamela

2096
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,969

official so you know really it wasn't

2101
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:21,178
until Jerry died that we decided wow we

2102
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:23,429
could probably move cuz we would have

2103
01:39:21,179 --> 01:39:26,609
never moved while the Grateful Dead or

2104
01:39:23,429 --> 01:39:28,380
Alive but Jerry died in 95 and we were

2144
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:26,738
you know to draft the dodge dodge the

2145
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:29,409
draft whatever that was called and

2146
01:41:26,738 --> 01:41:32,289
learned how to survive and grow weed and

2147
01:41:29,409 --> 01:41:33,969
and it's a potent group of people and we

2148
01:41:32,289 --> 01:41:36,698
always say now at the time that we came

2149
01:41:33,969 --> 01:41:39,039
in you know in the late 90s that we came

2150
01:41:36,698 --> 01:41:41,529
up as king anibus refugees because so

2151
01:41:39,039 --> 01:41:44,079
much you know there was guns happening

2152
01:41:41,529 --> 01:41:46,899
and so sore again and in northern Cali

2153
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:49,059
and you know we were a big time part of

2154
01:41:46,899 --> 01:41:51,698
the cannabis industry at that time and

2155
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:54,070
we had just had a you know a small child

2156
01:41:51,698 --> 01:41:56,259
and we thought you know we could go up

2157
01:41:54,069 --> 01:41:59,109
there we could do our craft we can we

2158
01:41:56,260 --> 01:42:01,840
can grow outdoors in nature and really

2159
01:41:59,109 --> 01:42:04,059
continue to make medicine without like

2160
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:06,940
you know all the heavy artillery and the

2161
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:09,760
heavy energy so to come up here to BC

2162
01:42:06,939 --> 01:42:12,879
and then become Canadian citizens you

2163
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:14,560
know as a cannabis refugee is you know

2164
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:17,409
it's an important part of our story

2165
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:19,719
because we really felt like following

2166
01:42:17,409 --> 01:42:21,430
the medicine and growing and cultivating

2167
01:42:19,719 --> 01:42:24,100
the message best medicine that we tried

2168
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:26,320
I feel you know those Grateful Dead

2169
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:27,910
years and those psychedelic years and

2170
01:42:26,319 --> 01:42:29,979
those herbalists years of gathering

2171
01:42:27,909 --> 01:42:31,719
mushrooms and being in the wood like it

2172
01:42:29,979 --> 01:42:36,039
was like it was Church you know it like

2173
01:42:31,719 --> 01:42:38,529
it set up a dedication that is like

2174
01:42:36,039 --> 01:42:40,000
gonna be set in our souls for the rest

2175
01:42:38,529 --> 01:42:41,948
of our life and it's been set in our

2176
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,359
lives before we feel like it's been set

2177
01:42:41,948 --> 01:42:46,238
in our eyes in the future and coming up

2178
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:48,880
here allowed us to really embody that

2179
01:42:46,238 --> 01:42:50,500
and that a percent man yeah well that

2180
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:52,300
whole psychedelic thing was important

2181
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:54,729
for me as well it was I went to the

2182
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:56,380
school of you know originally I was into

2183
01:42:54,729 --> 01:42:58,359
all these different sort of conspiracy

2184
01:42:56,380 --> 01:43:01,600
novels and I liked Robert Anton Wilson

2185
01:42:58,359 --> 01:43:03,670
and that sort of led me into Terence

2186
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:05,650
Mckenna and once I got the Terence

2187
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:07,480
Mckenna like esalaam Institute like

2188
01:43:05,649 --> 01:43:10,059
recordings with Rupert Sheldrake and

2189
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:14,500
Ralph Abraham from like the mid 80s to

2190
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:16,600
late 80s I I was very very very stoked

2191
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:18,939
on that at a young age and started you

2192
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:21,610
know Mike but you know high macro dosing

2193
01:43:18,939 --> 01:43:23,738
the five grams dried and ordering spores

2194
01:43:21,609 --> 01:43:28,000
from Terence and cat in Hawaii and

2195
01:43:23,738 --> 01:43:30,819
growing our own I guess it was

2196
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,949
sujini was this make note that that

2197
01:43:30,819 --> 01:43:35,139
Vancouver and British Columbia has an

2198
01:43:32,949 --> 01:43:38,050
equal importance as the stuff that's

2199
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:39,789
happened in Oregon and California and

2200
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:42,250
and it's almost like what can't happen

2201
01:43:39,789 --> 01:43:43,989
there happened here and what can't

2202
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:46,359
happen here happened there and somehow

2203
01:43:43,989 --> 01:43:48,789
they're both balancing each other out to

2204
01:43:46,359 --> 01:43:51,460
become the better situation so we've

2205
01:43:48,789 --> 01:43:52,869
really appreciated being able to you

2206
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:55,180
know we're basically a product of

2207
01:43:52,869 --> 01:43:58,720
British Columbia an Oregon at this point

2208
01:43:55,180 --> 01:44:01,350
and and it feels really good to be able

2209
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:03,940
to just embody what's right as a human

2210
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:06,160
yeah and the Canadians just always

2211
01:44:03,939 --> 01:44:07,929
pushing the envelope up here to make way

2212
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:09,399
and headway for what's been going on

2213
01:44:07,930 --> 01:44:12,700
down in the states and like Josh said

2214
01:44:09,399 --> 01:44:17,469
vice versa so Big Ups to the Canadians

2215
01:44:12,699 --> 01:44:19,869
there's a radical human radical human

2216
01:44:17,470 --> 01:44:22,530
beings on the earth we love you yeah and

2217
01:44:19,869 --> 01:44:24,849
and I also you know got an awesome

2218
01:44:22,529 --> 01:44:27,569
chance to be able to meet Terence

2219
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:30,010
Mckenna to when I was in Kealakekua Bay

2220
01:44:27,569 --> 01:44:32,979
you know five o'clock in the morning

2221
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:34,810
five days in a row and and it sort of

2222
01:44:32,979 --> 01:44:36,819
took me on the second day like wait this

2223
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:39,850
is Terence Mckenna I recognize his voice

2224
01:44:36,819 --> 01:44:41,170
you know from late-night radio when

2225
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:43,120
there were before there was an Internet

2226
01:44:41,170 --> 01:44:46,690
you know we used to listen to the super

2227
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:49,809
late night radio and he got to download

2228
01:44:46,689 --> 01:44:52,419
you know hours and hours of what he was

2229
01:44:49,810 --> 01:44:54,760
up to at that time and it really sent me

2230
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:57,609
on a whole new journey to be able to

2231
01:44:54,760 --> 01:45:00,760
convene with with his energy and and

2232
01:44:57,609 --> 01:45:03,819
where I really wanted to go in the world

2233
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:06,280
so again I know we're all big up in

2234
01:45:03,819 --> 01:45:08,619
Terence but I'm gonna do it again he's

2235
01:45:06,279 --> 01:45:10,989
amazing and you know when we started

2236
01:45:08,619 --> 01:45:12,760
going commercially here in 99 outdoors

2237
01:45:10,989 --> 01:45:15,489
and started seeing the outdoor british

2238
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:17,230
columbian genetics and growing the white

2239
01:45:15,489 --> 01:45:18,670
grizzly from the Kootenays really

2240
01:45:17,229 --> 01:45:20,559
allowed us to see a lot of different

2241
01:45:18,670 --> 01:45:23,199
genetics and we recognize now that we

2242
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,560
had auto flower genetics happening in

2243
01:45:23,199 --> 01:45:25,989
there

2244
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:27,970
we had haze genetics happening in there

2245
01:45:25,989 --> 01:45:29,590
an amazing Hoschton etics that nepali

2246
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:31,090
strain that people talk about Marcus I

2247
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:34,590
know you remember that one you know that

2248
01:45:31,090 --> 01:45:37,750
Nepali or Nepalese called it it was a

2249
01:45:34,590 --> 01:45:39,940
hot stream one of my favorites from the

2250
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:45,020
Kootenays from back in like

2251
01:45:39,939 --> 01:45:48,379
91-92 era was called the a1 magenta if

2252
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:51,920
you ever see Dustin or Paul ask them

2253
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:55,600
about the a1 magenta I'll tell you I was

2254
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:58,159
a special special special plant and

2255
01:45:55,600 --> 01:46:00,260
forever at British Columbia was locked

2256
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:02,720
into one strain and I know that it's

2257
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:04,760
it's beyond that now and you hear about

2258
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:06,440
it in Brazil like all that was that was

2259
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:08,390
back in the day when it was all tie in

2260
01:46:06,439 --> 01:46:10,549
Skunk it's changed now and I'm like well

2261
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:13,450
here in British Columbia you know it may

2262
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:18,590
have used to all be rocks

2263
01:46:13,449 --> 01:46:22,489
um I was insoluble I do a lot of making

2264
01:46:18,590 --> 01:46:23,960
big swish to - just exploring strains

2265
01:46:22,489 --> 01:46:26,359
and I like to see that here in British

2266
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:28,220
Columbia I think it's a tide that can't

2267
01:46:26,359 --> 01:46:32,029
be changed knowing that the world has

2268
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:34,730
awoken to cannabis as as a chemo bar or

2269
01:46:32,029 --> 01:46:36,380
as a phenotype and I'm really excited

2270
01:46:34,729 --> 01:46:38,059
that we can move beyond that and all of

2271
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:40,159
our hard work that we've put in as

2272
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:41,960
cannabis community before and now can

2273
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:44,439
really relate to everybody in Canada

2274
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:47,270
that can grow their Ford plants outside

2275
01:46:44,439 --> 01:46:48,769
that are gonna finish outdoors no matter

2276
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:50,870
where you are in Canada you're gonna

2277
01:46:48,770 --> 01:46:53,240
have beautiful finishing outdoor

2278
01:46:50,869 --> 01:46:55,159
genetics that when you experience this

2279
01:46:53,239 --> 01:46:58,099
medicine you're gonna have a really good

2280
01:46:55,159 --> 01:47:00,500
experience and we're huge advocates for

2281
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:02,390
everybody growing therefore so you know

2282
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:05,119
Big Ups to all of the cannabis community

2283
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:07,369
in Canada that's been greeting you know

2284
01:47:05,119 --> 01:47:10,220
since the 80s you know we were even

2285
01:47:07,369 --> 01:47:12,170
standing on the backs of giants that you

2286
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:13,820
know we got the genetics from the elders

2287
01:47:12,170 --> 01:47:16,489
you know at that time we're in their

2288
01:47:13,819 --> 01:47:18,409
late 70s and then we took that breeding

2289
01:47:16,489 --> 01:47:21,439
and then bred for another you know 20

2290
01:47:18,409 --> 01:47:23,479
years that we can now pass on to regular

2291
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:26,689
people that are growing there for plants

2292
01:47:23,479 --> 01:47:29,299
and that's just an incredible stride I

2293
01:47:26,689 --> 01:47:32,479
like to challenge people to grow for

2294
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:34,250
food plants and maybe even more so with

2295
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:37,279
your four plants take that opportunity

2296
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:39,199
to grow food along with it and let's

2297
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:40,909
take on the whole idea of Victory

2298
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:42,979
Gardens or the whole idea of us all

2299
01:47:40,909 --> 01:47:44,989
having a little bit the food grown so

2300
01:47:42,979 --> 01:47:47,359
that we can love and live in an abundant

2301
01:47:44,989 --> 01:47:49,340
culture and an abundant society rather

2302
01:47:47,359 --> 01:47:51,739
than the scarcity one and we want to see

2303
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:53,060
your big ganja colas but we also want to

2304
01:47:51,739 --> 01:47:54,920
see your big massive

2305
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:59,840
Keeney to our your holy babies little

2306
01:47:54,920 --> 01:48:02,390
growing underneath part of the

2307
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:05,840
regulation that you guys is brought up

2308
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:08,090
is being able to cultivate at home like

2309
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:10,699
it's it's a right for everyone and

2310
01:48:08,090 --> 01:48:13,310
everyone should be able to be in touch

2311
01:48:10,699 --> 01:48:16,449
with their medicine and understand how

2312
01:48:13,310 --> 01:48:19,130
the plant works and then see it like

2313
01:48:16,449 --> 01:48:22,010
like straw a seed for the first time

2314
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:24,079
plant like make a bunch of mistakes like

2315
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:26,480
water too much like this is the most

2316
01:48:24,079 --> 01:48:29,779
important step toward like yourself

2317
01:48:26,479 --> 01:48:31,489
making a medicine and this is beautiful

2318
01:48:29,779 --> 01:48:33,340
and one of the things that we have to

2319
01:48:31,489 --> 01:48:38,210
fight still watch in Brazil

2320
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:40,789
unfortunately here we have 60 people

2321
01:48:38,210 --> 01:48:45,409
growing weed legally over zoo not even

2322
01:48:40,789 --> 01:48:48,979
50 something they they they had to apply

2323
01:48:45,409 --> 01:48:51,199
they had to go individually in the

2324
01:48:48,979 --> 01:48:53,839
justice to fight for themselves you know

2325
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:56,059
say I have a condition and I'm planting

2326
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:59,180
meat already and this is good for myself

2327
01:48:56,060 --> 01:49:01,789
and then they get good you know but it's

2328
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:03,560
just not a thing here and how beautiful

2329
01:49:01,789 --> 01:49:06,380
would be if everyone could grow their

2330
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:09,350
own fought for or their own sakes like

2331
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:11,300
in California outdoors like every like

2332
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:14,030
people could see it you wouldn't have

2333
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:17,239
this amount of like indoor grows with a

2334
01:49:14,029 --> 01:49:18,829
bunch of like crazy electrical like I

2335
01:49:17,239 --> 01:49:24,429
don't even know how to say that in

2336
01:49:18,829 --> 01:49:27,890
English like when you make a fire hazard

2337
01:49:24,430 --> 01:49:30,079
very poorly made electrical light grows

2338
01:49:27,890 --> 01:49:32,750
that are dangerous for a house that can

2339
01:49:30,079 --> 01:49:36,939
put up a house on fire sometimes because

2340
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:36,939
that's one so it would be beautiful

2341
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:46,550
storage you should be able to get eight

2342
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:49,730
kilos cleaned and dried you see it like

2343
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:54,050
to say you could have four root stocks

2344
01:49:49,729 --> 01:49:56,179
and graft other strains on to us so you

2345
01:49:54,050 --> 01:49:58,460
could potentially let's say have four

2346
01:49:56,180 --> 01:50:01,789
different strains ax on one root stock

2347
01:49:58,460 --> 01:50:04,649
and still no you can enter 25 I've got

2348
01:50:01,789 --> 01:50:07,050
25 very very girl

2349
01:50:04,649 --> 01:50:09,510
of course you have Sam of course you

2350
01:50:07,050 --> 01:50:22,349
have we have the thirty once food I

2351
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:27,059
don't want to talk about it Wow for

2352
01:50:22,349 --> 01:50:30,360
plants in Italy I do want to hear a

2353
01:50:27,059 --> 01:50:32,939
little bit more about the 25 different

2354
01:50:30,359 --> 01:50:35,038
cultivars that you grafted onto a plant

2355
01:50:32,939 --> 01:50:38,070
though Sam what's that all about well

2356
01:50:35,038 --> 01:50:41,728
first what we did was we destroyed

2357
01:50:38,069 --> 01:50:45,509
grafting and that was successful so let

2358
01:50:41,729 --> 01:50:48,628
me put - and the next year we did 10 and

2359
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:52,498
the next year I most I ever put on one

2360
01:50:48,628 --> 01:50:54,238
root stock was 25 but one thing you have

2361
01:50:52,498 --> 01:50:57,418
to do is you have to make sure your root

2362
01:50:54,238 --> 01:51:00,628
stock is later maturing than the grass

2363
01:50:57,418 --> 01:51:05,448
that you're putting on it otherwise the

2364
01:51:00,628 --> 01:51:05,448
whole plant dies before the final

2365
01:51:05,958 --> 01:51:12,738
timeline wise but this have been after

2366
01:51:08,779 --> 01:51:17,929
the publishing of marijuana botany oh

2367
01:51:12,738 --> 01:51:20,308
yeah because I didn't move to Holland

2368
01:51:17,929 --> 01:51:23,038
yeah well I wasn't sure if you did some

2369
01:51:20,309 --> 01:51:26,820
of this in Cali or whatnot so no no I

2370
01:51:23,038 --> 01:51:30,448
didn't even count I wasn't a big

2371
01:51:26,819 --> 01:51:32,668
believer and I I thought that if you

2372
01:51:30,448 --> 01:51:35,248
made a copy of a copy of a copy it's

2373
01:51:32,668 --> 01:51:37,158
referencing Xerox effect which I found

2374
01:51:35,248 --> 01:51:41,179
that not to be true

2375
01:51:37,158 --> 01:51:46,799
crafting skunk one through skunk 25 yeah

2376
01:51:41,179 --> 01:51:50,849
what was your gross I was reading both

2377
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:53,639
male and female branches onto a late

2378
01:51:50,849 --> 01:51:56,489
maturing brood stock a lot of times I

2379
01:51:53,639 --> 01:51:59,909
try to use Hayes's as the root stock

2380
01:51:56,488 --> 01:52:03,928
because they're later maturing than any

2381
01:51:59,908 --> 01:52:06,328
of the grass that I put on them I just

2382
01:52:03,929 --> 01:52:09,359
wanted the grass to finish before the

2383
01:52:06,328 --> 01:52:13,368
root stock died that's that's super

2384
01:52:09,359 --> 01:52:13,368
smart we were having a really amazing

2385
01:52:14,439 --> 01:52:20,928
and asleep to death I don't know if

2386
01:52:18,859 --> 01:52:22,819
everybody's here you break up but I

2387
01:52:20,929 --> 01:52:26,929
heard it was breaking up for me too

2388
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:30,469
well he was good was when people had a

2389
01:52:26,929 --> 01:52:34,609
plan like here in the Netherlands you

2390
01:52:30,469 --> 01:52:37,399
can grow five plants in your balcony or

2391
01:52:34,609 --> 01:52:40,448
something okay well if you've got five

2392
01:52:37,399 --> 01:52:45,289
plants and each one of them's got 2025

2393
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:47,809
different genetic branches on them then

2394
01:52:45,289 --> 01:52:50,380
you actually keep in a library of a

2395
01:52:47,810 --> 01:52:50,380
hundred plus

2396
01:52:51,828 --> 01:52:53,889
you

2397
01:52:56,270 --> 01:53:03,420
well that's pretty interesting sorry I

2398
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:05,969
was just typing to someone in the wellhe

2399
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:07,618
but it was yon from New York you might

2400
01:53:05,969 --> 01:53:10,618
have even met him before but he said

2401
01:53:07,618 --> 01:53:13,259
he's glad Sam clarified the copying the

2402
01:53:10,618 --> 01:53:15,689
cloning does not decrease post it

2403
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:18,179
doesn't but if your plant is plagued

2404
01:53:15,689 --> 01:53:20,009
with virus fungi and microbials and it's

2405
01:53:18,179 --> 01:53:22,380
been impregnated with thousands of these

2406
01:53:20,010 --> 01:53:23,940
it can appear to be that way and I think

2407
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:32,569
that's where that whole like oh it's

2408
01:53:23,939 --> 01:53:35,339
genetic load or a bacterial load then

2409
01:53:32,569 --> 01:53:39,118
there yield of bigger could be greatly

2410
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:42,000
greatly reduced absolutely true hey

2411
01:53:39,118 --> 01:53:45,630
Marcus class the girls from uh from

2412
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:48,630
Brazil just a quick question and exactly

2413
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:50,699
so what is the regulation in Brazil you

2414
01:53:48,630 --> 01:53:54,359
know Brazil is a very large country with

2415
01:53:50,698 --> 01:53:57,539
large cities and a large economy and

2416
01:53:54,359 --> 01:54:00,509
large Natural Resources and certainly

2417
01:53:57,539 --> 01:54:04,319
the presence of industrial agriculture

2418
01:54:00,510 --> 01:54:07,139
is all over the place down there so what

2419
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:09,750
where is the law in Brazil like can you

2420
01:54:07,139 --> 01:54:12,800
possess or can you have or do you go to

2421
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:15,389
jail or is it municipality dependent and

2422
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:19,429
like what advice would you give tourists

2423
01:54:15,389 --> 01:54:23,940
who want to go down there and get high

2424
01:54:19,429 --> 01:54:26,789
Therese wanting to get high it is very

2425
01:54:23,939 --> 01:54:29,460
tough to find like good quality cannabis

2426
01:54:26,789 --> 01:54:32,760
or cash in Brazil we need to be very

2427
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:34,770
close to like a specific niche Instagram

2428
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:44,369
helps like if you're a tourist and your

2429
01:54:34,770 --> 01:54:50,699
stone helps the legislation it's not a

2430
01:54:44,368 --> 01:54:54,210
criminal offence to have under 20 grams

2431
01:54:50,698 --> 01:54:57,328
to precise in the 20 grams if you're

2432
01:54:54,210 --> 01:55:01,439
white like it's a truth everything has

2433
01:54:57,328 --> 01:55:04,710
to do with how the police officer that

2434
01:55:01,439 --> 01:55:08,529
gets you interprets the situation so our

2435
01:55:04,710 --> 01:55:12,520
drug policy unfortunately opened up the

2436
01:55:08,529 --> 01:55:14,380
room for a bunch of light racism in fact

2437
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:16,690
like for the interpretation of the

2438
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:18,489
police officer to be whatever is gonna

2439
01:55:16,689 --> 01:55:20,529
come out for that situation if he

2440
01:55:18,489 --> 01:55:23,319
interpret eights as like drug

2441
01:55:20,529 --> 01:55:25,239
trafficking or if he does not or if it's

2442
01:55:23,319 --> 01:55:26,590
just like drug use or just sign up and

2443
01:55:25,239 --> 01:55:27,699
then you have to like present yourself

2444
01:55:26,590 --> 01:55:30,310
in the court and then you have your

2445
01:55:27,699 --> 01:55:33,880
first offense but they insert first but

2446
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:39,039
it all depends my color depends on your

2447
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:43,180
caller and also unlike everything it's

2448
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:45,760
like its bias so if the police officer

2449
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:48,640
or if the judge so there are judges now

2450
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:51,220
who are ruling in favor of people who

2451
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:53,280
presents cases as we talked to fifty

2452
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:57,010
people who can legally

2453
01:55:53,279 --> 01:56:00,250
grow cannabis in Brazil medically who

2454
01:55:57,010 --> 01:56:02,920
have presented cases so it is changing

2455
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:05,560
like the federal law is that it's not a

2456
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:09,220
criminal offense under twenty grams to

2457
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:12,610
process you cannot grow but as Alice

2458
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:17,860
says but it depends on the

2459
01:56:12,609 --> 01:56:21,519
interpretation tourists Brazil it's it

2460
01:56:17,859 --> 01:56:24,189
has a lot of prejudice so if like if

2461
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:27,390
you're a tourist with money and you can

2462
01:56:24,189 --> 01:56:30,609
buy off the police officer you probably

2463
01:56:27,390 --> 01:56:33,910
might not have a problem but that is

2464
01:56:30,609 --> 01:56:36,489
hard for you as a tourist for you they

2465
01:56:33,909 --> 01:56:37,899
don't get accomplished yet to get for

2466
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:41,619
you to get caught up on the street you

2467
01:56:37,899 --> 01:56:43,509
know like they won't choose you since a

2468
01:56:41,619 --> 01:56:47,289
bunch of it is a racial thing like the

2469
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:49,960
drug our drug policy is like a tool to

2470
01:56:47,289 --> 01:56:51,189
criminalize specific people and I mean I

2471
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:52,750
know I know it's not new and I mean

2472
01:56:51,189 --> 01:56:54,339
something that came from America to in

2473
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:56,289
America like in United States it was

2474
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:58,539
like that but definitely in Brazil

2475
01:56:56,289 --> 01:57:01,569
that's still ongoing I feel like we are

2476
01:56:58,539 --> 01:57:05,050
still signatories off the war on drugs

2477
01:57:01,569 --> 01:57:09,549
and the like we're like ears that you

2478
01:57:05,050 --> 01:57:12,159
know do you think like a regulated

2479
01:57:09,550 --> 01:57:15,489
industry kind of like in some ways like

2480
01:57:12,159 --> 01:57:17,380
the way medical starts first with you

2481
01:57:15,489 --> 01:57:20,170
know addressing you know patients again

2482
01:57:17,380 --> 01:57:22,180
who whose lives are basically these

2483
01:57:20,170 --> 01:57:23,949
people are alive because of care

2484
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:26,079
was that there'll be programs like that

2485
01:57:23,949 --> 01:57:29,349
or do you think that there's still just

2486
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:32,140
such a a bias against it just a stigma

2487
01:57:29,350 --> 01:57:34,510
that it's it's drugs and all drugs are

2488
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:37,119
bad it is happening right now

2489
01:57:34,510 --> 01:57:38,920
like we see they're like legalizing

2490
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:41,409
medicinal cannabis like with many like

2491
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:44,590
this there is a bunch of like big

2492
01:57:41,409 --> 01:57:45,760
corporations that are like now not only

2493
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:47,560
big corporations were like

2494
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:49,480
pharmaceutical industries they're very

2495
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:51,910
interested in producing cannabinoids for

2496
01:57:49,479 --> 01:57:54,399
this specific kind of like medication so

2497
01:57:51,909 --> 01:57:56,680
there is a it is gonna be a big like

2498
01:57:54,399 --> 01:57:59,049
suit egg business because in presume

2499
01:57:56,680 --> 01:58:01,659
that it is a huge thing and once they

2500
01:57:59,050 --> 01:58:05,079
realize especially with hemp like what's

2501
01:58:01,659 --> 01:58:07,180
being naked with hemp in Brazil DM and

2502
01:58:05,079 --> 01:58:09,550
we need you guys here like we do guys

2503
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:11,320
here for you guys to teach people how to

2504
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:13,449
make it sustainably because in Brazil

2505
01:58:11,319 --> 01:58:16,479
they people don't grow sustainably they

2506
01:58:13,449 --> 01:58:19,000
grow like big yeah but I think the the

2507
01:58:16,479 --> 01:58:20,709
first step will still be medicinal

2508
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:24,310
because that's what's happening that's

2509
01:58:20,710 --> 01:58:26,710
what has happened with the health agency

2510
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:29,620
and that's what's happening right now in

2511
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:34,989
our Chamber of Deputies so like I just

2512
01:58:29,619 --> 01:58:39,119
interviewed two of our deputies some

2513
01:58:34,989 --> 01:58:42,069
Brazilian who are studying the quiet

2514
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:45,189
kind of regulation and they are going to

2515
01:58:42,069 --> 01:58:47,380
Canada in February to study that too and

2516
01:58:45,189 --> 01:58:49,239
we are talking here about some

2517
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:51,730
additional cannabis and growing in

2518
01:58:49,239 --> 01:58:54,069
Brazil and they are thinking about

2519
01:58:51,729 --> 01:58:57,729
research throwing importation

2520
01:58:54,069 --> 01:59:01,090
exportation but everything attached to

2521
01:58:57,729 --> 01:59:05,169
some kind of medical treatment so we are

2522
01:59:01,090 --> 01:59:07,750
hemp might come along I it hasn't

2523
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:10,029
happened right yet the movement for

2524
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:13,210
industry let him because I think the

2525
01:59:10,029 --> 01:59:16,059
lobby of other industries is art are

2526
01:59:13,210 --> 01:59:19,449
very very big here but for medicinal

2527
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:21,360
cannabis I think that like the next two

2528
01:59:19,449 --> 01:59:24,699
years you're gonna see a big movement

2529
01:59:21,359 --> 01:59:26,319
but Eve did did it happen in Brazil the

2530
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:28,059
same way like I picture it happening

2531
01:59:26,319 --> 01:59:30,250
this way which is you know the way

2532
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:31,780
cannabis works it's it's slow but sure

2533
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:33,939
it's gonna change the way people think

2534
01:59:31,779 --> 01:59:36,039
and generally the way I saw it happened

2535
01:59:33,939 --> 01:59:36,429
down in the US was they fought it and

2536
01:59:36,039 --> 01:59:37,779
fought

2537
01:59:36,430 --> 01:59:39,369
and fought it and fought it and then

2538
01:59:37,779 --> 01:59:40,809
they kind of like oh no they're finding

2539
01:59:39,369 --> 01:59:41,859
out about the endocannabinoid system

2540
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:45,070
they're putting all these things

2541
01:59:41,859 --> 01:59:46,750
together and then it was like epileptic

2542
01:59:45,069 --> 01:59:49,329
children and it was kind of like the

2543
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:51,670
last leg on the table of like

2544
01:59:49,329 --> 01:59:53,619
prohibition being able to keep this from

2545
01:59:51,670 --> 01:59:56,199
happening like how did it happen in

2546
01:59:53,619 --> 01:59:58,359
Brazil was it sick children that is

2547
01:59:56,199 --> 02:00:01,179
what's happening like all of this like

2548
01:59:58,359 --> 02:00:03,549
individual approvals that is are called

2549
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:05,590
abuse Court rules that this people have

2550
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:07,869
to grow weed like legally in their

2551
02:00:05,590 --> 02:00:10,300
places are like sick most of them see

2552
02:00:07,869 --> 02:00:12,579
children or like moms that have like

2553
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:16,779
proven that they were giving already

2554
02:00:12,579 --> 02:00:19,029
like illegal like our assault for their

2555
02:00:16,779 --> 02:00:22,059
kids and still they were improving a lot

2556
02:00:19,029 --> 02:00:25,449
and not taking like them and epilepsy

2557
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:27,400
medicine do you see that's the displacer

2558
02:00:25,449 --> 02:00:29,529
that's that's the one where they're all

2559
02:00:27,399 --> 02:00:30,939
sitting down going okay boys like we're

2560
02:00:29,529 --> 02:00:32,979
gonna have to figure this out this isn't

2561
02:00:30,939 --> 02:00:35,739
going away I'm certainly not going on

2562
02:00:32,979 --> 02:00:38,349
the news and telling everyone that that

2563
02:00:35,739 --> 02:00:40,750
kid can't have it's it's it's cannabis

2564
02:00:38,350 --> 02:00:42,789
and so that's how it starts and then

2565
02:00:40,750 --> 02:00:44,439
they think they're gonna control it but

2566
02:00:42,789 --> 02:00:49,000
anyone that's ever grown cannabis knows

2567
02:00:44,439 --> 02:00:55,509
if you give weed an inch it'll take the

2568
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:57,630
whole yard what you said and like the

2569
02:00:55,510 --> 02:01:00,610
beautiful thing is we do have

2570
02:00:57,630 --> 02:01:03,970
associations that either they are

2571
02:01:00,609 --> 02:01:07,239
growing or they are importing oil or

2572
02:01:03,970 --> 02:01:09,850
they are arranging to make it come to

2573
02:01:07,239 --> 02:01:13,840
Brazil and they're giving this children

2574
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:16,810
and they are doing better or as well as

2575
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:19,539
children who do have the money to import

2576
02:01:16,810 --> 02:01:21,700
the because that's another form there

2577
02:01:19,539 --> 02:01:23,859
are people who are growing and there are

2578
02:01:21,699 --> 02:01:27,279
people also like there are 7,000

2579
02:01:23,859 --> 02:01:28,989
licenses for importation but the thing

2580
02:01:27,279 --> 02:01:31,779
is the treatment just for you guys to

2581
02:01:28,989 --> 02:01:34,389
understand how extremely unreachable

2582
02:01:31,779 --> 02:01:37,269
it caught monthly treatment treatment

2583
02:01:34,390 --> 02:01:40,780
for children cause like two thousand and

2584
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:42,010
eight hundred he writes that is like no

2585
02:01:40,779 --> 02:01:44,739
just for them to understand like the

2586
02:01:42,010 --> 02:01:46,840
minimum wage most in Brazil it's like

2587
02:01:44,739 --> 02:01:49,029
the thousand so it's like almost three

2588
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:49,869
times that minimum wage so just so you

2589
02:01:49,029 --> 02:01:51,819
guys can understand

2590
02:01:49,869 --> 02:01:56,039
it's just like very rich families that

2591
02:01:51,819 --> 02:02:01,299
can explore that so we are we are like

2592
02:01:56,039 --> 02:02:03,519
stars like baby steps to take a long

2593
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:05,320
while but we do have this increase of

2594
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:07,260
the cannabis community here for sure I

2595
02:02:05,319 --> 02:02:10,509
feel like it's a worldwide movement

2596
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:11,680
people are traveling to like many South

2597
02:02:10,510 --> 02:02:14,500
America

2598
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:17,470
they're experiencing excellent like so

2599
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:19,300
oh do I as spannabis they're going to

2600
02:02:17,470 --> 02:02:21,070
the Emerald people are traveling and

2601
02:02:19,300 --> 02:02:23,619
understanding how the chemical cannabis

2602
02:02:21,069 --> 02:02:25,659
community somehow can also rise and that

2603
02:02:23,619 --> 02:02:28,510
pew tees are also starting to see the

2604
02:02:25,659 --> 02:02:31,119
money that they can get for sure that's

2605
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:36,119
also something that this year for sure

2606
02:02:31,119 --> 02:02:38,529
happens so like we have been to medical

2607
02:02:36,119 --> 02:02:40,779
conferences and things like this and I

2608
02:02:38,529 --> 02:02:44,739
have also been to meetings for like

2609
02:02:40,779 --> 02:02:48,250
China business the visionary markets and

2610
02:02:44,739 --> 02:02:49,149
a bunch of like whites men's red

2611
02:02:48,250 --> 02:02:52,270
politicals

2612
02:02:49,149 --> 02:02:54,670
starting to discuss the so studies who

2613
02:02:52,270 --> 02:02:57,880
prefer see how many billions of dollars

2614
02:02:54,670 --> 02:03:00,670
they can profit in the next three years

2615
02:02:57,880 --> 02:03:00,970
if the regulation does like this or like

2616
02:03:00,670 --> 02:03:03,340
that

2617
02:03:00,970 --> 02:03:05,289
they haven't even legalized or regulated

2618
02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:07,869
and the Green Rush somehow has started

2619
02:03:05,289 --> 02:03:10,659
that somehow when it has been there

2620
02:03:07,869 --> 02:03:12,699
already counting their their money yeah

2621
02:03:10,659 --> 02:03:14,710
yeah you know they're counting the money

2622
02:03:12,699 --> 02:03:16,750
would not even happy the regulation but

2623
02:03:14,710 --> 02:03:21,069
you know once again just like Sam said

2624
02:03:16,750 --> 02:03:24,010
see cannabis is going to change the way

2625
02:03:21,069 --> 02:03:25,869
they think and they're not going to be

2626
02:03:24,010 --> 02:03:27,820
able to fight it and when you have them

2627
02:03:25,869 --> 02:03:29,409
like well we're not gonna smoke it we're

2628
02:03:27,819 --> 02:03:32,500
not we'll just be into the money it's

2629
02:03:29,409 --> 02:03:36,550
like Oh still getting yeah still getting

2630
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:38,380
yeah just wait it's really important

2631
02:03:36,550 --> 02:03:41,050
that you know hand in hand we're having

2632
02:03:38,380 --> 02:03:44,350
the conversations that cannabis is good

2633
02:03:41,050 --> 02:03:47,920
for you but what is good cannabis it's

2634
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:50,140
it's as imperative as you know the

2635
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:51,730
medicine itself we need to be talking

2636
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:53,980
about what is good cannabis and then

2637
02:03:51,729 --> 02:03:55,929
that starts to have conversations on

2638
02:03:53,979 --> 02:03:58,029
what is good medicine and then that

2639
02:03:55,930 --> 02:04:00,130
helps us question Big Pharma and then we

2640
02:03:58,029 --> 02:04:01,869
start wondering what is good cultivation

2641
02:04:00,130 --> 02:04:02,970
and then that has us questioning Big

2642
02:04:01,869 --> 02:04:04,890
Pharma and

2643
02:04:02,970 --> 02:04:06,449
we're wondering what is good community

2644
02:04:04,890 --> 02:04:09,150
and then that has a start questioning

2645
02:04:06,449 --> 02:04:11,389
the communities that are you know only

2646
02:04:09,149 --> 02:04:13,739
are fracture due to you know

2647
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:16,800
misalignment and cannabis helps us align

2648
02:04:13,739 --> 02:04:19,829
so I think that these conversations need

2649
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:21,570
to be you know being pushed forward as

2650
02:04:19,829 --> 02:04:23,460
much as the medical has been the one

2651
02:04:21,569 --> 02:04:26,099
that comes through the door and then

2652
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:27,600
these huge Corp poly corporate chicks so

2653
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:29,789
I don't want to say corporations Pauline

2654
02:04:27,600 --> 02:04:31,860
the corporate day and then take that

2655
02:04:29,789 --> 02:04:34,140
lead of the medical cannabis and then

2656
02:04:31,859 --> 02:04:35,969
make medically legal like like that

2657
02:04:34,140 --> 02:04:38,840
continues to happen it seems to be the

2658
02:04:35,970 --> 02:05:06,600
pattern so it's important that we keep

2659
02:04:38,840 --> 02:05:42,630
this is whether or not it's kind of

2660
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:44,160
weird so we have to it would be I'm

2661
02:05:42,630 --> 02:05:47,220
curious how do we prevent medical

2662
02:05:44,159 --> 02:05:51,539
marijuana falling by the way I would say

2663
02:05:47,220 --> 02:05:53,310
that John Conroy here in Vancouver BC is

2664
02:05:51,539 --> 02:05:56,640
dealing with Canadian law but John

2665
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:59,640
Conroy has put up incredible discussions

2666
02:05:56,640 --> 02:06:02,010
and court cases to support compassionate

2667
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:04,320
care so really we just need to continue

2668
02:06:02,010 --> 02:06:07,380
saying the word compassionate care as a

2669
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:08,639
group because in malaysia you would

2670
02:06:07,380 --> 02:06:10,500
never think that it would ever be

2671
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:12,950
legalized because it's the death penalty

2672
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:15,479
but over the last year in malaysia a

2673
02:06:12,949 --> 02:06:17,119
person brought it to the supreme court

2674
02:06:15,479 --> 02:06:19,559
to be able to

2675
02:06:17,119 --> 02:06:23,519
medical marijuana because he got in

2676
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:26,280
trouble for providing and this oil to

2677
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:28,890
terminally ill patients so just like you

2678
02:06:26,279 --> 02:06:31,139
said here's a country where it's a death

2679
02:06:28,890 --> 02:06:33,840
penalty and this person is giving you a

2680
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:35,310
passionate - I'm truly ill patients and

2681
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:36,900
now they have to recognize it now

2682
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:41,730
they're gonna go through their whole own

2683
02:06:36,899 --> 02:06:46,529
process creating laws around it rather

2684
02:06:41,729 --> 02:06:48,239
than get help from the US forces do

2685
02:06:46,529 --> 02:06:50,670
their own thing but it's opening the

2686
02:06:48,239 --> 02:06:52,949
plate the doors for Thailand and so

2687
02:06:50,670 --> 02:06:55,319
Thailand has trained their medical

2688
02:06:52,949 --> 02:06:57,239
marijuana and we have been good friends

2689
02:06:55,319 --> 02:07:00,569
in Thailand who are working on region

2690
02:06:57,239 --> 02:07:02,789
they're heard of projects who would

2691
02:07:00,569 --> 02:07:04,649
would be interested in coming on hash

2692
02:07:02,789 --> 02:07:06,359
shirts if we want to hear their story I

2693
02:07:04,649 --> 02:07:09,109
would love to hear someone's yeah for

2694
02:07:06,359 --> 02:07:11,819
sure they worked over there dude that

2695
02:07:09,109 --> 02:07:14,939
that shows how strong cannabis can

2696
02:07:11,819 --> 02:07:16,739
change your mind when Malaysia considers

2697
02:07:14,939 --> 02:07:18,960
that [ __ ] if anyone's ever flown into

2698
02:07:16,739 --> 02:07:20,670
Malaysia and seen the big like death

2699
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:22,590
sentence like we're gonna kill you if we

2700
02:07:20,670 --> 02:07:24,779
find drugs on you signs like zero

2701
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:26,640
tolerance for sure we're really gonna do

2702
02:07:24,779 --> 02:07:29,670
it we're serious like you better not

2703
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:30,900
have it - well maybe we'll allow a

2704
02:07:29,670 --> 02:07:35,060
medical system

2705
02:07:30,899 --> 02:07:37,379
it's like Island and Lao are both really

2706
02:07:35,060 --> 02:07:39,480
pushing the envelope for Southeast Asia

2707
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:42,239
but it's a really interesting collide

2708
02:07:39,479 --> 02:07:45,239
here we are again like Indonesia it has

2709
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:47,819
death penalty it really follows under a

2710
02:07:45,239 --> 02:07:49,079
very strict Muslim regime for that whole

2711
02:07:47,819 --> 02:07:52,139
entire country

2712
02:07:49,079 --> 02:07:55,829
but I've gone into the akshay region

2713
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:57,690
instead of a mantra in Sumatra and and

2714
02:07:55,829 --> 02:08:00,239
that's where like a lot of the

2715
02:07:57,689 --> 02:08:03,599
Indonesian flower comes from for all all

2716
02:08:00,239 --> 02:08:05,639
of those regions and areas and we set up

2717
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:08,100
a clinic a free clinic right after the

2718
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:10,590
tsunami and we were having we weren't

2719
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:12,480
just working with women and children a

2720
02:08:10,590 --> 02:08:14,550
time because we were the first boots on

2721
02:08:12,479 --> 02:08:17,819
the ground and that was ten years ago

2722
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:19,739
yes so we were dealing with you know use

2723
02:08:17,819 --> 02:08:21,840
of all kind people who hadn't seen any

2724
02:08:19,739 --> 02:08:24,149
medical terrace and tsunami had come at

2725
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:26,699
all and I was really surprised to see

2726
02:08:24,149 --> 02:08:30,009
every single one of the men were wearing

2727
02:08:26,699 --> 02:08:32,079
two new pocket shirts

2728
02:08:30,010 --> 02:08:33,789
and I would ask you know well how much

2729
02:08:32,079 --> 02:08:36,010
do you smoke and maybe they would come

2730
02:08:33,789 --> 02:08:37,449
in with emphysema problems or some kind

2731
02:08:36,010 --> 02:08:39,280
of lung issue and I would say how much

2732
02:08:37,449 --> 02:08:41,859
do you smoke and they would say well I

2733
02:08:39,279 --> 02:08:43,630
smoke four of these a day and four of

2734
02:08:41,859 --> 02:08:45,759
these a day one of them was their

2735
02:08:43,630 --> 02:08:47,980
tobacco pocket and the other one was

2736
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:50,860
their cannabis pocket and that's totally

2737
02:08:47,979 --> 02:08:52,659
normalized as soon as you like they

2738
02:08:50,859 --> 02:08:56,920
don't know about government rules or

2739
02:08:52,659 --> 02:08:59,050
government no it doesn't mean it were a

2740
02:08:56,920 --> 02:09:01,270
mess region they're an autonomous region

2741
02:08:59,050 --> 02:09:03,610
and and like their culture has always

2742
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:06,250
kept cannabis as the part of their

2743
02:09:03,609 --> 02:09:08,589
medicine and they use the language like

2744
02:09:06,250 --> 02:09:11,079
this is for my fun which would be the

2745
02:09:08,590 --> 02:09:13,060
tobacco and I use this as my medicine to

2746
02:09:11,079 --> 02:09:14,710
get through my day and they were keeping

2747
02:09:13,060 --> 02:09:16,330
that culture from their great-great

2748
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:18,250
grandparents and they were telling me

2749
02:09:16,329 --> 02:09:19,809
that those varietals that they were

2750
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:22,479
growing were from their great great

2751
02:09:19,810 --> 02:09:27,070
grand and that might be some you know on

2752
02:09:22,479 --> 02:09:29,049
an unadulterated or non contaminated

2753
02:09:27,069 --> 02:09:30,670
land races in northern Sumatra still

2754
02:09:29,050 --> 02:09:32,199
because of the drug war so that's a

2755
02:09:30,670 --> 02:09:34,239
potentially good spot for unique

2756
02:09:32,199 --> 02:09:38,529
cultivars and connect what do you know

2757
02:09:34,238 --> 02:09:41,679
about Akshay flower I know that a DJ

2758
02:09:38,529 --> 02:09:43,689
will say I spelled Aceh Arabic Chinese

2759
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:45,220
European and Hindustani and that's

2760
02:09:43,689 --> 02:09:47,949
really interesting what's the name of

2761
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:50,710
that but lake with the island in the

2762
02:09:47,949 --> 02:09:53,229
middle of it over the Oba how about that

2763
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:57,130
so but yeah that's some of the first

2764
02:09:53,229 --> 02:10:00,488
cannabis that I saw in Indonesia but I

2765
02:09:57,130 --> 02:10:05,500
knew people who are taking Thai seeds in

2766
02:10:00,488 --> 02:10:08,709
the early 70s to Lake Toba

2767
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:10,689
a growing in lake toba Westerners and I

2768
02:10:08,710 --> 02:10:14,710
know people who are doing it in Bali

2769
02:10:10,689 --> 02:10:18,369
also so to depend on those being of pure

2770
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:21,550
variety good luck Chuck I mean jet

2771
02:10:18,369 --> 02:10:25,238
travel has made it so that all genetics

2772
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:28,210
are everywhere agreed and Haven say and

2773
02:10:25,238 --> 02:10:31,299
the historical accounts of the weed

2774
02:10:28,210 --> 02:10:33,520
coming to the a.j originally came from

2775
02:10:31,300 --> 02:10:35,409
India so you know you know whatever that

2776
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:39,710
was you know they say 300 years locust

2777
02:10:35,409 --> 02:10:42,260
seeds and I saw were were bigger than

2778
02:10:39,710 --> 02:10:46,760
most horrible indian seats they looked

2779
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:49,400
more like a yunnan or really big Thai

2780
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:51,829
seat but ones that I was dealing with in

2781
02:10:49,399 --> 02:10:54,199
Sumatra you know because you had to sift

2782
02:10:51,829 --> 02:10:58,309
through so many seeds were teeny teeny

2783
02:10:54,199 --> 02:11:01,729
tiny pure black seeds I'm really tall

2784
02:10:58,310 --> 02:11:04,489
like long blooming sort of you know thin

2785
02:11:01,729 --> 02:11:34,939
leaf structured plants does it all that

2786
02:11:04,488 --> 02:11:55,959
I saw when I was in Sumatra you know for

2787
02:11:34,939 --> 02:11:58,729
example the research that a lot of

2788
02:11:55,960 --> 02:12:00,380
reaching out to the u.s. to actually get

2789
02:11:58,729 --> 02:12:02,359
the research to bring back over there

2790
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:04,250
but the issues that the US has you know

2791
02:12:02,359 --> 02:12:06,259
at the stall on research for so long

2792
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:08,329
that it's like is that the French and

2793
02:12:06,260 --> 02:12:10,219
all the Rio should be approaching and

2794
02:12:08,329 --> 02:12:12,319
coming to the US even gather our data to

2795
02:12:10,219 --> 02:12:14,149
go bring back to theirs or is it you

2796
02:12:12,319 --> 02:12:15,979
know because recently as well in the US

2797
02:12:14,149 --> 02:12:18,079
and less focus on with this and look

2798
02:12:15,979 --> 02:12:19,879
it's not recreational and first thing I

2799
02:12:18,079 --> 02:12:21,380
feel like that's an issue because you

2800
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:23,300
know there's so much great that the plan

2801
02:12:21,380 --> 02:12:24,650
brings but we don't know the opposite

2802
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:27,230
side effects and you know what's going

2803
02:12:24,649 --> 02:12:28,879
on so you know is it a proper channel

2804
02:12:27,229 --> 02:12:31,159
we're gonna be checking this into Korea

2805
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:33,109
itself and is there a way for Korea to

2806
02:12:31,159 --> 02:12:35,300
start benefiting from Malaysia or time

2807
02:12:33,109 --> 02:12:38,509
man's research and kind of focus as like

2808
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:44,739
an Asian kind of collaborative work or

2809
02:12:38,510 --> 02:12:48,020
is it us and why not this is really

2810
02:12:44,738 --> 02:12:51,079
that's a great point - one thing about

2811
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:53,860
Korea is that they have had a

2812
02:12:51,079 --> 02:12:57,199
traditional hemp industry

2813
02:12:53,859 --> 02:12:58,909
since for hundreds of years and they

2814
02:12:57,199 --> 02:13:01,760
still do today

2815
02:12:58,909 --> 02:13:05,119
they grow industrial hemp in Korea and

2816
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:09,949
produced him textiles but particularly

2817
02:13:05,119 --> 02:13:13,970
for funeral costumes and stuff that they

2818
02:13:09,949 --> 02:13:30,500
wear yeah cuz we collected a bunch of

2819
02:13:13,970 --> 02:13:54,170
them thanks for introducing Danny and

2820
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:55,880
welcome Barbara oh that's amazing

2821
02:13:54,170 --> 02:13:57,710
Barbara you're a very important

2822
02:13:55,880 --> 02:14:00,980
component in this because a lot of

2823
02:13:57,710 --> 02:14:03,109
people who are at a certain age are kind

2824
02:14:00,979 --> 02:14:05,629
of just like scared of cannabis they've

2825
02:14:03,109 --> 02:14:07,460
heard all of the propaganda they don't

2826
02:14:05,630 --> 02:14:09,980
really want to be bothering with it and

2827
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:12,319
it's really good and empowering for them

2828
02:14:09,979 --> 02:14:14,569
to have someone like yourself who can

2829
02:14:12,319 --> 02:14:16,460
walk the walk and share the education

2830
02:14:14,569 --> 02:14:27,349
and have have an incredible daughter

2831
02:14:16,460 --> 02:14:30,829
like that so I get a text from my

2832
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:33,020
daughter who's like 16 on your YouTube

2833
02:14:30,829 --> 02:14:38,479
channel and I found the video of grandma

2834
02:14:33,020 --> 02:14:45,200
vaporizing what is going on so literally

2835
02:14:38,479 --> 02:14:56,469
when I think I do like seniors who have

2836
02:14:45,199 --> 02:14:56,470
been stigmatized when I do actually

2837
02:15:04,328 --> 02:15:41,868
apparently your daughter we're having

2838
02:15:36,319 --> 02:15:44,479
Barbara back on in fact I want

2839
02:15:41,868 --> 02:15:51,018
everyone's mom to come on hash that's

2840
02:15:44,479 --> 02:15:53,149
that is happening for sure my mother as

2841
02:15:51,019 --> 02:15:55,760
well it was she works for the Winnipeg

2842
02:15:53,149 --> 02:15:59,029
police for 35 years and absolutely could

2843
02:15:55,760 --> 02:16:01,400
not even consider using cannabis without

2844
02:15:59,029 --> 02:16:03,408
you know losing her job and now she's

2845
02:16:01,399 --> 02:16:06,439
I'm actually going to see her in a

2846
02:16:03,408 --> 02:16:08,748
couple of days she's turning 70 and just

2847
02:16:06,439 --> 02:16:10,939
for the last maybe couple of years she's

2848
02:16:08,748 --> 02:16:13,939
been using cannabis just to help her

2849
02:16:10,939 --> 02:16:17,118
sleep go to bed you know she takes she

2850
02:16:13,939 --> 02:16:18,589
buys these sublingual oils from from one

2851
02:16:17,118 --> 02:16:20,149
of the Canadian LPS I think it's

2852
02:16:18,590 --> 02:16:23,150
whistler medical right now which i know

2853
02:16:20,149 --> 02:16:25,939
they're using organic material i know

2854
02:16:23,149 --> 02:16:27,319
they're making water hash with that

2855
02:16:25,939 --> 02:16:30,169
material and then they're taking that

2856
02:16:27,319 --> 02:16:33,260
material in making a high terpene

2857
02:16:30,170 --> 02:16:34,398
content sublingual oil and my mum you

2858
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:35,898
know she's not using it through the

2859
02:16:34,398 --> 02:16:38,629
throughout the day she's still kind of a

2860
02:16:35,898 --> 02:16:41,058
little bit afraid to I use cannabis but

2861
02:16:38,629 --> 02:16:42,920
it makes me happy that she's less afraid

2862
02:16:41,058 --> 02:16:44,568
because you know we can laugh about it

2863
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:46,398
and that stigma and whatnot but it's

2864
02:16:44,568 --> 02:16:47,929
really it's like it's it's

2865
02:16:46,398 --> 02:16:50,179
life-threatening and I can tell you a

2866
02:16:47,929 --> 02:16:52,568
story about my uncle my mother's brother

2867
02:16:50,179 --> 02:16:55,219
who just recently passed away of cancer

2868
02:16:52,568 --> 02:17:00,739
he had asked me if I could send him some

2869
02:16:55,218 --> 02:17:02,869
oil - for him to use to try and battle

2870
02:17:00,739 --> 02:17:05,568
this cancer and I got 60 grams of this

2871
02:17:02,870 --> 02:17:09,380
really nice oil and I I sent it out to

2872
02:17:05,568 --> 02:17:11,478
him and he got afraid he thought that if

2873
02:17:09,379 --> 02:17:12,039
he took it he would lose his mind and

2874
02:17:11,478 --> 02:17:14,319
that he might

2875
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:16,090
you know lose his dignity and he didn't

2876
02:17:14,319 --> 02:17:18,670
want to die like that and so he got

2877
02:17:16,090 --> 02:17:20,409
afraid and he sent it back and in the

2878
02:17:18,670 --> 02:17:21,819
end with the medicines that he had and

2879
02:17:20,409 --> 02:17:23,860
the way the cancer took him it really

2880
02:17:21,819 --> 02:17:26,289
took him the same way that he was

2881
02:17:23,860 --> 02:17:27,730
worried that it would take him I sent

2882
02:17:26,290 --> 02:17:30,429
the oil to a friend of Mines

2883
02:17:27,729 --> 02:17:32,920
mother-in-law who had had some breast

2884
02:17:30,429 --> 02:17:36,159
cancer and she was in her 70s already

2885
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:38,770
and I just saw her post her it was her

2886
02:17:36,159 --> 02:17:40,510
74th birthday yesterday and she had she

2887
02:17:38,770 --> 02:17:42,489
was with her grandchildren she she took

2888
02:17:40,510 --> 02:17:45,159
the oil and got rid of the cancer and

2889
02:17:42,489 --> 02:17:49,629
the stigma kept my uncle from taking the

2890
02:17:45,159 --> 02:17:51,819
oil and he perished so keep doing the

2891
02:17:49,629 --> 02:17:53,558
good work get rid of that stigma and let

2892
02:17:51,819 --> 02:17:57,279
people know that this is something that

2893
02:17:53,558 --> 02:17:58,840
they should not give a crap about what

2894
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:30,780
anyone else thinks they should do their

2895
02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:35,558
own research and look into it where

2896
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:37,179
where you get pharmacy the community

2897
02:18:35,558 --> 02:18:44,799
center you try it with your community

2898
02:18:37,179 --> 02:18:48,219
for the free

2899
02:18:44,799 --> 02:18:51,119
I think at the end of life conversation

2900
02:18:48,218 --> 02:18:53,468
and cannabis use is absolutely

2901
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:57,160
imperative and that brings you know

2902
02:18:53,468 --> 02:18:59,968
cannabis back to medicine on my mother's

2903
02:18:57,159 --> 02:19:03,010
deathbed I was there I midwifed her

2904
02:18:59,968 --> 02:19:04,598
through her death and it was because

2905
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:07,630
cannabis she was having a very difficult

2906
02:19:04,599 --> 02:19:09,370
time she said she was going through you

2907
02:19:07,629 --> 02:19:11,829
know all of the thoughts of her life and

2908
02:19:09,370 --> 02:19:14,500
it was bringing her tremendous pain and

2909
02:19:11,829 --> 02:19:16,030
I said hey let's try out the volcano so

2910
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:19,000
my son got on the bed

2911
02:19:16,030 --> 02:19:21,480
you know just fully immersed her in in

2912
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:24,308
vapors from the old school volcano

2913
02:19:21,479 --> 02:19:25,449
everything changed her whole everything

2914
02:19:24,308 --> 02:19:27,909
changed

2915
02:19:25,450 --> 02:19:30,010
from reviewing her whole life and maybe

2916
02:19:27,909 --> 02:19:32,559
some of the bad times in her life to

2917
02:19:30,010 --> 02:19:35,380
everything that was positive in her life

2918
02:19:32,559 --> 02:19:37,389
and not only was she afraid to die but

2919
02:19:35,379 --> 02:19:41,199
after the cannabis she was actually

2920
02:19:37,389 --> 02:19:43,090
excited to make the crossover and you

2921
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:45,700
know this is somebody who you know was

2922
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:47,739
incredibly conservative and it wasn't

2923
02:19:45,700 --> 02:19:49,061
until maybe the last eight years of her

2924
02:19:47,739 --> 02:19:52,000
life that I started to introduce

2925
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:53,560
cannabis to her and she was taking more

2926
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:55,629
cannabis than I could ever take in a

2927
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:57,310
whole week in one night like she we were

2928
02:19:55,629 --> 02:19:59,739
calling her the cannabis Queen at the

2929
02:19:57,310 --> 02:20:01,931
end like girlfriend was like fully

2930
02:19:59,739 --> 02:20:04,659
immersed with it and in her last eight

2931
02:20:01,931 --> 02:20:08,260
years of life she changed she became a

2932
02:20:04,659 --> 02:20:09,969
completely different person and because

2933
02:20:08,260 --> 02:20:13,931
of what happened on the bed in her last

2934
02:20:09,969 --> 02:20:16,719
you know moments of life the last thing

2935
02:20:13,931 --> 02:20:18,880
that she said to me and it was important

2936
02:20:16,719 --> 02:20:21,100
it sounds like folly but it was so

2937
02:20:18,879 --> 02:20:24,459
important to her she drew me close and

2938
02:20:21,101 --> 02:20:28,110
she said Kelly in my next life I'm gonna

2939
02:20:24,459 --> 02:20:32,140
smoke a lot of weed and that was like

2940
02:20:28,110 --> 02:20:34,960
telling me I've come from here and now

2941
02:20:32,140 --> 02:20:37,149
I'm going to there and it was a really

2942
02:20:34,959 --> 02:20:39,279
it was it was something incredibly

2943
02:20:37,149 --> 02:20:41,709
powerful in it and it makes me know that

2944
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:43,630
I'm on the right path in my life to

2945
02:20:41,709 --> 02:20:45,850
continue to share these stories and

2946
02:20:43,629 --> 02:20:47,979
share good flowers and also share

2947
02:20:45,851 --> 02:20:50,590
healthy flowers not only you know

2948
02:20:47,979 --> 02:20:53,109
medicine that's good but medicine that's

2949
02:20:50,590 --> 02:20:54,760
good for you and even on her death you

2950
02:20:53,110 --> 02:20:57,431
know getting close to her death she was

2951
02:20:54,760 --> 02:21:01,149
like I recognize I'm gonna die now and

2952
02:20:57,431 --> 02:21:03,940
now it's just how do you die how do you

2953
02:21:01,149 --> 02:21:05,529
say oh my gosh you know I'm ready and

2954
02:21:03,940 --> 02:21:07,060
and I know this is happening and it's

2955
02:21:05,530 --> 02:21:10,239
inevitable how do you do it and I think

2956
02:21:07,060 --> 02:21:11,319
the cannabis just kind of soothed her to

2957
02:21:10,239 --> 02:21:13,390
the point where she didn't have to

2958
02:21:11,319 --> 02:21:16,289
figure it out and then it's just it

2959
02:21:13,390 --> 02:21:16,289
happens like this

2960
02:21:16,300 --> 02:21:21,859
and it was just like that it was the

2961
02:21:19,069 --> 02:21:24,560
most beautiful you know passing that

2962
02:21:21,860 --> 02:21:28,190
anyone could could ever have and I think

2963
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:31,699
that it it's just like here we are again

2964
02:21:28,190 --> 02:21:35,721
cannabis even creating a catalyst for

2965
02:21:31,700 --> 02:21:37,250
the living to understand true dying and

2966
02:21:35,720 --> 02:21:39,979
and what it can be and what that

2967
02:21:37,250 --> 02:21:42,409
crossover is like the most valuable

2968
02:21:39,979 --> 02:21:45,709
points of our life I bring cannabis into

2969
02:21:42,409 --> 02:21:49,280
Berks I've used cannabis multiple times

2970
02:21:45,709 --> 02:21:51,949
I feel like it's part of my pregnancy

2971
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:53,630
tea CBD that I give women women that are

2972
02:21:51,950 --> 02:21:56,271
having a really hard time you know

2973
02:21:53,629 --> 02:21:59,390
making that transition maybe they've

2974
02:21:56,271 --> 02:22:01,011
been sex used so many women today that I

2975
02:21:59,390 --> 02:22:03,229
deal with you know they're saying like

2976
02:22:01,011 --> 02:22:05,840
you know one in four have not been

2977
02:22:03,229 --> 02:22:08,060
sexually abused now in our culture so

2978
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:10,460
you go through that abuse when you have

2979
02:22:08,060 --> 02:22:12,890
to have a child and cannabis creates

2980
02:22:10,459 --> 02:22:15,169
this beautiful Avenue to be able to deal

2981
02:22:12,890 --> 02:22:17,750
with that for women to deal with their

2982
02:22:15,170 --> 02:22:19,909
their peers and it is it's true

2983
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:23,090
compassion and it allows you to realize

2984
02:22:19,909 --> 02:22:26,989
oh I can go ahead and make this / with

2985
02:22:23,090 --> 02:22:29,420
ease on my own terms and and I feel like

2986
02:22:26,989 --> 02:22:31,879
that's like you know life and death it's

2987
02:22:29,420 --> 02:22:36,409
hidden from us and and cannabis gives us

2988
02:22:31,879 --> 02:22:39,439
really good language to be able to help

2989
02:22:36,409 --> 02:22:42,709
us as a culture unveil these these

2990
02:22:39,440 --> 02:22:47,090
mysteries it's beautiful when you say

2991
02:22:42,709 --> 02:22:48,829
that women know so family what has been

2992
02:22:47,090 --> 02:22:50,511
happening with my family here in Brazil

2993
02:22:48,829 --> 02:22:52,761
it is very crazy just so you guys

2994
02:22:50,511 --> 02:22:54,829
understand when I'm in Brazil I live

2995
02:22:52,761 --> 02:22:58,640
with my mom and my grandma it's just

2996
02:22:54,829 --> 02:23:00,739
women it's very powerful my grandma's

2997
02:22:58,640 --> 02:23:03,261
name is Maria which is like marijuana

2998
02:23:00,739 --> 02:23:06,110
somehow to my mom's name is coochie

2999
02:23:03,261 --> 02:23:08,829
Maria and my name is Alisa Maria like we

3000
02:23:06,110 --> 02:23:11,780
all have the money under our knees and

3001
02:23:08,829 --> 02:23:13,370
it's crazy because starting as an

3002
02:23:11,780 --> 02:23:15,620
activist I feel like you have to be an

3003
02:23:13,370 --> 02:23:18,400
activist in our places to like it starts

3004
02:23:15,620 --> 02:23:20,840
from the inside to the outside so I

3005
02:23:18,399 --> 02:23:22,579
broke through the stigma with my mom and

3006
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:25,190
my grandma about cannabis in the past

3007
02:23:22,579 --> 02:23:29,539
like I don't know six to eight years you

3008
02:23:25,190 --> 02:23:32,210
know my mom dad sometimes she

3009
02:23:29,540 --> 02:23:34,160
like [ __ ] dad the cookies-and-cream like

3010
02:23:32,209 --> 02:23:38,029
Marcus the other day and she loved it

3011
02:23:34,159 --> 02:23:41,360
she's like oh I love this and my grandma

3012
02:23:38,030 --> 02:23:44,480
has been actually taking like take like

3013
02:23:41,360 --> 02:23:47,480
the oil and I figured out that actually

3014
02:23:44,479 --> 02:23:49,459
only the CBD does not work for her

3015
02:23:47,479 --> 02:23:51,979
because she has a bit of depression so

3016
02:23:49,459 --> 02:23:55,069
it has to that like the tea she helped

3017
02:23:51,979 --> 02:23:56,630
her out a lot and like one year ago was

3018
02:23:55,069 --> 02:23:59,091
the first time that I started like

3019
02:23:56,630 --> 02:24:01,609
giving this to her and I saw in her eyes

3020
02:23:59,091 --> 02:24:03,829
like and in her movements and in her

3021
02:24:01,610 --> 02:24:05,721
appetite and her happiness like how much

3022
02:24:03,829 --> 02:24:08,360
changed her in many ways she became less

3023
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:11,449
grumpy my grandma is Grampy goobie as

3024
02:24:08,360 --> 02:24:14,181
[ __ ] Mario knows it sometimes and I feel

3025
02:24:11,450 --> 02:24:15,829
like a changer a lot unfortunately here

3026
02:24:14,181 --> 02:24:18,051
in Brazil since we can't buy it and it's

3027
02:24:15,829 --> 02:24:20,209
not an easy access this year she stayed

3028
02:24:18,050 --> 02:24:21,890
a few months without it now I have a

3029
02:24:20,209 --> 02:24:24,169
whole set up for her like I brought

3030
02:24:21,890 --> 02:24:26,511
Kendon I brought from California a bunch

3031
02:24:24,170 --> 02:24:29,630
for my grandma and my mom but everyone's

3032
02:24:26,511 --> 02:24:31,819
being medicated like it wasn't fair it

3033
02:24:29,630 --> 02:24:33,859
was very beautiful to see how like all

3034
02:24:31,819 --> 02:24:37,039
this women like breaking the stigma like

3035
02:24:33,860 --> 02:24:39,381
true family so it is beautiful and you

3036
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:40,790
know what it's absolutely beautiful and

3037
02:24:39,380 --> 02:24:43,489
sort of interrupt but it's what it

3038
02:24:40,790 --> 02:24:45,290
really is is it's the answer I'm giving

3039
02:24:43,489 --> 02:24:47,630
everyone from now on when they tell me

3040
02:24:45,290 --> 02:24:50,480
how should I get started in the cannabis

3041
02:24:47,630 --> 02:24:53,750
industry I'm telling them from now on

3042
02:24:50,479 --> 02:24:55,459
learn everything you can go deep dive

3043
02:24:53,750 --> 02:24:58,220
have a personal intimate relationship

3044
02:24:55,459 --> 02:24:59,959
with it and then turn your parents on

3045
02:24:58,220 --> 02:25:01,430
and your grandparents once you've turned

3046
02:24:59,959 --> 02:25:03,169
your parents and your grandparents on

3047
02:25:01,431 --> 02:25:04,971
you are now ready for the cannabis

3048
02:25:03,170 --> 02:25:06,979
industry because when you go out and you

3049
02:25:04,970 --> 02:25:09,529
tell people how you got into it and

3050
02:25:06,979 --> 02:25:11,270
that's your story you're going to be

3051
02:25:09,530 --> 02:25:13,250
listened to because the people who have

3052
02:25:11,271 --> 02:25:15,950
those stories to me are the most valid

3053
02:25:13,250 --> 02:25:18,380
stories I really appreciate them so I

3054
02:25:15,950 --> 02:25:21,079
appreciate you guys turning on your your

3055
02:25:18,380 --> 02:25:23,689
grandma and your mom and that's pretty

3056
02:25:21,079 --> 02:25:27,620
hardcore stepping it up to my mom dabs

3057
02:25:23,690 --> 02:25:29,000
sometimes holy Moses Marcus when you say

3058
02:25:27,620 --> 02:25:30,710
get people started in the cannabis

3059
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:32,329
industry what do you what do you mean by

3060
02:25:30,709 --> 02:25:34,459
that cuz that's something I question

3061
02:25:32,329 --> 02:25:36,319
what does that mean well I don't even go

3062
02:25:34,459 --> 02:25:38,060
into what it means because it means

3063
02:25:36,319 --> 02:25:39,591
something different to everyone but what

3064
02:25:38,060 --> 02:25:41,841
it means to me is

3065
02:25:39,591 --> 02:25:43,521
they want to come to the cannabis party

3066
02:25:41,841 --> 02:25:45,140
they just want to come to the cannabis

3067
02:25:43,521 --> 02:25:48,381
party some of them are looking at it

3068
02:25:45,140 --> 02:25:51,199
like I'm trapped in this job that keeps

3069
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:53,421
me from doing anything I am a slave and

3070
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:55,190
they see people living this cannabis

3071
02:25:53,421 --> 02:25:57,110
life and they're like is there a place

3072
02:25:55,190 --> 02:25:58,819
for me is there a way that I can do this

3073
02:25:57,110 --> 02:26:01,069
and do what you guys are doing is there

3074
02:25:58,819 --> 02:26:03,921
a way for this to somehow eventually

3075
02:26:01,069 --> 02:26:06,140
allow me I think it's more attached the

3076
02:26:03,921 --> 02:26:08,001
people that I listen to anyway that I

3077
02:26:06,140 --> 02:26:11,511
when I read the emails and I get a lot

3078
02:26:08,001 --> 02:26:14,390
of emails I can feel this passion in in

3079
02:26:11,511 --> 02:26:16,131
it like a spark in their in their email

3080
02:26:14,390 --> 02:26:18,529
or sometimes they'll send her an actual

3081
02:26:16,130 --> 02:26:21,529
letter and so I don't know exactly what

3082
02:26:18,530 --> 02:26:23,301
it means but to me I'm I'm telling

3083
02:26:21,530 --> 02:26:25,700
people from now on how you should get

3084
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:27,859
started with cannabis is by having your

3085
02:26:25,700 --> 02:27:14,751
own relationship with it as much as you

3086
02:26:27,860 --> 02:27:21,471
can and then your that's where we

3087
02:27:14,751 --> 02:27:33,710
started still trying to do it you're a

3088
02:27:21,470 --> 02:27:35,720
Magnolia well that's so trip because I

3089
02:27:33,710 --> 02:27:37,760
told the story earlier I'm not sure if

3090
02:27:35,720 --> 02:27:40,130
you heard it but yeah we you I met you

3091
02:27:37,761 --> 02:27:43,521
like 20 plus years ago or whatever and

3092
02:27:40,130 --> 02:27:47,029
it was on I'm still on the same streak

3093
02:27:43,521 --> 02:27:48,430
Debbie and I'm I'm two houses over from

3094
02:27:47,030 --> 02:27:51,500
the house

3095
02:27:48,430 --> 02:27:57,050
well it's beautiful there who were you

3096
02:27:51,500 --> 02:28:00,228
with you came with me do you remember I

3097
02:27:57,049 --> 02:28:02,239
remember I came up there a couple

3098
02:28:00,228 --> 02:28:04,519
different times yeah you were with a

3099
02:28:02,239 --> 02:28:07,340
woman I can't remember what her name was

3100
02:28:04,520 --> 02:28:11,390
sure huh keep her talk no she wasn't

3101
02:28:07,340 --> 02:28:16,030
that super tall sama very smart maybe

3102
02:28:11,389 --> 02:28:16,029
maybe it was sama uc-berkeley

3103
02:28:17,500 --> 02:28:24,228
yeah that sounds more familiar well that

3104
02:28:21,978 --> 02:28:27,438
kind of leads me into a introducing

3105
02:28:24,228 --> 02:28:28,789
Brian who has spoken a few times but I

3106
02:28:27,439 --> 02:28:31,399
haven't even introduced him and he's

3107
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:34,100
actually from a company called Dean ale

3108
02:28:31,399 --> 02:28:38,149
and I've been working close with him as

3109
02:28:34,100 --> 02:28:39,409
well as a TA and I kind of switched to

3110
02:28:38,149 --> 02:28:41,329
this now it might be a little bit of a

3111
02:28:39,409 --> 02:28:42,950
different topic but when Debbie said

3112
02:28:41,329 --> 02:28:45,200
science and Berkeley and you know

3113
02:28:42,950 --> 02:28:46,909
thinkers and super-smart I was like oh

3114
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:48,380
well let's bring in Brian and talk about

3115
02:28:46,909 --> 02:28:51,978
it because what Brian's kind of been

3116
02:28:48,379 --> 02:28:55,670
super smart Brian well you've been

3117
02:28:51,978 --> 02:28:58,129
focusing and nerding out on the surfaces

3118
02:28:55,670 --> 02:29:00,590
that we take our dabs off of and the

3119
02:28:58,129 --> 02:29:02,420
types of you know composite these

3120
02:29:00,590 --> 02:29:04,040
different silicon carbides and these

3121
02:29:02,420 --> 02:29:05,270
different courses with the different

3122
02:29:04,040 --> 02:29:07,370
spinning balls and you've just been

3123
02:29:05,270 --> 02:29:09,680
going into it and kind of opening that

3124
02:29:07,370 --> 02:29:12,020
discussion a little deeper than most and

3125
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:13,220
I know hash searches is gonna end here

3126
02:29:12,020 --> 02:29:15,800
in a little bit I thought we could just

3127
02:29:13,219 --> 02:29:17,840
end it with a conversation of you know

3128
02:29:15,799 --> 02:29:19,909
how it's different you know what do you

3129
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:22,909
do in these days with with the different

3130
02:29:19,909 --> 02:29:24,049
dab surface areas and the different you

3131
02:29:22,909 --> 02:29:26,719
know I noticed you're doing all these

3132
02:29:24,049 --> 02:29:29,899
different methodologies of getting the

3133
02:29:26,719 --> 02:29:31,938
resin to spin around the port so what do

3134
02:29:29,899 --> 02:29:34,219
you want to talk about new stuff I'm do

3135
02:29:31,939 --> 02:29:38,210
you want to do a quick intro there this

3136
02:29:34,219 --> 02:29:40,250
is this is years of my life do a quick

3137
02:29:38,209 --> 02:29:46,750
little intro and try to fix your mic

3138
02:29:40,250 --> 02:29:46,750
it's crackling a little bit I think so

3139
02:29:48,728 --> 02:29:54,920
all right well if you guys can hear me

3140
02:29:51,790 --> 02:29:57,740
great short version is when we started

3141
02:29:54,920 --> 02:29:59,840
our work titanium courts were pretty

3142
02:29:57,739 --> 02:30:02,110
much the options and the discourse was

3143
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:05,170
pretty much the titanium guys saying but

3144
02:30:02,110 --> 02:30:08,620
and vice versa no real science no

3145
02:30:05,170 --> 02:30:10,090
particular reason and even worse no one

3146
02:30:08,620 --> 02:30:11,771
was able to interpret what data there

3147
02:30:10,090 --> 02:30:14,799
was so we just decided to look at all

3148
02:30:11,771 --> 02:30:17,260
materials initially we'd said it we

3149
02:30:14,799 --> 02:30:18,759
settled on silicon carbide for a variety

3150
02:30:17,260 --> 02:30:20,409
of reasons I could talk at length on

3151
02:30:18,760 --> 02:30:23,469
that later we ended up settling on

3152
02:30:20,409 --> 02:30:26,289
sapphire which as you've seen has

3153
02:30:23,469 --> 02:30:27,670
amazing flavor properties I've got a

3154
02:30:26,290 --> 02:30:30,670
couple of new things to share

3155
02:30:27,670 --> 02:30:34,989
yeah the that's optical grade sapphire

3156
02:30:30,670 --> 02:30:37,569
those parts phenomenal and where we are

3157
02:30:34,989 --> 02:30:40,449
with it now we spent some years working

3158
02:30:37,569 --> 02:30:43,239
in the cannabis distillation essential

3159
02:30:40,450 --> 02:30:45,070
oil extraction distilling by gradient

3160
02:30:43,239 --> 02:30:46,959
putting everything back together so

3161
02:30:45,069 --> 02:30:49,180
having really spent time studying up

3162
02:30:46,959 --> 02:30:51,789
close on a molecular level how cannabis

3163
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:54,100
comes apart goes back together bringing

3164
02:30:51,790 --> 02:30:58,750
that back to relate it to dish hardware

3165
02:30:54,100 --> 02:31:00,280
how is with the surface adhesion the the

3166
02:30:58,750 --> 02:31:03,940
surface architecture the thermal

3167
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:06,190
properties there there's a lot going on

3168
02:31:03,940 --> 02:31:08,230
we're kind of refining what we call the

3169
02:31:06,190 --> 02:31:12,250
flavor equation how does all of this

3170
02:31:08,229 --> 02:31:14,799
relate to our flavor and ultimately

3171
02:31:12,250 --> 02:31:16,780
flavor is preservation of chemicals can

3172
02:31:14,799 --> 02:31:18,340
you get them out intact can you get them

3173
02:31:16,780 --> 02:31:20,230
out in the same narrow window of time

3174
02:31:18,340 --> 02:31:22,540
intact

3175
02:31:20,229 --> 02:31:25,299
silicon carbide it's amazing for doing

3176
02:31:22,540 --> 02:31:26,830
that there's something so I'm think

3177
02:31:25,299 --> 02:31:31,359
about sapphire we're actually homing in

3178
02:31:26,829 --> 02:31:32,379
on slightly that math after the the big

3179
02:31:31,360 --> 02:31:33,640
thing that we're doing right now is

3180
02:31:32,379 --> 02:31:35,889
we're trying to figure out what relevant

3181
02:31:33,639 --> 02:31:38,289
safety tests for materials are we just

3182
02:31:35,889 --> 02:31:40,149
got in some off gas tests or a new kind

3183
02:31:38,290 --> 02:31:42,970
of course and we'd sent out some silicon

3184
02:31:40,149 --> 02:31:45,399
carbide because what are the safety

3185
02:31:42,969 --> 02:31:47,679
tests available for the nails that's

3186
02:31:45,399 --> 02:31:50,109
kind of been a he-said she-said what

3187
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:52,989
we're smoking on is safe all the way

3188
02:31:50,110 --> 02:31:54,700
back to aluminum I remember smoking on a

3189
02:31:52,989 --> 02:31:57,420
brass pipe so I remember smoking on an

3190
02:31:54,700 --> 02:31:58,750
aluminum bowl with a plastic bomb okay

3191
02:31:57,420 --> 02:32:02,469
what's up

3192
02:31:58,750 --> 02:32:05,229
coke can yeah coke can aluminum foil

3193
02:32:02,469 --> 02:32:08,829
Apple bamboo Thurman I got I was a kid

3194
02:32:05,229 --> 02:32:13,149
we've been their impiety not a papaya

3195
02:32:08,829 --> 02:32:15,789
leaf I've never had one handy areas

3196
02:32:13,149 --> 02:32:19,000
folder they're hollow

3197
02:32:15,790 --> 02:32:21,250
you know like the mango seed beside the

3198
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:23,950
mango see if you dry it yes

3199
02:32:21,250 --> 02:32:26,649
try and drill it out good good

3200
02:32:23,950 --> 02:32:29,350
old-fashioned Apple we've been smoking

3201
02:32:26,649 --> 02:32:31,510
off all these random things and today

3202
02:32:29,350 --> 02:32:33,970
I'm finding myself asking the question

3203
02:32:31,510 --> 02:32:37,389
is thermo is thermo gravimetric analysis

3204
02:32:33,969 --> 02:32:39,069
a relevant test for materials I ask

3205
02:32:37,389 --> 02:32:43,000
myself the very same thing this morning

3206
02:32:39,069 --> 02:32:46,289
actually Brian the short version it's

3207
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:48,850
it's fantasy forget it really hot see

3208
02:32:46,290 --> 02:32:55,570
and that's a good way to tell if

3209
02:32:48,850 --> 02:32:59,319
anything is actually coming off metric

3210
02:32:55,569 --> 02:33:01,539
analysis is a very sensitive and that

3211
02:32:59,319 --> 02:33:03,819
basically ramps up the temperature and

3212
02:33:01,540 --> 02:33:06,670
in what you do is the pan is basically

3213
02:33:03,819 --> 02:33:08,739
measuring the weight loss as a function

3214
02:33:06,670 --> 02:33:11,200
of temperature which is a function of

3215
02:33:08,739 --> 02:33:14,049
time right so if your temperature ramp

3216
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:15,909
ramps up like I don't know like 10

3217
02:33:14,049 --> 02:33:18,369
degrees a minute you'll see basically

3218
02:33:15,909 --> 02:33:21,879
the temperatures start to rise start to

3219
02:33:18,370 --> 02:33:25,000
rise start to rise and if some sort of

3220
02:33:21,879 --> 02:33:27,459
physical transformation happens to like

3221
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:30,579
a solid then it turns into a liquid and

3222
02:33:27,459 --> 02:33:35,049
ultimately a liquid vaporizes you would

3223
02:33:30,579 --> 02:33:37,659
see this as a loss in mass over a period

3224
02:33:35,049 --> 02:33:40,119
of time because you're starting sort of

3225
02:33:37,659 --> 02:33:43,090
with you know a full gram on there and

3226
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:46,360
by the time you've gotten to like 60 or

3227
02:33:43,090 --> 02:33:48,040
70 degrees perhaps like has been

3228
02:33:46,360 --> 02:33:49,390
vaporized because there's terpenes in

3229
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:52,720
there and you're gonna see that in

3230
02:33:49,389 --> 02:33:55,299
basically a loss in mass so so TGA or

3231
02:33:52,719 --> 02:33:57,819
thermo gravimetric analysis is just a

3232
02:33:55,299 --> 02:34:00,039
measure of weight loss as a function of

3233
02:33:57,819 --> 02:34:02,199
temperature down on a very sophisticated

3234
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:04,060
instrument that costs about two hundred

3235
02:34:02,200 --> 02:34:06,490
thousand dollars and would you say

3236
02:34:04,059 --> 02:34:08,260
conducting that that kind of tests on

3237
02:34:06,489 --> 02:34:10,209
our nail materials the stuff we're

3238
02:34:08,260 --> 02:34:12,210
actually vaporizing off thousand C TGA

3239
02:34:10,209 --> 02:34:16,169
would you say that's a relevant test for

3240
02:34:12,209 --> 02:34:16,169
helping to determine material C

3241
02:34:21,050 --> 02:34:25,409
experiment you're constantly changing

3242
02:34:23,579 --> 02:34:27,210
the temperature so you're not you could

3243
02:34:25,409 --> 02:34:29,101
I guess you can take the temperature to

3244
02:34:27,210 --> 02:34:30,449
a particular temperature and then hold

3245
02:34:29,101 --> 02:34:32,280
it there to see what it's like um

3246
02:34:30,450 --> 02:34:34,681
typically what you're doing is you're

3247
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:36,989
just looking at the thermal properties

3248
02:34:34,681 --> 02:34:39,841
of something as it's heated up and

3249
02:34:36,989 --> 02:34:42,390
you're basically just looking at the

3250
02:34:39,841 --> 02:34:45,360
loss and mass now what we're looking for

3251
02:34:42,390 --> 02:34:47,039
is get it up hold it there and 100%

3252
02:34:45,360 --> 02:34:48,480
weight the whole way through because if

3253
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:50,521
it's anything other than that the nail

3254
02:34:48,479 --> 02:34:53,970
shedding something really even matter

3255
02:34:50,521 --> 02:34:55,921
what it is we want zero yes so the

3256
02:34:53,970 --> 02:34:57,899
thermal gravimetric analysis may not

3257
02:34:55,921 --> 02:35:00,300
give you the result you're looking for

3258
02:34:57,899 --> 02:35:02,909
because you're gonna pass through that

3259
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:07,140
that number unless you hold it at a

3260
02:35:02,909 --> 02:35:09,989
particular a particular temperature now

3261
02:35:07,140 --> 02:35:13,859
I think that the the example where you

3262
02:35:09,989 --> 02:35:17,671
want to look at the impact of the nail

3263
02:35:13,860 --> 02:35:19,700
surface on the vapor profile is

3264
02:35:17,671 --> 02:35:22,110
something called a headspace-gc

3265
02:35:19,700 --> 02:35:26,221
measurement right so you want to be able

3266
02:35:22,110 --> 02:35:29,069
to put the nail material inside a vessel

3267
02:35:26,220 --> 02:35:31,909
that's got you know the stuff vaporized

3268
02:35:29,069 --> 02:35:35,520
in it now were you're measuring the

3269
02:35:31,909 --> 02:35:38,431
amount and the constituents of what's in

3270
02:35:35,521 --> 02:35:39,360
the vapor phase above the now you're

3271
02:35:38,431 --> 02:35:41,399
talking about you're talking about

3272
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:42,780
vaporizing oil off the nail and then

3273
02:35:41,399 --> 02:35:47,850
analyzing the vapor to see if it's

3274
02:35:42,780 --> 02:35:50,940
contaminated well I'm just saying that

3275
02:35:47,851 --> 02:35:55,079
you can look at the impact of an L

3276
02:35:50,940 --> 02:35:58,021
surface in a headspace-gc measurement a

3277
02:35:55,079 --> 02:36:02,880
little bit more in detail than you can

3278
02:35:58,021 --> 02:36:04,471
say just in the TGA experiment in and of

3279
02:36:02,880 --> 02:36:06,840
itself which is just going to give you

3280
02:36:04,470 --> 02:36:09,359
one number one number alone which is

3281
02:36:06,841 --> 02:36:12,421
weight loss weight loss is a function of

3282
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:14,579
time which is again can be translated to

3283
02:36:12,421 --> 02:36:17,011
weight loss as a function of temperature

3284
02:36:14,579 --> 02:36:20,101
if you put in your ear temperature

3285
02:36:17,011 --> 02:36:22,409
program file so if our purposes we're

3286
02:36:20,101 --> 02:36:25,711
looking for thousand degrees Celsius

3287
02:36:22,409 --> 02:36:27,450
zero so it doesn't matter there's

3288
02:36:25,710 --> 02:36:29,279
nothing being lost at 200 there's

3289
02:36:27,450 --> 02:36:30,780
nothing being lost 600 there's nothing

3290
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:32,290
being lost all the way up to a thousand

3291
02:36:30,780 --> 02:36:36,149
it

3292
02:36:32,290 --> 02:36:39,460
that's in I'm not a I'm not a little

3293
02:36:36,148 --> 02:36:41,108
analytical chemist so that was the best

3294
02:36:39,459 --> 02:36:43,028
thing I could think of to just go for a

3295
02:36:41,109 --> 02:36:46,510
blanket is this now going to release

3296
02:36:43,029 --> 02:36:50,170
anything attached what my interest is is

3297
02:36:46,510 --> 02:36:52,090
in knowing is what is happening in how

3298
02:36:50,170 --> 02:36:54,068
are these surfaces different because I

3299
02:36:52,090 --> 02:36:56,590
you know you've sent them all to me in

3300
02:36:54,068 --> 02:36:58,000
the way of well I mean in generally in

3301
02:36:56,590 --> 02:36:59,770
regards to when I have them all at the

3302
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:01,930
exact same temperature and I drop a dab

3303
02:36:59,770 --> 02:37:03,520
of the same resin I noticed that the

3304
02:37:01,930 --> 02:37:06,550
terpenes are either destroyed or

3305
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:09,970
preserved differently from the different

3306
02:37:06,549 --> 02:37:12,188
surfaces and for me I owned in on like a

3307
02:37:09,969 --> 02:37:15,340
low temp dab off of sapphire as being

3308
02:37:12,189 --> 02:37:17,859
one of the most preserved you know like

3309
02:37:15,340 --> 02:37:20,200
it tastes like what I want it to taste

3310
02:37:17,859 --> 02:37:21,939
like and I didn't even realize how

3311
02:37:20,200 --> 02:37:24,130
different it tasted off of a different

3312
02:37:21,939 --> 02:37:25,809
surface at the same temperature that's

3313
02:37:24,129 --> 02:37:30,549
what I want to understand oh it's great

3314
02:37:25,809 --> 02:37:32,379
yeah there's a lot to that on using

3315
02:37:30,549 --> 02:37:34,349
quartz as an example quartz of course is

3316
02:37:32,379 --> 02:37:37,659
an extremely poor conductor of heat and

3317
02:37:34,350 --> 02:37:38,979
if you start putting oil into it and

3318
02:37:37,659 --> 02:37:41,639
it's gonna start phase changing you've

3319
02:37:38,978 --> 02:37:43,959
got a puddle and you're gonna get vapor

3320
02:37:41,639 --> 02:37:45,398
coming off under the puddle if it's not

3321
02:37:43,959 --> 02:37:47,919
just placing that fluid if you don't

3322
02:37:45,398 --> 02:37:49,869
have any animation going on as the

3323
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:51,639
vapors created it's gonna spend a lot of

3324
02:37:49,870 --> 02:37:53,859
extra time in contact with a higher

3325
02:37:51,639 --> 02:37:55,119
temperature which is gonna start

3326
02:37:53,859 --> 02:37:57,279
degrading the compounds you're gonna

3327
02:37:55,120 --> 02:38:00,579
automatically lose a lot of your flavor

3328
02:37:57,279 --> 02:38:02,800
because these things with 35 Celsius

3329
02:38:00,579 --> 02:38:04,870
boiling points 50 Celsius boiling points

3330
02:38:02,799 --> 02:38:06,459
are cooking degrading and breaking down

3331
02:38:04,870 --> 02:38:08,649
your your more your most volatile

3332
02:38:06,459 --> 02:38:10,629
flavors are just the chemicals are gone

3333
02:38:08,648 --> 02:38:13,059
hey Brian Kelly had a good idea let's

3334
02:38:10,629 --> 02:38:16,568
try you without your headphones and or

3335
02:38:13,059 --> 02:38:18,189
your mic and if we or is that the only

3336
02:38:16,568 --> 02:38:21,459
mic you have does your computer have a

3337
02:38:18,189 --> 02:38:31,000
mic I can hear me it's still pretty

3338
02:38:21,459 --> 02:38:32,889
crackly I have no idea with it myself

3339
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:34,989
but I thought Kelly's idea was good and

3340
02:38:32,889 --> 02:38:36,579
I thought it could just fix it it seems

3341
02:38:34,989 --> 02:38:38,219
like it's I've had people before where

3342
02:38:36,579 --> 02:38:41,020
they had to like play with the little

3343
02:38:38,219 --> 02:38:42,340
little you know the Jack that goes in

3344
02:38:41,020 --> 02:38:44,439
for the headphones and then it's gone

3345
02:38:42,340 --> 02:38:45,120
away but yeah I'm still willing to

3346
02:38:44,439 --> 02:38:49,739
listen man

3347
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:53,840
it's not the end of the world it was

3348
02:38:49,739 --> 02:38:53,840
better with headphones he says okay

3349
02:38:57,920 --> 02:39:03,090
we've disabled all of our microphones in

3350
02:39:00,930 --> 02:39:10,829
the house as best we could and I went

3351
02:39:03,090 --> 02:39:16,049
through and I specially tried to mean

3352
02:39:10,829 --> 02:39:18,149
with the work that we education and I

3353
02:39:16,049 --> 02:39:20,159
was like wondering there's last couple

3354
02:39:18,149 --> 02:39:25,049
of days to write about like different

3355
02:39:20,159 --> 02:39:27,750
surfaces to fit to dead right we yeah we

3356
02:39:25,049 --> 02:39:29,609
have to be a bit more like we have to

3357
02:39:27,750 --> 02:39:31,649
talk a bit of bone white tan Yunnan

3358
02:39:29,610 --> 02:39:34,319
quartz and the differences in glass and

3359
02:39:31,649 --> 02:39:36,000
I was wondering if you have any mature

3360
02:39:34,319 --> 02:39:38,940
that you could send to us like into

3361
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:41,040
information about that and if there is

3362
02:39:38,940 --> 02:39:42,390
any kind of like I don't know if that's

3363
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:45,120
the word in English for that but like

3364
02:39:42,389 --> 02:39:47,369
when the weathering of the materials and

3365
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:50,010
how much you use because what I see a

3366
02:39:47,370 --> 02:39:58,851
lot is like people Debbie from Forks and

3367
02:39:50,010 --> 02:39:58,851
then the quartz starts to like yeah

3368
02:40:11,899 --> 02:40:17,909
short version with quartz is that its

3369
02:40:15,209 --> 02:40:19,619
oxidizing and breaking down at higher

3370
02:40:17,909 --> 02:40:22,110
temperatures it's more that the raw

3371
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:23,760
quartz is accepting extra oxygen so it's

3372
02:40:22,110 --> 02:40:25,980
not that bad unless you're actually

3373
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:27,601
hitting it rubbing it break it down like

3374
02:40:25,979 --> 02:40:29,329
we could talk a long time if you guys

3375
02:40:27,601 --> 02:40:31,710
want to do a lot of education stuff

3376
02:40:29,329 --> 02:40:33,601
let's make sure we can contact after

3377
02:40:31,709 --> 02:40:36,500
this and I will I will just make sure

3378
02:40:33,601 --> 02:40:36,500
all your questions are answered

3379
02:40:37,250 --> 02:40:42,840
well when we get a solid mic for you - I

3380
02:40:40,049 --> 02:40:44,819
want to do like a full show whether it's

3381
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:46,229
even a hashed Church or just you and me

3382
02:40:44,819 --> 02:40:47,520
and a couple other people who are

3383
02:40:46,229 --> 02:40:53,729
interested in talking about it because

3384
02:40:47,521 --> 02:40:58,290
it's another yeah I have a question here

3385
02:40:53,729 --> 02:40:58,979
GRU are you working with the way the

3386
02:40:58,290 --> 02:41:01,471
temperature

3387
02:40:58,979 --> 02:41:03,689
is heating material at the same time as

3388
02:41:01,470 --> 02:41:06,810
well as the surfaces that it's heating

3389
02:41:03,690 --> 02:41:09,511
oh yeah for instance like you know right

3390
02:41:06,810 --> 02:41:12,421
now you know a typical battery zero to

3391
02:41:09,511 --> 02:41:16,171
60 right it's typically not how we take

3392
02:41:12,421 --> 02:41:18,780
breaths or inhale material right like

3393
02:41:16,171 --> 02:41:20,819
we're not just like 0 to 60 with a hit

3394
02:41:18,780 --> 02:41:22,200
it's it's a slow pool and then maybe

3395
02:41:20,819 --> 02:41:25,261
we're pulling a little harder at the end

3396
02:41:22,200 --> 02:41:27,721
or vice-versa you know and how does that

3397
02:41:25,261 --> 02:41:30,301
affect the the surface area and the

3398
02:41:27,720 --> 02:41:32,369
material and and all that that trifecta

3399
02:41:30,300 --> 02:41:33,810
kind of working together one of the big

3400
02:41:32,370 --> 02:41:35,160
things that I learned in distilling is

3401
02:41:33,810 --> 02:41:37,829
that if you have stuff that you don't

3402
02:41:35,159 --> 02:41:39,810
want your tar your heavy resin whatever

3403
02:41:37,829 --> 02:41:42,120
degradation compounds are unwanted that

3404
02:41:39,810 --> 02:41:43,560
would be left behind the energy you need

3405
02:41:42,120 --> 02:41:46,200
to vaporize is actually the energy you

3406
02:41:43,560 --> 02:41:49,110
need to escape solution which increases

3407
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:51,421
as your dad goes off so if you have a

3408
02:41:49,110 --> 02:41:53,579
night by default unless you've increased

3409
02:41:51,421 --> 02:41:55,711
your either your agitation or your

3410
02:41:53,579 --> 02:41:59,101
thermal energy you're going to have

3411
02:41:55,710 --> 02:41:59,789
stuff left behind it's just trapped so

3412
02:41:59,101 --> 02:42:00,961
that's one of the things we're

3413
02:41:59,790 --> 02:42:02,671
interested in how does it how does this

3414
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:04,229
all fit together to getting everything

3415
02:42:02,671 --> 02:42:05,700
out of your oil and one of the simple

3416
02:42:04,229 --> 02:42:08,130
things is just raising your temperature

3417
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:10,141
a little bit just the exact opposite of

3418
02:42:08,130 --> 02:42:12,421
a torch temperature curve is on its way

3419
02:42:10,140 --> 02:42:14,159
down so either reheating toward the end

3420
02:42:12,421 --> 02:42:16,140
or increasing your temperature on some

3421
02:42:14,159 --> 02:42:19,681
sort of a temp control device or accept

3422
02:42:16,140 --> 02:42:22,350
that there's loss and in general to

3423
02:42:19,681 --> 02:42:25,801
answer your question it's it's a it's a

3424
02:42:22,351 --> 02:42:28,891
non-homogeneous substance time pressure

3425
02:42:25,800 --> 02:42:30,359
temperature variations within them all

3426
02:42:28,890 --> 02:42:33,659
of these end up creating an equation

3427
02:42:30,360 --> 02:42:35,489
that is so highly variable has so many

3428
02:42:33,659 --> 02:42:38,640
different results and outcomes based on

3429
02:42:35,489 --> 02:42:40,351
what people are trying to do in trying

3430
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:41,431
to answer even like what's better you

3431
02:42:40,351 --> 02:42:43,110
have to do an intake

3432
02:42:41,431 --> 02:42:44,940
what's better now how can how do we

3433
02:42:43,110 --> 02:42:46,591
backtrack that to what kind of nail what

3434
02:42:44,940 --> 02:42:50,221
kind of oil and what kind of technique

3435
02:42:46,591 --> 02:42:52,200
and hardware and that's I love it

3436
02:42:50,220 --> 02:42:53,930
there's there's no there's no answer to

3437
02:42:52,200 --> 02:42:57,750
it it just is going to keep evolving

3438
02:42:53,931 --> 02:43:02,011
it's just a session it's me yeah that's

3439
02:42:57,750 --> 02:43:04,079
the exciting stuff you know a lot of

3440
02:43:02,011 --> 02:43:05,761
people about what do you dab how do you

3441
02:43:04,079 --> 02:43:08,039
dad what do you like about it and then

3442
02:43:05,761 --> 02:43:09,631
try to backtrack that to what kind of

3443
02:43:08,040 --> 02:43:11,710
hardware could we make that even if we

3444
02:43:09,630 --> 02:43:13,659
don't have a specific instruction set

3445
02:43:11,709 --> 02:43:18,009
this hardware gives you the option to

3446
02:43:13,659 --> 02:43:20,170
augment your skillset well and it shows

3447
02:43:18,010 --> 02:43:23,500
in the in in the equipment because tons

3448
02:43:20,170 --> 02:43:26,799
of people send me stuff and I you know

3449
02:43:23,500 --> 02:43:28,809
I've got the puking beagle you know like

3450
02:43:26,799 --> 02:43:31,869
flared banger in there right now with

3451
02:43:28,809 --> 02:43:34,059
the two silicon carbide spheres it's

3452
02:43:31,870 --> 02:43:36,700
just a great it's my favorite banger

3453
02:43:34,059 --> 02:43:39,279
it's also flared at the at the top it's

3454
02:43:36,700 --> 02:43:41,350
got this little piece of quartz but

3455
02:43:39,280 --> 02:43:43,900
they've they've pushed it up so the oil

3456
02:43:41,350 --> 02:43:51,550
pushes out and then really flares

3457
02:43:43,899 --> 02:43:52,600
beautifully around in here everything is

3458
02:43:51,549 --> 02:43:55,569
actually spinning around

3459
02:43:52,600 --> 02:44:01,210
it's a pneumatic actuator everything's

3460
02:43:55,569 --> 02:44:03,100
to be leaves a semi spherical highly

3461
02:44:01,209 --> 02:44:06,029
efficient you sent me even some other

3462
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:07,840
crazy more like a thin film like

3463
02:44:06,030 --> 02:44:09,340
experimental I don't even know where it

3464
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:11,350
was but it was like a heater that went

3465
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:12,790
around like didn't you send me that one

3466
02:44:11,350 --> 02:44:15,370
too and then you drop the head in it was

3467
02:44:12,790 --> 02:44:18,570
a big glass like that's the falling film

3468
02:44:15,370 --> 02:44:20,979
inspired by ones falling film right

3469
02:44:18,569 --> 02:44:22,059
promoting but that one is specifically

3470
02:44:20,978 --> 02:44:25,059
designed for people with pulmonary

3471
02:44:22,059 --> 02:44:27,850
issues you can set the lowest possible

3472
02:44:25,059 --> 02:44:41,109
temperature and just yeah like that you

3473
02:44:27,850 --> 02:44:43,000
guys are thinking about this stuff well

3474
02:44:41,110 --> 02:44:44,770
you guys reminded me of my own company

3475
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:46,930
you know you weren't the first electric

3476
02:44:44,770 --> 02:44:49,090
nail you took a lot of guff but you

3477
02:44:46,930 --> 02:44:50,920
pushed through it and continued to be

3478
02:44:49,090 --> 02:44:52,510
innovators and I feel like bubble bags

3479
02:44:50,920 --> 02:44:54,790
did the same thing you know we weren't

3480
02:44:52,510 --> 02:44:57,280
the first bag company but we certainly

3481
02:44:54,790 --> 02:45:03,940
innovated change the game and brought it

3482
02:44:57,280 --> 02:45:05,710
to a lot of people different specialty

3483
02:45:03,940 --> 02:45:08,440
and skill set than most of the people

3484
02:45:05,709 --> 02:45:11,409
here but it's irrelevant without all of

3485
02:45:08,440 --> 02:45:13,960
you and everybody that came before us so

3486
02:45:11,409 --> 02:45:16,299
it's I'm trying to focus on my specialty

3487
02:45:13,959 --> 02:45:18,009
and the way we keep us driving our work

3488
02:45:16,299 --> 02:45:20,049
was we're trying to do what's not been

3489
02:45:18,010 --> 02:45:21,850
done if it's done it's somebody else's

3490
02:45:20,049 --> 02:45:22,619
job and if it's not been done then we

3491
02:45:21,850 --> 02:45:24,960
can consider it

3492
02:45:22,620 --> 02:45:28,149
someone has to

3493
02:45:24,959 --> 02:45:30,339
absolutely very good I need to get some

3494
02:45:28,148 --> 02:45:31,750
bubble bags over to the girls in green

3495
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:33,219
actually remember I made that promise

3496
02:45:31,750 --> 02:45:37,148
and then you guys never hit me up for

3497
02:45:33,219 --> 02:45:38,769
that you got to reach out you got to

3498
02:45:37,148 --> 02:45:45,879
reach out get you guys bubbling in

3499
02:45:38,770 --> 02:45:47,560
Brazil absolutely it's great to it's

3500
02:45:45,879 --> 02:45:49,539
great to be able to give bubble bags

3501
02:45:47,559 --> 02:45:52,118
away I'll say it's one of the greatest

3502
02:45:49,540 --> 02:45:56,170
things ever I've given a lot of bubble

3503
02:45:52,119 --> 02:45:59,350
bags away over the years and what a nice

3504
02:45:56,170 --> 02:46:01,000
gift the gift of making hash it works

3505
02:45:59,350 --> 02:46:03,670
for me too because then generally I'll

3506
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:05,020
be like oh [ __ ] I'm going to like the

3507
02:46:03,670 --> 02:46:05,529
middle of nowhere seeing all the like

3508
02:46:05,020 --> 02:46:07,270
wait a minute

3509
02:46:05,529 --> 02:46:08,710
I think I gave some guys like some

3510
02:46:07,270 --> 02:46:10,329
bubble bags that lives in the middle of

3511
02:46:08,709 --> 02:46:23,318
nowhere I'm gonna have to give that guy

3512
02:46:10,329 --> 02:46:25,238
a call there's great planning [ __ ] all

3513
02:46:23,318 --> 02:46:27,340
right there we go we got some back in

3514
02:46:25,238 --> 02:46:28,478
the day that's a you know it's good to

3515
02:46:27,340 --> 02:46:30,389
give it's good to give you know who

3516
02:46:28,478 --> 02:46:33,309
really taught me the gift of giving

3517
02:46:30,389 --> 02:46:36,549
fish fish taught me the gift of giving I

3518
02:46:33,309 --> 02:46:39,670
miracles 16 of my virgin fish friends

3519
02:46:36,549 --> 02:46:42,608
into a fish show in like 96 here in

3520
02:46:39,670 --> 02:46:45,699
Vancouver and it was like I never seen

3521
02:46:42,609 --> 02:46:48,449
such enjoyment and joy on someone's face

3522
02:46:45,699 --> 02:46:51,819
and I realized while like giving is

3523
02:46:48,449 --> 02:46:54,430
incredible I want to be a giver and so

3524
02:46:51,818 --> 02:46:57,969
I've never looked back be generous give

3525
02:46:54,430 --> 02:47:02,250
whether it's your time your energy or

3526
02:46:57,969 --> 02:47:02,250
something else don't be afraid to give

3527
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:12,430
1147 another 15 minutes to shoot the

3528
02:47:05,799 --> 02:47:15,509
[ __ ] retouch on with South Korea because

3529
02:47:12,430 --> 02:47:18,790
you know Korean natural farming is

3530
02:47:15,510 --> 02:47:21,670
playing such a big role in you know

3531
02:47:18,790 --> 02:47:23,560
cannabis cultivation these days than if

3532
02:47:21,670 --> 02:47:25,988
you combine Korean natural farming with

3533
02:47:23,559 --> 02:47:28,180
permaculture and the bio dynamics with

3534
02:47:25,988 --> 02:47:31,510
everything you can create a really

3535
02:47:28,180 --> 02:47:33,488
dynamic farm but Korea also has an

3536
02:47:31,510 --> 02:47:36,670
incredible amount of information with

3537
02:47:33,488 --> 02:47:38,300
medicinal mushrooms historically and

3538
02:47:36,670 --> 02:47:41,031
there's a lot of information

3539
02:47:38,300 --> 02:47:44,060
we in the english-speaking world don't

3540
02:47:41,031 --> 02:47:46,041
can't access the you know that we want

3541
02:47:44,060 --> 02:47:48,411
to access through medicinal mushrooms

3542
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:51,200
and I don't think it behooves South

3543
02:47:48,411 --> 02:47:53,210
Korea its to hold on to its information

3544
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:55,069
any more than it produces the United

3545
02:47:53,210 --> 02:47:56,689
States or any other country to hold on

3546
02:47:55,069 --> 02:47:59,149
to its information

3547
02:47:56,690 --> 02:48:02,569
I think it's opening the information

3548
02:47:59,149 --> 02:48:04,251
that makes us all better so I think that

3549
02:48:02,569 --> 02:48:07,001
that's what we've been talking about a

3550
02:48:04,251 --> 02:48:10,130
lot here today is you know the the

3551
02:48:07,001 --> 02:48:11,031
non-compete kind of aspect of beat of

3552
02:48:10,130 --> 02:48:14,020
feeling better

3553
02:48:11,031 --> 02:48:16,551
on earth you know I mean if if we have

3554
02:48:14,021 --> 02:48:19,041
created some laws that make sense in

3555
02:48:16,550 --> 02:48:20,630
North America whether it's in the US or

3556
02:48:19,040 --> 02:48:23,569
in Canada I think that it would make

3557
02:48:20,630 --> 02:48:25,430
sense for South Korea to say hey this

3558
02:48:23,569 --> 02:48:26,810
this has made a lot of sense there's

3559
02:48:25,431 --> 02:48:29,121
been a lot of things that don't make

3560
02:48:26,810 --> 02:48:31,700
sense out here so as we as we've

3561
02:48:29,120 --> 02:48:34,460
recognized you know our legalization has

3562
02:48:31,700 --> 02:48:35,990
a lot of flaws so I think that with

3563
02:48:34,460 --> 02:48:38,569
countries that are new and they're

3564
02:48:35,990 --> 02:48:41,210
coming on it would be really smart for

3565
02:48:38,569 --> 02:48:43,851
them to to enact the things that are

3566
02:48:41,210 --> 02:48:46,970
working you know within within each

3567
02:48:43,851 --> 02:48:49,490
system and to allow open exchange back

3568
02:48:46,970 --> 02:48:52,550
and forth because the ultimate reason

3569
02:48:49,490 --> 02:48:54,110
for a country to take on legalization

3570
02:48:52,550 --> 02:48:56,930
would be for health and well-being and

3571
02:48:54,110 --> 02:48:58,911
now we're recognizing that health and

3572
02:48:56,931 --> 02:49:02,031
well-being isn't just a product it's

3573
02:48:58,911 --> 02:49:04,040
it's the way it's made so cultivation is

3574
02:49:02,031 --> 02:49:07,281
the health and well-being of the earth

3575
02:49:04,040 --> 02:49:09,590
so we're using these these cultivation

3576
02:49:07,281 --> 02:49:11,690
practices to heal the earth and then we

3577
02:49:09,591 --> 02:49:13,819
want those cultivation practices to

3578
02:49:11,690 --> 02:49:16,819
going and heal our humans through

3579
02:49:13,819 --> 02:49:20,091
products so let's come together with

3580
02:49:16,819 --> 02:49:22,520
South Korea and be the most educated

3581
02:49:20,091 --> 02:49:24,711
group of people ever you know I think

3582
02:49:22,521 --> 02:49:27,940
Russia could play an amazing you know

3583
02:49:24,710 --> 02:49:30,050
think Japan China there there's so much

3584
02:49:27,940 --> 02:49:32,301
information there so that that's what we

3585
02:49:30,050 --> 02:49:35,390
have to say is free up the information

3586
02:49:32,300 --> 02:49:37,550
for the betterment of humanity well we

3587
02:49:35,390 --> 02:49:39,119
learned that as oh go ahead Debbie it'd

3588
02:49:37,550 --> 02:49:46,799
be fun to

3589
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:48,480
get some of the greenhouse photos coming

3590
02:49:46,799 --> 02:49:54,779
across they're really trying to rebuild

3591
02:49:48,479 --> 02:49:56,459
that you know that's for sure absolutely

3592
02:49:54,780 --> 02:50:01,290
we can probably get to work there's a

3593
02:49:56,459 --> 02:50:03,750
few members potent on axes in Zimbabwe

3594
02:50:01,290 --> 02:50:05,190
right now and you know working with some

3595
02:50:03,750 --> 02:50:07,379
people that are doing beautiful work

3596
02:50:05,190 --> 02:50:09,510
with track and trace and they're also

3597
02:50:07,379 --> 02:50:12,600
they worked within the cacao in the

3598
02:50:09,510 --> 02:50:14,610
street you know trying to support small

3599
02:50:12,601 --> 02:50:16,110
farmers through cooperatives and those

3600
02:50:14,610 --> 02:50:19,560
cooperatives give them collective

3601
02:50:16,110 --> 02:50:21,510
bargaining which allowed them to set

3602
02:50:19,560 --> 02:50:23,699
prices rather than the market setting

3603
02:50:21,510 --> 02:50:27,079
prices where the farmer never sees a

3604
02:50:23,700 --> 02:50:30,271
benefit from a rise or a lower in price

3605
02:50:27,079 --> 02:50:32,670
cooperatives allow farmers to exist

3606
02:50:30,271 --> 02:50:34,140
better so track and trace programs that

3607
02:50:32,670 --> 02:50:36,659
have been placed on the cannabis

3608
02:50:34,139 --> 02:50:38,430
industry can be a really good thing and

3609
02:50:36,659 --> 02:50:41,729
we can learn that through coffee and

3610
02:50:38,430 --> 02:50:43,590
cacao in Africa you know is a huge

3611
02:50:41,729 --> 02:50:46,049
frontier of possibilities and there's

3612
02:50:43,590 --> 02:50:48,601
some amazing people in South Africa

3613
02:50:46,049 --> 02:50:50,250
doing work it's gonna be you know

3614
02:50:48,601 --> 02:50:53,790
interesting to see how that comes up but

3615
02:50:50,250 --> 02:50:55,590
obviously THC me and I'm a lot of unique

3616
02:50:53,790 --> 02:51:00,540
cannabinoids are coming out of places

3617
02:50:55,590 --> 02:51:03,090
like Malawi also Nigeria also Swaziland

3618
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:05,790
and South Africa so again freeing

3619
02:51:03,090 --> 02:51:08,250
freeing it up is for the betterment of

3620
02:51:05,790 --> 02:51:10,561
humanity it's why I always shared clones

3621
02:51:08,250 --> 02:51:12,000
always and people will be like oh you're

3622
02:51:10,560 --> 02:51:14,699
not supposed to share that one and I'm

3623
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:16,170
like really cuz every time someone loses

3624
02:51:14,700 --> 02:51:18,570
all their genetics because they're an

3625
02:51:16,170 --> 02:51:20,760
idiot and don't give them away or share

3626
02:51:18,569 --> 02:51:22,979
cuz they're an idiot just to reiterate

3627
02:51:20,760 --> 02:51:24,510
that one more time and they're all

3628
02:51:22,979 --> 02:51:26,520
crying and bummed out and then you know

3629
02:51:24,510 --> 02:51:28,920
what the first thing they do if they

3630
02:51:26,521 --> 02:51:30,659
taxed someone hard and there's like sold

3631
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:33,299
them a clone for big money and said

3632
02:51:30,659 --> 02:51:35,489
don't give it away to anyone they say oh

3633
02:51:33,299 --> 02:51:37,409
do you think I could get that clone back

3634
02:51:35,489 --> 02:51:39,180
that I told you not to give to anyone

3635
02:51:37,409 --> 02:51:40,950
and I charge you five thousand dollars

3636
02:51:39,180 --> 02:51:45,120
for because I'm such an idiot

3637
02:51:40,950 --> 02:51:46,740
third time I lost it so it's like I get

3638
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:48,360
it protect your genetics you're a big

3639
02:51:46,739 --> 02:51:49,559
company you spent millions of dollars on

3640
02:51:48,360 --> 02:51:51,328
breeding that's one thing

3641
02:51:49,559 --> 02:51:53,158
but like you just have a great cultivar

3642
02:51:51,328 --> 02:51:54,538
but you barely had anything to do with

3643
02:51:53,158 --> 02:51:58,338
other than acquiring it and you're

3644
02:51:54,539 --> 02:52:01,489
holding on to it with greed shame on you

3645
02:51:58,338 --> 02:52:06,779
it's like carrier man let's see

3646
02:52:01,488 --> 02:52:08,309
man shame yeah if you want to save it

3647
02:52:06,779 --> 02:52:09,930
give it away and guess what it's

3648
02:52:08,309 --> 02:52:11,338
actually a good thing and it's funny

3649
02:52:09,930 --> 02:52:13,049
because I had a conversation with a

3650
02:52:11,338 --> 02:52:14,789
local guy here in Vancouver who was

3651
02:52:13,049 --> 02:52:15,449
pissed that I gave the Congo away to

3652
02:52:14,789 --> 02:52:17,579
everyone

3653
02:52:15,449 --> 02:52:19,319
and he was like you know you got a you

3654
02:52:17,578 --> 02:52:21,059
got a like filter and figure out who

3655
02:52:19,318 --> 02:52:23,068
deserves this and I'm like everyone

3656
02:52:21,059 --> 02:52:24,838
deserves it and he's like well that's

3657
02:52:23,068 --> 02:52:27,689
just not true and I'm like well how do

3658
02:52:24,838 --> 02:52:29,969
you know if say someone that you think

3659
02:52:27,689 --> 02:52:31,828
doesn't deserve it ends up with it

3660
02:52:29,969 --> 02:52:33,628
but really the only reason they ended up

3661
02:52:31,828 --> 02:52:35,100
with it was to give it to a bunch of

3662
02:52:33,629 --> 02:52:36,959
people who did deserve it that you

3663
02:52:35,100 --> 02:52:38,818
didn't have access to how about that I

3664
02:52:36,959 --> 02:52:42,299
stumped him on that one he was kind of

3665
02:52:38,818 --> 02:52:43,828
like oh but just give your you've given

3666
02:52:42,299 --> 02:52:45,810
the cultivars away if you're in a

3667
02:52:43,828 --> 02:52:47,458
position that you can you know if

3668
02:52:45,809 --> 02:52:49,798
they're not like the your entire

3669
02:52:47,459 --> 02:52:52,439
business or whatnot if you can and you

3670
02:52:49,799 --> 02:52:56,180
have a great great cultivar it's good to

3671
02:52:52,439 --> 02:52:59,100
share it more so in an envious photo

3672
02:52:56,180 --> 02:53:01,879
shot on Instagram but also by giving it

3673
02:52:59,100 --> 02:53:04,818
away I've given a lot of clones away

3674
02:53:01,879 --> 02:53:07,709

3727
02:55:06,700 --> 02:55:09,610
small just write down the beginning when

3732
02:55:17,978 --> 02:55:23,559
people in Congress who is looking for

3733
02:55:20,559 --> 02:55:24,670
that killer hash I'm out time out trying

3734
02:55:23,559 --> 02:55:26,739
to find that on the black market

3735
02:55:24,670 --> 02:55:30,790
wouldn't be as easy because it was

3736
02:55:26,739 --> 02:55:35,379
organic hash Ross oh wait yeah I'm dry

3737
02:55:30,790 --> 02:55:39,840
organically grown washed pressed that's

3738
02:55:35,379 --> 02:55:45,478
like I'm gonna say it's a good price I

3739
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:45,478
wouldn't well I'm not saying I mean okay

3740
02:55:45,629 --> 02:55:56,859
the terrible price it's the worst ever

3741
02:55:49,090 --> 02:56:00,420
it's like to do Marcus good price well

3742
02:55:56,860 --> 02:56:00,420
I'll tell you right off the bat

3743
02:56:01,450 --> 02:56:04,570
yeah yeah exactly let me tell you what

3744
02:56:03,219 --> 02:56:07,119
they need to do right off the bat so

3745
02:56:04,569 --> 02:56:09,010
these guys have burb they had some

3746
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:11,920
really nice flowers they have to buy it

3747
02:56:09,010 --> 02:56:13,389
from these legal grows but some of them

3748
02:56:11,920 --> 02:56:16,148
like

3749
02:56:13,389 --> 02:56:17,500
- no like that maybe 25% that I was

3750
02:56:16,148 --> 02:56:18,908
looking at was like holy [ __ ] look

3751
02:56:17,500 --> 02:56:21,279
that's nicer than I thought they were

3752
02:56:18,908 --> 02:56:23,920
gonna have they had it in custom jars

3753
02:56:21,279 --> 02:56:26,590
little glass triangular jars that were

3754
02:56:23,920 --> 02:56:29,829
sealed but had a Down stand coming out

3755
02:56:26,590 --> 02:56:31,658
of them and a downstem coming out of

3756
02:56:29,829 --> 02:56:32,978
them with a cork in it and so you could

3757
02:56:31,658 --> 02:56:34,750
take the cork out and you could smell

3758
02:56:32,978 --> 02:56:36,938
all these different varieties and it was

3759
02:56:34,750 --> 02:56:39,040
beautiful trust me any cannabis user

3760
02:56:36,939 --> 02:56:41,050
would have walked into their front area

3761
02:56:39,040 --> 02:56:43,359
and been like this is nice they were

3762
02:56:41,049 --> 02:56:45,129
like we don't do the iPad thing we want

3763
02:56:43,359 --> 02:56:47,890
you to see the bud look at the bud and

3764
02:56:45,129 --> 02:56:49,089
so I said well are you able to like what

3765
02:56:47,889 --> 02:56:51,849
do you do just sell the bud and the

3766
02:56:49,090 --> 02:56:54,130
discount once it's been dieter and he

3767
02:56:51,850 --> 02:56:57,068
said no no no the regulations we have to

3768
02:56:54,129 --> 02:56:59,049
destroy it and I was like I was like

3769
02:56:57,068 --> 02:57:01,600
what he's like no listen we have to mix

3770
02:56:59,049 --> 02:57:03,849
it with bleach and kitty-litter grind it

3771
02:57:01,600 --> 02:57:05,620
and throw it in the garbage and because

3772
02:57:03,850 --> 02:57:07,600
they're of this sort of connoisseur

3773
02:57:05,620 --> 02:57:10,390
innate nature and they're not going for

3774
02:57:07,600 --> 02:57:12,220
that iPad photo thing they want you to

3775
02:57:10,389 --> 02:57:14,680
see it and smell it and sort of you know

3776
02:57:12,219 --> 02:57:19,469
have that experience it costs them an

3777
02:57:14,680 --> 02:57:22,960
enormous amount of money just to do that

3778
02:57:19,469 --> 02:57:25,599
your compost there's all sorts of stupid

3779
02:57:22,959 --> 02:57:28,869
regulations set up where it screws these

3780
02:57:25,600 --> 02:57:31,750
these shops in a way that sort of locks

3781
02:57:28,870 --> 02:57:34,720
them into basically this is this is it

3782
02:57:31,750 --> 02:57:36,850
for now or nothing so you can do this or

3783
02:57:34,719 --> 02:57:39,188
you just have nothing and so of course

3784
02:57:36,850 --> 02:57:42,130
as we've been sort of you know jamming

3785
02:57:39,189 --> 02:57:43,750
our foot in the door of ending

3786
02:57:42,129 --> 02:57:46,089
prohibition in Canada because at first

3787
02:57:43,750 --> 02:57:47,709
it was like a little pinky toe that held

3788
02:57:46,090 --> 02:57:50,469
the door open and now I'd say we're

3789
02:57:47,709 --> 02:57:52,539
probably around the knee I'm trying to

3790
02:57:50,469 --> 02:57:54,579
get that elbow around the door and have

3791
02:57:52,540 --> 02:57:56,199
it crack wide open because we're still

3792
02:57:54,579 --> 02:57:59,590
dealing with an enormous amount of

3793
02:57:56,199 --> 02:58:02,229
[ __ ] and no one is really blaming

3794
02:57:59,590 --> 02:58:03,880
the right people the division in the

3795
02:58:02,228 --> 02:58:05,948
community is the people who went to

3796
02:58:03,879 --> 02:58:07,658
start legal stores or sellouts and that

3797
02:58:05,949 --> 02:58:09,790
the activists who did not have the

3798
02:58:07,658 --> 02:58:12,459
access to getting a licensing or whatnot

3799
02:58:09,790 --> 02:58:14,500
are still like the real deal and in the

3800
02:58:12,459 --> 02:58:16,568
meantime the government who makes all

3801
02:58:14,500 --> 02:58:19,478
the rules and is creating the division

3802
02:58:16,568 --> 02:58:21,969
over here is kind of the the the more

3803
02:58:19,478 --> 02:58:25,090
responsible of the three for for

3804
02:58:21,969 --> 02:58:27,069
creating a system that if we understand

3805
02:58:25,090 --> 02:58:29,681
in Canada our system was created

3806
02:58:27,069 --> 02:58:31,511
you know in part by us telling them no

3807
02:58:29,681 --> 02:58:32,920
we need this this this and this and I'm

3808
02:58:31,511 --> 02:58:34,420
saying oh well we'll give you this and

3809
02:58:32,920 --> 02:58:35,739
then that's going to coming back and

3810
02:58:34,420 --> 02:58:36,909
saying no sorry we're gonna need this

3811
02:58:35,739 --> 02:58:38,681
this this and this

3812
02:58:36,909 --> 02:58:40,569
it's an our Charter of Rights we took

3813
02:58:38,681 --> 02:58:42,880
we've taken them to court these

3814
02:58:40,569 --> 02:58:45,190
companies that were selling legal herb

3815
02:58:42,879 --> 02:58:48,939
sort of lobbied at one point that hey

3816
02:58:45,190 --> 02:58:50,771
maybe Canada doesn't need agro license

3817
02:58:48,940 --> 02:58:53,319
thing a medical license anymore maybe we

3818
02:58:50,771 --> 02:58:55,329
could just supply them when against our

3819
02:58:53,319 --> 02:58:58,090
charters and we won in court thanks to

3820
02:58:55,329 --> 02:59:00,039
John Conroy and some other great lawyers

3821
02:58:58,090 --> 02:59:03,399
you know fighting this right fight but

3822
02:59:00,040 --> 02:59:07,360
it's so slow it's just one little point

3823
02:59:03,399 --> 02:59:10,090
at a time the bottom line is I'm still

3824
02:59:07,360 --> 02:59:12,130
happy that there's there's a gram of

3825
02:59:10,090 --> 02:59:13,720
ailable if someone has a hundred and

3826
02:59:12,129 --> 02:59:15,729
eighty bucks they can go and try it I

3827
02:59:13,720 --> 02:59:18,279
wouldn't buy it personally but I went

3828
02:59:15,729 --> 02:59:21,939
with John a lot a bunch of stuff he was

3829
02:59:18,280 --> 02:59:24,820
super happy and it's like you know don't

3830
02:59:21,940 --> 02:59:27,159
fight against access that already exists

3831
02:59:24,819 --> 02:59:29,440
just create new and better access we

3832
02:59:27,159 --> 02:59:31,329
don't need to you know tear the system

3833
02:59:29,440 --> 02:59:33,730
apart those are their honor

3834
02:59:31,329 --> 02:59:35,829
there are lawmakers still going you know

3835
02:59:33,729 --> 02:59:38,770
around communities that are trying to

3836
02:59:35,829 --> 02:59:42,579
you know affect the law here in Canada

3837
02:59:38,771 --> 02:59:46,360
and make it worse and that there's more

3838
02:59:42,579 --> 02:59:49,261
of us and we have the Charter on our

3839
02:59:46,360 --> 02:59:52,840
side so that's in Canada actually

3840
02:59:49,261 --> 02:59:55,479
connected so if you want a cheaper price

3841
02:59:52,840 --> 03:00:00,431
you think they need to grow a larger

3842
02:59:55,479 --> 03:00:02,470
volume well I think yes giving licensing

3843
03:00:00,431 --> 03:00:04,239
allowing more craft growers allowing

3844
03:00:02,470 --> 03:00:05,890
more people to be a part of it a lot

3845
03:00:04,239 --> 03:00:08,860
opening up the pool letting people

3846
03:00:05,890 --> 03:00:10,959
process making it more available you

3847
03:00:08,860 --> 03:00:13,239
know it's you know loosen up that

3848
03:00:10,959 --> 03:00:16,149
control over it can only be sold here

3849
03:00:13,239 --> 03:00:18,129
here and here and open it up in a more

3850
03:00:16,149 --> 03:00:20,020
in a way that's more like okay well if

3851
03:00:18,129 --> 03:00:21,399
you can you know if you have the

3852
03:00:20,021 --> 03:00:23,320
business savvy and you have the

3853
03:00:21,399 --> 03:00:25,060
investment and you have the ability then

3854
03:00:23,319 --> 03:00:29,379
you should be able to do this instead of

3855
03:00:25,060 --> 03:00:33,310
everyone being kept out you know I have

3856
03:00:29,379 --> 03:00:36,159
no objection to taxes or regulations to

3857
03:00:33,310 --> 03:00:40,341
protect the consumer but that is common

3858
03:00:36,159 --> 03:00:43,280
sense to me but I just can't understand

3859
03:00:40,341 --> 03:00:45,649
180 dollars a gram I mean I understand

3860
03:00:43,281 --> 03:00:48,051
that might be necessary at this moment

3861
03:00:45,649 --> 03:00:50,030
for them to make a profit because of the

3862
03:00:48,050 --> 03:00:52,581
particular structured way they're

3863
03:00:50,031 --> 03:00:55,701
selling it but you and I both know that

3864
03:00:52,581 --> 03:00:58,460
a hundred and eighty dollars a gram I

3865
03:00:55,700 --> 03:01:02,359
mean either one of us could produce it

3866
03:00:58,460 --> 03:01:04,251
cheaper Oh beyond cheaper and this is

3867
03:01:02,360 --> 03:01:06,681
for the recreational market in Canada

3868
03:01:04,251 --> 03:01:10,251
not the medical market by any means

3869
03:01:06,681 --> 03:01:12,110
now how everyone's in a big uproar in

3870
03:01:10,251 --> 03:01:13,851
the meantime if you were going to if you

3871
03:01:12,110 --> 03:01:15,831
were to go to the black market to get

3872
03:01:13,851 --> 03:01:17,360
such quality you would maybe if you were

3873
03:01:15,831 --> 03:01:19,940
really in the know get a fifty dollar

3874
03:01:17,360 --> 03:01:21,771
price tag but more likely it would be

3875
03:01:19,940 --> 03:01:24,261
eighty to a hundred dollar price tag

3876
03:01:21,771 --> 03:01:29,451
which is even though it's half price

3877
03:01:24,261 --> 03:01:31,551
just as absolutely ridiculous because

3878
03:01:29,450 --> 03:01:33,950
honestly those companies and how much

3879
03:01:31,550 --> 03:01:35,870
they have to pay for overhead and taxes

3880
03:01:33,950 --> 03:01:38,240
and like the regulations and how they're

3881
03:01:35,870 --> 03:01:41,510
it's all set up to screw them that extra

3882
03:01:38,240 --> 03:01:44,031
hundred dollars is for sure Burt in that

3883
03:01:41,511 --> 03:01:46,161
plus more out of the second hundred

3884
03:01:44,031 --> 03:01:48,440
dollars the black market people are

3885
03:01:46,161 --> 03:01:51,800
probably making a way larger profit

3886
03:01:48,440 --> 03:01:53,721
margin because their lack of cost their

3887
03:01:51,800 --> 03:01:56,421
burn rate is way lower than some of

3888
03:01:53,720 --> 03:01:58,520
these hundred million dollar LPS that

3889
03:01:56,421 --> 03:01:59,871
have you know put themselves public on

3890
03:01:58,521 --> 03:02:02,841
the stock market and done all these

3891
03:01:59,870 --> 03:02:06,620
things so I'm sort of upset with both of

3892
03:02:02,841 --> 03:02:11,300
them I 100 most ridiculous eighty is

3893
03:02:06,620 --> 03:02:13,609
still not affordable is in Brazil where

3894
03:02:11,300 --> 03:02:16,880
the only the wealthy people can

3895
03:02:13,610 --> 03:02:18,891
participate you know and in that way

3896
03:02:16,880 --> 03:02:20,661
it's similar in different parts of the

3897
03:02:18,890 --> 03:02:24,440
world you know where they've created the

3898
03:02:20,661 --> 03:02:27,649
system that is just so overblown that it

3899
03:02:24,440 --> 03:02:30,190
becomes a civil disobedience just to

3900
03:02:27,649 --> 03:02:33,020
keep going the other direction if if

3901
03:02:30,190 --> 03:02:36,351
legalization was supposed to get rid of

3902
03:02:33,021 --> 03:02:39,471
the black market that isn't working yet

3903
03:02:36,351 --> 03:02:43,101
and if it was supposed to create access

3904
03:02:39,470 --> 03:02:46,130
to people that's not working yet in

3905
03:02:43,101 --> 03:02:48,230
Canada so I think that's where

3906
03:02:46,130 --> 03:02:50,390
compassion and care is allowing that to

3907
03:02:48,229 --> 03:02:52,939
happen and we can you know make it

3908
03:02:50,390 --> 03:02:53,779
really you know heady and good product

3909
03:02:52,940 --> 03:02:59,600
still

3910
03:02:53,780 --> 03:03:03,110
for sure just looking up expensive wines

3911
03:02:59,600 --> 03:03:06,350
and there's plenty in the $7,000 for

3912
03:03:03,110 --> 03:03:15,020
inch for a bottle of wine curious to see

3913
03:03:06,350 --> 03:03:23,870
where we go with this 7,000 and never

3914
03:03:15,020 --> 03:03:26,659
and I probably never will you know

3915
03:03:23,870 --> 03:03:31,030
people do all kinds of foolish things I

3916
03:03:26,659 --> 03:03:33,739
mean I have friends who were Samuel and

3917
03:03:31,030 --> 03:03:36,920
they told me that the guys would come in

3918
03:03:33,739 --> 03:03:43,449
and ask what is the most expensive wine

3919
03:03:36,920 --> 03:03:46,340
you laugh because value quality rating

3920
03:03:43,450 --> 03:03:49,220
it was you know they read that a very

3921
03:03:46,340 --> 03:03:54,110
expensive restaurant it was in business

3922
03:03:49,219 --> 03:03:56,420
they weren't paying for so the point

3923
03:03:54,110 --> 03:04:00,170
isn't in the the lower tier not in the

3924
03:03:56,420 --> 03:04:03,110
the five in ten the five and six there's

3925
03:04:00,170 --> 03:04:05,809
a very expensive stuff but humans are

3926
03:04:03,110 --> 03:04:08,030
capable of great things and there there

3927
03:04:05,809 --> 03:04:10,430
is a justifiable level of effort that

3928
03:04:08,030 --> 03:04:12,470
can go in from from soil to breeding to

3929
03:04:10,430 --> 03:04:14,569
genetics to care to produce some really

3930
03:04:12,469 --> 03:04:16,519
really amazing stuff and I don't know

3931
03:04:14,569 --> 03:04:19,069
anybody that's really targeting a $500

3932
03:04:16,520 --> 03:04:20,899
gram but conceptually I can I can

3933
03:04:19,069 --> 03:04:22,369
justify it but it would have to be

3934
03:04:20,899 --> 03:04:24,949
something really special and I'd love to

3935
03:04:22,370 --> 03:04:27,079
see that money used to fund something

3936
03:04:24,950 --> 03:04:28,909
better than producing luxury good for

3937
03:04:27,079 --> 03:04:32,270
rich people but there's gonna there's

3938
03:04:28,909 --> 03:04:33,590
gonna be a demand just look at look at

3939
03:04:32,270 --> 03:04:35,390
the food market look at the liquor

3940
03:04:33,590 --> 03:04:37,399
market and and you can see that just

3941
03:04:35,389 --> 03:04:39,109
ultra high-end and some of it is

3942
03:04:37,399 --> 03:04:39,859
justified in terms of the effort that

3943
03:04:39,110 --> 03:04:42,560
goes into it

3944
03:04:39,860 --> 03:04:44,870
I probably dropped five hundo on some

3945
03:04:42,559 --> 03:04:46,819
sands dry sift when I first met him I

3946
03:04:44,870 --> 03:04:48,680
mean he would never sell it in a million

3947
03:04:46,819 --> 03:04:50,420
years but had if he would have I would

3948
03:04:48,680 --> 03:04:50,939
have been like five hundred seems like a

3949
03:04:50,420 --> 03:04:54,389
reason

3950
03:04:50,939 --> 03:04:56,908
price just for the historical context of

3951
03:04:54,389 --> 03:04:58,439
like oh so you've not only grown these

3952
03:04:56,908 --> 03:05:00,238
plants you're actually bred them with

3953
03:04:58,439 --> 03:05:02,789
seeds you collected in hash producing

3954
03:05:00,238 --> 03:05:08,340
countries that you lived in like ding

3955
03:05:02,789 --> 03:05:09,959
ding ding come on historical context is

3956
03:05:08,340 --> 03:05:12,029
one of the biggest reasons things get a

3957
03:05:09,959 --> 03:05:24,209
high price tag if Thomas Jefferson made

3958
03:05:12,029 --> 03:05:43,619
it it's kind of worth a lot of money to

3959
03:05:24,209 --> 03:06:11,239
charity I didn't even know that there

3960
03:05:43,619 --> 03:06:15,479
was a higher XO we're not proud of the

3961
03:06:11,238 --> 03:06:20,698
$180 gram of rosin hashed rosin here in

3962
03:06:15,478 --> 03:06:22,799
the Canadian legal market but just keep

3963
03:06:20,699 --> 03:06:24,479
fighting hopefully you know I'm hoping

3964
03:06:22,799 --> 03:06:28,528
that our company can make enough hash

3965
03:06:24,478 --> 03:06:31,260
that the price can only go one way I've

3966
03:06:28,529 --> 03:06:33,920
seen I've seen a hundred and fifty

3967
03:06:31,260 --> 03:06:37,020
dollar half grams in California Marcus

3968
03:06:33,920 --> 03:06:41,248
with any Goods out they were they were

3969
03:06:37,020 --> 03:06:44,158
phenomenal but it's just it's you know

3970
03:06:41,248 --> 03:06:46,680
it's to everyone to Sam's point it's it

3971
03:06:44,158 --> 03:06:50,639
doesn't need to be that it just is that

3972
03:06:46,680 --> 03:06:53,760
it's a pie man I mean we get the Emerald

3973
03:06:50,639 --> 03:06:58,318
cup and before that was the ego clash

3974
03:06:53,760 --> 03:07:02,550
which was you know a hash merge Sam's

3975
03:06:58,318 --> 03:07:04,019
house and good name we didn't we exactly

3976
03:07:02,549 --> 03:07:04,680
it was the name that way for a reason

3977
03:07:04,020 --> 03:07:08,161
I'm pretty

3978
03:07:04,681 --> 03:07:11,101
sure but uh yeah um the hash that was

3979
03:07:08,161 --> 03:07:13,140
there is absolutely insane and and it's

3980
03:07:11,101 --> 03:07:15,391
not just like four or five fish makers

3981
03:07:13,140 --> 03:07:18,600
it's Barnes filled with hash makers and

3982
03:07:15,390 --> 03:07:21,751
the level of quality there is absolutely

3983
03:07:18,601 --> 03:07:23,761
his mind blowing and we are just talking

3984
03:07:21,751 --> 03:07:25,860
with James at product Earth and in the

3985
03:07:23,761 --> 03:07:27,091
UK who has an amazing conference going

3986
03:07:25,860 --> 03:07:30,051
up that we're going to and he was saying

3987
03:07:27,091 --> 03:07:35,131
when skittles got first created that

3988
03:07:30,050 --> 03:07:37,140
seeds or clone went out to the to the UK

3989
03:07:35,130 --> 03:07:39,510
and when it was grown the ounces were a

3990
03:07:37,140 --> 03:07:42,239
thousand pounds for one ounce

3991
03:07:39,511 --> 03:07:48,751
Wow it's just a matter back to the

3992
03:07:42,239 --> 03:07:50,550
diesel days yeah I mean I you know I was

3993
03:07:48,751 --> 03:07:55,081
washing all week in a walk-in freezer

3994
03:07:50,550 --> 03:07:56,779
all week with my cousin and you know

3995
03:07:55,081 --> 03:08:00,239
like I was saying earlier it's just it's

3996
03:07:56,780 --> 03:08:02,341
it could be expensive but it's you know

3997
03:08:00,239 --> 03:08:05,479
the process you go through can be really

3998
03:08:02,341 --> 03:08:08,011
complex but it can also be really simple

3999
03:08:05,479 --> 03:08:10,350
so there's you know there's definitely a

4000
03:08:08,011 --> 03:08:13,261
range here that we can we can hopefully

4001
03:08:10,351 --> 03:08:18,060
one day capture more people with a more

4002
03:08:13,261 --> 03:08:21,690
affordable option that's not 150 for a

4003
03:08:18,060 --> 03:08:25,261
half gram I mean if you have you know 50

4004
03:08:21,690 --> 03:08:27,841
people producing hash it's no longer

4005
03:08:25,261 --> 03:08:30,301
gonna be sad you know mu so but then

4006
03:08:27,841 --> 03:08:33,661
again strange that's why strain-specific

4007
03:08:30,300 --> 03:08:36,331
is so important you know people can walk

4008
03:08:33,661 --> 03:08:39,810
away their entire garden without the

4009
03:08:36,331 --> 03:08:41,729
right strain so those good hash strains

4010
03:08:39,810 --> 03:08:44,610
like Marcus is talking about full milk

4011
03:08:41,729 --> 03:08:46,439
us you know full milk certified hash

4012
03:08:44,610 --> 03:08:50,221
trains are incredibly valuable to people

4013
03:08:46,440 --> 03:08:51,961
so that would be amazing to start that

4014
03:08:50,220 --> 03:08:54,810
program if you guys did that that would

4015
03:08:51,960 --> 03:08:56,251
be well I mean anything like bein Lions

4016
03:08:54,810 --> 03:08:58,649
certified let me tell you because

4017
03:08:56,251 --> 03:09:01,291
originally back right before mark Emery

4018
03:08:58,649 --> 03:09:03,899
got arrested my idea with a friend was

4019
03:09:01,290 --> 03:09:06,600
let's start a seed company called full

4020
03:09:03,899 --> 03:09:08,940
mount genetics and we'll just resell the

4021
03:09:06,601 --> 03:09:12,001
seeds that we personally have run and

4022
03:09:08,940 --> 03:09:14,640
made kick-ass hash with and that was the

4023
03:09:12,001 --> 03:09:17,700
basis of the concept of the seed idea

4024
03:09:14,640 --> 03:09:21,569
the seed bank well then the DEA

4025
03:09:17,700 --> 03:09:24,601
I just decided to step over sovereignty

4026
03:09:21,569 --> 03:09:25,469
laws and roll into Canada wearing

4027
03:09:24,601 --> 03:09:29,340
balaclavas

4028
03:09:25,469 --> 03:09:33,329
and abduct and arrest Marc Emery and

4029
03:09:29,340 --> 03:09:36,989
Michelle Rainey and Greg Greg Williams

4030
03:09:33,329 --> 03:09:39,569
it was it was pretty scary so needless

4031
03:09:36,989 --> 03:09:42,601
to say I quickly shut down the idea of

4032
03:09:39,569 --> 03:09:44,851
starting a seed bank here in Vancouver

4033
03:09:42,601 --> 03:09:49,010
and when they arrested mark they said

4034
03:09:44,851 --> 03:09:53,040
that he was one of the top 100 most

4035
03:09:49,010 --> 03:09:56,700
wanted criminals in the world he was the

4036
03:09:53,040 --> 03:09:59,040
only one I think from Canada and it was

4037
03:09:56,700 --> 03:10:01,500
like everyone else was like terrorists

4038
03:09:59,040 --> 03:10:03,510
and like the head of like like organized

4039
03:10:01,500 --> 03:10:05,431
criminal syndicates and like and then

4040
03:10:03,510 --> 03:10:07,260
they had like mark on his list

4041
03:10:05,431 --> 03:10:11,431
it was really crazy man and it was super

4042
03:10:07,260 --> 03:10:13,800
scary something Marcus back to bed at

4043
03:10:11,431 --> 03:10:16,409
that time if you were arrested and

4044
03:10:13,799 --> 03:10:21,390
convicted of manufacturing more than

4045
03:10:16,409 --> 03:10:23,060
10,000 plants or a hundred thousand it

4046
03:10:21,390 --> 03:10:29,579
was a million pounds

4047
03:10:23,060 --> 03:10:31,529
marijuana kingpin yes yeah it was a

4048
03:10:29,579 --> 03:10:33,149
million pounds and they hit that they

4049
03:10:31,530 --> 03:10:34,860
hit mark with that because right before

4050
03:10:33,149 --> 03:10:37,039
when they when they released the

4051
03:10:34,860 --> 03:10:39,960
announcement they claimed that his seeds

4052
03:10:37,040 --> 03:10:42,450
were responsible for over a million

4053
03:10:39,959 --> 03:10:44,609
pounds of cannabis produced in the US

4054
03:10:42,450 --> 03:10:47,311
and they use that number specifically

4055
03:10:44,610 --> 03:10:53,521
because is because it is the minimum

4056
03:10:47,310 --> 03:10:55,681
number in what I'm telling him still

4057
03:10:53,521 --> 03:10:57,300
like when Mark was supposed to be be

4058
03:10:55,681 --> 03:10:58,500
extradited and didn't know what was

4059
03:10:57,299 --> 03:11:00,299
gonna happen and he was like I'll just

4060
03:10:58,500 --> 03:11:03,959
take the rap for every one I'll get

4061
03:11:00,299 --> 03:11:05,549
Michele and Greg off and I'll go down

4062
03:11:03,959 --> 03:11:07,140
and do whatever I have to do and I was

4063
03:11:05,549 --> 03:11:08,939
just like I work for the magazine at

4064
03:11:07,140 --> 03:11:10,979
that time selling them just kind of

4065
03:11:08,940 --> 03:11:12,960
freelance but I was like you're just

4066
03:11:10,979 --> 03:11:14,699
gonna go you would just go down there's

4067
03:11:12,959 --> 03:11:15,839
like yeah just wouldn't let you know he

4068
03:11:14,700 --> 03:11:18,090
was like what just wouldn't look good if

4069
03:11:15,840 --> 03:11:20,460
I ran I'll just like face the music I

4070
03:11:18,090 --> 03:11:23,399
was like but it's like possibly the

4071
03:11:20,459 --> 03:11:25,799
death penalty like how do you go face

4072
03:11:23,399 --> 03:11:28,760
the death penalty like mark always was

4073
03:11:25,799 --> 03:11:29,909
kind of like all's to the wall

4074
03:11:28,760 --> 03:11:32,500
[Music]

4075
03:11:29,909 --> 03:11:35,351

4076

03:14:21,260 --> 03:14:24,530
dude whether it's a hash Church or

rebuilt and restructured the company in

4150
03:14:38,840 --> 03:14:43,220
2019 so 2020 is just building on what we

4151
03:14:41,569 --> 03:14:44,629
did last year and then you just fixed

4152

4154
03:14:51,440 --> 03:14:57,319
background I was actually researching

4155

Church we might just whip out to

4158
03:15:01,340 --> 03:15:06,530
Victoria and go see Jack Phillips who

4159
03:15:04,010 --> 03:15:09,380
was our guest last week who spoke about

4160
03:15:06,530 --> 03:15:11,329
the opioid crisis getting drug users off

4161
03:15:09,379 --> 03:15:13,939
of drugs by giving away free cannabis

4162
03:15:11,329 --> 03:15:16,310
and he sort of started this really cool
