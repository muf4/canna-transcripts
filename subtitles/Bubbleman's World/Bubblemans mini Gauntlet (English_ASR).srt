00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,759
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:28,480
uh haven't filmed a video for a few days

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,880
I released macro photographs from 2008

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,759
and I have 09 10 11 12 and 13 all sort

6
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:36,000
of cute but I didn't want to just shoot

7
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:39,839
a bunch of macro photographs all at once

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,320
so I figured today I would do some hits

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,079
um out of the sublimator which we have

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,558
right here the 2.0

11
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,799
XTR as well as the denail which we have

12
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,479
right here um plugged into the quartz

13
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:56,718
PUK and be bowl and it's in a bubble man

14
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,358
Edition rure kind of neat hav't hit one

15
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,359
of those I also pulled out my little uh

16
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,320
I guess they call this the was it a

17
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,920
peashooter they had a name for it I

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,239
can't remember uh Martin gave me this

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,240
pipe a couple of years ago at the

20
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:12,519
Cannabis Cup um had a little boo boo

21
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,399
broke the bistable but the way the down

22
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:18,679
stem fits on this one still works

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,079
perfectly so going to hit that one um

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,280
very nice gift got this gift from Nate

25
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:26,798
Dizzle when I brought him and Steve hops

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,640
to amster uh sorry met in Amsterdam we

27
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,159
brought them to Germany uh to link up

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,799
with Martin from rwer where they did

29
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,399
some collaborations uh that was very

30
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,840
nice of Nate to give me that pipe Steve

31
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,478
also gave me a little pipe that I would

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,040
love to have here doing this little

33
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:45,158
Gauntlet but unfortunately uh I smashed

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,840
that one just a few weeks ago uh also

35
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,359
last but finally not least uh the

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,280
Sheldon black which Richard gave me um

37
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:55,200
several years ago now uh from Amsterdam

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,239
and what is it the six arm pretty

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,280
straightforward little unit um thanks to

40
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:02,199
hippo for fixing this bistable cuz I

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,879
broke that about a year and a half ago

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,319
and of course I've got the Mother Ship

43
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:09,560
here ready to go uh with the XTR uh

44
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,039
actually what we should do is we'll show

45
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,959
you turning on all the units so um for

46
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,840
the denail which is right here this is

47
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,640
my custom bubble man version we've got

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,239
the remote control so simple as pushing

49
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,639
that little button is going to turn that

50
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:27,159
unit on that'll be up to temperature in

51
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,159
about 3 minutes um the XTR also has a

52
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,639
nice

53
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,799
little little guy we just just push that

54
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:36,399
little button the light goes

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,519
on and then we dial it in I'm going to

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,760
go for herb which is about a seven not

57
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,760
sure if you guys can see that right

58
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:44,679
there

59
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,120
but all right so very important once you

60
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,439
do turn the sublimator on never to uh as

61
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,319
well as the Dil for that matter these

62
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,840
are both hot units be very careful as

63
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,000
you're leaning over in any way dealing

64
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,039
with this units you just have to

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,639
remember that they're they're very hot

66
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:01,280
and that uh you can burn yourself if

67
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:07,279
you're not careful so I think while we

68
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,280
are waiting for the denil and

69
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:15,039
the sublimator to turn on I'm going to

70
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:18,319
turn on the Ember which is a wireless um

71
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:21,280
ceramic heater much like the herb iron

72
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:24,158
and that was gifted to me oh 3 or 4

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,158
years ago in Amsterdam as well so for

74
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,679
that I think we're going to hit some

75
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:30,120
seedsman hay bubble I've got a custom

76
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,799
stainless steel screen inserted into to

77
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,640
the um Lux Bowl which was also a gift

78
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,400
from Richard man lots of kind people out

79
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,958
there so I suspect for this we are going

80
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,000
to need a little

81
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,959
beine which I have many of right

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,080
here and a little lighter couple of

83
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,120
things I haven't needed for a

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,519
while but it just goes to show I got a

85
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,079
lot of people asking me what you prefer

86
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,319
this what you prefer I love it all I

87
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,840
love a quiver I get into things you know

88
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:00,798
when I first got my sublimator I used it

89
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,959
endlessly when I first my Dil I used it

90
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,079
endlessly when I first got the beine I

91
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,000
used it endlessly and now I'm using you

92
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,360
know right now I'm using basically the

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,120
last few days the sublimator in the

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,040
denail the sublimator is allowing me to

95
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,439
hit herb again which is great um I do

96
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,159
have a solo from ritzer which is another

97
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,319
cordless little vaporizer which is great

98
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,840
for hitting herb on the go but it

99
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:24,639
doesn't really give you that punch that

100
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:26,839
the sublimator will give you pretty much

101
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,280
every time

102
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,519
so light the old beine with the

103
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,478
greenhouse lighter let's get this

104
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,478
Gauntlet started shall

105
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,478
we all

106
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,160
right always nice to start a gauntlet

107
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:05,120
with some mind melding sativa seedsman

108
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:08,960
Hayes um bubble hash often is the

109
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,879
best in around the 45 to 73 Micron this

110
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:15,918
particular batch that I just hit uh is a

111
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:18,279
45 Micron one of my favorites so let's

112
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,799
see um the denail will be hitting now I

113
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:23,359
think we're going to go with the

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,680
denail let's keep it

115
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,879
sativa and let's go

116
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,360
rip some great Gardener sweet skunk this

117
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,600
is dry sift that I cleaned up a few

118
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,840
weeks back it was extremely beautiful

119
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,600
dry sift even through a single screen I

120
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,638
managed to clean it up a little bit and

121
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,759
make it a little bit more beautiful so

122
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,879
this will also be my first denail rip

123
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,520
out of pretty much anything other than a

124
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,918
Mothership so looking forward to hitting

125
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,918
my custom rure

126
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:05,439
all right using the quartz carb cap as

127
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:12,399
well oh man The Taste on that quite

128
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:20,800
nice all right so we did the beine we

129
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:21,918
did the um D now let's hit an ember rip

130
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,478

131
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:28,639

132
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:32,120
Bubba cush bubble and we're going to go

133

140
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,960
stainless steel onto this as well get

141
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,680

144
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,439
bong just having the bman rure in my

145
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:12,878
hand which funny enough this is a bman

146
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:16,279
rure as well it it has my logo etched

147
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,360
into the back which you can kind of see

148
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:20,318
there this one's got it in the front

149
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,560
it's my color sequence red gold and

150
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,919
green all right let's see what we got

151
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,038
here just turned on the

152
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:28,639
Ember as I was going to hit the first

153
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,719
bowl with it and I I realized I wanted

154
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,120
to do the be line first first so beine

155
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,280
denail and now we're going to Ember up

156
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,519
once that gets nice and red hot for us

157
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:41,318
so it's got a blue light that's half red

158
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,240
and once it goes full red uh that's

159
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,639
generally where you see the tip of the

160
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,079
ceramic turn orange I can see it

161
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,079
happening

162
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:53,000
now oh this is great still got a few

163
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,000
more pipes to rip looking forward to the

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,560
sublimator herb hit I'm going to do both

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,918
a sublimator herb and a full melt bubble

166
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,918
rip here we

167
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,479
go for

168
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,040
ooho that was pretty special really

169
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,360
grabbed me by the back of the

170
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:17,120
throat it's quite amazing how different

171
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,800
each one of those hips were from the

172
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:25,240
combustion with the flame to the denail

173
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:25,240
rip with the quartz Bowl to the Ember

174
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:32,559
rip and then the sublimator

175
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:35,000
oh yes I think that sublimator will be

176
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,000
up to

177
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:41,239
[Music]

178
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,200
Temp oh yeah so generally with the

179
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,120
sublimator to actually get it to work

180
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,480
this is

181
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,720
important when you put it in the bowl

182
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,519
heating the bowl is part of the process

183
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,240
you can't really get sublimator rips

184
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,600
with a cold Bowl heating up the bowl to

185
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,200
the temperature that the nail or the

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,000
wand or whatever you want to call the

187
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,839
unit is very important and this is

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,360
something that you learn pretty quickly

189
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,000
so I've got two types of herb here I've

190
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,680
got if you can imagine some UBC chemo

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,958
and some rock star from Remo from it's

192
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,439
got to be a month and a half ago when I

193
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,000
went there the first time and shared

194
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,839
with you a video and then I've also got

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,519
some really beautiful it's one of John's

196
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,279
kushes this one's just

197
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,120
purple and both of these because I get

198
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,879
given herb all the time and I don't

199
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,278
really um

200
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,838
I don't smoke it um I basically often

201
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,439
give it away when I came across the

202
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,240
sublimator I started saving it my

203
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,760
sublimator uh I sent it back for the new

204
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,680
version and I've been waiting so I had I

205
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,000
wasn't using cannabis so basically this

206
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,638
cannabis became very dry which in my

207
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,039
opinion is generally pretty good for

208
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,480
vaporization you don't really want moist

209
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,159
herb I find even when the sublimator

210
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,120
isn't giving me that first real RightWay

211
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,559
rip it's generally because there's too

212
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,440
much moisture left in the herb

213
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,719
so we will grind it up with one of

214
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,800
John's

215
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,800
medtainers don't see me do that very

216
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,278
often I feel bad I've never really been

217
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,399
able to promote this little product of

218
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:15,278
John's and uh it's not because I dislike

219
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,399
it it's just that I've never used it for

220
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:21,600
anything other than to carry like stacks

221
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,639
of hash in so now that's all changing so

222
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,759
why don't we start with

223
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,159
John it's quite

224
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:31,240
simple sure won't need to do much to

225
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,240
powder that herb

226
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,639
all

227
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,639
right I use the tool that unrio

228
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:52,360
supplies to stuff the herb down a little

229
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:55,159
bit if you it's very fluffy so if you

230
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,560
leave it sit this goes into the bowl a

231
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,919
fair distance and I've seen people do

232
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:02,119
this as well where they push the top of

233
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,919
the sublimator down onto the herb and it

234
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,959
can potentially cause a little bit of

235
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,958
burning so here we

236
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,480
go oh my

237
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:27,439
goodness can't even really describe the

238
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,959
subtle differences and nuances that

239
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,399
you'll feel when you hit a sublimator

240
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:34,679
for the first time

241
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,559
um there's just something different

242
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,359
there there's something a little bit

243
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,838
more than what the the other

244
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:45,120
vaporization companies have come up

245
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,120
with it's just a really nice

246
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,000
taste packed with a really great hit

247
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,879
this is how much I put in this little

248
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:12,879
bud

249

00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:50,759
right

252
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:52,758
there a little tiny nugget has me

253
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,839
hacking more than all those beautiful

254
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:58,839
bowls

255
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,839
P you

256
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:07,949
