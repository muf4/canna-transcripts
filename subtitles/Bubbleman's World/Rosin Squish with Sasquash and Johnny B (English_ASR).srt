2
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:32,579
hey bubble man here I'm here with Johnny

3
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:34,530
[ __ ] hey guys welcome to bubbleman's

4
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,429
world I'm here with Johnny B and we're

5
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,109
about to get our squish on so what do

6
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,299
you got first there Johnny B I got some

7
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,820
Teflon Teflon how many grams well

8
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,769
there's six six grams six grams in case

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,929
you don't believe us what I'm looking at

10
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,550
is because this is like birthday stuff

11
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,829
birthday squish stuff but birthdays I

12
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:55,069
got I bought some weed from the best

13
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,780
place in Sunrise so I could squish it

14
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:00,058
well let us not waste another second and

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,849
I pull the ground once good open let us

16
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,849
open the plates and squish the rosin

17
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:11,489
[Music]

18
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,670
okay so we're gonna go for four grams

19
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:15,839
this is of the Teflon epsilon all right

20
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,680
let's see if we can get a little closer

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,978
to that Teflon

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:25,860
oh man that smell is so good even as we

23
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:28,019
were outside now a little bit of better

24
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,670
light and for those of you that are

25
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,069
complaining about the trim job I'll tell

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,079
you that a the little trim like that

27
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:36,389
will hold resin onto the plant from

28
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,459
underneath and the calyxes but also you

29
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,099
can see that the leaf itself is covered

30
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,750
in resin as well so you know leaving it

31
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,539
there is not gonna be a problem what's

32
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,599
that - uh we're gonna squish it all all

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,600
right let's smash these two buzz

34
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,599
smashing

35
00:01:51,469 --> 00:02:41,370
and definitely not touching this if you

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:48,810
did now we use my ear to listen so we

37
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:51,989
call the ear tech you can hear it using

38
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,810
I can hear it using so as you're slowly

39
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:56,099
pushing on the plates its extracting

40
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,670
that register and that when we hit it

41
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,090
too hard

42
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:01,798
it's squashes him well the bonus to was

43
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,180
I had the but on the plates a little bit

44
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:04,920
and that would have melted the resin

45
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,140
just while it was sitting on the open

46
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,268
plates while I was filling up the PSI in

47
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:14,089
the air compressor we do that with hash

48
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:14,090
as well go this long

49
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:38,500
that's real hot

50
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:40,358
what a lovely press mission a lovely

51
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,209
squish on that you can see the quality

52
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:45,010
is just spectacular tiny tiny little

53
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:47,979
flake and contaminant right there but

54
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:51,489
we'll get rid of that and we'll go

55
00:03:47,979 --> 00:04:01,358
collect this and see what kind of weight

56
00:03:51,489 --> 00:04:02,919
we got on it well we got to be careful

57
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:05,709
with this I want to take it in actually

58
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,769
it's so brittle I don't want it to I

59
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:17,769
don't want to lose any of your valuable

60
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:20,259
resin yeah much better already in a

61
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:25,269
sense that sorry for blocking it with my

62
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:27,639
hand it's definitely no fun but however

63
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:30,609
I can get it off of course we want it

64
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,079
off as fast as we can get it off I don't

65
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:38,250
like leaving it on for any amount of

66
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:38,250
time changes gets stickier

67
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,189
see now the beautiful thing is is when

68
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:52,870
we know our our numbers and what we know

69
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:57,520
what we should get off for grams if you

70
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:59,680
don't see it we can go back and hit that

71
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:04,079
again exactly Rhys wish it again until

72
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,079
we do see that return that we are

73
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:44,769
definitely easy Purdy

74
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:44,769
[Applause]

75
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:51,569
now we know what those wet half a gram

76
00:05:52,168 --> 00:06:02,848
as you can see you guys zero

77
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:06,218
booyah point six six point six probably

78
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:07,628
two maybe maybe another point two in

79
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:12,959
there though let's squish it and go find

80
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:12,960
out so we've got a point seven so far so

81
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:24,098
point seven on that little guy and we're

82
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:28,028
gonna restore and how we do that is

83
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:29,129
simply we fold it and then we fold it

84
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:32,790
again

85
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:35,850
and I usually fold it one more time once

86
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:38,129
I have something like that I'll throw it

87
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:44,310
back into the parchment a little over to

88
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:51,779
the side from where I hit it before all

89
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:53,540
right get that in there hey you can go

90
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:58,759
in the side yep perfect just like that

91
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,760
go in and then let's close

92
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:46,899
I can hear it me as well it's just not

93
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:48,490
that idea of it recording yes okay so

94
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,138
here we go is the second squish you can

95
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,519
see a lot more contaminant in the middle

96
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:54,720
you're gonna want to be careful with how

97
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:57,399
you collect it but we've got a nice cold

98
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,290
environment here I won't be able to

99
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,689
collect it all here it's just you can

100
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,689
see it just shattering but getting it

101
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:06,459
cold and then taking it in the house and

102
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:27,159
collecting it there will make life a lot

103
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:29,560
easier just trying to stay as you know

104
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,918
get as close as possible but not so

105
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,889
close that I actually get any of the

106
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:38,049
nasty dirtiness on there because you can

107
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:43,080
see the serious difference between the

108
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:43,079
beautiful resin and contaminant

109
00:08:47,269 --> 00:09:01,039
see the cold situation all right so I'll

110
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:02,958
get another one of these out we'll see

111
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,490
we got our Betty we get that point one

112
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,489
or point two that I was talking about

113
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:15,289
[Music]

114
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:17,958
I'll just put it on this one here which

115
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:21,259
is this is something that Dom mentioned

116
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,849
the other day at sunrise that you can

117
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:24,528
you know some people without when they

118
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,450
don't use the screen they'll then take

119
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:28,039
the rosin at a much lower temperature

120
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:31,209
and push it through a screen to remove

121
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:33,588
any contaminants that they find

122
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:35,239
yeah that's I've seen it done a lot of

123
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,980
people think someone's pressing rosin

124
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,070
and tons is coming out and it's so

125
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:44,839
there's point eight for exactly what I

126
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:48,740
said basically 20 times and it's even

127
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:51,320
flickering at point nine nice so very

128
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:55,669
good for four grams and there is your

129
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:58,278
four grams so that's not too shabby

130
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:59,899
right I think that's pretty fantastic so

131
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:01,759
there's that right off you have four

132
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,519
grams of butter roughly and then you get

133
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,409
roughly almost a gram of rosin so you're

134
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,588
four times a bud that costs you roughly

135
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:12,319
$40 is now almost we're looking at

136
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:15,290
almost exactly a gram that cost roughly

137
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,640
seventy eighty dollars so a 40 gram by

138
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:21,379
God you $80 worth of resin well you know

139
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,409
the end in a sense right the retail for

140
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:26,328
that resin is close to 80 bucks so the

141
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:28,278
quality would be roughly 180 it always a

142
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:30,559
couple other squishes they did I got you

143
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:32,480
yourself e right here Johnny me so

144
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,639
Johnny B is now going to he's seen me

145
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,539
operated he's paid attention this time

146
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:40,189
we gave him a few tips and back left

147
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:45,828
through you see the little liver lifted

148
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:47,029
up up up up more huh now down okay so

149
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:49,429
now you'll be able to fit the button

150
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:51,289
without hitting them on the plates so

151
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:53,389
get that in there okay ready

152
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:56,299
my first sound squash press there you go

153
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:58,470
John I'm really excited because April

154
00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:00,149
there you go there you go get that butt

155
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:05,629
in there all right now make sure that

156
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:05,629
levers down he was down and then gently

157
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:21,120
and then as it gets close real close

158
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:22,620
you'll hear it one click at a time now

159
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,810
give a couple seconds in between each

160
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:31,679
one to so it allows to get that heat in

161
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:34,239
there and it's I can hear it how do you

162
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:37,508
know when this like one more

163
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,509
[Music]

164
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:46,649
how's it sounding probably good on the

165
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:46,649
pressure now I think we're pretty good

166
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:56,470
like how does one last click - all right

167
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,970
don't open it too much cuz you just have

168
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:08,139
to use pressure to close it alright open

169
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:14,050
that up yeah really nice

170
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:15,399
cracks Johnny good job that's that's

171
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:19,990
good you'll be able to clean that up

172
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,669
pretty easy so close the plates boom and

173
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,379
then this I think it's just too high

174
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:25,269
quality you won't be able to collect it

175
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:27,778
but you'll be able to put it there for a

176
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,778
second or two

177
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:42,719
oh it looks beautiful doesn't it though

178
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:45,480
it does I'm super excited

179
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:50,450
I'm glad man you did a great press my

180
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:55,909
first breaths honey

181
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,910
they're done good you're done kids

182
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,899
first things first we're gonna go

183
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:02,549
through and just get rid of any tiny

184
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,860
little bit of contaminant that we can

185
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:06,359
see on the end of the dabber and then of

186
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,669
course to make sure that you take that

187
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,029
dabber and really make sure you clean it

188
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:11,610
up

189
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:14,159
also if you have a lot of contaminant in

190
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,960
your rosin don't clean up too much of it

191
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,029
at once or you'll create a larger

192
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,400
surface area at the end of your gabber

193
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:23,069
and you'll start picking up oil so I'm

194
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,709
Johnny B's cleaning it up there you

195
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,470
should be able to do it fast okay for me

196
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,940
I pull towards myself yeah the faster

197
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,970
the better and thicker areas especially

198
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,550
if it's not you know shattering like

199
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,040
cold like it was inside this is just

200
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:41,240
perfect I was gathering I do a lot of

201
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:43,860
rosin and this is like a perfect gather

202
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,440
just beautiful very easy to pull

203
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,970
together I was fine then I pull like

204
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,920
this if it's a wheely shattering but

205
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,750
this is just lovely you can link and

206
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,219
roll with it it's like perfect

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,110
temperature breakdown from being outside

208
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:59,129
