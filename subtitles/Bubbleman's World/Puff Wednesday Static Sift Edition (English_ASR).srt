12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,160
it's nice to see you or half of you yeah

13
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,398
it's nice to see half of johnny b he

14
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,558
used to be much uh more

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,480
he's less but in when you when johnny's

16
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,919
less he's still more

17
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,679
a lot more he's still more i think

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,600
there's more of me now that there's less

19
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,920

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,280
listen right off the bat this is a very

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,840
exciting video i've been waiting to do

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,000
this for a while now uh this is the

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,920
quintessential dry sift video we're

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,079
going to talk about uh the dry sift

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,400
wizards methodology that he uses with

26
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,719
the 60 and the 90 mesh that's awesome

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,799
we're going to talk about the um 200 and

28
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,798
the 110 which i've been showing for

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,799
quite a while with karting which kind of

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,640
became you know came into this static

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,560
thing with a dvd and some parchment

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,560
thanks to me's

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,159
then that kind of grew and people i

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,759
think jungle boys and some other people

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,400
were wrapping paint rollers and

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,118
parchments uh and then recently steven

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,200
marick uh from team dry sift was really

38
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,680
posting a lot on my facebook group about

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,359
this nitrile glove method and i i had

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,118
seen it over the last couple of years

41
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,200
just glimpses of the picture of the

42
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,799
glove with resin on it

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,519
someone had sent it to me on instagram

44
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,600
and

45
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,319
i never really thought much about it

46
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,478
uh and then lo and behold steven came on

47
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,438
to team dry sift and was really getting

48
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,799

this is four and a half months cure this

122
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,519
is proper hang dry this is no screwing

123
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,758
gun this is a slow

124
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,359
cure because when he talked about dry

125
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,879
sift and when i listened when the skunk

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,240
man sound was talking about how like the

127
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,959
three and four month cure was truly the

128
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,360
resin exactly shrinking the heads before

129
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,719
you go do the work or you do the work

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,439
exactly and it's kind of like you know

131
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,759
what and then you know things happen and

132
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,439
and uh you know flooding in abbotsford

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,040
and then i wind up hurting my back and

134
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,800
that's why they've been hanging for so

135
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,080
long but what perfect timing i think it

136
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,000
was meant to be

137
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,599
truly meant to be

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,959
on this strain here do you want to put

139
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
these ones away first so you have room

140
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,560
to pull those ones out

141
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,319
i don't want to we don't want to keep

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,079
them all so cold although it is nice and

143
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,439
cool out here like it's definitely not a

144
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,758
long day look at the box look at that

145
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,918
look at the first bounce in that box

146
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,840
see i know did you see that

147
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,879
isn't that amazing oh my god i looked at

148
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,239
that and i'm like that's why i put them

149
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,600
in these brand new boxes guys

150
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,560
but i mean

151
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,639
it's like

152
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,478
first bounce is just the most amazing

153
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,079
and you can see how that happens there

154
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,038
so we're gonna get these going but you

155
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,000
can just see

156
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,439
lots of good resin coming off of these

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,439
oh yeah

158
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,439

00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,399
that's more pink goo

169
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,839
and that looks like some more pink goo

170
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,800
smells delicious

171
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,318
and

172
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,719
this is going to be animal cookies so

173
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,000
you can see the color of it and the

174
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,000
difference though so it's the cookies

175
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,560
cross with that

176
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,079
this was a bc bud depot run so it's an

177
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,079
animal cookies from bc bud depot

178
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,079
i can definitely see that there you can

179
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,240
just see how that is now this has got a

180
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,159
real creamy flavor to it but this this

181
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,160
pink goo and the media as you can see in

182
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,919
that biscotti cake is stacked are those

183
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,439
the ones you're most excited to process

184
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,879
i'm really excited we'll start with

185
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,639
those because we're gonna have to trim

186
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,879
these down get the buds off break the

187
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,199
buds down do the sifting

188
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,879
um and we'll kind of break it down into

189
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,720
into components we may get to all of

190
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,240
them but we'll definitely do the top two

191
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,880
so what i did was those first ones that

192
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,400
i i did trim they just this is the first

193
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,680
mouse that fell underneath so this can

194
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,839
actually be cleaned up already but

195
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,560
that's first bounce sitting there

196
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:26,159
so that would be the first bounce and um

197
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,160
yeah it was underneath the screen

198
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,840
all right so uh yeah i was out actually

199
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,360
looking for a small 250 micron

200
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,198
round

201
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,960
because that's nice when we when we go

202
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,720
through this process and they'll we can

203
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,000
do the redistribution naturally through

204
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,879
the 100 um 110 lines per inch which is

205
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,879
about a 150 to 160 micron and this is

206
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,759
the very simple process that most people

207
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,520
know you use your first screen this 110

208
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,879
mesh or lpi

209
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:59,198
which is about 150 to 160 microns that's

210
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,000
the screen that the flower won't go

211
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,000
through but most of the other stuff will

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,038
the bottom screen which is a 200 lines

213
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,478
per inch or mesh which is 70 microns the

214
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:09,839
magic screen that's the one we're going

215
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,519
to catch the good stuff on that's the

216
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,318
one we're going to do this nitro glove

217
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,159
trick on but before we start that i

218
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,840
wanted to talk a little bit about the 60

219
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,080
and the 90.

220
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,839
this is an old process from california i

221
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,079
believe

222
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,839
i'm not exactly sure who told the dry

223
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,680
sift wizard the process but i heard it

224
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,839
was a guy in california

225
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,598
um so the tricep wizard shared this

226
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,120
technique with me quite some time ago

227
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,399
you can see a piece sticking out right

228
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,440
there do you see that it was just

229
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,599
sticking straight out and that's

230
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,839
interesting because this process

231
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,000
are very large screen holes very

232
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,959
different from this um

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,679
160 micron to 70 micron this is actually

234
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:50,319
a 250 micron on top you can see through

235
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:53,519
this and or sorry on the bot on the top

236
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,879
and then on the bottom you have a 250.

237
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,959
it's actually should be reversed it

238
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,200
should be the 250 on top

239
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,518
and the 180 on the bottom

240
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
so i believe that's how i have it

241
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,519
90 is

242
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,800
one's not marked in the 90s yeah the 60

243
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,959
is the 250 and it's on the bottom

244
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,479
and the 180s on the top i think we need

245
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,319
to reverse these

246
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,680
this process i haven't done for a while

247
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
and so i don't want to get it wrong

248
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:20,199
[Music]

249
00:09:21,440 --> 00:18:44,719
this um

250
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,679
like this

251
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,399
there we go and so

252
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,838
what happens is everything falls through

253
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,080
the 250

254
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,560
lands on the 180 underneath and

255
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,720
i guess the heads go through

256
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,319
and land on the bottom but on the 180

257
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,240
screen you see these little like it

258
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,160
looks like little trees that are planted

259
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,440
in the screen it's a neat process we're

260
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,199
not going to do it here today but i can

261
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,279
explain it to you very simply you're

262
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,120
going to take some nice dry material

263
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:54,799
toss it across the top screen i would

264
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,959
have this screen flip the other way but

265
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,879
we don't have the risers right now that

266
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,399
way when it's like this it protects the

267
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,000
flower on the inside and it's not going

268
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,679
to kind of end up all around your

269
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,720
wherever you're working your workspace

270
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,399
is so this process is a very quick

271
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,160
first bounce process where you just

272
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,399
throw some material on you don't

273
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,838
manipulate it or work it hard in any way

274
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,200
shape or form

275
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,120
the heads are going to fall straight

276
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,040
through the contaminant falls through

277
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,120
like this and it gets stuck in the holes

278
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,360
of the big screen on the bottom and you

279
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,159
end up with these it looks like a like a

280
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,399
little area of trees miniature trees or

281
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,199
something so very cool process these

282
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,120
screens are available at

283
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,120
freshheadies.com and bubblebag.com

284
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,720
um but really the ones we're going to be

285
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,120
using today

286
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,800
are the 110 and the 200. and we

287
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,440
mentioned earlier how it you know the

288
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,039
history uh leading up to stephen sharing

289
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,320
this process as well as a couple of

290
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,159
other people i wish i could remember

291
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,640
their names that were sharing it on

292
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,480
instagram shout out to you guys as well

293
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,559
and this is a very simple process where

294
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,039
you're doing the static process that we

295
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:59,359
learned with the dvd and the parchment

296
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,958
except what we learn is that the

297
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,079
particles will all become charged in the

298
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,239
static

299
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,399
buildup of i guess us touching the

300
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,320
screen and doing circular motions or

301
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,360
whatever

302
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,640
and so

303
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,120
um

304
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,600
you need more than just that you also

305
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,879
need the pressure of your hand and i'm

306
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,240
going to show you guys the whole process

307
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,480
here in a bit we'll start breaking up

308
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,159
some of these flowers break them up ju

309
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,320
however johnny likes and then we'll lift

310
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,559
up this this top we're just crushing it

311
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,680
yeah whatever we'll crush them up crush

312
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,599
them all out

313
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,359
like we're just whatever like there's no

314
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
like boom let's crush it whatever we

315
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,519
have underneath we can do the process

316
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,879
for and see what kind of piles we can

317
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,879
end up with see what kind of a melt

318
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,879
factor we can end up with

319
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:43,838
that's what i'm mostly interested in um

320
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,958
so yeah

321
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
for me

322
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,239
this is not about first bounce this is

323
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,838
fresh plants but like we said we're

324
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,000
gonna eliminate the first bounce and

325
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,519
just completely crush it this time

326
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,839
so it's like chucking these plants on

327
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,519
there

328
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,639
and so we got two plots in there my

329
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,720
friend

330
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,120
yes so you just want to do one cultivar

331
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,440
at a time so

332
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,399
now we do have these scissors that you

333
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,920
can get from your basic um kids drawer

334
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,240
yes that's where we pulled those out

335
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,519
from all right so this here as you can

336
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,720
see this is just garbage that's all the

337
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,039
biscotti

338
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,040
cake all right so you can smell it

339
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,039
and it's definitely got um

340
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,079
it's got some nice resin production

341
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,560
there going on

342
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,638
you know what

343
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:36,000
i don't know what's best about this

344
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,000
tell me is in reality

345
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,599
you know what this is not how you should

346
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,199
do this

347
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,720
if you're going to be saving these buds

348
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,000
but we're actually collecting all this

349
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,320
resin so

350
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,240
i thought the scissors was a great idea

351
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,040
until i did one cut like that and i'm

352
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,320
like what are we doing

353
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,639
isn't that easier

354
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,720
that was a lot easier check this out

355
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,000
and always go towards not behind if you

356
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,839
go towards you're just going to come up

357
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,120
very

358
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,560
easily can see the resin just like pile

359
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,720
it's nice and dry

360
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,638
so it is properly cured this is four

361
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,320
month cure this came in here it was if

362
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,519
you saw the humidity levels on it so

363
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,360
it's really nice and i'm pulling this

364
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,000
apart and i can feel how juicy is in the

365
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,240
middle there because that's just like

366
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
wow

367
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,680
dude there'll be a lot more resin on

368
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,240
this what i would suggest after we do

369
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,039
this is let this material dry out much

370
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,200
more

371
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,958
and then uh and then we can get uh you

372
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,519
can get cause there's it's still got

373
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,679
some freshness to it you know oh yeah

374
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,440
i'm just like wow

375
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,359
beautiful material i just don't want to

376
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,000
break heads

377
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,000
i just want them to kind of fall off

378
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,360
yes

379
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,600
so there's a few here that were nice and

380
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,600
clean but like the inside of that is

381
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,199
oh it's beautiful

382
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,320
i think with the best part about this is

383
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:56,159
actually you would put it on the screen

384
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,600
like that yeah let it sit loose the

385
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,759
temperature out right now it's nice and

386
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,278
cold it's dry give it a couple minutes

387
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,879
it'll dry right out again because then

388
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,799
when you get that weed in your front

389
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,879
joint you go use the bathroom and you

390
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,479
come back with a little bit too dry

391
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,240
right so i mean right now because it

392
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,399
just came apart with me freshly in these

393
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,759
boxes let's see this box under here for

394
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,839
this nesting we're gonna open it up so

395
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,439
we

396
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,000
more packed with a really nice dry

397
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,000
because get

398
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,839
humidity but i guess a little bit in the

399
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,440
box because the boxes are closed it's

400
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,040
more cheering again so we're actually

401
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,000
sweating the weed out you have these

402
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,919
stalks right so this is like a constant

403
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,440
support system of moisture for the

404
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,120
flowers and this is what's being so nice

405
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,279
about this long cure being able to keep

406
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,600
those stalks at that level so

407
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,399
i mean if this was bone dry this would

408
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
dump

409
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,519
so hard

410
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,600
and we would have all of this resin off

411
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,360
in a very short period of time

412
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,278
but it's very fresh i didn't realize

413
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,199
quite how fresh it is so we're going to

414
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,879
kind of play it by ear

415
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,479
we'll leave it sit for a little bit see

416
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,480
if we can't get it a little more crispy

417
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,120
because it's it's very like marshmallowy

418
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,278
it's just after four months cure to boot

419
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,278
yeah it's really nice i don't like i'm

420
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,120
just like i'm blown with how how the

421
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,320
center of this is so perfect dude i'm

422
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,000
blown

423
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,680
like i'm really blown oh i'm right in

424
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,759
the middle of it look at that

425
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,439
yeah yeah i'm just because i'm i'm

426
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,720
actually surprised i thought this was

427
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,160
just going to crush really nicely over

428
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,560
the screen so it's nice and dry in the

429
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,000
room it was sitting around the 57

430
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,919
percent and then it went dropping down

431
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
to 46 there for about an hour or two and

432
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,198
i put the boxes abroad in here

433
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,440
so uh

434
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,198
i'm excited to see what it dumps

435
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,519
yeah me too

436
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,479
well what we can do is just to protect

437
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,120
it from

438
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,600
any kind of debris or

439
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,039
let's put it out like that

440
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,399
and we'll be back in a bit

441
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,799
all right so we're just going to collect

442
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,919
this herb it dried out a substantial bit

443
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,758
more but there is a ton of resin on this

444
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,679
flower right now and i'm sure john's

445
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,680
getting out the resin that is just

446
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,000
sitting off of the flower mixed in with

447
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,239
the plant matter but there's also

448
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,399
popcorn size nuggets that are absolutely

449
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,399
completely coated in resin so i think

450
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,000
ideally we'll wait for this material to

451
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,799
get much drier

452
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,720
then he can grind it up down into a much

453
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,719
finer powder

454
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,480
and do this process because with this

455
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,079
nitrile glove process

456
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,240
you can be a lot more um

457
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,799
rough with the material knowing that you

458
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,720
have a methodology of cleaning it out

459
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,838
that's um you know much quicker than

460
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,839
that dvd case

461
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,879
okay so that actually we've waited

462
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,120
another 10 or so minutes and that

463
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,639
actually kind of worked in our favor

464
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,879
broke it down a little bit more and kind

465
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,720
of ground it gently on the screen very

466
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,399
very gently i was like screw this [ __ ]

467
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,839
man let's get this resin off dude let's

468
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,399
get it off so what we're gonna do now is

469
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,839
we're gonna take all the flour off of

470
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,600
the screen

471
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,440
uh get it into its bag because this

472
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,639
flower has a lot more resin i mean john

473
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,639
was just saying oh i could roll this

474
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,079
into joints and share it with friends

475
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,720
have giveaways and stuff and it would

476
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,559
certainly be very decent joints even

477
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,560
with what's cute look at the resin on

478
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,239
here but there's a ton of resin like you

479
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,240
you die for this someone said here you

480
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,038
want this to be like i'll take this [ __ ]

481
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,038
do you want to grab the bag

482
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,720
so we're just making sure any

483
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,720
heads that are stuck to the bottom of

484
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,480
the screen there

485
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,318
dude

486
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,319
yeah that looks good

487
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,558
okay so let's keep it protected until

488
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:35,038
i'm prepared he's like that looks good

489
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,440
i'm like that looks more than good

490
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,038
it looks quite lovely

491
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,720
so we'll get a nitrile glove on here

492
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,400
let's hope that this glove is all

493
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,240
operational on the good side i'm gonna

494
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,038
get right out of the thumb so i can't

495
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,038
like block it yeah i'm going to

496
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,359
wipe this

497
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,960
the reason i do that is

498
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,399
is this is

499
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,319
cold metal

500
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,400
so i'll actually keep my hand on the

501
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,359
cold metal just to bring it down a

502
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,880
degree or two so it's not the warm hand

503
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,439
nice

504
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,440
that's a great idea some people won't be

505
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,558
able to do this process and some will so

506
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,798
we've done a single screen dry sift here

507
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,160
um we're now gonna i actually i'd be

508
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:15,759
remiss if i didn't show you with the

509
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,320
camera so if you want to lift that

510
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,480
screen gently for me johnny b

511
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,480
um i'll come over with this and give

512
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,279
them the view of the diamonds across the

513
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,798
screen right now

514
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,399
so you can see there's contaminant in

515
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,798
there as well

516
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,559
it looks like little stems inside the

517
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:36,240
resin

518
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,240
but we're going to get rid of all that

519
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,759
all right looks really good johnny b

520
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,639
thumbs up

521
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,640
thumbs up

522
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,240
okay

523
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,480
so

524
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,279
cool that glove a little bit more

525
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,720
cooling down the glove

526
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,399
and then i'll get you to pick this up

527
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,279
and just maybe put it over to the side

528
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,960
old hand on the on the nitro glove and

529
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,678
literally just doing like circular

530
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,480
motions to pick up as much of this resin

531
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,519
as possible there's tiny little bits

532
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,038
of contaminant which i just saw move the

533
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,119
resin doesn't move but the little bits

534
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,919
of contaminant move in the in the minor

535
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,599
wind yeah the mining

536
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,600
i'm watching it i'm like i'm just like

537
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,719
staring at it right all right here we go

538
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,719
i think i'm gonna give it a go

539
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,079
see

540
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,599
heads

541
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,079
um

542
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,240
okay with the thought eh

543
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,480
see the difference and now how it looks

544
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,480
yeah

545
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:06,599
oops

546
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,599
make sure you stay wherever you belong

547
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,480
so that's all heads now

548
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,279
yep

549
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,879
i can see just like all going over here

550
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,359
which is like people

551
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,360
but i mean

552
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,158
clumping a little bit which is not ideal

553
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,559
and now probably because of the heat

554
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,640
right now right yeah

555
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:39,038
but we can collect those as its own

556
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,038
grade

557
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,200
now i used to do something would you

558
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,880
change the global maybe at some point i

559
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,159
would change it right now because we see

560
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,840
that when we're doing with the with

561
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,520
within with parts we go a little longer

562
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,519
we start doing that and i see

563
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,679
exactly

564
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,079
yeah i don't think we'll be able to do

565
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,038
too much more because of these clumps

566
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,918
yeah

567
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:03,919
so we'll uh

568
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,000
be good if we had a clean card like i'm

569
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,079
really happy with the amount of resin

570
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,159
from that right now and then that quick

571
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,158
clean that i would normally spend

572
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,640
ah at least 20 minutes half an hour

573
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,559
doing only took about a second

574
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,960
it was pretty quick it only took a

575
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:20,960
second

576
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,720
it really did only take a second didn't

577
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,879
it yeah

578
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,360
it was kind of nice here these jars

579
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,799
actually came from horatio he gave me

580
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,319
these but he's kind of here with us

581
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:39,599
right now nice do you want to throw some

582
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,720
of this in there that's why i pulled

583
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,319
them out

584
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,839
probably a good idea get that in there

585
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,839
and out of the sun

586
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,279
i got like right away i was okay let's

587
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,279
get that out of there

588
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,159
if you saw that face

589
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,159
like

590
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,280
no i i would i just it is like like the

591
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,399
best first balance of the world right

592
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,038
now

593
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,519
johnny b

594
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:17,519
with the fresh first pounds

595
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,440
all right so here's a couple of batches

596
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,359
for you

597
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,759
this is the seconds and this is the

598
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,199
first oops

599
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,480
you know what's best about that we just

600
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,640
talked about that

601
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,880
that's this is the thing with heads and

602
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,400
you can just clean them up like never

603
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,159
feel that oh

604
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,559
i spilt them and they're all dirty it's

605
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,880
like get them back onto your screen

606
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:46,158
do the process again if you feel that

607
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,960
there's some oh i'm sure this one okay

608
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,440
i can see that you can clean that up

609
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,880
whatever you like

610
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,640
so you know what's gonna be important is

611
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,919
the type of glove too because there are

612
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,679
gonna be different i like the black

613
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,919
these gloves that i have are terrible

614
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,240
yeah yeah this is not the glove

615
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,799
you want nitrile not spelt with a y

616
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,720
first of all i like the black ones and i

617
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,798
use them at my um

618
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,839
at my facility and they really work

619
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:11,759
great

620
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,759
um yeah it's i've never used it myself

621
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,200
but i know that the black one we can try

622
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,319
it i'm just curious

623
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,840
for sure

624
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,798
make sure you mark your resins and put

625
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,158
them away and uh yeah we'll get to uh

626
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,240
the next bounce all right so what you

627
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,520
cutting up there johnny b some ping poo

628
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,960
thank you

629
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,558
some pink goo

630
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,640
thank you maybe we'll come check it out

631
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:31,678
with you real quick see how nice this is

632
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,400
i'm going to get rid of some of these

633
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,440
bigger families on here yeah but i mean

634
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,120
they're nice

635
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,600
where'd you get this cultivar from um

636
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:42,000
this actually came from um i'm gonna say

637
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,000
the fraser valley okay that's what i'd

638
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,599
be saying little fraser valley dank

639
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,960
razor valley tank that's where all the

640
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,798
fire comes from you're looking for that

641
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,159
gas you know where it finds all right

642
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:51,519
well we'll be back when all this is

643
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,360
broken up

644
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,440
well john's just doing the final touches

645
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,959
on this pink goo and uh you'll notice

646
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,960
that he doesn't have gloves on because

647
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,798
this is his medicine and he loves to get

648
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,798
his hands dirty he loves to smell the

649
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,879
herb he loves to feel the resin and

650
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,798
taste the resin you can feel the

651
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,320
you can actually see the difference from

652
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,079
the form of cure like you're saying and

653
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,839
they're where the raisins they're

654
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,278
they're just so

655
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,839
absolutely you can see with that last

656
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,400
stump too even the bees are coming up

657
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,000
yep remember doing this at champs

658
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,000
johnny's just picking up the last oh

659
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,880
yeah i remember the video charlie's just

660
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,880
picking up the last of the uh the flower

661
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,760
here then we're gonna lift up and we're

662
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,760
gonna show you what is on top of the

663
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,759
200.

664
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,880
okay guys there was uh some noise that

665
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,240
ended up happening which is funny

666
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,320
because when we first went to start the

667
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,960
video there was like three digger

668
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,798
machines banging and moving rocks but it

669
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,880
somehow miraculously stopped when we

670
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,879
started now it seems like someone's leaf

671
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,960
blowing and then the wind and then the

672
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,640
wind is also like

673
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,360
absolutely bonkers so we came inside to

674
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,120
do this i've been holding on to the um

675
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,000
ice pack here getting my hand nice and

676
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,239
cold

677
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,400
getting prepared yes cold is good we can

678
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,079
remove this top screen if you like i

679
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,120
actually don't need this and then what i

680
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,759
was going to do is put the camera down

681
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:13,558
on the actual screen instead of on us so

682
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,558
i'll do that right now

683
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,679
a little closer

684
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:28,080
[Music]

685
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:30,880
and then straight down like that

686
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:30,879
looks proper

687
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,400
it looks proper

688
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,720
okay so i'm gonna try the different

689
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,480
glove this time

690
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,480
the green nitrile glove

691
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,158
it feels good it feels better than the

692
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,159
other glove i'll be honest that glove

693
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,919
had a lot of ridges in it yeah that the

694
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,360
resin was getting stuck in because this

695
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,200
one i can tell already does it's nice

696
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,519
and tight yeah exactly you want a really

697
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,000
nice tight glove oh yeah that's

698
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:00,319
important guys okay so just cooling my

699
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,240
hand with the glove right now

700
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:05,759
and we'll see how this goes no it's not

701
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,759
moist at all it's totally dry nice

702
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,919
i can feel it doing the thing that i

703
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:15,360
don't want it to do

704
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,360
balling but look at that

705
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,359
yeah falling if we can get those little

706
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,519
balls picked up

707
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,519
and removed that would be amazing

708
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,918
because it's definitely so i think what

709
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,599
you do is as a colder room

710
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,120
yeah exactly just do it

711
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,480
already this is really high quality

712
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,639
resin too we're just trying to get the

713
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,720
message out i'm gonna do a bunch more of

714
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,080
these videos hello

715
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,360
and uh

716
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,038
and as you can see how i'm doing this

717
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,479
you do it like carting over as he's

718
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:43,759
doing that and you can actually pull

719
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,759
those heads out as you can see what i

720
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,000
was doing here so and it's actually why

721
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,839
i use the 250 is because if it was

722
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,359
way past you know even being able to do

723
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,519
what you're trying to do we could

724
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,079
collect all of this resin pour it

725
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:58,798
through the 250 gently

726
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,000
you know like flour mill it back onto

727
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:01,759
the screen

728
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,519
and uh

729
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,440
be in great shape that way look at the

730
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,038
color on that by the way look at that

731
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,240
wow

732
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:11,759
just beautiful yeah really nice

733
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,919
so yeah i guess it's going to be kind of

734
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:17,038
more of the heat in here

735
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,038
yeah exactly so we'll make sure we go

736
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,720
as cold as possible as again any any

737
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,558
little bits you see

738
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,558
that around that you can just even pick

739
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,759
up glasses hey check this stuff out guys

740
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:27,918
i have this here

741
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,919
you get some glasses i have some glasses

742
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,200
there you go they probably can't see it

743
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,159
because right now it's right on the

744
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,600
screen

745
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,000
so get this going again really quick

746
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:40,079
that first one dumped just amazingly but

747
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,359
mine it is like minus one outside or two

748
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,359
actually about three degrees mm-hmm

749
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,440
here's a question somebody's looking for

750
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,640
like a light rub no i'm rubbing pretty

751
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,798
hard i'm ready

752
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,720
i'm pushing contamination through the

753
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,480
screen oh okay so that way i was kind of

754
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,798
curious on like wow

755
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,159
like see that like i'm i'm actually

756
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:03,759
gonna take a picture of your hand at the

757
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,278
same time because that's quick because i

758
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,278
want to get it off my got it yeah it's

759
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,519
already gone like that you don't want my

760
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:11,599
warm hand warming up

761
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,278
you're melting your resin to my hand

762
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,278
there you go so that actually makes a

763
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,200
lot of sense get it off the hand quickly

764
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,759
and using the cold pack which is really

765
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,278
key important i'm seeing that actually

766
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,038
with that second round it's good for

767
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:24,640
people who don't have a cold room or

768
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,158
don't have access you know it's it's

769
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,000
another way to do it i mean we're doing

770
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,000
it in the warmth but it's still you can

771
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,159
see the process is still working it's

772
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,759
it's totally working like it's totally

773
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,520
working like this it's melting a little

774
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,119
bit it would be more efficient if i

775
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,879
didn't have these little balls that are

776
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,798
popping up they they really keep the

777
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,559
process because what they're gonna do at

778
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,240
this point is they're kind of balling up

779
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,519
the rest of the resin with yours yeah

780
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,120
they just start collecting like

781
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,480
snowballs and

782
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,839
which that's gonna melt like crazy it's

783
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,599
got a nice little you can make potatoes

784
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,519
in little hash balls

785
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,439
yep

786
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,440
it's really a nice pile though like the

787
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,038
color beautiful pile

788
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,000
and you can see underneath there so

789
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:01,359
they're always pushing through

790
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,119
underneath on that on the underneath

791
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:04,158
there yes exactly we'll have that as

792
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,839
well so

793
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,640
should i try to give you a camera shot

794
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,639
pull it off oh

795
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,679
of course we're doing one more shot

796
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,119
one more shot you should be able to pick

797
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,798
up some of this and then you can just

798
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,558
carve these uh

799
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,319
it'll be like the seconds here see of

800
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:21,759
course like a hundred percent you

801
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:23,519
probably even do a third on that i

802
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,200
honestly believe if you close your hand

803
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,440
up one last time then

804
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,278
oh yeah because i don't want to lose any

805
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,880
i don't know we won't because everything

806
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,960
that's here you're still going to smoke

807
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,159
you'll be surprised at how good it is i

808
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,919
already know

809
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,159
yeah this is not the stuff on the top of

810
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,080
the screen is not by any means stuff

811
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,760
that you're going to throw away no no no

812
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,839
we already know that the the magic is on

813
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,398
the 200 remember that the magic is on

814
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:49,119
the 200. the real magic is on the glove

815
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:51,678
well the real magic is on the glove now

816
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:53,519
that is the truth

817
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,559
can you just put that in there for me so

818
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,000
yes sir i surely can just fill that one

819
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,398
up there

820
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,839
oh this this is really nice resin this

821
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,519
is everybody said this is some of the

822
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,000
nicest resin i've ever grown which is

823
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,519
the the that goon i think this could

824
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,038
even by looking at the whiteness this

825
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,639
could be the maddie those last two i

826
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:12,640
really because they're so close together

827
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,080
oh that's exciting

828
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,000
normally i'll jar i would get a jar like

829
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:27,439
this off of my whole room

830
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,119
mind you i wouldn't be crushing it how

831
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,120
this is happening so now we'll also just

832
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,319
do this and you'll be surprised there's

833
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,639
still some great stuff here

834
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:40,319
and really the real proper way to do it

835
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,480
is to run it through the 160 again yeah

836
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,798
i wish i had my 250 screen because it

837
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,640
comes in really handy for that little um

838
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,759
work like this

839
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,399
yeah i've misplaced it but what i would

840
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:54,558
do is i would take all of this yeah and

841
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,158
i would put it on that 250

842
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,000
and all the resin would fall through and

843
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,278
all the little balls would stay on top

844
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,079
and then you'd be able to do that again

845
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:04,079
and then i do another great one for sure

846
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,558
i think you could eat one more uh

847
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,359
possibly but after

848
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:08,240
like

849
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:12,079
now

850
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,679
you have to make it really even okay

851
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,678
well that worked out really good

852
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,120
actually well that's the separation that

853
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,320
worked out really good you can always do

854
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,518
that when you're doing the sift and i

855
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:21,678
used to learn enough from doing a lot of

856
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,359
sifting because of course you know the

857
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,600
dvd you get these balls on there you

858
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,759
have to change the dvd over all the time

859
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,359
so i was getting this one doing the dvd

860
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,038
shouldn't get these balls on here to be

861
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:32,639
honest this is a warmth issue it's a

862
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,720
warm picture 100

863
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,559
100 being inside the room right now we

864
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,000
already know that i that's a thousand

865
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,639
percent what you said mark it's a warm

866
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,558
fishing yeah thousand percent the only

867
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,080
issue is that this wasn't so damn good

868
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:45,440
it's falling into it already wants to

869
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:46,960
melt yeah

870
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,480
and often when you clean it and it

871
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,000
doesn't ball the stuff that's left on

872
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,159
the screen that doesn't go on the glove

873
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,480
is still killer it can still be totally

874
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,919
melty we've seen that on top of that 110

875
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,599
screen all those balls and we did that

876
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,679
one but scotty cake

877
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,678
yep and it was like a bunch of balls on

878
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,080
oh it's falling up like look at how fast

879
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,640
yeah at this point it's hot in here

880
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,000
and and just for the final there but i

881
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,919
can't even feel this on the screen at

882
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,599
this point here i would stop sifting if

883
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,120
i was in my room and wait to come back

884
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,719
because to cool it down yeah because i

885
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,439
could feel that just using the card at

886
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,440
this point now

887
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,960
from the glove to the jar from the glove

888
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:26,000
to the jar

889
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,960
from the from the from the leaf

890
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,960
to the screen to

891
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,440
i like it i love it

892
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,320
shitty um try to get yourself good

893
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,240
brushes because you don't want these

894
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,319
little well those brushes were thanks to

895
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,919
your wife i know but these are not these

896
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:45,918
are not not for this quality this

897
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,000
quality resin deserves a much nicer

898
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,200
brush i like using the horsehair brushes

899
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,398
that's what you actually got in the

900
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,120
beginning there and i was getting yeah i

901
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:54,398
used badgers badgers nice see let's talk

902
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,158
about the different ones that you want

903
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:58,000
to use so that's good to use yeah my

904
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,600
wife just bought me a shaving kit years

905
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,480
ago and again it wasn't like i went out

906
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,879
and looked for badger

907
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,960
jesus look at the difference i know

908
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,640
let's take a picture of that yeah i mean

909
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,399
it's just like i said he's like let's

910
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,759
take a picture of that guys you're

911
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:13,199
definitely getting a close-up of this

912
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,038
and seeing the difference

913
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,319
and it's epic you can see the difference

914
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:17,599
with the glove tech and then how things

915
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:21,398
are clean with that

916
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,398
it's a it's really phenomenal

917
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:30,240
and this of course is the night

918
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,079
well why don't we

919
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,240
yeah that looks really good i mean in

920
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:37,439
the sense clear not as good as i'm

921
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,880
trying to know it's clear uh yes exactly

922
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,960
okay so

923
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,600
now what i want to do real quick is for

924
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,798
us to sit down and have a bowl let's do

925
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,719
that

926
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,639
awesome all right hey johnny we did

927
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,399
forget to show what was getting pushed

928
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,720
through the screen

929
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,398
and so this is all you know i would call

930
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,600
it contaminant it's definitely not pure

931
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:59,599
heads it's more than likely um

932
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,240
you know all pistol-lit hairs no sorry

933
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,839
systolic hairs decapitate stalks

934
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,519
cecil stalks

935
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,678
um i'm going to try and get photographs

936
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,679
of this stuff with the macro lens so you

937
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,320
can see the different grades what was

938
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,159
like ended up on the screen as

939
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,480
sort of balled up

940
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,398
hash and then the guys that you know

941
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,000
this stuff right here which

942
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,319
we almost owe it to ourselves to just

943
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,838
show a little bit of it in the sun here

944
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,159
because it's just

945
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:30,078
looks really nice

946
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,079
it works better than just really nice

947
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,359
really nice really nice

948
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,879
okay so well you can have it all right

949
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:41,519
it's okay i'll collect all of this

950
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:44,000
none of these heads will go to waste

951
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:46,320
but i do think it's time to see just how

952
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,320
well

953
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,519
these can melt

954
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,358
oh i'm doing the double screen double

955
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,800
screen double screen

956
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,239
what are you hitting

957
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,560
a big jar

958
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:01,039
from like the epic of course

959
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,719
which that's the big one there yeah nice

960
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,400
they definitely have like very different

961
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,399
color sequences just three different

962
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,838
photo sequences yeah you can see it you

963
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,119
can see the difference on the first

964
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:10,639
there's the first this or the one at the

965
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,160
end that you did in that last class yeah

966
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,759
yeah you could see that difference in

967
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:15,118
how that is so there's actually a

968
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,599
different difference with a separate and

969
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,280
how you're doing that oh yeah so you can

970
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,720
see and then this of course is at the

971
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,079
end they're all gonna melt you know that

972
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,358
right so a thousand percent oh yeah

973
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,960
i'm gonna like go home and take that

974
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:29,119
piscotti cake and just put it all in the

975
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,880
brows and i'm just gonna squish it oh

976
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,280
nice yeah it's called like clarity but

977
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,280
you get like an 80 to 90 plus percent

978
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,960
it's [ __ ] awesome right yep like

979
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,680
isn't that like what you would do you're

980
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,639
like what are you gonna do it's

981
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,159
definitely what some people that's what

982
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,679
people think are you gonna wear let's

i'll try to make a little video for you

995
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,519
guys so you can see it up closer

996
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,880
i'll just go ghetto styles with the uh

997
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:17,920
with the phone

998
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,000
you know what

999
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,599
now the last time we did this in 2012 we

1000
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,039
laughed so hard we spoke so here's what

1001
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,640
i'm going to ask you to do not light it

1002
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,239
with this handle and cover the entire

1003
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,159
bowl but light it with this hand and

1004
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:32,759
come up from that way and then

1005
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,759
we will get this whole thing on video

1006
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,280
was it appropriate

1007
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:53,039
i think it needs to be a lot bigger

1008
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,320
yeah

1009
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:55,679
all right well i'm gonna dab one of

1010
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,079
those that looks oh look at this

1011
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:01,279
beautiful my hands just like stuck

1012
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,800
together dude that was like on i'm gonna

1013
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,000
dab it

1014
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,400
straight up oh look what fell through

1015
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,440
that's why i'm gonna dab mine because

1016
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,599
that is too good for screened

1017
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,440
smoking it is too good for screen that's

1018
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,880
why i double screened it

1019
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,679
and that's why i was like you get to the

1020
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,599
next level so sometimes you make it so

1021
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:25,519
fine

1022
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,519
every time when you do the nitro glove

1023
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,200
i feel like

1024
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,358
i feel like

1025
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,039
i'm quite excited i'm not gonna lie

1026
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:36,799
i'm quite excited too i'm not gonna lie

1027
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:40,400
because you know what as he's doing like

1028
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,320
he did for me i'm doing the same for him

1029
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,838
yeah yeah bang it a little

1030
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,838
there we go oh there we go

1031
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:51,118
are you ready

1032
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:54,880
i'll put it in with this and then i'll

1033
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:56,800
kind of get out of the way right away so

1034
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,119
you can get the footage see the footage

1035
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,039
is is this does it does it this is cut

1036
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,358
is it you can see the heads and i'm

1037
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:04,480
going to say we need a bigger dab tool

1038
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:05,679
to be honest

1039
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
i mean this is going to be perfect for

1040
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:08,559
me

1041
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,880
i'm going to hit this around 650 because

1042
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:11,880
it is sift

1043
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,680
yeah

1044
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,519
do a quick dunk in the iso here

1045
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,838
definitely left some residue on here

1046
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,280
more so than a normal

1047
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:40,960
well that's something about sift you

1048
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,240
always get that and i'm gonna say no

1049
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,400
matter what i'm always getting more

1050
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:50,000
residue from sift with the flavor

1051
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,000
i mean it cleaned real nice of course

1052
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:54,639
you know i had to go in a little bit

1053
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,039
deeper oh there you go here let me video

1054
00:38:54,639 --> 00:39:01,159
that as well dude i just dabbed that dry

1055
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,159
sift in a turp slurper

1056
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:13,960
i got you

1057
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,960

whoa

1059
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,759
that was harder to

1060
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,679
that was harder to light than i can

1061
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,680
possibly tell you i know my fingers are

1062
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:35,559
stuck to my bone

1063
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,559
oh it smells like amsterdam

1064
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:50,799
dude

1065
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,519
very nice very nice headspace on the uh

1066
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,920
on the resin hits that's just uh

1067

everyone you know you might say like wow

1069
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:02,159
you took a lot of flour and turned it

1070
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,839
into a very small amount of resin but uh

1071
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,000
john does this all the time are you

1072
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,599
kidding me i took my flour and got twice

1073
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,199
as much resin than i normally do exactly

1074
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,519
so not only and you have a lot more left

1075
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,960
i have a lot more left this is this is

1076
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:14,400
exactly what we're looking for is
