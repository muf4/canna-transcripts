side and yeah hey guys welcome to Bubble

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,640
man's world it is uh lovely Sunday

18
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:06,118
afternoon we just filmed a almost 4H

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,840
hour hash church and we're here with the

20
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,519
uh the good guys over at Van City

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,640
extracts I just met Matthew uh not too

22
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,839
many days

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,319
ago a couple of weeks he was the

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,759
gentleman that came up to d420 K and I

25
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,478
and sort of blew us away with this

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,959
really beautiful Quality Dry sift and uh

27
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:26,319
today we've also met Ally who's doing

28
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,118
some of the dry sifting uh with Matt and

29
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,719
man hats off to both of you guys dude

30
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:33,239
cuz this is quality product you guys are

31
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:37,039
obviously taking care of growing proper

32
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:39,719
plants or accessing proper gear because

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,240
uh decontaminating is only one part and

34
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,078
I'm sure Ramone uh you can attest for

35
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,879
sure yeah cleaning is one part but you

36
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,679
don't always get that yeah you can clean

37
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,319
to 99 but you don't always get that full

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,200
milk so yeah exactly I mean the hardest

39
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,559
part really is whether you're going

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,240
through a grower yourself is really to

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,519
either find the person that knows the

42
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,158
plant that well or either know the plant

43
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,118
that well yourself and it's really hard

44
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,640
to do with different strains right so if

45
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:05,840
you can really find a strain that you're

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,759
able to train and work with and produce

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,520
those resonance heads you can keep doing

48
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,598
it over and over that is the key for

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,159
sure a lot of people haven't quite

50
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,719
figured that out that they need this the

51
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,878
super important factor is having a great

52
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,400
grower but also in choosing great

53
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:21,598
genetics and so all of these you should

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,280
walk us through a little bit of what you

55
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,840
got going on and feel free to hold it up

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,719
and show the camera whenever that's a

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,640
beautiful piece of right here we have

58
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:32,759
the flow flower

59
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:35,399
rosin yeah yeah and what strain is that

60
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,359
what strain was it again I believe it

61
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,080
was an Obi-Wan crossed with something

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,959
else ah yeah you guys showed me a BT of

63
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,920
that Skywalker I believe ob- one

64
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,199
Skywalker yeah that was really kushed

65
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:48,399
out and super nuggety and chunky chunk

66
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,639
then for the dry sip we have some

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,360
headband

68
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:56,439
cush dry siip that looks like flower

69
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,440
rosin Clarity counts yeah it does we

70
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:00,598
have some morte that won the first place

71
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:04,759
solvit list at g&amp; Great Northern

72
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:08,280
extraction cup yep beautiful and also my

73
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:12,000
favorite so far candy cush the one that

74
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,080
started this meeting up really it was uh

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,479
this was the the dry sift that Matt came

76
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,280
up to D and I at the cchq and offered

77
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:21,000
you know when he came up I swear it was

78
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,039
this reminiscent thing where I was like

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,878
oh my God this guy is for sure going to

80
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:29,359
give me an a an oil slab right now cuz

81
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,318
it happens to me a lot which is weird

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,400
cuz you people would know that I'm not

83
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,958
really like a big oil guy oh so but when

84
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,959
he came over and I was like oh my God

85
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,360
this guy's Mak give me oil he was like

86
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,080
he's like he's like I want you to have

87
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,680
this dry sift and I was like did he just

88
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,200
say dry sift you know like the smell and

89
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,760
the quality I was like all right sit

90
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,560
down let's try this out so we've

91
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,959
literally been setting this up for the

92
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,319
last half an hour we came in we haven't

93
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,438
had any Puffs since hash church and I

94
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,078
think it's time to hit some of these

95
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,438
flavors definely which one you guys want

96
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,680
to try I mean we're going to open it up

97
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:02,158
with the best the starter the the the

98
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,959
one that smells like a half pound of

99
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,919
wheat

100
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,199
on start C candy yeah you know I love I

101
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,878
love when I'm decontaminated to 99%

102
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,318
gland heads I love when the gland heads

103
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,878
have been grown to Perfection but then

104
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,120
at that point I love a strong turpine

105
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:20,560
profile and I find that this particular

106
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,000
candy cush dry sift has all three of

107
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,639
those things the one thing I've realized

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,759
with this candy cush dry sift is with

109
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,840
other strains when we were sifting it

110
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,759
throughout the whole process your your

111
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:33,959
nose kind of gets uh used to the smell

112
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,639
used to the Turing profile and I kind of

113
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,159
stopped smelling it after about a couple

114
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,560
hours in there right but with this candy

115
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,560
cush it didn't matter how long you were

116
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,439
in the room with it how close you were

117
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,120
to it you could smell it the exact same

118
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,240
the whole time just saturated just

119
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,478
saturated my nose saturated my taste

120
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,199
butts even every time I hit it it was

121
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:53,680
amazing well it's got great texture I

122
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,680
mean even the way it's picking up off

123
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,959
the parchment the way he's just cut the

124
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,478
dab it's just really really nice uh nice

125
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:04,239
and we're happy that what's the first

126
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,758
give it to Rick we're happy that van

127
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,319
City extracts is deciding that a quiver

128
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:13,240
beats uh you know a single you know one

129
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:15,680
trick pony oh yeah definitely it's all

130
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,079
about you got to expand your Horizon and

131
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,840
you know the whole the whole reason why

132
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,599
we're into cannabis in the first place

133
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,439
is because of its medical quality

134
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,879
exactly right and if you're really

135
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,279
passionate about it you'll take the time

136
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,639
to study it you'll take the time to

137
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,079
learn the plant how the plant can

138
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,439
benefit you and uh what it can do for

139
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,879
you how it can help your every single

140
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:36,519
day life mhm yep no totally 100% the

141
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:38,560
gear up for that hit a little hit

142
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:42,000
through the sick maybe you got that all

143
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,720
on yeah oh yeah 723 and 749 for those of

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,720
you wondering at what temperatures our d

145
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,160
nails are at um the sick is a unique

146
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,840
head uh on a nail in the sense that

147
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,439
serious you can turn this thing up to

148
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:57,159
800 and it's still going to hit more

149
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:59,319
like a low temp dab off of titanium and

150
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,080
quartz now silicon carbide is a a

151
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,800
highend and ceramic so it's it's just a

152
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,439
little bit different from

153
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,160
that let's see if we can't get this in

154
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:13,319
here nice big old silicon carbide rip

155
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,880
very nice top quality so happy to see

156
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,360
the youth picking up the torch thank

157
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,120
you we're happy to see the Pioneers

158
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,520
enjoy what we're making yeah definitely

159
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,680
it blows us away definitely if it wasn't

160
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:25,120
for you guys in the first place we

161
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
wouldn't even be able to get close to

162
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,079
where we are there's not that much

163
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,719
information out there readily available

164
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:34,399
to the public that you can know while

165
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,000
watching that it's 100% accurate true

166
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,478
right everything that you get on the

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,478
internet is pretty much just you know

168
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,038
half and half well it's like looking

169
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:44,598
looking for a needle in a hay stack

170
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,439
sometimes yep exactly there's good

171
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:48,639
information out there but it's uh it's

172
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,439
literally floating in a Cess poool of

173
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,199
disinformation of disinformation and

174
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:53,800
David Suzuki had a brilliant quote years

175
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,720
ago when he talked about his show the

176
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,720
nature of things it was a PBS uh show

177
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,759
really incredible nature show and he

178
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,160
really thought he was going to change

179
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,680
the world with this show and he he I

180
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,319
seen him speak one time and he said you

181
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,720
know it was I quickly realized when you

182
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,919
jump into a Cess pool that you take on

183
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,919
the appearance of everything in the cess

184
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,478
pool even if you are yourself a gem no

185
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,318
so the internet has a little bit of that

186
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,959
problem in the sense that there's a lot

187
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,680
of sess there's a lot of [ __ ] and a

188
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,159
lot of crap to sort of filter through

189
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,240
and a lot of people who maybe aren't as

190
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,400
passionate about this um particular

191
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,759
topic as ourselves they might have an

192
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,918
even harder

193
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,199
time you know distinguishing the real

194
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,198
from the false that's why uh we love

195
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,560
hash church and we we really respect the

196
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,000
people on there because we know

197
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,240
everyone's speaking out of the kindness

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,399
of their hearts to help better the

199
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,840
community to help better all the

200
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,000
processes we have going on yeah well I'm

201
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,359
glad to hear you say that Cu uh that's

202
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,680
really what hash church is all about

203
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,199
it's just about creating a dialogue uh

204
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,680
sharing uh information with people so

205
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,720
that just getting rid of this fear

206
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,598
scarcity that there's not enough for you

207
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,879
and there's not enough for me and sort

208
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,478
of putting more of a love and abundance

209
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,120
Vibe into the air where it's like hey

210
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,800
guess what like if there's not enough

211
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,639
pie on the table we can go bake another

212
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,639
pie exactly you know what I mean there's

213
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,120
we can make enough John made enough for

214
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,360
everyone Rastafarian friends say all the

215
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,680
time and I'm that resonates with me I do

216
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,240
believe that job made enough for

217
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,079
everyone I'm not necessarily a religious

218
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,158
person but I like the aspect the

219
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,560
spirituality aspect of cannabis and uh

220
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,838
the helping aspect I mean you know like

221
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,320
I said some of the stories in hash

222
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,080
church today were really powerful Colton

223
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,719
and his mother Wendy coming in and

224
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,599
sharing their story that's uh that's

225
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,959
real true value and I always bring that

226
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,000
value back to this because people like

227
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,679
to distinguish the two and they say well

228
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,440
okay yeah that's legitimate a child who

229
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,679
needs medicine but you guys are just a

230
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,040
bunch of Stoners sitting around smoking

231
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:59,958
hash how can you call okay well guess

232
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,919
what people like Colton learned about

233
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,599
this plant from People Like Us and how

234
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,360
we learned about this plant was not from

235
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,399
going to university courses or reading

236
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,399
about um different aspects of this in

237
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,480
textbooks but we learned about it from

238
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,720
from inhaling phyto canono from

239
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,000
consuming cannabis that's how we learned

240
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,360
about it that's how we better understand

241
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,320
and and learn about this plant by the

242
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,039
relationship that we have not only with

243
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,600
growing it and processing it but then

244
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,519
taking what we process putting it inside

245
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,200
our bodies people may look at us like a

246
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,560
bunch of Stoners but me personally kind

247
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,519
of just saved me I I had to take

248
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,278
multiple oxycottons every day because of

249
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,759
my herniated disc in my back after my

250
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:41,679
car accident brutal this guy right here

251
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,600
showed me the beauty of extracts he's

252
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,078
the reason I got off opiates that's a

253
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,879
big deal for sure and it is a very big

254
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:49,000
deal I was a zombie at that point and

255
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,958
it's they're doing this to the youth

256
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,679
these pharmaceutical companies are doing

257
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,679
this to young kids like getting them

258
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,958
hooked on to 19 years old at the time

259
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:59,958
Oxy Cotton are [ __ ] hardcore you know

260
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,679
what I'm talking about like what more of

261
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,799
a hardcore pill could he have said that

262
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,039
he was taking what 20-year-old man needs

263
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:08,359
to take 80 migam oxyc that's straight

264
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,000
hillbilly piece like heroin and to be

265
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,639
honest like in the world we live in like

266
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,399
with with the experiences you go through

267
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:16,039
and everything usually Somebody by the

268
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:18,078
time they're like even that age that

269
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:19,838
drug will do more than just relieve that

270
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,199
pain it will do some other thing in

271
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,320
their brain and relieve other pains that

272
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,160
they need to be the person they are and

273
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,000
it's just it's some weird [ __ ] those

274
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:31,240
those pharmaceutical pills man they

275
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,919
that's the thing you know those pills

276
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,480
kind of take you away from who you are

277
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,919
and make you a zombie and Bob Marley

278
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,759
even said you know when you smoke the

279
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:40,439
herb it reveals good to yourself it does

280
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,838
true you know it's the complete opposite

281
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,160
and that's why the pharmac super copia

282
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,040
doesn't want weed to be available

283
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,759
readily to the public the way I take it

284
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:51,159
to the next level and even say that it

285
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:55,078
not only reveals you to yourself but it

286
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:59,078
reveals it as well it really

287
00:10:55,078 --> 00:11:02,000
unveils the the potential offerings that

288
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:04,039
can Canabis truly has not only from um

289
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,639
an industrial standpoint and the many

290
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,399
thousands of commercial products that

291
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,839
could be made from hemp uh from a health

292
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,240
standpoint of crushing the seed oil and

293
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,880
acquiring all 11 essential amino acids

294
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,000
that the body needs but can't produce

295
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,240
including the three that children need

296
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,039
so that's 11 nine for adults three more

297
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,278
for children and then it also produces

298
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:28,039
these phyto canabo that are like the

299
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:29,679
essential life fuel or Essence for every

300
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:31,599
cell in our body to communicate at

301
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,519
healthily back and forth to one another

302
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,278
in able to put our central nervous

303
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,879
system and our immune system into

304
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:42,919
homeostasis the endoc canabo system

305
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,600
requires canab and that right there is

306
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:49,519
an incredible quality I don't think it's

307
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,440
a coincidence that the level of the bar

308
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,560
that we set as connoisseurs as some as

309
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,959
people that love to inhale this plant

310
00:11:54,559 --> 00:12:00,359
both recreationally and medically and

311
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:03,039
even Al be it um preventatively

312
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,879
that it somehow coincides with us having

313
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,719
the most valid information to help

314
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,360
people that need this plant for a uh for

315
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,000
medicinal purposes you know the

316
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,440
pharmaceutical companies they're like we

317
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,879
don't really know we'll test it in a lab

318
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,000
we're testing it on our on ourselves

319
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:19,679
through bio acid we are taking it and

320
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,839
it's so instantaneous you know it's hard

321
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,958
to deny someone with glaucoma with an

322
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,760
intense ocular pressure having a quick

323
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,838
puff out of a pipe or off of a spliff

324
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:30,278
and releasing that ocular pressure in an

325
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,160
instant it doesn't matter how much you

326
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:33,559
think you know or if you have a medical

327
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,039
degree you're going to have a hard time

328
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,439
convincing that person that what they're

329
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,480
doing isn't isn't good and isn't right

330
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,639
for for them so it's interesting

331
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,680
discussion you know it's uh it excites

332
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,639
me and uh so does puffing more of that

333
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:51,599
try telling Colton that's not good for

334
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,600
him I mean yeah I mean man crazy my 67y

335
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,480
old father man he gave him one dab of

336
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
dry sift he didn't take his pills for an

337
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,360
entire day yeah that's how it goes

338
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,879
that's over 20 pills he has to take a

339
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,720
day absolutely all 20 of those pills are

340
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:08,240
slowly trying to uh what they're doing

341
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:12,160
is a bad job of trying to do the job of

342
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,919
what canabo the natural um signalers are

343
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,480
canabo these are AR qu imitation

344
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,360
basically low quality imitation that

345
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,000
produces all sorts of adverse side

346
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,759
effects costs uh untold amounts of pain

347
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,159
and suffering and costs enormous amount

348
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,319
of money taxes people's paychecks well

349
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,240
it doesn't cost a lot of money that the

350
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,519
government and tical company but it cost

351
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,519
a lot of money to us that's right right

352
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,278
herb herb shouldn't really cost as much

353
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,320
as it is you know one thing that I

354
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:40,240
really was hoping when the dab era came

355
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,240
around was that the price of flowers

356
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,959
would go down a little bit and the price

357
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,759
of extracts wouldn't be priced as

358
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,638
outrageously as they are these days to

359
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,120
some people are charging 150 to 200

360
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,000
bucks a gram and they're preaching it

361
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,519
for like medical patients like I really

362
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,759
personally don't know many medical

363
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,560
patient I could afford that no it's

364
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,039
insane and it's unfortunate that the

365
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:02,559
prohibition dollar went from prohibition

366
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:05,399
went from well you could serve your life

367
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:08,000
in prison that was what the value was

368
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,519
put upon cannabis if you can go to jail

369
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,399
for a long time well then you can get a

370
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,799
lot of money for pounds in that

371
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,958
particular place MH and so that

372
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,399
prohibition dollar as it slowly turned

373
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,919
into the medical dollar it just never

374
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,480
changed it just didn't change and in

375
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:27,159
fact it did for a short period of time

376
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,600
what happened was herb dropped through

377
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:31,600
the floor both here in Canada

378
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,639
California the West Coast even in

379
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,360
Florida you were able to buy pounds for

380
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,240
thousands of dollars cheaper than ever

381
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,199
before because so many pounds were

382
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,320
starting to gather in California they

383
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:44,120
were able to send them all over the US

384
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,879
Surplus yes Surplus and Canada stopped

385
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,639
sending pounds down to the us cuz they

386
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:50,120
started growing so much and having such

387
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,000
a surplus it really changed everything

388
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:56,198
and it wasn't until people started how

389
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,159
people really accessed the prohibition

390
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:02,000
dollar that that was slowly getting lost

391
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:04,519
was through oil they were able to blast

392
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,720
pounds and get that dollar back and all

393
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:07,240
of a sudden it's like oh I'm getting

394
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,560
like this many thousands of dollars for

395
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,879
a pound well how I make

396
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,399
shatter 100 they were throwing it away

397
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:17,240
before so it's this whole new like it's

398
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,519
one of the things that I I I stayed away

399
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,440
from the oil scene I mean really patio

400
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:26,198
brought me back to even considering um

401
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,079
um an oil product and then so did rosin

402
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:30,120
you know this this is the rosin Headband

403
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,318
Kush Headband Kush so yeah right here in

404
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,240
front of me just coincidentally enough

405
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:37,399
is you know beautiful flower rosin that

406
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,799
is an oil as well as a deliming extract

407
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:43,318
from perao uh which is an oil as well

408
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,479
they don't scare me I I know that even

409
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:48,559
if a mistake was made there's not going

410
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,800
to be something left in here that can

411
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,638
cause me adverse you know there's no

412
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,198
footprint from an outside source of the

413
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,959
can particularly a chemical hydrocarbon

414
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,879
I'm just afraid of them I'm not to I'm

415
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,919
not to say that chemists couldn't learn

416
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:05,318
the process and do an exceptional job in

417
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:08,198
a laboratory with lab grade materials I

418
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:10,559
guarantee that can and should exist I

419
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:13,958
just say that um more people like your

420
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:17,318
guys' self should be focused on things

421
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:21,119
like this that are that give you a

422
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:24,078
greater room for mistake for error yeah

423
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,000
because hydrocarbon is a cruel [ __ ] for

424
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,879
it's a dangerous gas you know the way

425
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,559
the way that we really like to look at

426
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:33,679
the whole um um you know hydrocarbon

427
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:35,599
extract era if you will is there's a lot

428
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,399
of misinformation out there first of all

429
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,879
absolutely and second of all a lot of

430
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,000
patients are smoking garbage stuff

431
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:45,399
they're smoking poison 100% so we really

432
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,879
feel as because I mean a lot of people

433
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,399
obviously believe that their own extract

434
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,759
is I don't want to necessarily say the

435
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,679
best but the safest you know they're

436
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,399
like oh I know my stuff is safe I know

437
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,399
my stuff is good the way that we really

438
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,958
started our company we we made extracts

439
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,440
for ourselves we never really wanted to

440
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:02,039
go into this and go to dispensaries but

441
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,078
a lot of people around us were saying

442
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,240
we've never tried extract like this you

443
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:06,678
know it's actually different than the

444
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,120
stuff we tried it's like I've tried oil

445
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,000
for my first time brought it to Eden

446
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,519
medicinal society and they just they

447
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,439
went crazy they had never really seen

448
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,959
anything like it before really and so

449
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,600
like we almost I don't really want to

450
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,038
say we feel as if it's our duty to

451
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:23,639
supply the city with good medicine but I

452
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:25,599
just feel a little bit more oblig better

453
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,880
yeah obliged to do so right because I

454
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,399
see the garbage that's out there and

455
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,559
there's nothing I can really do except

456
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,160
for produce my own safe hydrocarbon

457
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,839
extract and let the patients be able to

458
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,240
get their hands on it for the best price

459
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:38,759
right I try running all sorts of

460
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,440
material so that anybody with any price

461
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:42,679
budget will be able to afford extract

462
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,558
not everybody wants to pay 80 90 100

463
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:48,160
bucks a g for Shatter or butter yeah

464
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:51,720
that's do not many patients can yeah if

465
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:55,000
you have a very debilitating physical

466
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,120
disability and you can't work 8 hours a

467
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,519
day you are really a physical like

468
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,199
you're a patient how are you going to

469
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:04,319
afford $200 a gram $200 a gr when your

470
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,000
disability check is $900 day and that's

471
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,399
you know not everyone is is um smoking

472
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,079
it some people really need to consume

473
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,480
this

474
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,119
orally you know totally and for those

475
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,000
people to consume something now

476
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:18,119
comparing it to pharmaceutical drugs

477
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,319
they're still more expensive there are

478
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:24,479
pills that cost $80 a pill there are

479
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:26,839
pills that cost $150 a pill and it's uh

480
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,038
just it's just not really doesn't seem

481
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,959
to be the Cannabis way I don't think

482
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,599
cannabis is just for millionaires that

483
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,679
can afford hundreds of dollars a gram I

484
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,279
think in India cannabis is known as the

485
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,798
poor man's drug and it's available to

486
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,678
everyone it doesn't matter who you are

487
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:43,158
what class you're from how high up you

488
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,919
are how low you are you should be able

489
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:46,760
to access cannabis because it grows in

490
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,280
the ditches it grows in the mountains

491
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:51,440
and it's available and it's like that's

492
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,079
always how I've seen cannabis and I

493
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,038
think that's why the agenda is so

494
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:58,038
threatened by it and why they're like no

495
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,440
nobody can have it because in reality

496
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:01,359
the this is what they don't want you

497
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,080
guys to know so pay attention

498
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,879
here H you can have it it's for everyone

499
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,639
and it's everywhere on all four corners

500
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,000
of the planet which is pretty incredible

501
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,038
it can't really be said for that's the

502
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,599
beauty of it for too many other uh

503
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:16,319
plants it grows everywhere so no matter

504
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:19,119
where you're watching from in all the

505
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,359
different 208 countries because that's

506
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,000
currently how many different people how

507
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,359
many different countries watch Bubble

508
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,679
man's world 208 countries so there's

509
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,439
people tuning in from all these

510
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,038
different countries and depending on

511
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,038
your laws you know I I don't urge you to

512
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:35,759
go out and get yourself arrested or in

513
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:37,798
trouble but I definitely urge you if

514
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,879
cannabis is not allowed where you live

515
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:41,960
and you want to be a part of and have

516
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,320
cannabis in your life then you either

517
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,200
need to a make things happen in the

518
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,519
safest most efficient way for you or you

519
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,720
need to move those are the two options

520
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,400
well that's the thing that always blows

521
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,440
me away is the fact that we're sitting

522
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,200
right here smoking comfortably in peace

523
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,159
M and there's people on this same Planet

524
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,798
somewhere getting beaten for smoking by

525
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,520
police they're getting thrown in jail

526
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:04,960
for smoking like it just really bothers

527
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,319
me that we're all living on the same

528
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,558
Planet yet everywhere has a different

529
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:10,000
you know I understand there's different

530
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,678
cultures there's different ways about

531
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,440
going for things but we're all like

532
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,000
we're human beings we got to be logical

533
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,480
about things it seems like there should

534
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,839
be almost the way physics has laws there

535
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,200
should be common sense laws that it's

536
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,639
like okay we respect your belief system

537
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,840
cuz one of the things I appreciated

538
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,240
about traveling in India is that India

539
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:31,599
respects all the belief system systems

540
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,519
like you can hang out with a shite and

541
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,279
you can hang out with a Krishna and you

542
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,798
can hang out there's so many different

543
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,839
belief systems in India they're all

544
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,599
tolerant one another well they all

545
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:43,558
believe deep down that no matter what

546
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:45,439
you believe it's what they believe it's

547
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,639
just through a different perspective so

548
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,200
you won't see it the same way but it's

549
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,480
just kind of a known thing that it's

550
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,600
like listen it's it is what it is it's

551
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,880
this energy we come from here we go to

552
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:59,599
there they all have these sort of

553
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,080
standards and there should be sort of

554
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:05,158
Common Sense standards like physic

555
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,480
physical laws that uh no matter what

556
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,280
your belief system or culture is you

557
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,880
shouldn't be allowed to execute people

558
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,079
for a plant you shouldn't be allowed to

559
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,320
put people in a cage for 30 years of

560
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:19,038
their life for a plant and uh you just

561
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:20,319
really shouldn't even I I can't even

562
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:24,119
believe that people are like it's a

563
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,759
ticketable it's a ticketable offense yay

564
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:27,519
it's like we fought for a ticket it's

565
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,319
like what we fought to get ticket a

566
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:33,278
ticket no how they

567
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:35,480
doing how was it working out like that

568
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:37,319
yeah that that's pretty much what the

569
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,720
point I was trying to bring up at cchq

570
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:42,439
is that you guys the pioneers made that

571
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,038
possible for us that's why we're sitting

572
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,759
here as a younger generation saying holy

573
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:47,119
crap we only getting a ticket for weed

574
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,240
while you guys are actually fought for

575
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,399
the whole thing that's not what you

576
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,079
wanted you wanted more than that but we

577
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,798
didn't really see the fight we were

578
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,319
growing up as you guys were fighting and

579
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:57,480
when that all came along and where we're

580
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,519
at now it's completely different than

581
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,720
what you guys wanted well but that's the

582
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,759
plan right you always want the youth to

583
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,240
not have to go through what you went

584
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,359
through uh particularly in this

585
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,038
particular

586
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,759
fight I mean I I just keep always going

587
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:14,158
back to Rick's dad like sitting in

588
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,960

weeks and then I'll even know more so

625
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:49,759
it's just a trip you know I mean live in

626
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,759
this world where it's bugged out just to

627
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:55,200
to be cuz I just went from

628
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:58,759
Frisco and there it's kind of it is

629
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,759
pretty much tolerated and legal to some

630
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:04,158
perspective medically and then go to

631
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:07,278
Colorado where there's where

632
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,600
there's and then in Seattle and then

633
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,038
here you know so you see all these

634
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,240
different that it's actually possible

635
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:15,000
and then think like yeah Poss and I live

636
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,599
in Amsterdam where it's like you can go

637
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,519
downstairs and buy a [ __ ] you know what

638
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:20,158
I'm saying that's the thing the

639
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:22,079
government they like to make an example

640
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,720
out of people that's the problem you

641
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,398
know like they they go out of their way

642
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,839
to do so and they even break the law to

643
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:29,038
do so now it's beyond an example cuz I

644
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,558
mean

645
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:34,759
now it's like [ __ ] now it's [ __ ]

646
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:38,278
like my dad doesn't need to die in

647
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:40,079
PR Out The Window Man Common Sense isn't

648
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:41,759
so common anymore anyways well that's

649
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,519
what you guys can do now you know you

650
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:46,919

guys we haven't had the best dcep to

685
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,558
show these guys well honestly since

686
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,639
smoked mine like a fiend since we really

687
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:17,519
started making dry sip we've never

688
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,200
really smoked anyone else's but our own

689
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,759
right so I always thought it melts it's

690
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,840
good it SMS it's good right but when I

691
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:28,079
saw bubble man's reaction and Darren's

692
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:29,798
reaction I was like shocked and then you

693
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,960
know a couple days later on high sech

694
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:34,000
the way that you guys just you know

695
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,640
reacted to it I would really blown away

696
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,519
well the way it is is it's it's like

697
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,880
this and and remone was in the same boat

698
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,639
and there's like more and more people

699
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,600
stepping up to this plate and I think

700
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,360
they think that it's like it should it's

701
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:47,678
like a rare position but really it's not

702
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,319
you guys are just the first ones out of

703
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,399
many to come to realize they're simple

704
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,918
techniques if you pay attention to the

705
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:57,359
resin somehow it just ends up being

706
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,759
better than if you don't pay attention

707
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,079
to the resin if you growing for

708
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:02,640
vegetative yields and flowering periods

709
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,839
and how much can I get and how fast can

710
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,038
I get it it just is never going to turn

711
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:09,558
out for the same is like no man like

712
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:11,158
we're going to dry sift all this [ __ ]

713
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,079
and like when we do that like it has to

714
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,440
be grown this particular way we've

715
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:18,439
learned from mistakes and it's just a

716
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,038
different focus when you have that Focus

717
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,480
you end up with this it's that simple

718
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,599
and there's more and more people every

719
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,240
year since we started Legends more and

720
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:31,639
more people come to the plate and when

721
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,159
you make the best it's all the best is

722
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,919
the best yeah you just have to take the

723
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:36,799
proper steps and it's that's it and the

724
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,159
proper steps start with growing yeah

725
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:39,960
exactly you know what I mean the people

726
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,200
who can control their resin are the

727
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,399
people who can grow their resin and

728
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,120
that's what I've noticed in this

729
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,158
industry in this community the people

730
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:52,398
who seemingly have the best sort of

731
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:54,320
quality resins are people who have a say

732
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:56,599
in how that you know what's required in

733
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,678
order to do your job so that's the thing

734
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:00,719
though what it it's almost as like a

735
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,320
spiritual journey in itself you know

736
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,000
understanding the it's not like you can

737
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,720
just go to school read books and find

738
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,839
out about it you'll know the basics of

739
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,960
it but until you really put your heart

740
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,759
and soul into it interact it won't speak

741
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,038
back to you exactly there's a lot of

742
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,960
interaction going on in it so it's

743
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,640
exciting we geek out on this [ __ ] as you

744
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,200
can see

745
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,080
here when when he came home that day

746
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,120
after he saw you at cchq and he said you

747
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,519
looked at the dryp the way you did yeah

748
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,918
I I almost fell out of my chair cuz I

749
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,000
was like I couldn't believe that

750
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:36,679
something we produced yeah man just us

751
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,839
two look at how nice it is would make

752
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,000
you that impressed yeah I know we we had

753
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:43,639
never even thought because the best is

754
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,960
the best no matter where you are or who

755
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,559
made it it's like ego aside it's like no

756
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,240
that's the best like and oh you have the

757
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:52,639
best too that's amazing oh look he's got

758
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,759
some too I won't be happy until everyone

759
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,000
has it all different flavors these are

760
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:59,879
what he says to me every day he says

761
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,640
everybody deserves to have that's why I

762
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,760
I'm more more than a hash maker I I am

763
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,679
now cultivating

764
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:09,480
hash you becoming a philanthropist for

765
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,919
the Cannabis Community cultivating hash

766
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,599
makers yeah well whatever it takes man I

767
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,080
I love the industry

768
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,158
so it's good to see the industry showing

769
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,398
support back right I mean like when I

770
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,159
talked to a lot of older people like

771
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,199
just last month I had a meeting with

772
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,720
some guy he's like in his 40s 50s and he

773
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,278
was telling me he's like you know just a

774
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,480
couple weeks ago I threw away my second

775
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:30,960
phone like what do you mean he's like I

776
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,278
used to have a business phone and a

777
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,319
personal phone my entire life he's like

778
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,240
we used to have to worry all the time

779
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:39,960
check over our shoulder but he's like

780
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,720
now the industry has been so supportive

781
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,960
that it's taking heat off of a lot of

782
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,720
people cuz they're watching Everybody

783
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,240
not just certain people absolutely right

784
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,360
and when we stand together they really

785
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,798
can't take us down well and when you

786
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:55,798
realize that most people in the Cannabis

787
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:58,398
industry aren't actual criminals yeah

788
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:01,119
they've just been criminalized sure

789
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:03,000
there's some interaction with when you

790
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:04,918
make something completely illicit

791
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,119
there's going to be an interaction with

792
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,840
the non and the actual like elements of

793
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:12,678
of crime that's what they do for a

794
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:15,519
living you know what I mean you make you

795
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:17,919
you give them you fund them by

796
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:20,440
prohibiting certain drugs when you make

797
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,880
certain things illegal that funds

798
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,120
organized crime they would have a lot

799
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,399
less money if those drugs that they were

800
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,959
but then again you know maybe they're

801
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:30,599
just business man that were like oh well

802
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,919
if the drugs were legal we would be able

803
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,240
to just do a sort of business model with

804
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:38,919
that like I I'm not one to pretend to

805
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:42,640
know uh that aspect but uh it it's

806
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:46,038
interesting to see how far we've come

807
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,278
compared to the heat that once was yeah

808
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:49,359
it's nice to hear that buddy got to

809
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,759
throw a second phone yeah exactly he was

810
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:54,558
he was Prett about extra Pocket spish

811
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:56,240
yeah that's just too much especially now

812
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,038
that everybody's you know a little too

813
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,038
anal about radiation and everything

814
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:01,679
comes off your phone and your laptop you

815
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:03,638
know you don't need to be carrying 10 of

816
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,038
them in your bag exactly one of my

817
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:06,038
phones is

818
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:13,480
ringing ah the good old

819
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,880
days just a bag of phones I had a design

820
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,599
that it was going to be a briefcase in

821
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,240
the back you you'd crack it open and it

822
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:20,359
could be like five phones on this side

823
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,038
and five phones on this side and then

824
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:23,719
when you close it there would be like a

825
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,038
plug for you to put your headphone

826
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,519
mouthpiece into and then a a little

827
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:28,759
light to let you know which one was

828
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,960
ringing

829
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:35,319
that's pretty smart yeah you back in the

830
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:38,639
days back in the day that's proprietary

831
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:40,798
information that was some 96 [ __ ] right

832
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:43,038
there and do you have the whole belt

833
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,759
full of beepers you uh I didn't wear

834
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:47,319
them on a belt but I definitely had a

835
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:49,359
little bag of some in

836
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:51,879
it yeah we've come a long way but

837
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,479
there's still a long way to go so that's

838
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,559
definitely why we continue on this

839
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,200
mission of creating these dialogues and

840
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,599
sharing information with people and

841
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,319
letting people know where they can find

842
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,398
Van City extracts for people that want

843
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,599

845
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:10,398
Facebook set up yet but we have

846
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,759
Instagram you can follow us at Van City

847
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,398
extract on Instagram and the only

848
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:17,278
dispensary that we're currently at right

849
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,879
now is eating medicinal Society every

850
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,278
now and then we might have a drop of

851
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,840
like a special flavor or a variety at

852
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:24,679
different dispensaries but for the most

853
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:26,439
part we're just eating exclusive nice

854
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,159
and I guess the dry sift isn't leaving

855
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,080
the head stash eh yeah well I mean I'm

856
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:34,200
trying to get enough I'm talking to the

857
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:35,480
grower he wasn't really into dry SI till

858
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,639
I showed it to him I shouldn't have

859
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,120
really showed it to him but uh he didn't

860
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:40,759
really know his flowers were actually

861
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:42,119
producing those resins that were really

862
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,679
good so when I came back to him he

863
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:46,038
actually wanted some himself yeah of

864
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,559
course but I'm trying to you know get

865
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:51,319
him on the same level as I am with the

866
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,319
whole patient lead this medicine take it

867
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:55,359
off the top before you do anything else

868
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:57,918
exactly exactly so what we would love to

869
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:00,759
do is to be able to give patients access

870
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,360
to dry sift at an affordable cost would

871
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:05,879
at the Quality that you would like where

872
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,558
can I say like that's what we're trying

873
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,278
to get going yeah I for the longest time

874
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:13,200
have just been trying to grow enough

875
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:15,919
resin for myself to have a gram of it a

876
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,200
day so I can consume half of it orally

877
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,519
and half of it through uh you know

878
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,000
inhalation and it's hard even just to

879
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:23,638
grow that small amount of while you're

880
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,159
running a business and being a father

881
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:28,359
and doing all the other things in life

882
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:31,320
it's not that easy to just grow

883
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:33,359
365 G of resin but it would be a lot

884
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,439
harder without the sift right it sure

885
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,959
would be for sure I'll tell you

886
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,440
definitely glad to have my screens yeah

887
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,919
which I never ever promote my own [ __ ]

888
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,558
but you can check these screens out that

889
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,759
we're all talking about at uh fresh.com

890
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:51,079
it's uh get your B bag all that sort of

891
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:53,200
resin extraction tools we definitely

892
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:55,439
have you covered and uh what I like to

893
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,278
think of is pretty good support in the

894
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,000
sense that even people for years have

895
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:00,880
been asking me how to do stuff with

896
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,638
other people's products and I've been

897
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,240
answering them and basically doing

898
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:08,398
customer service for like every other

899
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,719
Bag company and most people who sell

900
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,118
like a dry sip box or any of those

901
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,000
people call me they're like how do I

902
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:18,119
what do I I'm like okay well you need

903
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,398
more than one scream like at CH asking

904
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:22,919
me if I on hash church if I only had one

905
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,960
screen damn did you see the mean that

906
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:28,239
got created it's like me smelling a bud

907
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,679
in Jamaica a sativa plant and it says

908
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:34,279
one screen eh do you have any panty

909
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,039
hoes cuz panty H could be used as a

910
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,119
screen y yeah right a single farmer grid

911
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,719
screen so if you only were able to have

912
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,720
one screen I think i' grab the 70 and

913
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:46,078
then just some panty hose defit so etm

914
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,319
was

915
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,159
like yeah I definitely use the screens

916
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,519
myself I mean it's all I've ever used

917
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,760
and I don't think I'm going to switch to

918
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,719
anything else because the results have

919
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,960
just been spectacular yeah well that's

920
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,399
the that's the hard part right now

921
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,760
there's a few other people asking me to

922
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,358
promote their dry sift methods and I'm

923
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,079
having a hard time doing it because a I

924
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:07,799
haven't been able to be find it

925
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,519
efficient uh or really even work in the

926
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,560
same way at all like especially for the

927
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:13,480
decontamination no one's coming out with

928
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,799
a better

929
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,838
decontamination um method anytime soon

930
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,560
that is like a a game Cher being able to

931
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:24,759
do that and even carding was a game

932
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:27,039
changer for the patient no the patient

933
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,960
person who was patient enough to push

934
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:32,639
all the contaminant through the card you

935
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:36,039
could get it you could get 99% heads and

936
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:38,480
then with you know M uh online on

937
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:40,639
YouTube he wrapped parchment around the

938
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,079
card and he found when he was doing it

939
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,319
that it was sticking to the parchment

940
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,960
well then d420 K wrapped it around a

941
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,760
thicker thing a DVD case and that was

942
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,318
really the game changer right there so

943
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,400
everyone had their place in that and

944
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:56,679
those uh guys should deserve their shout

945
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,480
out for helping everyone along the way

946
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:02,199
you know get to what I like to call the

947
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,240
unadulterated canabo profile yeah and

948
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:06,039
that's what uh that's what dry sift is

949
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,239
it's it's the purest of the pure it's

950
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:11,239
the Holy Grail it's like if you can

951
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:13,039
master that one that's a a good Arrow to

952
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:15,519
have in the quiver and all the other

953
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,239
arrows in my opinion line up definitely

954
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,358
I mean personally I couldn't really see

955
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:22,039
any other way to be able to get those

956
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:24,639
glandular heads without using any

957
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:27,400
solvent you know purely unadulterated

958
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:30,480
like intact yeah completely intact with

959
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,680
no water solubles taken like water hash

960
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,000
like literally

961
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:40,399
really profile that's so I think on that

962
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,559
note we should um thank these guys from

963
