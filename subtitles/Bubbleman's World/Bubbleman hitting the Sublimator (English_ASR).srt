00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,599
hey guys bubble man here just about toh

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,320
take a rip here on the sublimator from

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:10,839
enrio um this is an amazing incredible

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,000
new device that I just recently got

5
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:17,118
turned on to and um aside from the fact

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,240
that it's a gasification process

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:24,518
sublimation turning the the solid into a

8
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:26,919
gas without going through a

9
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:29,118
liquid I can't say enough about how it

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,320
affects the hit how wonderful it tastes

11
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,000
even though this is a plastic tube and I

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,039
never smoke out of plastic tubes

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,159
although I suspect I'll get myself the

14
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:42,000
wand working with just uh glass bong in

15
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:44,439
the near future but for now I'll show

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,679
it's as simple as loading up a little

17
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:49,079
bowl or big one for that matter some

18
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,238
watermelon full

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,160
melt putting that in the old mouth and

20
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,159
dropping this into the

21
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,719
[Music]

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
chamber

23
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,920
[Music]

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,080
pretty incredible size Vapor hit it

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,680
dissipates very fast in the air The

26
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,039
Taste is unparalleled particularly once

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,479
you start playing around with the heat

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,280
and getting it to that perfect heat

29
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:32,399
temperature that was a dry hit through a

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,399
plastic tube I'm not even coughing um

31
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,478
the size of the vapor molecules the way

32
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,599
it breaks them down allows it to get so

33
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:41,239
deep into your lungs everyone has said

34
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,280
it once they've exhaled it it's this

35
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:47,039
incredible permeation and the tpin in

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,200
your mouth and in your throat really

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,760
quite a good little unit I'm sure

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,849
there's a little bit left

39
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,849
[Music]

40
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:59,519
here anyway that's the

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,118
sublimator hope uh hope you enjoy we're

42
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,759
going to have more videos of it coming

43

up soon and uh myself the bubble bag

44
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,840
booth and sublimator will be at the

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,520
treating yourself expo from May 24th to

46
