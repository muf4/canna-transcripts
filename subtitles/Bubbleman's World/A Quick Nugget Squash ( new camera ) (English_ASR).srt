00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,439
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,518
I'm not going to lie I finally went out

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,759
and got a new camera and kind of see the

5
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,518
box over my shoulder there all right so

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,239
we are starting with this video with the

7
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,558
new for 4k

8
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,039
camera and see what kind of quality we

9
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:39,399
can share

10
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:41,159
here it's beautiful all right so here

11
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,120
you can see the quality difference in

12
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,878
the camera I'm a total idiot guys I

13
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,558
apologize for recording this I don't

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,920
know how I had it set on the lowest

15
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,119
setting uh pretty ridiculous optical

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,079
zoom on this thing as well if you see

17
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,198
I'm zooming in several kilometers away

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,920
I'm hand holding this so there's no

19
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:00,399
tripod or anything thus the little bit

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,640
of shake but for that kind of zoom and

21
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,320
to see that clear I was quite impressed

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,680
with the quality so uh you guys should

23
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,919
expect better things to come from the

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:16,600
new 4k camera on Bubble man's

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:19,079
world uh the new Panasonic uh 991 xcw or

26
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:21,158
something little 4K unit pro suumer

27
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,039
model not too expensive not too

28
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,439
inexpensive hopefully you guys are going

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,640
to be enjoying the quality on this and

30
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:28,519
it's got some pretty cool options uh and

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,439
new things with picture in picture and

32
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:32,478
being able to use multiple smartphones

33
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:33,798
to record and put that inside the

34
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,640
picture so we'll probably end up doing

35
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,759
that eventually but for today just a

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,320
quick little video uh went and saw the

37
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,200
guys at Sunrise Wellness here in

38
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,438
Vancouver the other day uh Dom great guy

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,240
had a nice little session with him

40
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,879
really liked his education that he was

41
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,319
laying out to the customers that were

42
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,319
coming in it's definitely a shop that is

43
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,798
carrying a higher uh quality that you

44
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,758
see generally and he gifted me a small

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,560
little bud here which is the Gorilla

46
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,640
Glue number four uh cross with the 09

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,640
cookies nice little package that it came

48
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,000
in as well that was open and not going

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,598
to squish the bud type of thing I've

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
already Vaped a little bit of the bud

51
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,959
and I've

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,080
squished just a tiny little bit of it as

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,199
well it was a nice size Bud that he gave

54
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,640
me so too bright there oh yeah that's

55
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:22,079
maybe a little bit

56
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,159
better still getting used to this bright

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,440
bright light off the top of the camera

58
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,439
here let's

59
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,759
see I guess you can't really see it that

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,360
way

61
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:36,479
but anyway a nice little bite by anyone

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,280
standards got the sasquash press behind

63
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,959
me all lit up and ready to go we're at

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,919
about

65
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,640
238Â° right now I'm going to grab my

66
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,639
parchment real

67
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,878
quick got a piece of parchment

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,360
all pre- ripped just got to give it a

69
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:59,318
fold and then I generally break up the

70
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,480
bud and make it kind of long nice little

71
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:03,919
buds

72
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,959
pretty decent

73
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,280
quality and I'm still oh it's back on

74
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,519
all right so let's crack this open a

75
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,519
little

76
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,360
bit not raising it too much I'm not even

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,360
going to give it the the pre-

78
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,400
squish make sure that lever's

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,759
closed get over here to the to the air

80
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,760
compressor

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,639
bring her down

82
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,478
[Music]

83
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:55,438
slow now she's squishing I can hear

84
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,439
her oh yeah squishing

85
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,719
nice we're going to open it up and check

86
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,620
out what we

87
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,818
got

88
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,819
[Music]

89
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,400
all right

90
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,519
so let's get this squishing on so we can

91
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,519
show you what we got

92
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,800
here all right so this is what we got

93
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,119
out of the

94
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,160
squish it's just a first squish there's

95
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,319
plenty left so I'll fold it all up into

96
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,240
a small ball all right so there's a tiny

97
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,478
little dab of what I

98
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,199
collected couple of little pieces in

99
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:45,399
there one little partic I see in the

100
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,199
bottom right there as I turn

101
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:51,000
it very nice quality looking though I've

102
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,919
already had a dab so I know it's tasty

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,038
Gorilla Glue number four let's press it

104
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:57,079
again and see what we get all right so I

105
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:59,680
broken the the piece up and I'm going to

106
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:02,560
squish it in this little sort of pen

107
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,959
pancake stack pancake stack Tech so we

108
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,680
got that in

109
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:09,599
there can't really see it but the stack

110
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,280
is in there I assure you there it is

111
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,960
there she

112
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,959
goes let's get this

113
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,619
[Music]

114
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,759
happening how's that for a

115
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,759
squish got much more efficient on that

116
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,600
Squish and this thing really laid out

117
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,319
the juice like what I knew it would was

118
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,080
willing to lay out so right there is why

119
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,600
you want to do a couple of squishes just

120
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,680
in case you're not super efficient at

121
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,199
first you might want to uh it's worth

122
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,000
doing let's collect this all right so

123
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,759
we'll just get rid of a couple of

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,759
little little bits of

125
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,609
[Music]

126
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,800
contaminant all right let's let's

127
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,079
collect this up and see how how how well

128
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,079
she's

129
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,400
collecting sorry you guys can't see that

130
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:25,319
very well I guess

131
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,318
it's and we'll get the second

132
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,478
batch

133
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,639
all right so you can see this is real

134
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:38,598
sappy sticky stuff almost

135
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:43,160
shaty but quite sappy once heat it

136
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:46,399
up and let's see what we got here always

137
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,400
excited to see what we

138
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,519
got nice little dab right there not too

139
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,879
shabby at all all right so yeah nice

140
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,399
little dab that came out of that right

141
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,960
there can see the first dab

142
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:06,839
right right

143
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:10,799
here and if we want to get

144
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:13,519
fancy and we want to show you both dabs

145
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,160
simultaneously we can do that as well

146
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,159
let's see there you

147
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,080
go camera and Camera new camera right

148
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,759
we're going to be playing around with

149
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,359
all sorts of things hope you guys

150
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,840
enjoyed the short video and uh yeah

151
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,560
maybe I'll finish it off with a bong rip

152
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:30,399
shall I I think so all right so there's

153
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,759
the second press right there

154
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,239
and there's our first press it's a

155
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,160
little bit of contaminant in there

156
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,478
but it will sit on my

157
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,599
nail so yeah let us do a dab here which

158
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:46,158
one should we do should we hit a little

159
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,759
mixture of both I think so and there's

160
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:49,439
our little cake almost looking like

161
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,680
there's still a little bit of goods left

162
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,680
in

163
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,038
there all right well I finally managed

164
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,478
to get myself that little dab dipped in

165
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,199
I will have you know some cherry AK-47

166
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,959
Blue River tpin let me tell you about

167
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,199
these

168
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,318
oh my goodness these are some special

169
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,720
special just making the rip at first I

170
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,720
wasn't sure if I had dipped it and I

171
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,560
smelled it I was like I'm not sure if

172
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,759
I've dipped it obviously you have not

173
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,439
dipped it when you're not sure that

174
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,158
you've dipped it because when you have

175
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:18,319
trust me you're going to know as this

176
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:22,079
right now is wreaking up the entire area

177
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:25,879
around my face right now got my torch

178
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:28,598
all heated up the Mother Ship here torch

179
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,720
here did it all off camera got it all

180
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:34,879
heated up the bucket set and uh got my

181
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,918
carb cap dab in hand we're at about the

182
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,759
48 second Mark if we were hitting the

183
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:41,759
quartz we'd be probably hitting it right

184
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,919
about now um but because it is the

185
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,039
ceramic from hive the brother ship

186
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,559
actually we're going to wait a little

187
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,639
bit longer I usually go a minute and a

188
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,679
half to 2 minutes on on the uh on the

189
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,319
ceramic so probably going to trade my

190
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:58,879
clear one in soon here my mother ship

191
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,720
bucket little honey bucket gold dial get

192
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,720
that traded in maybe get myself a

193
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,160
colored one and that's the one that

194
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,079
you'll see me using I think here in the

195
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,199
near future anyway we're at about a

196
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:12,039
minute and 40 uh a minute and 30 seconds

197
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,040
I think we're good to go

198
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,658
[Music]

199
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:33,159
now just a lovely flavor on those tpin

200
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:33,159
let me tell

201
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,759
you got a pretty damn sweet temperature

202
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,359
on

203
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:50,919
that not super super low temp but

204
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,919
definitely

205
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,120
puddling I like to catch it at the

206
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,759
closest level of puddling that I can

207
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,919
without wasting too much of my rip and

208
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,639
knowing that I'm still getting a really

209
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:07,360
full flavored full bodied um hit so

210
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,559
thank you guys for watching that I've

211
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,639
got a little bit of this rosin left go

212
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:14,000
check out Sunrise Wellness I'm hoping on

213
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:16,360
doing a video with those guys where I go

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,759
down there pick out a few different

215
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,720
flavors of nuggets maybe a couple of

216
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,958
hashes and then go home and you know

217
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,079
puff them and give you guys a little

218
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,439
review I was really happy with the

219
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,278
quality that they had and uh there's

220
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,959
just not many dispensaries that I'll

221
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:31,919
avidly jump in behind behind and say you

222
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:34,359
should go there I think they're all

223
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,719
great for Access but for me because of

224
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,600
the way I use cannabis is basically for

225
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,000
the highest quality that I can find I'm

226
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,759
really OCD about the the the level of

227
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,399
care that was taken to grow it and you

228
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,519
know whether it was grown organically

229
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,639
and whether it was

230
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,879
grown you know if if they've been

231
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,440
spraying spraying it in any way shape or

232
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:56,200
form as a processor not even as an end

233
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,920
user I immediately have a problem with

234
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,200
it because I concentrate those terrible

235
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,759
things with my good things that I'm

236
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,440
extracting so that doesn't work too well

237
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,759
either anyway I'm just rambling now that

238
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,480
was a quick little video Sasquatch shout

239
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,078
out to those guys soil grown s and

240
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,680
hopefully the quality of the videos just

241
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,159
gets better and better I also changed

242
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,799
the lights in my office I put three new

243
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,759
beautiful lights in and you can see this

244
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:21,319
really bright kind of light that

245
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,919
surrounds me now as opposed to that

246
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,240
really terrible yellow light that we

247
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,759
started with at the start of the video

248
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,039
anyway we'll see you next time on Bubble

249
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:32,000
man's world hope you guys keep pressing

250
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:36,799
those Buds and may the full mouth bless

251
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,799
your bow sooner than later peace

252
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,159
out
