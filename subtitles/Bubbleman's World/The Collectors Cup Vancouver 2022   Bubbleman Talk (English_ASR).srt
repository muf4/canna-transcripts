1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:06,239
uh Marcus is a very important person to

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:09,300
me

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,759
um not and yes he's a legend and he's

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,460
helped Pioneer the industry but my

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,039
personal connection to him was one day

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:21,179
when I was running a dispensary one we

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:24,060
did a Rebrand and did a um basically a

8
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:25,618
relaunch of our dispensary so I just

9
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,479
called up all of our vendors and said

10
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:29,339
hey you know what like we'd love to have

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,579
you participate is there anything you

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:36,899
can do and he himself

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:39,600
showed up with all his supplies items he

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,239
gifted a bunch of samples and was right

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,960
then and there from the start to the end

16
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:49,320
and so his dedication to being on the

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,600
ground assisting you know small players

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,039
like myself that I you know was new to

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,219
the industry

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,439
um it was just his generosity of sharing

21
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,620
his knowledge and his

22
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:04,079
um his clout I gotta say he is one of

23
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:07,259
the most beautiful people I've ever met

24
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,239
I spent a number of lunches and

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,640
afternoons with him and every single

26
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:18,658
time I I just can't get enough

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:21,659

00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,258

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,880
phone number and she'll uh confirm

39
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,820
everything that I'm suggesting right now

40
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,739
uh yeah thanks everyone for being here

41
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,679
this is awesome thanks Julie and Canada

42
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:00,298
reps um since day one that I met Julie I

43
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,939
loved what she was doing

44
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,618
I love the idea of sensory science it's

45
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:06,839
very important we're learning we're at a

46
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:07,739
bit we're at a more basic level right

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,939
now

48
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,919
um in the Cannabis industry

49
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:11,939
unfortunately than say from the Hops

50
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,738
industry

51
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,120
but we're catching up and we're starting

52
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,039
to learn more about these different

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,959
volatile organic compounds and I think

54
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,060
events like this where we actually pay

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,120
attention to the sommelier aspect and

56
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,439
Trust our oil factory the one thing two

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,060
things I would suggest when you are

58
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:33,479
doing sensory evaluations of cannabis is

59
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,400
learn what your sensitivities are so if

60
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,619
you have like a sensitivity to

61
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,980
deliminine or a sensitivity to whatever

62
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,439
sort of compound could even be THC it's

63
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:46,799
important to take that into account in

64
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:49,800
the way that you evaluate the sensory

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,620
aspects of of cannabis the second one

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,660
would be to if you have uh and if you if

67
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,500
you recognize them a lot of people don't

68
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:01,859
but if you have blind spots if you have

69
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,840
um compounds that you can't perceive and

70
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,959
so understanding what your sensitivities

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,939
are and the things the compounds that

72
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,500
you can't perceive you might you know

73
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,239
someone might say oh this smells like

74
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,860
this to me and then the person next to

75
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,019
them is like wow I don't get that at all

76
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,959
it's like yeah well if they're missing a

77
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,959
single thiol uh that they are unable to

78
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,759
perceive the compounds would smell very

79
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,920
very differently to them than it would

80
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,340
be to you so those those are good things

81
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,839
but hats off to Julie and Canna Reps for

82
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,459
putting on events like like this and

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,560
supporting the front liners the bud

84
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,239
tenders you guys are the front liners of

85
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,580
our industry so we definitely have mad

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,620
respect for for what you guys are doing

87
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,060
and I guess uh I'll start by just

88
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,819
telling everyone a little bit about

89
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,739
myself I go by Marcus Richardson aka the

90
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:50,458
bubble man

91
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,739
um uh came from Manitoba originally at a

92
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,199
very young age I think it was 17 or 18.

93
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,420
I decided to become an activist in in

94
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,280
the Cannabis world we were in the Bible

95
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,619
Belt in Manitoba so we were like maybe

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,019
we'll do like hemp activism yeah we'll

97
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,680
do hemp activism because going to prison

98
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,120
with hardcore criminals was not my idea

99
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,040
of a good time and the prison that we

100
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,900
had outside of Winnipeg was very heavy

101
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,959
Stoney Mountain Penitentiary did not

102
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,720
want to be going into jail there as a

103
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,060
habitual florist so I avoided that we

104
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,280
did our hemp activism we got the first

105
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,060
hemp field growing in Manitoba in over

106
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,379
73 years that was in 1995 and my

107
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,478
partners went on to start the company

108
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,918
Manitoba Harvest with the work that we

109
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,019
did there so you may have purchased

110
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:37,319
those products at the grocery store or

111
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:39,599
whatnot I basically left in 96 from

112
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,939
Manitoba came to British Columbia

113
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,220
hooked up with Hillary black a dear

114
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:46,439
friend of mine who was just kind of

115
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,660
deciding in her life should I go

116
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,519
live in California with this guy that

117
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,160
I've fallen in love with or should I

118
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:56,339
come to Canada back to Canada and start

119
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,979
the BC Compassion Club and I watched the

120
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:01,258
BC Compassion Club you know get you know

121
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:04,500
kind of created on my living room floor

122
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,060
back back in 97 while I was living in BC

123
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,918
and Hillary was really one of the only

124
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,280
people I knew we had known her from

125
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:14,519
hempc from Mark Emery's place and so I

126
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,439
immediately became a sort of grower and

127
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,799
philanthropist to the BC Compassion Club

128
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:21,959
because I loved the idea of supporting

129
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,879
um the most vulnerable people in our

130
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:27,299
society people that are not only

131
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:29,819
mentally ill and terminally ill but also

132
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,579
homeless which is a pretty pretty

133
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,439
hardcore Trio to be to be rocking some

134
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:36,779
amazing people that I met back in those

135
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,160
days and we should all really thank all

136
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,019
of them for their pioneering work

137
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,020
because the whole reason we can have an

138
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,698
event like this today is is based on a

139
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,379
lot of the Civil Disobedience that

140
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,538
Hillary was practicing at the BC company

141
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,879
fashion club and that's how medical got

142
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:52,860
into Canada and Canada of course medical

143
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,560
opened the door for federal legalization

144
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,960
so shout out to Hillary black and all

145
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,060
the good Folks at the BC Compassion Club

146
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,978
I was helping them out a little bit too

147
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,139
much and at one point

148
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:05,639
um someone was trying to steal all the

149
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,500
Cannabis out of their safe trying to

150
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,819
steal the safe actually they drove a car

151
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,819
right through the front window of

152
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:15,000
Commercial Drive store back in 99 or

153
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:17,519
whenever it was 98. and so she asked me

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,259
can you take this cannabis home I'm

155
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,959
worried it's going to get stolen and it

156
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,600
was like I don't know 17 16 and a half

157
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,698
pounds and there was a bit of cash uh

158
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,979
that I I just took it home and that

159
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:31,800
night I went through a roadblock at the

160
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:34,258
Lionsgate bridge and got busted with 16

161
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,180
and a half pounds and six grand cash so

162
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,860
that was fun

163
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,978
um that really changed the sort of

164
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,220
course of what I was doing and how I was

165
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:46,680
sort of helping cannabis and the Civil

166
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,380
Disobedience I was practicing and that

167
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,360
led me to realize I wasn't just going to

168
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:53,279
be able to broker and sell cannabis at

169
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,020
the rate that I was doing which was at a

170
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:59,758
at a fairly High rate in 97 98 and so I

171
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:01,439
needed to come up with something where I

172
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,720
could I mean honestly I'll be honest it

173
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,699
was my lawyer John conright who inspired

174
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,580
this a great deal because I would give

175
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,620
him money like cash in a paper bag and

176
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,478
then that was proceeds of crime if the

177
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,759
police caught me with it but then he'd

178
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,459
take the paper bag to the bank and it

179
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,199
was like it was just legal money all of

180
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:20,758
a sudden like he was like literally

181
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,319
taking money from all these people in

182
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,780
the Cannabis industry putting it in the

183
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,939
bank paying taxes on it and it was legal

184
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,439
and I thought I need to figure out how

185
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:30,899
to do that

186
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:34,019
so I started a company called Fresh

187
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:36,538
headies and I started popularizing these

188
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:39,240
sets of bags that I co I coined Bubble

189
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:40,560
Bags which are the water extraction bags

190
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,960
that we'll talk a little bit about today

191
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,180
here that basically using water and ice

192
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,038
you can isolate the glandular trichome

193
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,500
heads of cannabis

194
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,459
uh and in a very pure form and we're

195
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,899
going to go through some macro

196
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:54,120
photographs and talk about that in a

197
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:56,638
little bit here as well so this company

198
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,038
was right at the onset of digital

199
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,460
cameras you know to give you an idea the

200
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:06,120
Sony Cyber Shot in 1999 was a 2.2

201
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,680
megapixel camera two megapixel camera I

202
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,879
was one of the first digital cameras

203
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,860
that you could take pictures of

204
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,199
something that was at your home and then

205
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,960
upload it onto the internet this was

206
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,579
also during a time where

207
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,519
cannabis.com

208
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:22,139
cannabisculture.com overgrow.com

209
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:25,198
cannabisworld.com all of these sites

210
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:27,900
were popping up and people who were in

211
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,960
The cannabis Community Growers and

212
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:33,059
dealers and hashmakers and breeders and

213
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,579
all of these different people were

214
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,379
suddenly like brave enough and they were

215
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,719
living all over where you could get in

216
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:41,338
serious trouble for this level of Civil

217
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,560
Disobedience that they were practicing

218
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,880
and now we were on a website and we

219
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,338
could all communicate with one another

220
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:50,220
and it was the most incredible thing and

221
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:52,440
the timing of that thing the timing of

222
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,879
me getting busted

223
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,339
um which I thought was the worst thing

224
00:08:53,879 --> 00:09:00,000
at the time and I learned that it was

225
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:02,459
probably my own manifestation coming to

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,440
me as they often do which is as an

227
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:07,439
obstacle and then you have to get over

228
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,720
your own ego and see past the obstacle

229
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,399
and turn it into an opportunity I could

230
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,440
have played the victim I could have woe

231
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,539
as me I lost the weed I lost the cash

232
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,420
I'm busted I'm a Heat score or I can't

233
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:21,059
sell weed anymore but instead I decided

234
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:23,219
oh maybe I'll Pioneer something new like

235
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:24,539
water extraction not just in Canada but

236
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,160
all over the world through these

237
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,319
websites and I'll start teaching people

238
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:31,799
how to make this incredible quality hash

239
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,959
at their own in their own homes uh which

240
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,819
was you know the opposite of sort of the

241
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,699
other concentration that was popular in

242
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,440
99 two months after I released my bags

243
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,560
Indra

244
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,260
released the BHO method on neurowa.org

245
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,719
and that was you know his karma was very

246
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,980
different from my karma and I know Indra

247
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,100
very well

248
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,080
um he basically put this method out

249
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,639
there as a scientist but not

250
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,500
understanding that young people would

251
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,600
get a hold of it and then they started

252
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,000
blowing up burning their houses down

253
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,879
blowing their hands off and doing this

254
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,860
whole variety of things that is very

255
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:11,159
very dangerous so it was a unique place

256
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,440
to be in 99 as the water extraction Guy

257
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,838
versus all of these BHO communities

258
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,760
which I will say now the majority of the

259
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,200
people I know from the BHO Community

260
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,958
back in the day

261
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,220
they all smoke live hash rosin so we're

262
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,719
going to talk about solventless

263
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,000
extractions

264
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,980
um the three different uh practices that

265
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,620
I personally use my solventless quiver

266
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,180
but I figured I'd take you through some

267
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,139
photographs because

268
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:38,759
for me before I could learn about

269
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:41,100
terpenes and terpenoids and thiols and

270
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:44,399
Esters and esterification of terpenes

271
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,379
and cannabinoids and trichomes and

272
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,159
capitate stalks and all of these

273
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,500
different

274
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:52,319
sort of terminologies

275
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,000
I first had to see what they were and I

276
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,140
wasn't seeing enough with my naked eye

277
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,299
so around 2007 2008 I started practicing

278
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,578
macro photography and I started

279
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:05,338
photographing cannabis with a macro lens

280
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:08,939
and and bringing it to my eyes bringing

281
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:10,860
that world into my brain in a way that I

282
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,920
could make more sense of it and have a

283
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,620
deeper understanding of of what it was

284
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,719
uh what it is that is going on at these

285
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,839
levels so I just want to kind of quickly

286
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,800
walk you through some of these photos

287
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,240
and then

288
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,139
um we'll talk a little bit about dry

289
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,419
sifting rosin and bubble hash so let me

290
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,338
see okay we're going the other way uh so

291
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:34,199
this this is just a picture of seeds

292
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,480
just a picture of seed it all starts

293
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,759
with a seed uh Julie Julie asked me

294
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,860
earlier oh could you speak to what makes

295
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,278
a great quality how do you make a great

296
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:48,120
quality as a hashmaker

297
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:49,740
hashmakers don't make great quality and

298
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,379
I know that might sound confusing to you

299
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,600
but what hashmakers do and concentration

300
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,759
extract artists whatever you want to

301
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,600
call them

302
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:03,360
they unveil what the genetics the genes

303
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,759
and the grower along with the terroir

304
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,700
and the methodologies of growing all of

305
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,278
those variables that's where quality is

306
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,060
created the hashmaker does not create

307
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:17,639
quality he or she

308
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:20,099
unveils quality if it's there and we do

309
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,759
that through what we practice which is

310
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,560
purification we create Purity you want

311
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,879
it to be as pure as possible and you'll

312
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:28,379
see in some of these pictures some of

313
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,200
the hash that I've made

314
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:33,720
is just that extremely pure this was a

315
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,240
photograph of Sleestak uh crossed with

316
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,360
skunk number one from DNA genetics uh

317
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,120
and it was I don't know 2009 or 2010 in

318
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,600
Amsterdam and uh at um Aaron from from

319
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,360
the D or the a from DNA Don and Aaron of

320
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,459
course is the name of those two guys DNA

321
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,320
um he asked me to take a photo for the

322
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,699
inside of one of their hats so when you

323
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,800
took the hat off you would get this

324
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,320
picture of seeds and it all starts with

325
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,120
a seed so I figured let's start this

326
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,360
with a seat

327
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,060
uh next up this is a macro photograph of

328
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,519
a hash plant seed that was 25 years old

329
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:11,159
at the time of cracking I did not keep

330
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,019
it in a freezer it wasn't a refrigerator

331
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,939
for about the last 10 years but at room

332
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,320
temperature for quite a while and I

333
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,300
thought it would be a neat thing to

334
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,959
document and it's also the striations

335
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:23,699
the the harshness of the of the crack in

336
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:26,159
the seed you can really see how how

337
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,019
sharp it is and I learned something when

338
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,419
I took these pictures because what I did

339
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:32,220
not know this is also a 25 year old

340
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:35,458
plant from Jamaica that I collected in

341
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,920
1995 and it's uh I wouldn't call it a

342
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:40,379
cultivar because Lamb's bread isn't and

343
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,120
it's Lamb's bread not breath it's the

344
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:43,679
bread of the Lamb that's what the the

345
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,419
cultivar is called lots of people mix

346
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,519
that up and call it Lamb's breath but

347
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:49,500
it's actually Lamb's bread and this was

348
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,600
you know Lamb's bread would be in

349
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,360
Jamaica kind of like someone saying

350
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,759
sativa it would be more like for a genre

351
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,639
of plants than an actual cultivar there

352
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,980
is no one single Lamb's bread plant but

353
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,079
there are narrow leave drug cultivars

354
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,620
that are considered to be lamb spread

355
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,659
you know around Jamaica less so now

356
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:12,240
unfortunately but um this one I

357
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:14,759
collected in 95 and it was spectacular

358
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,019
just a cool up close shot and you see

359
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:21,659
how sharp the husk of the of the um seed

360
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:24,720
is and how delicate and slug like the

361
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:28,259
root of the cannabis plant is so these

362
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,600
are extremely opposing worlds so close

363
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:32,759
together and that veil of like a half a

364
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,700
centimeter a quarter of a centimeter is

365
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,399
is life or death because if the seed

366
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,699
touches that sharp edge and grows out

367
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,159
and opens itself up uh it will be dead

368
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,359
so it's a very delicate process shout

369
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,039
out to the Breeders that are creating

370
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,440
good genetics and there's a whole

371
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,899
process on how this happens without your

372
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,579
seeds dying and this is a big part of

373
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:56,519
that process so this is called a

374
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:59,458
bitumint and this bitumen is like the

375
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:03,120
sack that the embryo grows in inside the

376
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:06,059
calyx when the male pollen hits the

377
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,919
stigma the pistolate hair it travels one

378
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,799
single piece of pollen just like one

379
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,319
sperm one egg travels down into the

380
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,659
calyx and it creates one one Single Seed

381
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,278
this brown pad in the middle is actually

382
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:20,519
what's sitting at the bottom of the

383
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,740
calyx and then that material is this

384
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,899
membrane that wraps around the embryo

385
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,879
and it allows the embryo to birth out of

386
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,578
the seed husk without

387
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,620
um without damage so this is a very very

388
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:33,179
important part of seed breeding and if

389
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,698
you're growing seeds that produce a

390
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:38,819
membrane that is too thin you'll have

391
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:40,198
less success rate in your germination so

392
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,579
this is I don't know I find it

393
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:43,919
interesting maybe you will maybe you

394
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:45,838
won't just a couple more pictures of

395
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,519
this bitumen

396
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,199
because I thought it was so neat anyone

397
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,320
that's grown enough seeds has seen the

398
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:54,599
bitumen get trapped on the cotyledon

399
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,639
these are the first two leaves on the

400
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,040
plant and as any grower knows they're

401
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,600
they're called the cotyledon they're not

402
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,759
true leaves in the sense that they're

403
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,500
not serrated they're just round little

404
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,720
leaves and they're called the cotyledon

405
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,759
when the bitumen gets trapped on the

406
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,639
cotyledon the way this is if you don't

407
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:15,120
help it and remove it it'll only take a

408
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,799
couple of days before the interior the

409
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,078
epicado which is the part that we're

410
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,759
going to see next the true cannabis

411
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,698
leaves that are trying to come out in

412
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,500
the v the bottom of this photo uh they

413
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:27,659
suffocate and they die and then then

414
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,639
that is also a poor germination rate

415
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:31,500
this is just kind of cool I thought it

416
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,839
looked like a walnut husk it's just the

417
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,659
seed husk that the cannabis plant and

418
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,300
the bitumen has expelled after after

419
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:41,458
rooting and growing

420
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:44,578
and another photo of the same thing with

421
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:46,799
the cotyledon and that bitumen all in

422
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:49,198
one place they all used to be residing

423
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:52,078
right inside this little husk I just

424
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,758
think that's so cool personally uh and

425
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,620
yeah this right where this little piece

426
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,600
of light is is where we're gonna see the

427
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,519
Epic Auto produce

428
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,399
uh and this will also be interesting for

429
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,078
people so you see these little arms that

430
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,539
you can see right away the Epic Auto

431
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,639
looks like wet tissue paper and it is

432
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,578
pretty much that delicate and so it

433
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,259
grows these types of

434
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:15,298
non-glandular trichomes so these are

435
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:17,699
trichomes that have a different purpose

436
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:20,699
than producing aromatic volatiles and

437
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:24,900
cannabinoids instead they produce these

438
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:28,140
little arms that allow the Epic Auto to

439
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,120
pull itself off of the cotyledon without

440
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,280
getting stuck and anyone that's grown

441
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:35,058
has seen once again if you don't produce

442
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,859
genetics that produce strong enough

443
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:39,359
trichomes in this particular place on

444
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:42,240
that epic Auto coming out of the

445
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,918
caudalodon you can run into problems and

446
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,079
all of these things you can see how deep

447
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,660
this Rabbit Hole goes right literally

448
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,099
with your eyes you can see it it's

449
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,558
really quite something to start

450
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:55,199
understanding like what in the genetics

451
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,119
creates a strong success rate of

452
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,360
germination and then that's not even to

453
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:03,538
get into a count What gene synthesis are

454
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:06,538
present and turned on meaning you know a

455
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:08,579
plant that has a gene synthase of cbda

456
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:11,279
if it's in the off position that plant

457
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:14,159
will not produce cbda you can take that

458
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,740
plant as breeding stock and produce cbda

459
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,720
in in The Offspring because the synthase

460
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,120
is there but you need to breed it in to

461
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,860
be turned on so all of the volatile

462
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,839
organic compounds those are Gene

463
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:27,959
synthesis that are turned on to produce

464
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,579
these very unique profiles that uh that

465
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,140
Julie definitely loves because I heard

466
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:32,879
her talking about it I think it's so

467
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,340
awesome how much she Geeks out on

468
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,260
cannabis and absolutely just truly loves

469
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:39,720
cannabis and it's one of the unique

470
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:41,339
things about our community it's uh it's

471
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,558
really something that a lot of us

472
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:45,779
absolutely love you can see a little

473
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:48,298
damage on the cotyledon here that's

474
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:50,220
probably from where that membrane was

475
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:52,019
left on a little bit too long and you

476
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,419
can see it just starts eating into the

477
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:56,700
plant and that plant would have been

478
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,380
dead in a very very near future that's a

479
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,120
25 year old seed so I don't know how

480
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,740
many of you grow but maybe I don't even

481
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:03,779
know how many of you are over 25 years

482
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,940
old but when you have a seed that's over

483
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:07,918
25 years old or around that you want to

484
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,840
give it the best care are possible you

485
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,720
can see here the epicodle is absolutely

486
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,279
covered in trichomes now the top of it

487
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,079
is very white that's where the two

488
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,359
leaves meet they're going to separate

489
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,038
here very soon

490
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,899
this is just a cool picture of a

491
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:23,759
pistolid hair I thought it was like

492
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,460
buddies you know they're just holding

493
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,079
hands on the plant this is where the

494
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,759
seeds you can see these are other types

495
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,798
of trichomes that are growing on the

496
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,900
outside of this pistolid hair each

497
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,759
pistolit hair comes out of a calyx

498
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,660
sometimes you'll get two coming out of a

499
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:41,460
calyx and that's how the plant gets

500
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,759
pollinated pollen hits one of those

501
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,380
trichomes it gets sucked into the

502
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:49,980
interior of the pistolate and travels

503
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,140
down below and produces a Seedling to

504
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,240
pass on that to genetics

505
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,759
this would be the mycorrhiza sphere of

506
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,500
the root system so just a kind of very

507
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:01,200
hard picture to take but this is the

508
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,298
root tap and these little mycorrhiza

509
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,700
sphere hairs are the things that will

510
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:08,579
help the plant sequester the compounds

511
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,679
that it needs in order to express itself

512
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:13,379
in the way that it that you want it to

513
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:17,220
which is ideally strong terpene and

514
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:21,299
volatile organic compound expression and

515
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:23,519
obviously a nice strong cannabinoid

516
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:25,619
profile as well

517
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,079
so this is a picture of the Epic Auto

518
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:29,519
it's now growing a little bigger and I

519
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,038
wanted to show this because a lot of

520
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,940
people that tell me they grow say oh we

521
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:35,460
don't

522
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,500
um spray once it blooms once the

523
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,538
trichomes are in development We Don't

524
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,640
Spray anymore and I show them this

525
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:45,419
picture and say these are glandular

526
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,799
trichomes on the first set of leaves of

527
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:50,460
a Seedling

528
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:53,519
so yeah ideally particularly if it's

529
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,980
some sort of systemic systemic poison

530
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,660
Don't Spray those on on your plants

531
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,058
we're volatizing this stuff into our

532
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,919
lungs and it's probably best this is

533
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,918
also a picture of the Epic Auto showing

534
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,780
clearly bulbous trichome heads all over

535
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,240
the outside of it as well as once again

536
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:11,220
another type of glandular sorry

537
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,319
non-glandular trichome which is called

538
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,960
the systolith hair

539
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,819
so there's in general about six of these

540
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,798
different types of trichomes I've shown

541
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:23,038
you quite a few of them on the Epic Auto

542
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:25,619
on the pistolid hair and also the

543
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,558
systolith hairs here on the on the Epic

544
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:29,519
Auto so those are three types of

545
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:31,139
non-glandulars then we're going to talk

546
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,819
about the three types of glandular

547
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,380
trichomes

548
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:36,240
um which you know here's a couple of

549
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,159
them right here this is oh I don't know

550
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,558
what I did there I don't know what I'm

551
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,820
doing here sorry I think she has this

552
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,819
set up a little different than I

553
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:47,939
normally do bear with me

554
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:48,899
I think we're back yes okay so this is a

555
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,700
picture

556
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,860
um I took of a good friend of mine's

557
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,360
cannabis it was the Burmese [ __ ]

558
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:57,178
incredible

559
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,859
and this was Opus from Cannabis culture

560
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,440
days I liked it because it had a

561
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:04,439
refraction of a cannabis leaf in the

562
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,919
trichome head so these taller trichomes

563
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,500
are called uh capitate stock

564
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,780
and these little shorter ones aren't

565
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,700
actually capitate Stalks at a different

566
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:16,139
level of maturity but they're a totally

567
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,319
different type of trichome called

568
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,240
capitate Cecil

569
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,158
the first ones we saw that were just the

570
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,140
little balls stuck on the leaf those

571
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,419
ones are called bulbous and from an

572
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,120
inhalation standpoint you want a

573
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:32,640
cultivar that has capitate stalks and

574
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:35,038
capitates cecils especially from an

575
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,980
extraction standpoint and we'll talk a

576
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,900
little bit about that so keep in mind

577
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,339
all of the medicinal compounds some of

578
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,440
you may want to argue this in your mind

579
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:47,658
but science disagrees with you

580
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,940
all of the volatile compounds all of the

581
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:54,840
cannabinoids are found inside the

582
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:58,140
glandular trichome of this head these

583
00:22:54,839 --> 00:23:00,058
capitate stalks are made of cellulose so

584
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,080
like the same thing a cardboard box is

585
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:03,119
made of

586
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,099
which is also what the majority of the

587
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,918
plant is made out of cellulose and and

588
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:10,439
fiber so really what what you learn

589
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,580
about cannabis that the same way when it

590
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,220
produces if you want to produce

591
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:16,740
wonderful cloves from hemp you don't

592
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:19,259
take the seeds you don't take the resin

593
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,980
you don't take the buds you take this

594
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:25,200
the the cellulose and the fiber from the

595
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,659
plant so you take the one from the hole

596
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,960
if you want to access the essential

597
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:33,360
amino acid-rich seed oil in the embryo

598
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,480
you don't squish the cellulose you don't

599
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,699
squish the fiber or the bud you take the

600
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,980
seed and squish that or remove the

601
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,200
embryo and ex that's where all of the

602
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,240
essential amino acids are produced in

603
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,759
the plant so it's not like this is my

604
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,640
opinion it's just the way the plant is

605
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:53,099
if you want to access the cellulose for

606
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,559
making paper you don't use the seeds you

607
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:57,359
don't use the bud so when it comes to

608
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,579
accessing the medicinal components

609
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,979
whether it's for um

610
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:03,480
recreational perspective or medical

611
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,759
perspective

612
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,860
it's all happening in this resin gland

613
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,960
and I have people all the time tell me I

614
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:12,240
don't like hash I just smoked the flour

615
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,819
and I just say well that's okay you're

616
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,519
still smoking the hash you just prefer

617
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:19,740
it diluted on biomass so that you're

618
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,658
getting less amounts of it and it's it's

619
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,339
different like when you smoke cannabis

620
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:25,200
it's totally different from when you

621
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:27,779
smoke hash there's no doubt about that

622
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,600
but if I take the resin off the Cannabis

623
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:32,639
and I do it really well and you smoke it

624
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:36,359
you won't want to smoke any more of it

625
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,360
like factual you just the resin needs to

626
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:41,639
be present on the flower to to create

627
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,439
the high that you're getting there so

628
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,840
glandular trichomes three different

629
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,820
kinds this is a Astro Boy photo I grew

630
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,619
this plant and I photographed it this is

631
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,960
a really good example of the capitate

632
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:54,538
stalk how tall it is and then

633
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,220
decapitates cecils next to it

634
00:24:54,538 --> 00:24:58,919
when you're producing hash producing

635
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,200
cultivars for the hash Market you know

636
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,960
there's plants that have 40 bulbous

637
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,880
heads so 40 of all the trichomes on the

638
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,400
plant are bulbous and you have to

639
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,780
understand that

640
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,460
they don't extract in solventless

641
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:13,500
processing they don't extract with

642
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,140
mechanical screen separations they don't

643
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:19,259
wash off the plant washing and dry

644
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:21,120
sifting require this long cap this long

645
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:23,339
stalk with a little head on top where

646
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,379
it's easy to break it off and it snaps

647
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:27,538
off and then you use a variety of ways

648
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,520
to isolate those which we're going to

649
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:31,200
talk about for a few minutes after I get

650
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,900
through these photos

651
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,120
another fan Leaf this is always a good

652
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,159
sign you want to grow genetics that

653
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,459
produce large amounts of cannabinoids

654
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:45,539
I'm not as much worried about high THC

655
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:49,079
but I do like a very dense amount of of

656
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:50,759
trichomes and I want 90 to 95 of the

657
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:52,859
trichomes that are on the plants that I

658
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:55,500
wash to decapitate stocked and capitate

659
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:58,139
Cecil I want five percent or less to be

660
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:01,140
bulbous and if you isolated these these

661
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,360
glands into capitate stalks capitate

662
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,159
Cecil and bulbous you and you hit the

663
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,918
bulbous ones you'd realize they're

664
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:10,559
they're waxy they're thick they contain

665
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,659
a very unique oil compound that often

666
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,639
lights on fire if you have a flame near

667
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:17,640
it it's very much like the 45 Micron

668
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,500
bubble hash but very hard to extract and

669
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,299
it's the difference between solvent and

670
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,319
solventless when you have a solvent guy

671
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:25,859
say

672
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:27,720
I ran that material and I got 24 and you

673
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:30,479
have a solventless guy say wow I ran

674
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,240
that material and I got 14 these are dry

675
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,558
weights not fresh frozen where does that

676
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,480
difference come from that difference

677
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:40,319
comes from the fact that he's using a

678
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:43,259
solvent or she to isolate or to extract

679
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,819
and melt all trichomes present so all

680
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:47,278
the bulbous heads are going in there and

681
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:50,519
if it's 40 you're gonna literally get a

682
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,619
a 40 yield higher than your solventless

683
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:55,019
counterpart this is also important for

684
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:56,639
LPS and hashmakers to understand these

685
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:59,099
things so that they're not making hash

686
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,259
from the wrong genetics if your whole

687
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,538
process is to make dry sift and you're

688
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:05,900
using cultivars that are bulbous rich in

689
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:08,579
the glandular trichome area

690
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,259
you're missing the the boat you need to

691
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:12,720
kind of go back and be like okay we need

692
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:15,538
to have specific cultivars for specific

693
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,000
processes otherwise uh in these tough

694
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:19,798
margins that we're in it becomes uh a

695
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,200
very difficult this is a UBC rock star

696
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:24,359
from Remo the urban grower I thought it

697
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,159
was a good plant to show the anthocyanin

698
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:28,740
and striations in the capitate stock

699
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,659
these little purple colorets they often

700
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,298
come in through stress

701
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:34,919
cold different things that happen to the

702
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:36,599
plant in the fall that's why a lot of

703
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,179
plants produce anthocyanins and

704
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:41,399
antioxidant it's it's found in blueberry

705
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:43,798
skin it's found in

706
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,140
um all sorts of different flowers and

707
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:48,720
it's healthy to take orally not so much

708
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:51,419
to smoke it it is water soluble so your

709
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,720
water when you wash anthocyanin and Rich

710
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:58,620
products the water will be very purple

711
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:02,278
it doesn't very often translate into the

712
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:04,379
resin itself it can with rosin but very

713
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:07,019
it's it's less likely with bubble I've

714
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,120
seen it but it's far and few between

715
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:11,278
just a little bumblebee that landed on a

716
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,019
plant when Johnny B and I were on my

717
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,640
deck One Day filming a puff Wednesday

718
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:16,079
and this little guy came and landed on

719
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,880
it was one of Johnny B's buds actually

720
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,980
shows you the difference between the

721
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,120
size of an insect and you can see in the

722
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,038
corner here these are the glandular

723
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,339
trichome heads I thought it was kind of

724
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:28,019
a neat photo uh just to a horrify anyone

725
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:30,298
that wanted to see what an insect looked

726
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:32,460
up close but also to show the difference

727
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:35,759
between a tiny little insect yet it's

728
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,440
still like 50 to 100 times bigger than

729
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,379
those trichomes

730
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,880
some trichomes that were really showing

731
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,679
you know you can see these little

732
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,200
circles are different types of

733
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,059
organelles and so you have plastids and

734
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,278
you have vacuoles and plastids produce

735
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:52,740
phenols and vacuoles produce

736
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:55,319
hydrocarbons and those hydrocarbons are

737
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,140
terpenes and so these are the little

738
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:01,259
Labs that cannabinoids become cooked

739
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:04,860
into existence it's the reason why I

740
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:08,158
prefer hash over oil whether it's rosin

741
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:10,259
or or full melt bubble I find fomel

742
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,840
Bubble to be much more of like a five

743
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:14,759
course meal because the laboratory that

744
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:18,000
cooked all of these compounds into

745
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:19,859
existence is present it gets it's it's

746
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,359
in the resin gland so you're not

747
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:23,158
filtering it out with heat and pressure

748
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,558
that being said I certainly wouldn't

749
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:28,260
kick rosin out of bed for eating

750
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:29,460
crackers uh that's something weird my

751
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:32,700
dad would have said back in the day

752
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,440
about something else but uh I said it I

753
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,659
said it I thought this was cool too

754
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,179
couple trichomes pounding each other out

755
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,399
respect mom on some Jamaican tricoms

756
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,778
right there

757
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,579
remember what the cultivar was but it

758
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:46,440
was from my buddy Archie in Kingston

759
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:48,119
growing great weed it would have been

760
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,558
something gassy and cushy for sure

761
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,319
because that's what those guys loved

762
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:55,379
this is five minutes perfect this is a

763
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:57,119
picture of material that I washed this I

764
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,340
will talk about bubble hash real quickly

765
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,079
for those of you that know or don't know

766
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:03,599
this is a way to purify glandular

767
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,639
trichome heads into a very pure form

768
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,158
isolating them using water and ice

769
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,200
breaking the heads off they sink they're

770
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,000
very brittle in the cold ice water in

771
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,919
the mixture they break and they're still

772
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,619
affected by gravity so they sink in the

773
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,140
water while everything else floats you

774
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:20,939
end up with a very um clean product you

775
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,100
can see these are all capitate stalks

776
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,320
and cecils with no heads on them so I

777
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:27,058
clean that plant very effectively and

778
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:29,339
then you can also see when you clean the

779
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:31,678
plant effectively this is what your hash

780
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:34,740
should look like and this is what I

781
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,080
meant by purity this grower this breeder

782
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,179
produced an incredible genetic produced

783
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:42,619
an incredible expression of that genetic

784
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:45,600
grew to Perfection all I really did was

785
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:48,058
isolate the resin glands and purify them

786
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:51,959
so did I make it did I make the quality

787
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:53,359
no I created the Purity which unveiled

788
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,740
the quality

789
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,959
unveiling the flame this is some of my

790
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,720
mentor skunk band Sam's full melt dry

791
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,159
sift been sifted to Perfection this is a

792
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,140
much harder thing to do when you don't

793
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,419
have water on your side and everything

794
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,759
is falling through hopefully I'll get to

795
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:10,799
speak on the difference between dry

796
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,379
sifted these are dry sifted but they're

797
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:16,819
very clean sorry keep doing that but

798
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,820
we'll go back down here real quick

799
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,538
we're almost done I took a lot of photos

800
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,579
holy [ __ ]

801
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:25,259
so these are all dry sifts we can kind

802
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:27,480
of whip through them and then there's

803
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:29,398
some rosin and some dry sift pressed

804
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,798
this is some bubble hash that's very

805
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:33,719
fresh but what I wanted to get to these

806
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:36,960
are these are air dried products from

807
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,659
Barcelona uh really nice orange soils

808
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,340
and and heat that volatizes the product

809
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:43,020
while it's drying so we're not using

810
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:44,879
freeze dryers in this instance it

811
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:46,619
congeals together and it's very

812
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,539
different these are all Air dried

813
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:50,339
bubbles from back in the day uh

814
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:52,019
producing different colors this shows

815
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:54,720
the purity of the bubble we call this

816
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:57,960
six star full melt bubble uh it melts

817
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,419
into a liquid and it is really the Holy

818
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,278
Grail of the of the hash world I don't

819
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,538
think it'll be sold at dispensaries for

820
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:05,159
a while I don't think it'll be something

821
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:08,220
you see your customers coming in and

822
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,799
asking for quite as much as pre-rolled

823
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,679
joints and other hashes but uh we'll get

824
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:16,019
there as we do it together more rosin

825
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,600
what I wanted to show was what dry sift

826
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:21,480
looks like under the microscope so you

827
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:22,740
saw the bubble hash you saw the purity

828
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,419
of the bubble hash this is really

829
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,339
important from a bud tender standpoint

830
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,960
when someone comes in and they say I

831
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:30,000
want the best bang for my buck I want to

832
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,819
buy a grandma hash and there's a forty

833
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,759
dollar gram of bubble and but there's a

834
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:38,519
20 or a fifteen dollar gram of dry sift

835
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,140
you have to understand the 15 to 20

836
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:42,000
dollar gram let's say it's twenty

837
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:46,200
dollars which is half the price of the

838
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,179
Bubble at 40. the purity of this is ten

839
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,980
percent and if you understand what that

840
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,259
means it means 10 percent of this

841
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:55,919
product is glandular trichome heads and

842
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:58,200
active ninety percent of it is not which

843
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,380
means to get one gram of glandular

844
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,259
trichome heads you would have to buy 10

845
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,539
grams of this product at fifteen to

846
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:10,200
twenty dollars a gram so now you're 200

847
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:12,000
into your gram of heads versus the Forty

848
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,580
dollar gram that you could have got of

849
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,759
bubble so this isn't a story that the

850
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:20,939
COA is telling oh well this one's 60 THC

851
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:22,679
and this one's 30 so 40 bucks 20 bucks

852
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,298
it makes sense it's half the price it's

853
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,519
half the THC

854
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:28,319
that's just confusing people the reality

855
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:30,899
is you want to understand when you're

856
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:33,058
purchasing hash what is the purity of

857
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:35,579
the hash of glandular trichomes what is

858
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:37,259
the percentage of trichome heads that

859
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:39,119
are in that hash

860
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:41,099
um now don't get me wrong sometimes you

861
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,859
need sift like this I like it to be at

862
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:46,019
least 20 to 25 percent heads but when we

863
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:48,119
make our Hazel joints which are the pure

864
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:51,359
hash joints that have no paper and no

865
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:53,219
glue it can't be too high of a purity if

866
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,079
it's that full melt bubble and you go to

867
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,700
light the joint and it starts dripping

868
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:58,980
and melting and it won't burn

869
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,600
consistently then that product is not

870
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,419
going to be effective so there are times

871
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:05,519
where you want hash to be of this

872
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:08,460
particular caliber but in my opinion

873
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,619
it's for novel products where you and

874
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,539
and the fact is also it's a much more

875
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:14,940
Mellow Smoke and a lot of people that

876
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:16,800
smoke hash I'm sure you guys would agree

877
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,838
with this not most people are not

878
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,119
carrying around Rigs and smoking hundred

879
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:22,980
dollar grams of live hash rosin that is

880
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,838
a small percentage of the customers that

881
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,940
are coming into dispensaries they want

882
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:28,918
pre-rolled joints they want gummies and

883
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,500
different drinks and of course herb

884
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:34,199
eighths and and ounces and whatnot but

885
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,239
uh hash is still very much Niche so it's

886
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,519
all about kind of educating it's a fun

887
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,959
little rabbit hole to go down

888
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:42,239
um I have a bunch of different social

889
