106
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,800
right here first few I sat over

107
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,319
here but then they had this nasty bong

108
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,280
and I didn't want to sit too close to it

109
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:34,319
I was like yesh I have got to get out of

here so we set up over

111
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:42,159
here of course it's Whistler so every

112
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,160
house has a

113
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,960
view so I don't know if that's W no

114
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,319

118
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:14,878
warm for Whistler right now it's never

119
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:17,519
this warm it's um not in February anyway

120
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,240
so uh most of the snow has melted off

121
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,560
the ground you don't see really any on

122
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,000

breakfasts there uh we're gearing up to

251
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,240
go have a quick hot tub and maybe a

252
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,799
steam sauna here at the Weston but

253
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,198
before I've been meaning to do a couple

254
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:25,519
reviews on these units uh originally

255
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:28,879
jonthan from Wizard puff sent me the V5

256
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,278
o vaporizer from uh flower mate I guess

257
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,919
or it's called The Flower mate yeah it's

258
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:37,078
from flower mate vaporizer

259
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:38,838
technology and uh he sent me this um a

260
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:41,039
while ago now probably close to a month

261
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,360
ago told him I was going to do a review

262
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:47,278
never got around to it volcano since

263
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,720
sent me their Mighty another vaporizer

264
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,759
and the reason I feel okay about doing

265
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,319
this together is because Jonathan sells

266
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,560
both of them at wizard puff.com so we're

267
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:56,719
going to do a little review on these and

268
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,758
actually how we're going to review them

269
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,079
is we're going to take them up the

270
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,519
mountain today into the black home park

271
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,719
make sure we have them there with us so

272
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,120
we have uh an ability to

273
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,279
medicate so which one should we try

274
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,078
first straight to the flower mate the

275
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,359
flower mate open her

276
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:18,399
up open her up got my medtainer with a

277
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:20,359
little bit of herb that uh that I grew

278
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,880
back about a year

279
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,879
ago prepare

280
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:32,640
that sneeze

281
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,798
excuse me spicy weed so that's pretty

282
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,000
sweet did you just uh screw it on yeah

283
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:40,558
exactly it just screws on PO the bottom

284
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,679
this little guy has a ceramic I had a

285
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,319
really good little little book in here

286
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:46,798
that we

287
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,759
could so give you a little idea on this

288
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,038
V vaporizer it's portable design fits in

289
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:53,160
the pocket real easy Advanced

290
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,679
temperature control system ensures per

291
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,519
perfect function and perfect or purest

292
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,320
vaporization we're going to see um innov

293
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:02,599
a vapeway with three-way temperature

294
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,439
setting this I liked so it's got a nice

295
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:07,558
design to hold in your hand easy it does

296
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,519
feel pretty solid doesn't it m um now

297
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:13,720
level one which if you push this button

298
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:15,359
five times one two three four five yeah

299
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,798
blue light turned on and then inside

300
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,240
there it should yeah this little blue

301
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,558
light on the outside says that we're at

302
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,919
level one which is 385 de fhe so we'll

303
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,599
leave it at that we'll let it heat up

304
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,880
we'll pack it in a second um we can also

305
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,719
move it up to 400° F by um clicking it

306
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,159
some more times I I'm not sure how many

307
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,000
that that's on the next page to level

308
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:34,760
two and then finally a red color which

309
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,319
is

310
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:39,240
415° pretty cool option for a portable

311
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:41,480
vaporizer to be able to do that I like

312
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,159
that built-in lithium ion battery you

313
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,000
can tell the whole thing is basically a

314
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,880
battery no plugs uh to take with you

315
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,919
huge heating chamber huge ceramic

316
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,520
chamber helps you get best experience

317
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,759
okay it's got a Bora silicate glass

318
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:57,679
mouthpiece little slider on top cooling

319
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,919
holes there with the green button or the

320
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,798
green lights

321
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:06,240
super simple I guess uh here why don't

322
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:09,400
we Medan her a little

323
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,839
herb I think it's as simple as just

324
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,679
unscrewing the

325
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:14,678
top and then loading the

326
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,880
chamber

327
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,120
okay always interesting vaporizers are

328
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:28,759
always interesting in the sense that um

329
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,439
if you get them wrong

330
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:32,879
if you if you don't know how to do it

331
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,558
pack it incorrectly if you pack it

332
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,039
incorrectly or you do just the smallest

333
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,599
thing wrong you don't get the rip so

334
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:41,679
give it a rip let me and I'll find out

335
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:44,000
what you need to do to uh move that into

336
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,000
different

337
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,319
levels that looks like it's coming out

338
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,319
real

339
00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:00,240
nice milked up the little mouthpiece

340
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,240
pretty nice

341
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:06,079
showing them that's of

342
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,440
quality showing them up

343
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:11,240
close well this would be fun to have the

344
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,919
mighty and the uh the flower mate with

345
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,319
us the

346
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,080
V5 how's that tasting on the lips you

347
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:23,079
getting some nice pulls on that yeah

348
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,798
nice excellent I'm going to pack a

349
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,798
little bit more

350
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:30,119
for the next unit we'll try in a bit

351
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:33,639
here

352
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:36,959
oh yeah little rip let me give it a

353
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:42,280
shot nice that was two in a row you blew

354
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,279
that yeah three even yeah no it's not

355
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,119
bad

356
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,279
that's

357
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,720
doable now they also sent me a unit

358
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:17,200
along with this when you come back Dev

359
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,839
it's right beside the computer there

360
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,840
that little metal piece

361
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,919
yep

362
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,919
I thought he said it was an herb

363
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,278
chamber let's

364
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:48,199
see so yeah he said this was another

365
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:50,000
unit I guess that you could attach on

366
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,798
here

367
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,720
somehow not sure exactly oh I guess this

368
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,038
just comes out

369
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,000
maybe oh

370
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:02,839
yeah

371
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,839
that comes off much the way that comes

372
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,720
off

373
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:13,759
interesting I'll have to figure out how

374
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:17,678
to use this additional

375
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:20,440
piece uh seems pretty simple I guess you

376
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,278
just go like that put that in there I'll

377
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,759
figure out what this additional piece is

378
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:26,480
uh later on for you guys and make a

379
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:29,798
point on showing that to

380
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,360
you um yeah not a bad little unit you

381
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:34,079
know pretty small chamber in the sense

382
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:36,199
but if this is an additional chamber

383
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,960
like an XL chamber for larger amounts of

384
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,519
herb which I think it must be well then

385
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,798
that's pretty cool going to try and hold

386
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:47,839
the button down for 3 seconds moved into

387
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,240
the next color it's kind of a purple and

388
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:53,839
so that tells me now that I'm going to

389
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:57,000
move up uh above 375 deg or 380°

390
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,959
whatever it was uh and get myself into

391
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,960
yeah 385 so now we're going to go up to

392
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,960
400 so 15° temperature

393
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,080
raise not

394
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:18,319
bad not bad at all for the flower mate I

395
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,639
can push it one two three four five more

396
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,278
times and it shuts off it is quite nice

397
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,400
and small um this would have been a

398
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:28,038
bummer had it not been unscrewable cuz

399
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,559
you just snap that thing off in a hurry

400
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:35,519
and then you can uh you can close the

401
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:35,519
unit which is also pretty

402
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,720
cool you can close that unit right up

403
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,880
boom and then on the bottom the

404
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,720
mouthpiece just goes right back in and

405
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,600
closes not a bad little unit probably

406
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,278
good for warming the hand too feel it I

407
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,798
have hey out on the mountain yeah

408
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:55,119
that'll heat you up all right so that's

409
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:57,119
pretty cool flower mate we're going to

410
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,558
have that with us today and uh we'll let

411
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,119
you guys know how how many hits we get

412
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:03,678
out of that and how well the battery

413
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:07,239
operates and etc

414
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,080
etc all right and we'll figure out this

415
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,038
giant herb chamber as well I think it's

416
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:15,000
an an added herb chamber I'm pretty sure

417
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:17,558
so now from stor and Bickle from the

418
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,880
good people uh who brought you the

419
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:21,720
volcano geez that must be going back to

420
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,960
1999 or

421
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,319
2000 so this is called the mighty it's

422
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,840
uh I guess their Premier um portable

423
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:34,558
unit I never expect anything but sort of

424
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,199
exceptional quality from volcano uh say

425
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,079
what you want about the unit but it is

426
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,440
quality built it's got an incredible

427
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,798
warranty and they last a long time I

428
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,480
know people that have had them for well

429
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:47,000
over 10 years uh so this is a nice

430
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,640
little uh design here the

431
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
mighty it's got a nice little design got

432
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:57,080
a digital screen I'll peel that plastic

433
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,640
off uh comes with as volcano used to

434
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,000
sell back back in the

435
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,120
day this little guy here which is a

436
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,319
screen

437
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,599
pad and I guess you can put that in

438
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,000
there and that way you can use

439
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:11,558
concentrates here's the unit itself when

440
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,359
you push the power button on it vibrates

441
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:14,960
much like a cell phone and then you've

442
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,839
got your bottom temperature which is the

443
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,278
temperature that it's going to go to and

444
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:20,000
then you have your top temperature which

445
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:22,798
is the temperature that it is at right

446
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,200
now and this unit's pretty simple uh

447
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,398
it's got a cool little mouthpiece right

448
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,679
on the top here uh you can twist the

449
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:31,398
entire thing to open it up to reveal the

450
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,080
chamber and now if you were going to use

451
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:35,239
uh concentrates you'd put this little

452
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:38,119
fat screen right inside there and then

453
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,519
drop your um concentrate full melt dry

454
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:42,239
sift whatever on top uh the unit

455
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,240
obviously has a screen on the top here

456
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,319
as well and that just screws right back

457
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,679
into place super easy peasy also very

458
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:50,839
handheld and portable and we're going to

459
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,080
Devon and I are going to load it up

460
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:56,158
right now and let you know how it

461
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:57,879
tastes have to say the taste on the um

462
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,360
flower mate was pretty darn good yeah

463
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,039
man that one's brilant ceramic through

464
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,918
glass I mean uh that thing's awesome not

465
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,919
too shabby at all the size of not

466
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,240
everyone's like daily iPhone yeah well I

467
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,360
guess some of those new ones are massive

468
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,519
like yours but yeah that's like your

469
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,439
average one it's

470
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:20,079
true oh that smells

471
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,759
nice no that it does all right so here

472
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:25,879
we go into our chamber I like that they

473
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:29,200
made this very wide big open chamber so

474
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,240
that as you fill the herb uh you can uh

475
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,399
you know try not to miss and get herb

476
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,399
everywhere even though I still generally

477
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,880
do give it a little blast

478
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,519
out a little blast out all right so

479
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,000
we've got

480
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,398
195° celius which is geez it must be

481
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,159
about

482
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:53,719
42 or 400 something degrees I guess I'll

483
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,159
give this shot at first they did give us

484
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,960
also a grinder two little Grinders not

485
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,720
really my style they're kind of plastic

486
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,480
Grinders I guess probably people would

487
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,919
be pretty stoked still I guess oh yeah

488
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,240
you know knowing them it's I don't even

489
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,840
know what that is actually I don't think

490
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,519
that's grinder dude high performance

491
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,439
vaporizer that's like a component or

492
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,240
something to

493
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:21,399
it oh that is

494
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:25,759
tricky a component that one looks like a

495
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:28,239
grinder oh yeah filling the ground

496
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,519
herbs this is just tripping yeah the

497
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,798
other one's a grinder I'll have to

498
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,519
figure out exactly what this one is see

499
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,558
this is what this is remember when it

500
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:40,319
was saying filling and filled with

501
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,319
ground herbs that's what this

502
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:48,359
is ah so it's the it's the helper that's

503
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:51,440
what he was using to fill the units

504
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:54,359
somehow come on how does that go on

505
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,558
there wow okay this is a cool thing that

506
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,359
I'm just sort of discovering now it

507
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:01,720
looks as though

508
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:04,278
they have a way to fit this on top of

509
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,240
here and so your ground herbs just

510
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:08,159
naturally go right into the chamber

511
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,000
without you having to do what I just did

512
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,440
like an idiot that's awesome so yeah

513
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,319
we'll check that out in a bit I'm going

514
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,080
to hit this for now cuz it's heating up

515
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:16,079
something different for

516
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
sure

517
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:35,038
that was a nice tasting

518
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:35,038
rip

519
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,599
interesting M very flavorful it had the

520
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,880
unit had just turned off but I still got

521
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:44,519
my my

522
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,360
hit I guess it's got battery saver I

523
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,240
believe you got two large lithium ion

524
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:50,119
batteries uh in either side and then

525
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,640
just the middle is the actual Vapor

526
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:55,479
vaporizer unit then you have the screen

527
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,480
it's pretty cool little

528
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,398
unit

529
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:09,440
the screen uh the opening the the the

530
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,038
the straw is quite big it's not like

531
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,480
restricted at all you really get a full

532
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:13,480
flow of

533
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,558
vapor yeah that's

534
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,079
incredible wow that last rip I took I

535
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:31,200
was hauling on it kind of breaking my

536
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:33,480
intuitive knowledge of vaporizers and

537
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,600
that if you suck too hard you create

538
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,240
cold air that cools the unit and gives

539
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,678
you less of a hit that just did the

540
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,440
opposite I was pulling on it quite hard

541
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,600
for my whole hit I wasn't doing the slow

542
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:50,038
and steady I was just doing the vacuum

543
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:53,119
and that was a really exceptional Vapor

544
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:55,558
rip um obviously these units are in

545
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:58,319
different price ranges uh I'm not sure

546
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:00,278
exactly the price range um unfortunately

547
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,240
I didn't do that research I think this

548
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:04,960
one for some reason might be around the

549
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:09,679
$300 area and this one might be around

550
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,720
the to $150 maybe 200 not sure they're

551
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,880
both quality units in that sense but so

552
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,440
far for rip for rip this thing has given

553
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:20,320
me the most insane

554
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,320
rip the mighy speaks for

555
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,960
itself yeah that's quite something well

556
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,519
we'll bring both of these up on the

557
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,919
mountain uh actually we'll bring them

558
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,200
out to the hot tub right now and let you

559
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,559
know how they do around a hot tub and if

560
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,120
one gets wet see if it gets destroyed or

561
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:37,480
see if they're you know we'll just test

562
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,879
them out we straight to the test

563
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,839
straight to the test so see if they're

564
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,440
waterproof see if they're waterproof

565
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,519
exactly there's all sorts of things I

566
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,000
don't even know about this unit look at

567
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,440
this thing I just found the little

568
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,759
cleaner right up the bottom all right

569
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,759

hot tub over there so what I was

642
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:15,240
thinking is that I would hang my

643
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:15,239
actually I'll put it over by the hot

644

00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:15,879
I can't walk all the way

652

672
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:44,199
to smell the herb in the unit I think

673
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,079
it's a good idea to go s bubbles while

701
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,159
ready to go

702
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,519
mhm

703
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:07,480
this thing gives incredible rip

704
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,400
that

705
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,880
Sprout looking

706
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,880
good off in the

707
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:27,440
dis jeez I guess you could easily have a

708
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,760
rubber sort of piece on the outside of

709
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,440
this thing like a membrane and you could

710
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,240
easily hold it with a wet hand I'm sure

711
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,000
you could potentially even hold it with

712
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:38,639
a wet hand although there is an opening

713
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:42,519
right here to the uh power unit so keep

714
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,519
it out of water folks they don't claim

715
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:59,318
waterproof oh that's just darn good

716
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:02,078
tasty too that's the Astro Boy it was

717
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:04,039
really tasty yeah even old herb that's

718
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,599
over a year old and it still just has

719
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:10,159
that Wicked taste doesn't it nice little

720
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,160
high from it too I was just gazing

721
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,119
hookers I know you keep looking behind

722
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,359
me like there's someone there oh no

723
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,440
there was a dude standing there but it

724
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:19,759
was all good I wasn't just going to blow

725
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,920
it

726
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,079
out I would

727
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,400
have one of the beautiful things about

728
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,119
having a federal license here in Canada

729
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,838
is as long as you're not uh obviously

730
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:33,079
breaking anyone's personal rules

731
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:35,159
business rules or um offending people uh

732
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:37,039
with children and such that it seems to

733
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:38,719
be a pretty safe bet that um doing a

734
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,639
small amount of vaporizing in an area

735
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:43,679
that's not affecting anyone and not CH

736
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,400
and not affecting even the place I think

737
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,159
it's a good thing to allow people to do

738
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:51,240
such things rather than make them feel

739
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,118
like they have to go hide to Simply

740
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:55,358
medicate particularly for some people

741
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,119
that you know it really just requires a

742
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,000
quick one or two rip before they can

743
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,640
sort of self-regulate themselves back

744
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,719
from either an anxiety attack or a

745
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:08,440
potential seizure uh you know Tremors

746
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,439
from with people from with uh

747
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:28,318
Ms man that cool wind is nice isn't it

748
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,480
yeah all right shutting shutting down

749
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:33,159
the mighty going to go put that one away

750
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,920
talking to my

751
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:38,000
wife well we do have the flower

752
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,920
mate I guess we might as well just get

753
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,559
her done

754
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,079
son nice steam right into a hot tub I

755
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:47,119
like this I have to

756
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:51,079
admit that little sort of uh little

757
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,640
cubby hole to keep it put away in and uh

758
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:54,760
yeah I'm impressed with that oh we got

759
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:57,400
this

760
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,440
resin all right so that closes back up

761
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:03,760
this simply opens

762
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,760
up all the herbs still in there

763
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:09,519
nicely I'm still always want

764
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:13,599
to give it a little blowby blow so we'll

765
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:15,800
go 1 two 3 four five we get our blue

766
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,160
temperature it takes a few seconds to

767
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,800
heat up now this one's a little more

768
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:21,239
simple in the sense that it doesn't show

769
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,800
us any temperatures um we know that

770
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:25,519
there are three temperatures uh the blue

771
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,720
the the pink and then the finally the

772
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,119
are purple and and then finally red are

773
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:30,558
the three options I thought the second

774
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,119
one was supposed to be orange but I

775
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:35,800
could be mistaken now that I'm all uh

776
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,280
Vaped up at the hot tub here in the

777
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:41,000
Weston and that cool wind is feeling

778
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,000
proper

779
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,838
mhm nice day yep AB going be fun on the

780
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,318
mountain it is going to be fun on the

781
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:49,318
mountain isn't

782
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:58,159
it oh that's ready to go oh I bet

783
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,160
doesn't take much for it

784
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,759
that taste is

785
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:15,880
exceptional you really can taste a a

786
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:19,160
difference in the ceramic to The Boro

787
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,280
silicate as opposed to the um I guess I

788
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:23,639
guess it must be ceramic into more of a

789
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,960
plastic composite that uh uh the

790
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:26,598
vaporizer guys are using they also have

791
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,838
a bigger straw and a feel like I get a

792
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:32,599
bigger Rip but I'll tell you herb vaping

793
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:34,719
the same herb There is almost a sweeter

794
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:36,519
taste in the first you you took the the

795
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,598
first few rips the last time so I didn't

796
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:41,159
get that sweet taste but this time I I

797
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:45,240
got it all right let's hold this for 3

798
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:45,239
seconds I'll turn that to the next

799
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,160
color yep there we go wow It beeped like

800
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,240
a cell phone as well I guess they're all

801
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:53,358
doing it so yeah you can see the little

802
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:55,039
but the little uh flashers got a little

803
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:57,719
sort of pink side to it as well and we

804
00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:01,199
could even go

805
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:03,078
three more seconds and then she goes red

806
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:05,480
and now red is a

807
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:07,640
450° um temperature that it's going to

808
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,199
go up to we'll see if we can taste the

809
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:10,199
difference in that

810
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:18,919
rip just beeped again I'm guessing that

811
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:22,118
means it got up to temperature so this

812
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,680
unit is quite fast in regards to how

813
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:26,838
fast it gets up to

814
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:29,000
temperature um nice and portable I'm not

815
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:31,279
sure that it would survive a drop in the

816
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,679
hot tub nor would the other unit so if

817
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,240
you're going to be jumping in the hot

818
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:37,000
tub this uh winter uh and using these

819
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:39,078
units please be careful and don't expect

820
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
them to cover any warranty damage if you

821
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:43,480
get water into them that's why we don't

822
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,760
have the bubbles on here so so far so

823
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,960
good pretty impressed with both the

824
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,160
flower mate and the mighty love the

825
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,000
taste on both of them love the

826
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:51,519
portability and uh yeah it'll be

827
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,719
interesting to see how long the

things to look at all of this and just

937
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,159
think this is what we ride down we ride

938
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:43,919
down here we go through these trees we

939
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:45,318
go everywhere there's Boulders and big

940
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,159
gnarly

941
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:51,318
features Fallen trees and such and the

942
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:53,118
snow just covers them all up I mean I

943
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:56,119
can't imagine coming down these Cliffs

944
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,318
on our boards without that snow tell you

945
00:51:56,119 --> 00:52:01,000
that

946
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:04,358
much I'm finally getting into the into

947
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,079
the snow line up here this seems like

948
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:08,679
naturally a snow line that they didn't

949
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,680
have to push

950
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,160
down pretty

951
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,159

952
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:22,039

956
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:30,079

957

1029
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,280
medtainers not very often that I use

00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,838
them I'm not really able to shout them

1031
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,880
out cuz I really don't use herb that

1032
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:56,199
much as most of you would

1033
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:59,200
know

1034
00:56:56,199 --> 00:56:59,199
nice and clean in the

1035
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:05,358
chamber pretty easy going in the sense

1036
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:08,318
of how to how uh cleaning it and then

1037
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:11,440
reloading it even the wind is a little

1038
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:13,679
bit windy up here it's not

1039
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:17,599
completely windless up here and it's

1040
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:21,118
still pretty easy to load up not feeling

1041
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:23,640
overwhelmed the one finger

1042
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:26,280
clean sure the outside is all nice and

1043
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:30,879
clean before you screw the top up

1044
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,880
on this way so we don't lose

1045
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,559
it

1046
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:39,480
and we' got

1047
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:41,319
133° so far if you can see that not sure

1048
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,440
but uh yep we're

1049
00:57:41,318 --> 00:57:46,358
good about another minute of enjoying

1050
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,000
this View and then we're going to have a

1051
00:57:46,358 --> 00:57:50,159
nice little session with the uh mighty

1052
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,440
here on the Gonda so or this chairlift

1053
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:56,199
sorry uh I'd have to say how easy it was

1054
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:58,240
to find in my bag unload and reload turn

1055
00:57:56,199 --> 00:58:00,838
it on get it up to temperature and then

1056
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:03,118
here soon to take a rip I'm pretty

1057
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:05,639
impressed with that it also feels like a

1058
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,358
durable unit like if I dropped it maybe

1059
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:09,598
on a day like today where it's hard pack

1060
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:11,639
it would probably break but on a regular

1061
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,400
day where the snow it is just reg you

1062
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:16,798
know normal nice and soft snow it

1063
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,400
doesn't feel like dropping this would be

1064
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:20,400
saying goodbye to it it feels like you

1065
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,599
could come back down and get it and you

1066
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,720
know it could potentially still be on so

1067
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:26,720
but let's have a

1068
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:26,719
rip

1069
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:40,160
a solid size rip I'm impressed because

1070
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:42,000
um it's a cold wind out here the chamber

1071
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:44,078
really has to be sealed well and

1072
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,239
containing its own own heat well cuz

1073
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:48,240
it's a nice cold wind in my face right

1074
00:58:53,719 --> 00:58:57,879
now

1075
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:57,879
oh

1076
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,559
yeah brother man

1077
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:16,720
yep pretty good easy use for a chairlift

1078
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:16,719
unit great taste on it

1079
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:26,199
too can start to feel the temperature

1080
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:28,318
different uh difference up here now I

1081
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:29,719
wouldn't by any means say that it's cold

1082
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:31,318
but you can definitely feel the coolness

1083
00:59:29,719 --> 00:59:33,480
in the air from all the snow that's

1084
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:37,599
present now bad in the fact that the

1085
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:37,599
chair lift seems to be rocking at a good

1086
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:44,240
clip not bad on the mighty hey no not

1087
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,240
bad at all

1088
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:49,318
dude not bad at all near the end of it

1089
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,480
though what's that near the end of that

1090
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:52,279
hit give it a shot you might be

1091
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,000
surprised well how do we turn it up in

1092
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,119
the temperature like you said just oh

1093
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,440
yeah just with the this this one's

1094
00:59:55,119 --> 01:00:01,720
really easy yeah just like the up button

1095
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,720
click yeah get it up to 200 if you

1096
01:00:10,838 --> 01:00:17,480
like chairlift rips

1097
01:00:15,159 --> 01:00:18,838
sweet hey maybe we could uh get them to

1098
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,199
stop the chairlift so we could just

1099
01:00:18,838 --> 01:00:22,000
enjoy ourselves for a few minutes

1100
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:24,038
without the

1101
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,159
wind hey would you look at that we

1102
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:28,480
stopped

1103
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:29,759

are capable of doing off of uh off of

1108
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:40,318
some of the features in

1109
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,200
there you've been having quite a bit of

1110
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:43,798
fun in there the last couple of weeks

1111
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:45,279
yeah it's been good nothing well since

1112
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:47,559
the sun came out but it's still been

1113
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:50,920
bulletproof but it's still nice so it's

1114
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:54,079
good I guess from 12 or 1 till 3: it's

1115
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,639
uh it softens up a little bit in the sun

1116
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:58,000
yeah there soft spots and there's still

1117
01:00:55,639 --> 01:01:00,838
their icy patches in the shade it's

1118
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,960
still solid here still cold up here at

1119
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:05,920
night and nice you just got this to spe

1120
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,838
to a temperature I Heard It Go like a

1121
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,200
text coming in it's h we're already

1122
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:13,078
designed

1123
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:15,279
to um react to to that very sound of

1124
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:18,160
that particular vibration of what many

1125
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:22,280
iPhones sound like when they uh are

1126
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:23,639
vibrating what a freaking beautiful day

1127
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:26,440
now we're getting near the top here a

1128
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:26,440
little bit closer

1129
01:01:31,719 --> 01:01:36,639
and where do we head from here down to

1130
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:40,520
let's go down to Jersey down to Jersey

1131
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:42,960
and then up to the top of cat Skinner is

1132
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:44,759
that what it's called Uh Jersey and then

1133
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,358
we'll be a top cat skner and solar yeah

1134
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,880
yep all right just in this top shelf you

1135
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:50,440
yeah just fold the little piece in and

1136
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,519
get it in there and then I turn it off

1137
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:55,920
if you can just get this manage to close

1138
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:58,278
it all around that would be awesome

1139
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,240
I like just giving a real honest review

1140
01:01:58,278 --> 01:02:01,760
having it with us pulling it out

1141
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:04,439
throughout the day using it and letting

1142
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,680
people know uh you know what they uh

1143
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,240
we'll get a few other people that have

1144
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:09,278
never tried it before to hit it as well

1145
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:11,479
and see what they

1146
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:13,119
think that'll be of course Mountain

1147
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,480
device before the Mother Ship gets

1148
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,000
pulled out because you know I got my

1149
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,199
mother ship in

1150
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,318
here hell yeah I brought the mother ship

1151
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:22,639
on the mountain are you kidding me

1152
01:02:21,318 --> 01:02:24,639
people are like why do you bring your

1153
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:28,759
Mothership with you I'm like so I have

1154
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:28,759
it with me doesn't that make good

1155
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:47,318
sense I had my bag grab the other day on

1156
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,159
the peak chair I had my helmet and my

1157

go down to that big Kong even and get a

1490
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:43,560
a video or a few pictures before the DL

to lie we didn't have the water

1523
01:31:43,238 --> 01:31:47,279
initially we went up to the rendevu

1524

Whistler hospitality

1527
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:00,399
all right almost

1528
01:31:58,118 --> 01:32:02,158
done so obviously we can't have the

1529
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:04,039
denail up here without bringing very

1530
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:07,759
heavy batteries and my 40 plus pound

1531
01:32:04,039 --> 01:32:09,760
backpack is is already heav enough heavy

1532
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:12,880
enough so going to hold that for a

1533
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:15,159
minute y gear up some hits the hard part

1534
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:17,400
about this always is warming the hash up

1535
01:32:15,158 --> 01:32:20,198
to the point where it softens up so you

1536
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:22,638
can kind of uh get a little dab

1537
01:32:20,198 --> 01:32:26,719
maybe here check this

1538
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:26,719
so show you what we're

1539
01:32:27,158 --> 01:32:34,559
here look at that oh it's flake yeah and

1540
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:37,199
that's dry sift too it's not bubble

1541
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:39,960
hash how is it process uh just

1542
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:42,479
mechanical mechanical separations via

1543
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:44,000
screens you know just bouncing uh

1544
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:45,678
bouncing resin over screens and then of

1545
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,600
course uh you know some more techniques

1546
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:53,319
in regards to further refining and

1547
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:56,079
cleaning or decontaminating the resin

1548
01:32:53,319 --> 01:33:00,399
right pretty stoked about this

1549
01:32:56,079 --> 01:33:03,198
dude got to say I like that did there

1550
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:05,439

1551
01:33:03,198 --> 01:33:05,439
way to

features not bad

1557
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:26,759

1558
01:33:25,319 --> 01:33:29,719
difficult to deal with outside cuz you

1559
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:32,199
can't really see what it's doing but

1651
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:21,519
with a guy like Devon who who wouldn't

1652
01:40:18,439 --> 01:40:23,919
uh put himself in any unnecessary Danger

1653
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:25,880
he still feels that he's safe to have a

1654
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:27,920
rip or two and go and do some of these

1655
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:30,079
jumps feel that it helps you a little

1656
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:31,920
bit it well a collar bone like mine it

1657
01:40:30,079 --> 01:40:34,519
definitely helps yeah just to some

1658
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:37,679
tension and pain for my injuries sure

1659
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:39,040
play a big impact a little bit more CDD

1660
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:41,960
give a little bit more on the uh

1661
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:46,399
flexibility too I'm sure

1662
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:46,399
mhm it does helps with a lot of

1663
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:52,920
injuries

1664
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:02,359

01:52:53,118 --> 01:52:56,839
the fact that it's got a case in it so

1841

you can unscrew it from the top and

1842
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:00,480
still put it away inside and even if

1843
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:04,560
