bottle tell you when you go out on the

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,920
water you really want to make sure you

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,319
have a lot of fres fresh water with you

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,920
because uh the salt water is surrounding

35
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:39,438
you but it's pretty much useless yummy

36
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,560
little wet the whistle

37
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,398
there all

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,600
right all right all right all right

39
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,399
so got a new bowl today I'm really all

40
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,478
about the quartz you guys know uh

41
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,118
especially when I'm out and about

42
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,039
otherwise I love the silicon carbide and

43
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:58,840
the sapphire but Dil sent me this uh a

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,039
few days ago uh it's a brand new um

45
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,399
offset deep dish

46
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,159
bowl you can see it comes apart real

47
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:09,679
nice and it's just got a 144 hole that's

48
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,800
going to go right into my mother ship

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,439
now I do have a DC quartz Banger here

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,719
that I could easily rip as well but I I

51
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,400
haven't ripped this yet so I thought

52
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,239
this is my opportunity this is the one

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,239
you see it goes in real

54
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,239
nice boom boom could use a drop down on

55
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,599
that if you're uncomfortable with

56
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,200
putting a titanium nail into your pipe

57
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,840
whether it be a mother ship or any other

58
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,679
pipe I to totally understand where

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,000
you're coming from if I had a denail on

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,800
this I would 100% drop this into a but

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,959
for a quick little torch I think it'll

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,200
be okay I've got my hybridized

63
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,439
sublimator denail carb cap I've put the

64
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:52,238
top of the sublimator carb with the

65
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:54,359
bottom of the uh titanium uh denail one

66
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,920
it's got the D right on top

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,480
there and then I've also got oh man I'm

68
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,479
really loving this Dabber that Dil sent

69
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,719
me thank thank you so much guys I love

70
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:05,878
the feel of the wood in my hand what can

71
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,000
I say it's just a nice nicer than the

72
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:10,479
the feeling of uh the metal it's just it

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,840
fits like a pen or something you know

74
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,840
and then I brought myself a little bit

75
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,519
of

76
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,680
headband

77
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,920
rosin so this has gotten a little bit

78
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,200
dark but ooey gooey it was made from

79
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,759
some nice nice bubble has and the bubble

80
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,439
hash was very dark so I'm not overly

81
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,878
surprised that we've got a pretty dark

82
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:32,280
product here but uh I'll tell you this

83
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:35,158
product is is

84
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,799
strong no doubt about it so we got

85
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:40,158
ourselves a nice rip there uh this might

86
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,000
be my last denil or uh non denail

87
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,759
session on the boat I'm really close to

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,840
getting the denail hooked right up to

89
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,039
the boat I'll probably end up asking for

90
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,400
an extended whip might even put it right

91
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:51,039
here in the front so you can just plug

92
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,519
in the whip like that I think that would

93
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,919
be pretty cool let's give it a shot

94
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,920
shall

95
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,039
we so nice big torch nice set Bowl not a

96
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,958
big torch I mean a nice a decent Siz

97
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,280
flame coming off of this thing right now

98
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,039
it's really hard to see when you're

99
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,039
outside of the

100
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,400
sun give it a little bit of a seasoning

101
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,200
the best I can I know I'm going to have

102
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,358
people oh you didn't even season it oh

103
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,238
blah blah listen I don't need to hear it

104
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,039
torching it up real nice we'll get it

105
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,799
nice and seasoned for you okay change

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,199
that color as you can see it's going

107
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,199
nice and purple as I torch it

108
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:37,279
give it the best seasoning that I can

109
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:38,719
cuz I sure don't want to taste any at

110
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,879
all

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,520
metal so this is why we season the nail

112
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,519
get it nice and

113
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:54,439
piple oh yeah she's turning nice and

114
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,719
purple I guess probably this wasn't the

115
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:59,399
best bowl for me to choose when I'm damn

116
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,600
near out of propane or sorry when I'm

117
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,359
when I'm damn near out of butane and uh

118
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,439
the torch is running quite low but you

119
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,759
know what that's okay we got her she's

120
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,399
nice and

121
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,199
purple think she's off gassing anymore

122
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:16,758
but we'll see we'll just continue to hit

123
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,319
it if those purples to come in what they

124
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:22,919
do is they kind of come in the purples

125
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,759
and then they disappear so all of that

126
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,599
is what we will call the seasoning of

127
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,199
the nail you don't want that any left

128
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,039
over so you can see my nail went

129
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,520
completely purple and now she's almost

130
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,519
clear

131
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:47,159
again all right give it a last little

132
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,400
base to clean out the

133
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,840
bowl I'm pretty impressed this is pretty

134
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,918
much the

135
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,159
first well I don't really even have a

136
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,560
torch nail so this is one of my first

137
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,880
Nails I've actually had to season most

138
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,360
of the time they

139
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,918
I use the denail in such a low

140
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,439
temperature I just what I would do is

141
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:06,318
I'd H hook the nail up and turn the

142
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,598
denail way up and that seemed to do the

143
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,479
job so I've never actually done this

144
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:13,839
with the torch to season her out but uh

145
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:15,519
she looks clean more importantly she

146
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,859
smells clean she's starting to go pink

147
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,719
now a little

148
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,560
[Applause]

149
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,360
bit all

150
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,360
right seasoning of the

151
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:33,239
nail derbs

152
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,240
that cool down a tiny

153
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:37,360
bit so nice to have you guys out here

154
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,959
again I think we're going to be doing a

155
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,360
lot of boat sessions this uh summer it's

156
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,120
just so easy the boat's right on the

157
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,840
dock and it takes me all 5 minutes to

158
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,959
leave my house get in the boat and then

159
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:51,159
be out in the middle of the water which

160
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,159
is kind of surreal no one around

161
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,639
wow does that carb work

162
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:21,360
good unbelievable taste on that

163
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:24,719
headband you can actually taste

164
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,639
it like in your lungs it's not just

165
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,479
tasting in your mouth it lights up these

166
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,960
taste buds that are deep deep down in

167
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,478
your tongue I can feel

168
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:38,000
it like the taste of it right here and

169
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,318

170
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,879
the first time I ever had dank the first

171

feeling we've all had it where we've you

175
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,639
thought you knew what good herb was and

176
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,720
then someone gave you the

177
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,680
absolute chronic

178
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,840
fire and uh you hit it and you have this

179
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,959
minor uh Epiphany almost a religious

180
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,239
experience and uh that's pretty much

181
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:08,839
what I'm talking about with this right

182
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,840

183
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:13,679
I seasoned off the nail got rid of that

184
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,279
little coating that was on there and you

185
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,439
could smell it the tiniest little bit

186
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:22,439
but I'll tell you that hit was

187
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:22,439

00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:35,199
one and another one that's what that

191
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,319
tasted

192
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,278
like

193
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,320
well has a

194
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:45,000
little kind

195
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,040
of view of the house sound here so we've

196
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,559
got the mainland that attaches to

197
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,039
Vancouver and that goes down and then

198
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,559
you see this little Island right here

199
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,240
that's Boer and then between the island

200
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,799
you can see there's a

201
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,959
fair now that fer is coming from this

202
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:02,838
island which is called Bowen Island just

203
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,719
this part of it that other little part

204
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,440
is a is a different uh

205
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,320
Island that one there and then beside

206
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,959
that you've got Keats the flat one in

207
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,320
the background which you can barely see

208
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:17,199
is the Sunshine

209
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:20,240
Coast and then this giant right here is

210
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,040
like it's a big one is called gambir and

211
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,720
Gambier has a little friend at the end

212
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,278
called Anvil all the mountains in the

213
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,560
background are the mainland but the

214
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:32,200
front one Anvil this big front one which

215
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,719
is not the one in the background that

216
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,640
tip that you see that's a little on the

217
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,360
bottom half of it that's actually the

218
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:41,240
mainland again that's Elfin Stone

219
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,680
National Park on the Sunshine Coast so

220
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,959

little bit of a combination sort of fun

313
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,480

315

little combination of the two yes I like

316
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,159
that idea I think uh that'll be a little

317
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,240
bit different from our last video where

318
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,078
we just literally booted all around the

319
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,240
sound and uh you know from Gambier to

320
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,799
Bowen from oh it's good from Bowen to

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,799
what yeah no I was watching it earlier I

322
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:26,599
had it right on the front and it was out

323
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:28,319
balancing on that I'm so scared about

324
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,879
these things you know when I before I

325
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,120
got these I didn't want smoke out of

326
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:34,559
these because it was they're so

327
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,198
expensive and good looking that's a good

328
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,239
thing to always take off I find that

329
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:39,599
when it's left on that you forget it

330
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,959
sometimes cuz it looks like such a piece

331
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,320
of the pipe yes I've seen them get moved

332
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:46,638
real quick by people and those kind of

333
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,920
blow off when I've done that and

334
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:53,278
actually forgot it's been so gooed up

335
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,719
that it's stuck so I had to heat it up

336
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,039
to pop it off so I was lucky I got lucky

337
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,680
a few we're pretty close here now hey

338
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:02,879
yeah we are like how close would you say

339
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:06,359
that is I'd say that's a good 30 ft 30

340
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:09,078
ft 25 I'm going to move us a little bit

341
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,759
yeah I would too just so you know don't

342
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:14,039
collapse into the Rocks yep let's see

343
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:18,120
good idea it says it's only a few feet

344
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:22,078
deep here as well 30 ft deep 70 ft deep

345
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,320
50 ft deep I don't see no bottom

346
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,958
activity no it's not that easy to see

347
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,600
bottom around

348
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:31,439
here let's see if uh one of these times

349
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,759
I'll have to dive down and see if I can

350
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,959
touch the bottom and bring up a rock

351
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,560
what it's only what 200 ft some some

352
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,078
spots well if you're going to do that

353
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,838
I'd bring you over to a spot that was

354
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:43,359
like 5 600 ft so you could really

355
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:46,040
impress us really impress us that would

356
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,959
that would be impressive holy Christ

357
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,360
could you

358
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,198
imagine I'd come up like a big old red

359
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,039
snapper my guts and everything be

360
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,838
popping out of my [ __ ] mouth and my

361
00:15:53,039 --> 00:16:02,039
eyeballs will be blowing up and yep good

362
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:04,560
times good times too much wind too much

363
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:07,078
wind that's what I'm saying right there

364
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,479
we got too much wind why don't we uh

365
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:11,000
head around this island a little bit and

366
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,319
see what we can see we might see a

367
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,879
little bit of uh see a little bit of

368
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:19,240
goodness

369
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:21,958
torch d420 k out on the boat doing uh

370
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:26,318

his Dabber

373
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,159
no we aren't claiming originality here

374
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:34,639
we just saw other people doing it

375
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,240
thought it was

376
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,560
cool yes exactly I seen someone doing it

377
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,000
and I thought [ __ ] that's what those are

378
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:44,559
for not just a carb cap there's

379
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,159
something to stick your dab to and put

380
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,119
in the bowl right down to the thing and

381
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:52,600
Bam you're [ __ ] in why not instead of

382
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,278
taking your dab tool dabbing it in

383
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,800
putting it down grabbing this putting it

384
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:59,919
on stick your hoot to that I forget who

385
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:02,318

beautiful so we've got this we've got

399
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,798
that where did we do with the whole shot

400
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:43,000

here just hand that over to me when

402

just go it underneath yep Hard

404
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,679
Times Hard Times doing

405
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,759
this I'm going to go for the uh sort of

406
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,840
dual cab it up as you dab it up sort of

407
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:00,839
thing here see if I can get this

408

off of that uh titanium you know there's

411
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,400
a tiny little bit of difference from the

412
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,960
quarts but uh I mean it's really

413
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,798

ship and it looks like they're having

423
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,279
some sort of a little meal on it or

424
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,519
something at the back there there's a

425

of feet long that is

436
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,798
incredible I wonder if they're

437
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:48,080
dabbing in a perfect world we would roll

438
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:50,000
up and we would be the dab crew and we'd

439
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,359
be like hello yep dab crew here we're

440

443
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,240
adventure driving over here wouldn't you

444
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,038
say yes it was it was we got into some

445
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,038
Nar there I think it was from the ship

446
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:07,759
doing a little bit of a turn you can see

447
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,240
how the wood out there is disappearing

448
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,279
and then and then appearing and then

449
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,200
disappearing and appearing that's what

450
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,279
we really have to watch out for look

451
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,759
behind us too look

452

454
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,679
puffy little

455

clouds pretty beautiful though perfect

456
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:28,679
well I guess we'll uh we'll truck over

457
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:29,918
and maybe go to check out Pam rocks

458
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,480
where all the seals hang out and see if

459
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,240
they're what they're doing today have a

460
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:38,200
float and maybe another dab a float to

461
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,960
floating to all right all right it all

462
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,279

463
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,440
here see we got a little bit of seal

464
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:48,079
action on the Pam rocks sorry about the

465
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,360
Shady camera work it's hard when the

466
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:53,439
boat's moving to uh do good camera work

467

468
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,840
because this is the ocean and there are

469
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,240

712
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,639
thinking that well we're going to have

713
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:53,480
to wait a little bit cuz people don't

714
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,480

00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:12,039
Dempsey Road and it's a 15minute trail

719
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:15,760

we might as well hit over here so we got

721
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,920
baen Powell Trail we got Lin Valley

722
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:24,759
Dempsey Road 1 km 40 m we got Gross

00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:40,180

staircase as you saw cuz you were with

787

788
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:39,358
Rocks behind us you can see them between

789
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:41,039

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,199
what

952
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,440
happened this is what it used to be more

953
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,440
like right here sort of naughty roots

954
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,440
and

955
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:38,760
[ __ ] naughty

956
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,760
na super naughty

957
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,200
all right I think this might be the spot

958
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,880
where we're going to jump

959
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,798
out if I am correct it's hard to

960
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:31,440
remember I swear it's been 10 plus years

961
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:31,440
since I've been

962
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:38,440
here Yep this is where I used to climb

963
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:39,920
down although we can go down lower

964
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,240
before not we don't have to go from here

965
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,358
but yeah I used to see see how this

966
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:44,798
there's a little thing that goes right

967
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:46,318
into this River runoff I used to follow

968
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:48,199
it right down but there's a better spot

969
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:50,079
up here this is a good bench for puffing

970
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:52,558
on too though it's where the old trailer

971
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:56,720
used to come

972
00:49:52,559 --> 00:50:01,000
from isn't it this one fits just right

973
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:01,000
it's nice it's good to me it's

974
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,000
nice all right we've officially stepped

975
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:14,679
over the chain Ling fence and we're into

976
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,639
the Nar well we're not supposed to be

977
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:18,719
yeah so I don't know if it's this way we

978
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:22,440
want to go or that way we'll have to try

979
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:26,798
one way and then if it denies us we'll

980
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,798
shut her down and try another way

981
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,400
especially carrying this [ __ ]

982
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:38,639
camera all right all right and here we

983
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:43,400
go this is what we got

984
