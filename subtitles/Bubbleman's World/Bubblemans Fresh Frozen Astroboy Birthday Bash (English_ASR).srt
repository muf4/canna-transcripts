yeah no that's a birthday treat for real

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,930
what kind of friend brings this problem

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,000
now of course I'm not keeping the resins

9
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:41,909
but just to be able to make it and smoke

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,609

11
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:46,229
beautiful of birthday gift so I've

12
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:49,829
actually got a rarity here that you

13
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:51,209
haven't seen yet I've got all three of

14
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,100
the bunk bed kits

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,410
that we're selling right now from the

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,500
original the top grade warrantied for

17
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,968
life durable as a mofo except that I

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,890
have yeah exactly that's the

19
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,689
professional house makers kit that's the

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,960
most expensive fog gallon aid bag kit

21
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:09,950
that comes in at 320 plus dollars number

22
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:13,079
two which still has all the colors right

23
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,810
just a slightly lower GSM thread count

24
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,879
the bags are still quality right and I

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,259
use an outside bag to change the color

26
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:20,819
to show people that this is not an

27
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,319
original kit so that they shouldn't be

28
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,589
paying the original price this bag is

29
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,539
about $50 cheaper this kit I basically

30
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,630
passed the savings on of the slightly

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,450
cheaper material for the bags and the

32
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:35,188
cheaper out outer material and basically

33
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,890
patch that right on to the customer so

34
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,989
that bag comes in at about 270 thanks

35
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,599
Canadians hey are you much sorry and

36
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:43,798
then the final ones which unfortunately

37
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,209
these look a little smaller than those

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,920
other two kits because I only had a 1

39
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:49,048
gallon kit and these were fives but

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,728
pretend this is a 5 gallon kit now these

41
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,299
are the lights and these are the ones

42
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:56,188
where I really went out hard on the

43
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,890
savings I changed everything there's no

44
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:00,688
eight colors like I took away the eight

45
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,509
colors and put only three colors which

46
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:06,359
was a pretty massive savings for me

47
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,149
being able to not have to buy eight

48
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,159
rolls of full color which is you know

49
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,509
it's everything everything adds up it's

50
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,829
very expensive to buy eight separate

51
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,750
roll

52
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,210
I was able to pass on a huge savings on

53
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,430
the eight bag five-gallon kit of the

54
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,140
lights at just a hundred fifty bucks

55
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,520
that's like half price it's less than a

56
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:24,229
half price for the original so you know

57
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,360
what just lots of people always asking

58
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:28,189
for deals and always asking for cheaper

59
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,470
set so I like to accommodate we give

60
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:32,210
deals and we have three different sets

61
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:34,159
that can accommodate you for whatever

62
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,870
your priced price it's not to sound too

63
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,590
much like an infomercial cuz I like the

64
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:41,539
fact that John and ionize videos are

65
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,909
more chill and more real but I I never

66
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:46,549
talked about the bags that much and this

67
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:48,829
is a good time to do it and we use these

68
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,210
ones already we use the lights and one

69
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,459
of our other video exactly and we've

70
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,010
used the originals I did the originals

71
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:57,530
with Remo I believe and it's just a

72
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:59,539
matter of one day running but it's your

73
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,759

134
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:12,329
layer of or so yeah you can put more ice

135
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,329
in

136
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,089

138

[Music]

146
00:06:53,279 --> 00:07:02,469
I've done this before with me and

147
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:04,540
without with in with them this is a

148
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,330
perfectly that father was the 400 grams

149
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,620
it knocks this bag perfectly yeah I was

150
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:10,689
getting used to it I like my little

151
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,579
Rubbermaid bin so once that's all the

152
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:14,829
fresh I know I'm ready good to go and

153
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:20,639
this the 2.5 gallon nine point five

154
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:20,639
liter bin that I'm using good sign John

155
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:53,680
we have five nice pieces of ice here

156
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:55,779
perfect there we go back Sean so today

157
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,240
we're gonna use ice in the bubble now

158
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:00,009
machine as well nice just because our

159
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,650
water is not necessarily gonna be the

160
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,300
coldest coldest coldest you could start

161
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,099
turning that water on now actually I

162
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,110
will let that water run because it is an

163
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,510
outdoor hose in a black hose sitting out

164
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:14,020
in the Sun when it first comes out it

165
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:18,120
can be pretty warm and we're pretty

166
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:21,899
blessed with our water that just fits

167
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,899
Oh perfect uh no real it's gonna be nice

168
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:26,250
I can't even tell you how good that TGA

169
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,168
strain smells

170
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,500
I call it watermelon all the time it is

171
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:34,139
the Astro Boy from TGA and it is a

172
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,668
really nice strength there you go but I

173
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,080
was gonna put some ice in here to pour

174
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:39,960
in there so we're using the bubble bag

175
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:44,879
originals I'll get rid of the lights and

176
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,950
the standards and there's one more

177
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,480
little bud I found would you like to put

178
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,180
some ice in there so you keep that for

179
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,920
photography reasons later nice it's on

180
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:56,789
the gun no stuck to my fingers so good

181
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:58,139
boy one away we will but what we're

182
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:59,789
gonna have to do first to get a little

183
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,500
of this mounted because it's such a

184
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:04,110
perfect amount we basically filled this

185
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,120
that's the cool thing about the the

186
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,460
barrel shaped bag is that it fills the

187
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,429
Machine perfectly and just allows you to

188
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,290
mix as though the Machine the bag isn't

189
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:14,549
even there you know what I mean that's

190
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:16,528
what I love about this bag that's why

191
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:18,870
I'm so surprised when I hear people say

192
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:20,610
that they prefer the triangle bag and

193
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,490
that they're getting a bigger yield and

194
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:26,339
they get it I get my yield I get what is

195
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,350
there I never get less you know what I

196
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,560
mean if there's 10% that's what I'm

197
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,659
gonna get and having a barrel shaped bag

198
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,088
certainly isn't going to be it isn't

199
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,069
going to make it that I get any less

200
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:40,200
let's get some water on that yeah we'll

201
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,760
bring over the hose over here I'm just

202
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,320
gonna pass if I'm the camera here I

203
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,708
think it'll just reach if we're lucky

204
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,089
we're lucky I think we just happen to

205
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:49,679
perfect there we go so we've had the

206
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,860
pressure turned down there so we could

207
00:09:49,679 --> 00:10:00,419
do this

208
00:09:51,860 --> 00:10:01,620
we got lucky there I got it awesome you

209
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,120

215
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:17,958
ball yeah it's awesome

216
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:24,149
all right

217
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:36,889
oh yeah there you go dabbing and filling

218
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:39,589
up the bucketful ice here getting the

219
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:49,909
bubble now going it's just very nice

220
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:53,740
asking beautiful oh that's nice what did

221
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:53,740
we dab up there number two and three

222
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,769
[ __ ] oh gee I like that pack indeed

223
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,900
it is a very nice play I'm sure I like

224
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:06,350
it a lot it isn't yeah this is filling

225
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:07,639
up beautifully perfect yeah you're just

226
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,360
hearing now what's getting up to the top

227
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:14,480
which is great oh not even close

228
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,940
it's actually about halfway perfect yeah

229
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,440
and luckily it's got quite a bit of

230
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,640
distance about an inch and a half all

231
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,420
the way around the whole thing that can

232
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:22,429
fill with water

233
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:23,899
excellent yeah you know you don't want

234
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:25,489
to take away all your water the water is

235
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:30,980
definitely a very important component of

236
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:32,240
making water hash water and ice always

237
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,129
what you say keep it cold

238
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,769
mmm-hmm keep it and I'll have you all

239
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:39,409
know that this hose nozzle was cleaned

240
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:41,509
by myself before I stuck it in here I

241
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:43,309
made sure to get all the particulates or

242
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:44,990
any little pieces that were on it off

243
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:47,989
and I cleaned it up real nice

244
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,460
I've been getting a lot of sort of flak

245
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,259
lately because I show people how to make

246
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,150
a bubble and of course I like to show

247
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:55,250
them how to make it properly but I also

248
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:57,559
like to show people how to do it easily

249
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,360
with whatever they have available for

250
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,789
where they are not everyone can afford

251
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,190
an expensive hash lab with machines and

252
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:05,959
ice makers and AH rows and so for those

253
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,810
people it's nice to be able to show them

254
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,639
a way to to be able to hand mix and you

255
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:12,829
know how to get your house dry properly

256
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,449
and all those things all right now we're

257
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:18,870
getting close to the top

258
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:21,900
okay I'm gonna turn that off so I'm

259
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,429
about maybe two inches from the top and

260
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,009
the reason I'm leaving that distance

261
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:31,229
this is nice too now the bag will go

262
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:35,460
sideways and upside down so I got it

263
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:37,289
nice and upside-down all tied up we're

264
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,450
gonna do about a ten-minute mix today

265
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,980
and then we're gonna come back and we're

266
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,530
gonna pull some bags for you nice and

267
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,840
quickly the bubble now has been filled

268
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:48,179
with water ice and herb john told us we

269
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,060
put 400 grams of fresh frozen in there

270
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:53,039
which is probably around 100 grams so if

271
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:55,829
we can pull out anywhere from 10 to 12

272
00:12:53,039 --> 00:13:01,439
grams of hash and return we've done

273
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:06,810
exceptional so let's get her mix in it's

274
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:09,090
my birthday batch it's your birthday so

275
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:13,619
we're gonna continue to smoke hash while

276
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:15,780
this bad boy continues to make cash yeah

277
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:20,610
I hid yourself some Hoss oh you're nuts

278
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:22,019
oh me oh well alrighty then stoked kind

279
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:26,539

00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,539
it's your birthday

281
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:35,509
and always hitting it nice and all

282
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,220
someone was saying though we take big

283
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,439
bong rips I think no I think it's the

284
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,420
quality of house that we're smoking you

285
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,210
think we're taking a big one but it's so

286
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:45,019
smooth it was pretty big okay let's

287
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:49,100
bigger than normal

288
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:54,069
what is your how can you not do a big

289
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:57,490
birthday trip who's delicious that sauce

290
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,490
that's nice too

291
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:21,689
the more water and the more ice more ice

292
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,409
[Applause]

293
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:27,410
more ice merrier yeah

294
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,090
you're gonna get a great extraction

295
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,090
ratio

296
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:48,750
[Applause]

297
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:50,939
John's got the parchment paper here

298
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,289
we've got pizza boxes four of them

299
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,780
spread out which will be more than

300
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:57,839
enough for 10 to 12 grams it's always

301
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:59,429
great to use less hash for large area

302
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,629
the more surface area the better and

303
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:06,449
we've got the parchment paper unbleached

304
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:08,759
for putting overtop of the cardboard I

305
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:11,009
get so much flak for people a harsh and

306
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,110
on me for cardboard I show you the

307
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:14,549
cardboard because it's available to most

308
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,019
people of course if you can have

309
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:17,969
parchment paper and you've gone to your

310
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:20,399
store and got some that's great just

311
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,500
make sure in high humid areas that it's

312
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,240
not stopping the wicking I do worry

313
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,610
about the wax paper

314
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,259
esque miss of the material but here we

315
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,840
got John he's just gonna fold up the

316
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:33,840
edges and we're folding up the edges on

317
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,810
the parchment paper to just make like a

318
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:39,660
little protected area so the bubble

319
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:42,059
doesn't you know fall or get knocked off

320
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:44,299
the parchment and we're gonna continue

321
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:48,539
we're gonna tape the parchment as well

322
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:49,979
onto cardboard thank you sir you're very

323
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:53,399
welcome always nice to give a friend

324
00:15:49,980 --> 00:16:03,470
hand especially when it's you know about

325
00:15:53,399 --> 00:16:03,470
birthday hash patches there you go

326
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,850
all right so that's pretty quick just

327
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:17,269
picking the four together like huh

328
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:20,870
yeah once it stays up nice nice little

329
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:23,360
box that's perfect for keeping the

330
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:27,200
bubble hash safe all right well let's go

331
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,789
see if if it's time for us to pull the

332
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:41,129
bank's tape down the corners a little

333
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:43,919
bit looks yellow and smell it

334
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:47,808
[Applause]

335
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,808
it's almost like a beige yellow

336
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:55,389
I'm totally excited to go how cool that

337
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:58,049
is I can feel it when I opened it it

338
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,049
nice and

339
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,970
we're gonna get these bad boys working

340
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:02,969
real soon

341
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:09,390
[Applause]

342
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:18,068
[Applause]

343
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,050
all right we're back and our bubble now

344
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:39,409
has just stopped mixing we did about a

345
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:42,680
ten-minute err sample 10 minutes and

346
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:45,300
water is pretty trippy it's almost like

347
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,299
now that is funky I don't even know how

348
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:51,480
to describe it it's got this light light

349
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:55,319
green but the green is like a good it's

350
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:59,640
golden oh I want to say smell my fingers

351
00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:01,619
but I'm not smelling a finger it's so

352
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,960
yeah feel free to have a sip I always

353
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:05,429
like to taste my rather a problem

354
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,279
there's definitely resin you can see it

355
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:11,910
floating right on the top in that right

356
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:14,759
yeah it's nice hey yes I like it

357
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:16,769
so we are gonna put the bags in the

358
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:18,119
bucket real quick this doesn't have to

359
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:22,139
take a long time and I'll just go

360
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:24,379
through the colors and the micron sizes

361
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,850
you start with the purple the 25 micron

362
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,800
it's the smallest screen make sure our

363
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:30,799
bag is nice our bucket is nice and clean

364
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,359
because I do remember we got a little

365
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,799
few nuggets that fell in there otherwise

366
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:40,559
the only thing that's ever gone in this

367
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:44,039
bucket is hash so not bad

368
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:47,309
alright so 25 micron going into a clean

369
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:49,710
bubble bubble bucket yeah we don't even

370
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:51,379
have to turn it over but you can it's

371
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,610
definitely not as necessary

372
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,020
takes a lot longer if you want to do all

373
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:57,889
the bags but it does help keep the

374
00:18:55,019 --> 00:19:00,180
screen nice open 45 micron the white

375
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,700
this is our second bag and it's

376
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,380
definitely a bag that produces no

377
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,049
shortage of resin that comes out of the

378
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:10,080
45 micron bag really regardless ADA

379
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:13,369
stream it's what I be pumping lately I

380
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:16,500
mean that smoke is I'm 45 my little pony

381
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:18,750
73 micron that means he's out of 90 73

382
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,460
120 but it still goes to show you that

383
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,839
it's worth puffing I'm actually doing a

384
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,220
little bit of

385
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,049
watermelon on top of that excellent so

386
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,799
this was 73 yellow I'm not sure if I

387
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:31,589
mentioned that I might have I might not

388
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:36,639
have we've been dabbing bowls

389
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:39,099
so there's 73 yellow used to be the gold

390
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,009
bag until the black bag came along and

391
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:46,559
stole its thunder yes the black bag is

392
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:50,049
my favorite bag and it is the 90 micron

393
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:53,109
today on this day of 90 micron I wear

394
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:55,240
all black and honor of my friend Xavier

395
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:57,549
from medical seats rocking the medical

396
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,309
seat shirt that's job is there awesome

397
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:01,569
oh great time with those guys just good

398
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:05,440
dudes they can't wait til they come here

399
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:07,269
we can show them you know our style we

400
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:14,230
got beeping and bangin and beacon and

401
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:16,480
dancer number 120 micron orange so that

402
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:19,779
night it was a pretty a pretty good ad

403
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,849
in from the 122 the 73 everything

404
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:23,410
between the 120 and the 73 is delicious

405
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:26,109
and awesome and you loved it but there

406
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:28,029
were still thoughts that if we separated

407
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:30,279
it it might even be more different and

408
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:37,990
of course it was very glad to have my

409
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:40,180
1970 separated red 160 micron this is

410
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:42,279
the contaminant bag but can also be a

411
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,200
quality bag you know there has been

412
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:49,809
resin that comes out of this bag that is

413
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:54,069
melty I'm huffing on some also 160 no

414
00:20:49,809 --> 00:21:00,940
right now really yeah my little pony no

415
00:20:54,069 --> 00:21:03,490
I'm also 190 Green sorry to interrupt go

416
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:11,230
ahead oh I'm just saying how tasty that

417
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:14,200
160 is because I have some good wow this

418
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,660
is nice so um you can always try you 169

419
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,880
your 45 you have to be quite pleased if

420
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,080
you're a good organic grower you'd be

421
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,120
amazed at what you can get but they'll

422
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,259
definitely know it's when it's special

423
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:25,809
you'll see right away if you like

424
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:27,250
waiting so this is the 220 now and we're

425
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:29,169
still gonna use it even though that the

426
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:32,559
bag in here the bubble now barrel shaped

427
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,460
bag is at 220 I still like to use my 220

428
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,769
bag

429
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,230
and just in case filter out any other

430
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:41,230
contaminants that are a large

431
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:51,130
particulate separate out from those

432
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:53,069
smaller screens passion this looks like

433
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,770
this bags been mixed once they pulled

434
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:57,879
what was good to keep your bags clean

435
00:21:55,769 --> 00:22:00,069
it's good to check the bottoms of your

436
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,700
screen sometimes before you shove them

437
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:06,099
into a bucket it's a good idea you can

438
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,470
have debris and dirt on the bottom of

439
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:11,259
your screen and now there's some dirt

440
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,579
that's right into your good hash and now

441
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:15,220
you don't know how it got there but I'm

442
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:16,898
sitting on the bottom of the 73 or the

443
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,669
bottom of the 120 and you pushed it down

444
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:20,199
and when the water and everything went

445
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:22,179
through that little particulate fell

446
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,940
right into your hash and it's just one

447
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:27,370
thing to pay attention to so we've got

448
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:32,200
all these now we're going to do the

449
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:36,699
draining a quick little drain just over

450
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:41,409
slightly all right and we'll just do the

451
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:45,038
green on this boom that's exciting

452
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:49,270
yeah that's fun I love this part make it

453
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:58,240
hash they don't what boom you know what

454
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:59,950
it's it's the most exciting part yeah so

455
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,970
because this is fresh frozen watermelon

456
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,110
and it's a fairly warm day thank God the

457
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:09,009
Sun went a little bit behind the tree

458
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:11,109
there we are in for some quick pulling

459
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:13,629
of bags because when we pull in fact

460
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:15,548
what I would suggest John is the 190 and

461
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:18,820
the 160 no problem but when we get to

462
00:23:15,548 --> 00:23:21,690
the 120 I think we should I need to dab

463
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:21,689
you up wick right away

464
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:03,980
all right that there pass me your

465
00:23:58,398 --> 00:24:06,229
Tupperware container always make the key

466
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:09,889
for a second one oh absolutely

467
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:12,919
that was that nut so we can whip up a

468
00:24:09,888 --> 00:24:15,048
second run so fast to yourself when

469
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:18,649
using fresh frozen of such quality

470
00:24:15,048 --> 00:24:20,569
nugget you got to do a second run I just

471
00:24:18,648 --> 00:24:22,158
touched it my fingers are sticky

472
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:24,528
well that water was coming out nice and

473
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,409
clear adding that extra gallon or two

474
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:31,009
was worked out in our favor you're just

475
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:38,629
gonna unplug this get the bubble now out

476
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:43,569
of the way we go right and we almost

477
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:46,808
killed me actually this will be a table

478
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:46,808
there we go

479
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:54,638
excellent all right so we've got our

480
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,278
little area set up here with our bags

481
00:24:54,638 --> 00:25:00,528
I'm using a small bucket to flip the

482
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:03,589
bags over and then we've got a spray

483
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:07,339
bucket over here so that we're gonna be

484
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:12,128
able to utilize it spin it in the ice

485
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:12,128
for the whole time so it's excellent

486
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:21,519
all right so even right off the bat

487
00:25:17,528 --> 00:25:25,669
there's spring to be done on this bag

488
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:27,200
they do this is great so happy can't

489
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:29,059
wait to see the night on that one bad

490
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,288
boy there we go I'm gonna flip it up and

491
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:32,288
you can do some spraying if you like

492
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:43,039
yeah so this is mostly pistol at Harris

493
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:44,839
stigmas big large contaminant if it was

494
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,819
bubble it'd be moving a lot faster so

495
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,949
this this part will be a little bit slow

496
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:57,109
when you're spraying John's got it about

497
00:25:48,950 --> 00:26:00,080
half way cleans now yeah it's definitely

498
00:25:57,109 --> 00:26:05,139
I'm sticking really as you can see right

499
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:07,849
now he can you can but it's it's just

500
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:10,880
all right so let's just give it a quick

501
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:14,389
little scoop what we can find we've got

502
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,980
the screen nice and wet just give that a

503
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,910
little scoop and drop that right there

504
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:21,410
to 20 micron flip this take this here

505
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,570
John we'll give it the clean-out over

506
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:26,298
there just like right here it's really

507
00:26:23,569 --> 00:26:27,859
convenient that's nice to have that hose

508
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:30,650
you're off camera but what John's doing

509
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:32,479
is he's leaning over the deck right now

510
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,850
and he's just cleaning the bag with the

511
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,940
hose here I'll give you a little a

512
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:40,178
little visual cleaning the bags with a

513
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:43,480
beautiful ocean view in the background

514
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:47,390
good Johnny no this is nice

515
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,620
this is darn nice all right well let's

516
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,049
get back to pulling our bags we

517
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:54,289
definitely don't need to spend any

518
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:57,079
wasted time leaving the water in the

519
00:26:54,289 --> 00:27:00,019
resin in the water so quick 10-minute

520
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:04,308
rip on the bubble mouth and then pull

521
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:06,889
those bags that was very little in that

522
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:08,569
bag almost nothing see that every day

523
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:11,840
although there is stuff it's kind of

524
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:14,450
spread out on the screen it's invisible

525
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:18,220
because of the orange screen in the

526
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,220
sunlight I almost couldn't see it

527
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,780
this is more resonance now it's already

528
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:31,500
moving much easier than that other stuff

529
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:37,319
was just pile it into a little spot very

530
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:40,559
small little 190 keep that on and just

531
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:41,669
clean it like that with the easier to

532
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,059
clean when it's stretched

533
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:46,970
I often clean my buckets my bag

534
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:49,649
stretched over a bucket like that it's

535
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:51,990
it's held in place it's easier there's

536
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:54,300
no mob eases there's no creases that

537
00:27:51,990 --> 00:28:00,410
hold the bag shot in in weird ways and

538
00:27:54,299 --> 00:28:00,409
it's just like super quick alright a

539
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:09,569
real small amount of 160 probably

540
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:11,929
because it's just so damn good there's

541
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:15,589
very little contaminants this herb

542
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,590
that's something to come

543
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:33,069
very small little piles but also not

544
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:35,860
important piles alright now we're

545
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:37,179
getting more into an important a bag

546
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:41,349
that you want to see some resin in

547
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:45,870
generally is your 120 it's a nice bag to

548
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:45,869
see a little piling never a bad thing

549
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:14,409
yeah a little pile of some some niceness

550
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:37,778
show the camera here little pile of

551
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:38,230
someone 20 goodness this teamwork there

552
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:42,128
you go

553
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:46,298
we're making bubble boom melt on our

554
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:52,418
Gmail what snails by puking be skillet

555
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:53,490
tools for me bubble hash galore alright

556
00:29:52,419 --> 00:30:00,038
looks good

557
00:29:53,490 --> 00:30:03,159
pick that up oopah so this is the bag

558
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:04,419
that we put in the next bag to come yeah

559
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:06,309
exactly you don't want to lose this

560
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:10,179
resin that's a good point to be

561
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:12,249
remembered by even this little bit of

562
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:15,278
hash that stuck to the spoon right into

563
00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:16,868
the 90 quality is there no problem

564
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,210
you're definitely not contaminating that

565
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:27,128
bag by any means putting a tiny little

566
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:30,210
bit of 120 in and white and then you'll

567
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:33,009
still make sure we give it a good rinse

568
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:35,649
alright 90 bike bum bag one of my

569
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:37,450
favorites always good when it lifts up

570
00:30:35,648 --> 00:30:39,099
with a lot of water there's about a

571
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,069
gallon and a half gallon and a half of

572
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:44,230
water in there right now which tells me

573
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:46,710
something's covering the screen at least

574
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,710
a little pile

575
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:55,160
this is always nice to get your yield in

576
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:57,799
your 90 bag if you can a bad thing give

577
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:01,308
that 90 you tiny little particulates but

578
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:05,119
if I rinse the bubble around we should

579
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:07,910
be able to pick them out which is like

580
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,489
too much use the bottle in a second once

581
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:13,910
I get these new guys Irish three or four

582
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:21,440
just tiny little things that we don't

583
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:22,940
want in there and let me tell you this

584
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:33,980
thing does not want to pick up whatever

585
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:56,808
it is all right you got a bug spray this

586
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:58,640
up in just push the bag up put the lip

587
00:31:56,808 --> 00:32:01,579
up on the bag and it makes for easy even

588
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,259
easier spring and I can just turn it boy

589
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:07,819
there so you can just stay in one spot

590
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:09,679
whatever works best for you looks like a

591
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:12,700
nice pile there's definitely probably

592
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,380
threw three grams there I would say

593
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:19,670
where is that last one 20 was maybe half

594
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:22,040
a gram 73 45 still two more good bags

595
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:25,539
that we're gonna pull oh we're gonna how

596
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:25,539
creamy that is oh it's delicious

597
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,919
Rick's on the screen remember these ones

598
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,200
need to go through the sieve almost

599
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,909
immediately we can't leave this out for

600
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,319
too long we can't waste all our time

601
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:57,929
filling all these bags anyway we're

602
00:32:43,319 --> 00:33:02,730
gonna have to see some I think yeah that

603
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:05,340
is like trim to the Krampus sound so

604
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:10,429
there's that I'm thinking what I'm gonna

605
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:23,128
do now though is potentially strain that

606
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:25,019
1/2 hour all right so we've got our

607
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:29,668
parchment paper made into a big square

608
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:34,259
here with the edges done up layer down

609
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:36,028
here and I suggest we do that 90 micron

610
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:41,940
and almost immediately let's get that

611
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:44,808
done right now all right well let these

612
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,399
guys see what's going on a little closer

613
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:49,918
so I'm just gonna put the screen right

614
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:54,209
here sure I'm gonna go grab that

615
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:57,600
Oh sounds good man just gonna quickly um

616
00:33:54,210 --> 00:34:00,419
oh it looks perfect it looks perfect for

617
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,980
micro plane itch for receive it for sea

618
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:04,559
Vitch I should say sorry it was mixed

619
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,470
the names huh all right so there's the

620
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:08,940
ninety we're gonna gently rub it through

621
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,490
the screen and you can see it's got that

622
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:14,338
perfect right now that it's crumbling

623
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:17,549
perfect so what I would suggest John is

624
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:19,349
use the end okay and you you rather than

625
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,599
make it awkward on yourself come back

626
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:23,309
around here I'll show you here I can't

627
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,619
show you without showing it there you go

628
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:29,299
basically use the bottom of the spoon on

629
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:29,300
the edge of the screen

630
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,450
so I'm gonna try and he's gonna come

631
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:37,119
back I'm gonna show this right here

632
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:39,789
there you go now a lot of it right now

633
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:43,869
is stuck on the outside but I give it a

634
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:50,279
couple of whacks and it's quickly coming

635
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:50,280
off oh that's beautiful look at exactly

636
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:59,920
and see how we put the lip on there

637
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:01,659
because as he's tapping away the lip is

638
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,700
actually protecting it from jumping off

639
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:09,069
of the lip is working for us very well

640
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:12,219
yeah it does doesn't it Danis quite

641
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:14,740
happy with that oh but you know what

642
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:16,209
he's getting a little bit excited oh you

643
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:17,829
got to get a little excited we're

644
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,400
cleaning this hash off we don't want it

645
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:27,219
stand in our seat we want it on that

646
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:33,160
parchment getting dried all right that

647
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:34,959
was 90 perfection right there well

648
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:36,940
that's all you stuff coming off Wow

649
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,920
worried about bouncing everywhere was it

650
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,510
we just let this dry a tiny little bit

651
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,670
this left little remnants that are in

652
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:44,560
here we'll give it a good whack in about

653
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,960
two or three minutes and it'll just fall

654
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,809
and cover this look at what beautiful

655
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,579
coverage we got with that sieve and in

656
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:53,320
the Sun it looks so nice doesn't it job

657
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:55,420
oh yeah it does some nice close-ups here

658
00:35:53,320 --> 00:36:02,559
I'll give it back to you there my friend

659
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:07,260
oh dude beautiful right there cuz you

660
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:11,079
already there beautiful beautiful job

661
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:12,700
today is the birthday boy I know it's my

662
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:15,039
birthday I should answer the phone it's

663
00:36:12,699 --> 00:36:18,399
birthday everybody's calling him he's

664
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:21,000
making hash if that's what he alright

665
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,000
that's awesome

666
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,450
all right we'll be back in a second all

667
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:30,460
right that didn't that 90 look

668
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:32,078
unbelievable aren't you glad we received

669
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,789
that right away I'm telling you right

670
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,339
now if that 73 was still sitting there

671
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:38,769
it'd be a done deal the 120 we could do

672
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:39,849
any time as well but we'll pull these

673
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:42,280
three bags and we'll do them all

674
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:44,440
together we'll be quick though because

675
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:48,510
the 73 is gonna be just much like that

676
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:53,289
it's gonna be creamy deliciousness that

677
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:55,060
90 bag just made it all yeah right there

678
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:59,710
and the 73 is doing it too just so you

679
00:36:55,059 --> 00:37:00,489
know just so you know it's also doing it

680
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,740
yeah

681
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:07,379
all right yeah the 73 is looking creamy

682
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:11,608
too a very creamy I can I could smell it

683
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:13,720
all right let's get that in there Oh

684
00:37:11,608 --> 00:37:14,949
thought I was gonna pull the Ricky ledee

685
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:16,929
I thought you're almost gonna pull a

686
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:19,598
rookie moves you know we do that even

687
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:21,009
being we do we do we do I mean that's

688
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,599
the that's one of the main reasons I

689
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:25,450
don't mess around with chemical solvents

690
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:26,980
but the fact that they're just come on

691
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:31,269
look at this in the Sun look at the

692
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:42,039
color of that that's just amazing you

693
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:45,179
know what that's you know I can see it I

694
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:48,190
wish you guys will bring it to them

695
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:52,358
we're gonna be like this is one from

696
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:54,159
here directly in this I'll let you pull

697
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:58,219
that little chunk out in a second once I

698
00:37:54,159 --> 00:38:00,469
get it right there that guy

699
00:37:58,219 --> 00:38:03,879
and I think he didn't have a bit of an

700
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:06,219
animal in that there we go a couple more

701
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:18,410
perfect so stinky

702
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:21,679
yeah this is gonna have to go all right

703
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:26,480
want to get the spoon spoons right here

704
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:32,899
oh yeah this is just like that night he

705
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:38,210
was just like that it even wants this

706
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:41,450
just stay on this that last little bit

707
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:44,380
dang keep it the you know what it's

708
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:47,629
almost the same amount with 73 is there

709
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:52,160
it looks beautiful it's even like

710
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:54,140
hardening on the spoon here screen the

711
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,690
next screen is coming up the next screen

712
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:59,629
the next screen I should not be the next

713
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:02,210
parchment the next cardboard and

714
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:04,030
parchment we're hitting gabs it's easy

715
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:08,119
for us too

716
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:10,960
alright so take that guy right here we

717
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:14,690
can rinse this guy off ASAP because he's

718
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,490
already starting to dry and that's one

719
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:19,760
thing we talked about is don't let your

720
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:21,169
screen one of the things they were doing

721
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,030
in Spain that I couldn't wrap my head

722
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:24,170
around that I really was thinking that

723
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,300
it's just something they shouldn't be

724
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:28,519
doing and I saw more than one person do

725
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,140
it they pulled all their bags out and

726
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:31,699
then they hung them and lean them up

727
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:34,279
against one another put them in a bag

728
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:36,019
and high-quality resin is gonna wick

729
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,510
moisture just sitting on top of that

730
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:41,269
screen so much then it'll be very

731
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:42,590
difficult to see if micro planing will

732
00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:43,639
be one of your only options at that

733
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,380
point and you'll have to of course

734
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:47,960
freeze the resin before you do that

735
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,519
because it's a warm environment in Spain

736
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,500
especially in Barcelona even

737
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:55,559
it's hard to get to a cool temperature

738
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:59,070
that you can actually you know even just

739
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:02,250
playing some some hash without having it

740
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:07,050
just start melting your fingers all

741
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:11,340
right it's richer bags very very devil

742
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:13,019
there the better yeah no it's good so

743
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:17,820
we're just given the resin and ice the

744
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:20,039
resin is so clean Beth Lee Mort I see

745
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,680
you yeah it's like four grams at least

746
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:29,340
I'd say we've got our 10 to 12 grams

747
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:32,879
anyway Joseph just from the like two and

748
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:34,309
a half to the two to three two three

749
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,990
four five six

750
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:40,858
yeah we've got about ten anyway we still

751
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:42,989
haven't pulled 225 either though just

752
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:44,608
give this a couple of good squirts to

753
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:48,299
show if there's any contaminants in

754
00:40:44,608 --> 00:41:01,409
there no it's beautiful then we'll scoop

755
00:40:48,300 --> 00:41:02,910
it all up how's that for not a drop

756
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:05,129
drive would you like that

757
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:07,230
that's cute dude that's a nice pile

758
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:09,780
that's a huge problem

759
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:13,380
that's not even done yet that's thanks

760
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:15,090
thank five times of everything I'd say

761
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,579
it's at least five times of everything

762
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:25,619
yeah I think there's about six grams

763
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:28,139
just there that's definitely close to

764
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:29,640
five maybe 456 you know I'm just

765
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:32,219
guesstimating just like you and I'm like

766
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:33,629
you know no no more accurate and my

767
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:34,980
guess we're gonna weigh it and we'll

768
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,970
find out what its gonna be like yeah

769
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,320
we're definitely let you know

770
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:38,909
I'd say we're gonna get that through the

771
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,400
plane real soon if you want to start

772
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:42,469
sieving yeah why don't you come over

773
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,789
here and see why like

774
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:49,399
bags all do the cleaning on this bag I'm

775
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:52,279
gonna grab this 73 right off the hop

776
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:59,119
sure man yeah get that going right away

777
00:41:52,280 --> 00:42:01,430
it's good looks good hey you blow that

778
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:06,289
off nice and fast tech I can just do

779
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:09,230
that nice work though well easy going

780
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:11,269
easy going so yeah this is a nice easy

781
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:23,210
way to clean bags isn't it yeah isn't

782
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:30,380
that nice haha totally digging it all

783
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:33,349
right excellent

784
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:37,519
excellent so remember the cleaner you

785
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:39,140
you get your bags the better it's you

786
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,550
get that resin stuck on there and you're

787
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:42,549
the one that's gonna be dealing with it

788
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:53,299
that is the truth of that never a bad

789
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:55,280
idea to just use a little extra couple

790
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,820
extra minutes and make sure you get it

791
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,790
real dry well that's looking great John

792
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:04,039
that's the 73 73 all right you could

793
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:05,750
probably afford to card just a small

794
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,829
section of this over there real quick

795
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,170
you might even be able to do it just

796
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:11,989
with the lightness I wouldn't touch it

797
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:14,329
with your hands but and then we can put

798
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:16,819
the 120 right here I will draw a line

799
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:18,588
and then we've got two more in there

800
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:20,119
that we'll have to make i'd say we're

801
00:43:18,588 --> 00:43:26,559
gonna need at least a whole one

802
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:26,559
easy-easy for that 45 right now yeah

803
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:31,280
then I'll pull the 25 bag this is a bag

804
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,230
that everyone has a real problem with a

805
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,080
simple technique you can see that it's

806
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:37,639
holding at least 3 gallons of water but

807
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:42,739
a simple technique is to lift it very

808
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:44,509
quickly and the water just releases so a

809
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:47,419
bag like this generally when I start

810
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:52,180
doing this little jerk upwards method I

811
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:52,180
can drain it in about 10 seconds

812
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:57,949
fresh frozen John but I still have more

813
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:59,389
that's sitting to be run again like

814
00:43:57,949 --> 00:44:01,308
we'll put it in the bubble now again and

815
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:05,389
run another batch so I'm going to grab

816
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:06,980
that we're not going to film our second

817
00:44:05,389 --> 00:44:08,469
batch but we will let you know what came

818
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,088
of it

819
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:12,858
that will do many push maybe a little

820
00:44:11,088 --> 00:44:15,440
couple days down the road notice how I

821
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:17,630
filled the bag with air and slid my hand

822
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,269
down the bag to actually get some of

823
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:22,430
that excess water out do not physically

824
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:26,030
grab the hash in the screen and squeeze

825
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:27,529
it that is not a good idea it's just

826
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:30,319
something that definitely is not a good

827
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:37,130
idea and then finally here we've got our

828
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:40,880
25 oh yeah looking good John the 120

829
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:42,470
looked beautiful the 25 is one of the

830
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,250
unique resins that you can actually

831
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:50,269
gather with a spoon almost as well as

832
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:52,068
you gather with the spray bottle but why

833
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:54,259
that is if it's the size of the heads

834
00:44:52,068 --> 00:44:56,630
obviously it is it's the only thing

835
00:44:54,260 --> 00:45:04,760
that's really different about it just

836
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:06,829
clean it so well 25 micron the grade

837
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,599
that will pay for your bags whether you

838
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:12,490
want to use it in a metal bowl or an ax

839
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:12,490
joint or smoke it in a bone

840
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:20,889
I saw Franco from strain hunters

841
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:23,170
recently going off on you about USF's 25

842
00:45:20,889 --> 00:45:26,199
micron bubble so you know that there's

843
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:28,030
something to it there's some actives in

844
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:32,259
there depending on where it was growing

845
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:35,340
on the strain this color of this 25 is

846
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,340
absolutely beautiful

847
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:49,330
yeah awesome I got water spraying in my

848
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:52,210
face this is awesome it's beautiful look

849
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:54,480
at the Sun just just goodness this is

850
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:58,960
totally beautiful

851
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:01,780
totally awesome birthday thanks for

852
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,760
coming over John oh you know what I mean

853
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,980
you always come over but put a nice guy

854
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,220
to bring the fresh frozen and hey plan

855
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:11,289
this like this is a day it was something

856
00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:13,569
that I you know it's I'm gonna I'm gonna

857
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:15,730
give me this cut I've rushed this home

858
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,769
now about Christmas I brought him here

859
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:19,210
from my friend Ron's yeah we were

860
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:24,759
laughing about it today it came home in

861
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:26,949
my pocket in a plastic bag and I'm gonna

862
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:30,730
go get the second parchment paper so we

863
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:33,869
can get on seething that 25 and that 45

864
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:33,869
I'll be right back

865
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:42,930
and what I'm gonna do here as we know

866
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:47,789
this side here is the ones one and this

867
00:46:42,929 --> 00:46:49,799
side here is the 73 so instead of

868
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:51,079
drawing a line on the paper here I'm

869
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,220
just gonna write it on the cardboard

870
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:58,009
gives me an idea

871
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:58,009
I put the 73

872
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:10,210
and the 9v fills up that whole tray and

873
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:13,568
this 45 is definitely looking so sweet

874
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:16,690
so I'm gonna wait for mark to come out

875
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:22,029
here right now move this whole dollar

876
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:24,700
bags we've seen the 90 the 120 the 73

877
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:26,740
and what we have left is the 45 and the

878
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:29,679
25 we're not bothering with the 222

879
00:47:26,739 --> 00:47:31,959
190th 160 it's just schwag Isles I'm

880
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:56,348
gonna pour this water into my garden

881
00:47:31,960 --> 00:48:00,909
down below that's terpene rich hey here

882
00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:06,160
we go that right there is what we call

883
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:09,759
koala tay 445 I'm gonna smile on your

884
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:10,239
face look at me dude you're 45 below is

885
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,220
that Johnny

886
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:15,639
already five is this your 45 over that's

887
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:17,669
the 45 Oh John do you think that III

888
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:22,210
think it's just a beautiful thing

889
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:25,930
what are you my friend it's for you I'll

890
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:27,940
look at that for you I think I think I

891
00:48:25,929 --> 00:48:30,279
think listen maybe just a little bit

892
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:32,409
tiny little bit if it's no good you let

893
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,910
me know if we need to we'll add a tiny

894
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:36,608
little bit of moisture it could be

895
00:48:33,909 --> 00:48:44,379
perfect it could be perfect

896
00:48:36,608 --> 00:48:46,239
oh yeah it's coming through nice it's

897
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,280
sticking so gently give it a gentle

898
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:50,889
little smack on the edge as you move it

899
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:54,640
as you yeah oh yeah that's perfect John

900
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:58,629
oh this smells amazing it looks unreal

901
00:48:54,639 --> 00:49:01,269
II hear ya believe how the smell this is

902
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:04,510
the colour is written this is probably

903
00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:06,608
the nicest 45 I've ever seen it's

904
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:09,900
definitely very nice for me that what

905
00:49:06,608 --> 00:49:09,900
I've grown so I mean

906
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,719
here and there you can also do a light

907
00:49:12,768 --> 00:49:15,919
scraping on the outside make sure you

908
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:18,469
move it when you do that or you'll get

909
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:22,489
clumps though move the whole unit around

910
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:25,579
even towards some of the empty spots so

911
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:27,650
this is a real important process the

912
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:29,599
sieving or the micro planing we're doing

913
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:31,579
the sieving technique it's good to keep

914
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,289
your tools cool we're doing this in the

915
00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:35,329
sunlight so you guys can see it really

916
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:37,160
well obviously it's a better idea to do

917
00:49:35,329 --> 00:49:39,380
this in a colder environment

918
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:41,210
not that it's SuperDuper warm right now

919
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:50,869
but it's definitely probably ten degrees

920
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:53,690
well we are so filler up nice little

921
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:56,329
pile right off another piece and just

922
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:57,588
kind of working yeah gently sieve it

923
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:59,420
through the screens you know there did

924
00:49:57,588 --> 00:50:00,978
this did have a little bit more moisture

925
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:03,798
removed even though it's sieving

926
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:04,818
perfectly if I left a little bit more

927
00:50:03,798 --> 00:50:06,650
moisture in it it would have probably

928
00:50:04,818 --> 00:50:08,989
sieve even a little bit more perfect

929
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:09,729
both the to the 90 and the 73 were like

930
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:11,900
that as well

931
00:50:09,728 --> 00:50:13,608
but this looks great you're gonna get it

932
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,910
all the way through and you'll be able

933
00:50:13,608 --> 00:50:19,489
to to cover this parchment paper nice

934
00:50:16,909 --> 00:50:21,379
and evenly so wherever you see it to be

935
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:23,349
the least amount is where you kind of

936
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:26,930
want to spend some attention whoo nice

937
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:28,670
yeah I like that I moved the paper open

938
00:50:26,929 --> 00:50:31,338
just as you did it all right I was like

939
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:33,528
team I was like team work you're like

940
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:35,179
very receptive to the motions John hi

941
00:50:33,528 --> 00:50:36,559
you know what we work well together we

942
00:50:35,179 --> 00:50:38,210
do get the job because we're just having

943
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,979
a good time but now it's cuz we love

944
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:42,228
what we do we do love what we do and we

945
00:50:39,978 --> 00:50:44,358
seem to be very much alike in our in our

946
00:50:42,228 --> 00:50:49,159
just in our histories and the vision

947
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:51,048
involved with and we just seem so damn

948
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:53,449
happy to share with the people out there

949
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:55,608
you know what what's what's the best

950
00:50:53,449 --> 00:50:59,449
thing you can do is show people this

951
00:50:55,608 --> 00:51:01,400
yeah baby it's my birthday hash look

952
00:50:59,449 --> 00:51:03,728
look at the bottom of this I'm so

953
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,729
excited

954
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:10,480
oh yeah let's look at the bottom of that

955
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:12,309
in the sunlight alright give it a gentle

956
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,079
smack rather than brush it with the

957
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:18,909
spoon you can smack all most of that off

958
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:23,679
sometimes I go high like on this on the

959
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:25,899
top part that's good and then of course

960
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:28,690
some more loosening of it up as it dries

961
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,070
as we're taking time that bubble will

962
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:48,340
dry out a little bit more and it'll even

963
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:49,570
break off easier sometimes the little

964
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:52,269
bits that get stuck on the outside you

965
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:54,190
can gently brush it off with a spoon or

966
00:51:52,269 --> 00:51:55,659
you could use a brush you could also use

967
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:57,970
one of the anti-static brushes to get

968
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:59,739
this bubble off and that's just a nice

969
00:51:57,969 --> 00:52:03,849
even amount we'll give that a few more

970
00:51:59,739 --> 00:52:05,859
good whacks on the edge of the stainless

971
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:07,569
steel strainer with the spoon real good

972
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:10,120
ones give it a top whack like a nice

973
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:11,769
hard one yeah that's where you see it

974
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:16,199
really start see how I see it bouncing

975
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:16,199
and releasing them yeah excellent

976
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:23,130
beautiful alright well we've got our 45

977
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:23,129
we're gonna move on to the 25

978
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,110
so we ran out of space on our parchment

979
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:36,179
paper we don't really want to rip out

980
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:37,740
another batch and the 25 micron of all

981
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:40,259
the hashes if you get it into a thin

982
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:42,509
enough patty it seems to be the one that

983
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:44,580
can actually dry in a patty so we're

984
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:46,380
gonna do a little experiment just with

985
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:48,690
the 25 we're gonna leave this little

986
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:51,660
patty as is and we're still gonna get it

987
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:53,760
on to the wicking table here we've got a

988
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:55,489
nice little spot in the corner of our 45

989
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,480
we'll put it on the parchment there and

990
00:52:55,489 --> 00:52:59,639
we'll get back to you and let you know

991
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,369
how that kind of turned out it's been an

992
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:04,859
unbelievable birthday batch with my

993
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:07,470

996
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:14,250
beautiful area that we live and yeah I

997
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,710
mean basically the only thing really

998
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:18,360
left to share which I'll end with is the

999
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:20,159
macro photographs of the resin that we

1000
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:23,579
just made you know starting with that

1001
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:25,199
120 micron beautiful heady heads all

1002
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:28,019
stuck together in little clumps

1003
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:30,269
beautiful color dropping down into the

1004
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:32,900
90 and suddenly it's like whoa that

1005
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:36,659
stuff is surreal Dimond like glistening

1006
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:38,849
amazingness with the 73 looking almost

1007
00:53:36,659 --> 00:53:40,440
exactly like the 90 to the naked eye I

1008
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:42,839
expect that it'll look pretty beautiful

1009
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:45,869
under the macro lens and then down into

1010
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,340
the 45 and I'll shoot the patty 25 and
