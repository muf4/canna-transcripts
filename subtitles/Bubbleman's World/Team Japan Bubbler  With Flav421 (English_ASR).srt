holding the little mandolin they're

90
00:04:57,228 --> 00:05:05,978
covered in I guess he's not quite the

91
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,978
shakedown guy but he's sort of similar

92
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,569
what do you call the little guy and the

93
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,280
main disc in the center Uncle Sam

94

I knew he wasn't quite the shakedown guy

95
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,959
but he kind of had a shakedown guy look

96

98
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:23,469

many plans over the last year it hasn't

113
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:24,469
even been funny no then finally it's

114
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:26,750
just a spur of the moment did you smash

115
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,570
that against in Spain yes again like a

116
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,790
third time yeah yeah cuz I got it fixed

117
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:33,740
in Spain I remembered it 14 hours later

118
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,629
in front of all you guys dude and then

119
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,870
got a fix and then smashed it again what

120
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:40,279
should I be waiting for you um I know

121
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,250
it's already cooling down substantially

122
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:45,979
yeah maybe even at 55 because the

123
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,490
outdoors is blowing well the variable

124
00:06:45,980 --> 00:07:01,100
wind

125
00:06:46,490 --> 00:07:07,790
yep there's many variables certainly and

126
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:10,160
that is that yeah that's 14 11 million

127
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,480
and 10 but we got it done anyway you see

128
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,650
the quick response always nice when

129
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,000
you're buddies there to pick and you

130
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:17,449

totally smashed alright oh dude yeah

133
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:29,149
I can honestly say I've never had a

134
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:32,918
banger fall out of my pipe while I was

135
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:35,568
just dabbing releasing the dam yeah

136
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:38,779
there's a first for everything even when

137
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:40,939
I was doing this part I made sure to

138
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:42,679
hold it yeah yeah because it just makes

139
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:44,870
sense but well I'm not gonna hold it

140
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,810
while I'm dabbing I have to dig out like

141
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,348
a bunch of 45 tens that are in other

142
