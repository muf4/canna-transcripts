00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:30,310
breeding company and his strange dude

14
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:32,920
he's breeding for his own personal

15
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,789
medical issues and we're gonna take some

16

D mail rips

17
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:49,050
awesome he loves the grow room be sure

18
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,840
that those vitamin lights in there for

19
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,649

00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:01,080
vitamin lights rewrites that very trifle

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:08,539
production yeah they really like the

23
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:11,609
whole over that CFLs educated use

24
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:13,319
compact fluorescents take a couple of

25
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,060
plants and flower with them and the

26
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,699
results are absolutely amazing

27
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:22,199
I've grown single plants have grown

28
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:24,060
multiple plants understand just still be

29
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,089
Tricon production how they're not just

30
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,229
great yields the track of production be

31
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,909
when we thought right here this little

32
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:32,619
plant here that you brought down this is

33
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:35,560
something we've been working on for a

34
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,469
couple years here this is an OG 18 grown

35
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,050
from seed when crossed with West Coast

36
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:43,239
savages own mail we got the West Coast

37
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,219
Sour Diesel beans from Mad Men they were

38
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:53,230
a gift

39
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:55,780
half ago he a little bit of nice

40
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:58,649
glandular producing mail no beautiful

41
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:10,840
and smash that onto our blueberry

42
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:12,129
Sowerberry been an OG 18 would be give a

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,729
little history on that that would be the

44
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:17,409
Jew gold that's wool the og teen that's

45
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:19,479
what they used to make the Jew gold in

46
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:21,329
LA they use that to make the kosher what

47
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:24,729
everyone calls the kosher coach right

48
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:27,549
DNA genetics came out with the the og 18

49
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:29,949
that was their first release of their og

50
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:31,689
cush they reef Amman the history because

51
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:33,849
it came out where they came out with a

52
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:35,829
phenotype that was more lemony more

53
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:38,169
candy more sour and a little bit better

54
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,150
yielding so they just reversed her again

55
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:42,818
and then that's where we get the e OG 18

56
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,219
from okay great and all that history is

57
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:47,500
just a personal favorite for for

58
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:50,229
medicinal use and for all-around just be

59
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:53,919
great a great smelling plant and a great

60
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:56,199
looking plant I love the name sweatbands

61
00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:00,789

[Music]

65
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:10,129
maybe your seed company and maybe just

66
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,360
sort of talk about the history of really

67
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:18,199
what brought you does start your

68
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:19,939

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:29,300
wow this is a special when he said it as

72
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:50,420
well he said you know this is the one

73
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:53,090
where you lighted in a room yeah a lot

74
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:56,360
of Lies a lot of gimmicks [ __ ]

75
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:58,399
sure lassic CD industry you bought

76
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,590
exactly the seed industry was pretty

77
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,079
seedy you order her package seeds from

78
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:05,089
anywhere calling it God but you

79
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:06,979
germinate it and you get weird looking

80
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:09,289
plants it don't even look like cannabis

81
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,150
tea I stuff it doesn't germinate you get

82
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,879
seeds that aren't even modelled not even

83
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:15,229
healthy seeds there's just a lot of

84
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,730
uncontrolled stuff going on and Steve

85
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,830
industry a lot of give me stuff that

86
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,230
just wasn't helping customers internet

87
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:22,939
patience lot of [ __ ] it's a lot of

88
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,740
time and energy as well when you're

89
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:26,689
growing from seed and you're looking for

90
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,550
that you know especially to breeding the

91
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:30,939
amount of time and energy it becomes

92
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:34,750
incredibly

93
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:38,350
almost exponential to give someone seeds

94
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,910
for examples oh here have some seeds for

95
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,160
that person to take those seeds and grow

96
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,990
them that's the real gift yeah but I

97
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,040
mean unless you really know these seeds

98
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,540
are stable and they're gonna grow what

99
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,569
generally God is a perfect example

100
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:56,830
because God by these God there's nothing

101
00:05:52,569 --> 00:06:00,040
like it's just so it's so specific that

102
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:03,370
those terpenes and you can't to crack

103
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,040
those seeds and not get those that smell

104
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:10,410
that would hurt a lot

105
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,410
bujji cursed rice if from d4 20k

106
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:39,720
all melt does that yeah when the quality

107
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:42,460
they're absolutely a little bit about

108
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,070
sort of the cannabinoid profiles that

109
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:48,759
you look for I know that you uh you

110
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:51,819
suffer from cluster my cluster migraines

111

up with trigeminal autonomics of algae

112
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:58,689
in the whole word basically it's a

00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:03,509

and we're waiting in 20 minutes or so

147
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:48,029
from now one of Phil's tents are gonna

148
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,220
go on so we might take you in there and

149
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:52,439
just show you a few strains you can talk

150
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,970
put a few you're a few of the

151
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,700
cannabinoid profiles that you seek

152
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,019
perfect you can do I can also go in and

153
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,120
do a green light and a couple of other

154
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,980
ones to see if we can show you guys

155
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,860
something ladies

156
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,470
so the cannabinoid profiles that I look

157
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,629
for well because of my condition it

158
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,220
doesn't just cause the pain it's not the

159
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:12,360
neurological pain the main thing is the

160
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,580
neuropathic and the neurological

161
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,009
problems and you need to find strains

162
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,680
that directly go for that directly

163
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:22,169
target that extremely extremely

164
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,149
psychoactive pirates do that but you

165
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:26,879
also have to look at what's happening

166
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:28,289
after the headache I'm getting nausea as

167
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,519
developing post-traumatic stress

168
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:32,909
disorders

169
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,740
bpfv starting to cause a lot of problems

170
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,850
that's just from the horrible experience

171
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,419
of going through the headache and then

172
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,330
being afraid

173
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:40,919
just after shaking just pandering is

174
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,550
another one gonna happen like eventually

175
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,750
you just go crazy yet an attack well

176
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:47,279
they call them cluster moderate

177
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,490
migraines for a reason because they come

178
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,769
in clusters you get one that goes goes

179
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,419
away you're sitting there you're sweat

180
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:56,699
kind of goes away you wipe the sweat and

181
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:58,919
tears and then the moment you stand up

182
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,330
and breathe the Wallops do again and you

183
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,279
fall down to the floor and that's when

184
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,660
you're kind of shattered and you don't

185
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,360
really know what to do it just keeps

186
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,559
hitting you over and over and over again

187
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,320
gets you to a point where you're just so

188
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,000
worn down and not healthy that you just

189
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,830
you'll basically take anything and

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,490
cannabis has always worked but the

191
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:19,740
doctors for some reason we're just not

192
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,350
did not want to let me use cannabis

193
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,820
solely they felt that I needed to take

194
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,500
all these heavy this heavy medication

195
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,629
and I needed to take pills and

196
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,509
injections and I needed to go take blood

197
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:32,480
tests and all sorts of body tests all

198
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:35,970
the time that was just unnecessary I

199
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,220
wasn't sleeping I was 123 pounds I'm now

200
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,860
a hundred and sixty pounds so you must

201
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,690
be more afraid than most at the thought

202
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,870
of losing your ability to grow your own

203
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,780
medicine and to maintain your own

204
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,789
genetic and cannabinoid profile you know

205
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,409
lineage maintaining my genetics and

206
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:54,480
maintaining my health directly depend on

207
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:57,689
my ability to grow if I'm not able to

208
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,129
grow legally then there's only in one

209
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,980
other way you don't really have the

210
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:04,740
luxury of applying to all the different

211
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,480
companies buying herb from all of them

212
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,700
and finding out which one works because

213
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,800
you've already done that well um exactly

214
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,390
like I was I was a part of an article

215
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,179
that was just put out in a local

216
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:17,699
newspaper and it basically says that we

217
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:19,259
don't have the money to go through the

218
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,170
trial and error process again with all

219
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,808
these big license producers

220
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:27,048
I can't go through the 40 strains these

221
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:29,269
guys have at 8 to 12 dollars a gram and

222
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:37,458
a long to grams of each to figure out if

223
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:39,019
they work but I don't I don't I'm just

224
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,758
gonna ask you you're not a plant matter

225
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:47,558
guy you know we don't on citrate we

226
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:47,558
don't said quite a few

227
00:11:50,889 --> 00:12:01,509
is garbage very small on this planet

228
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:02,328
it's only a very small perceptions

229
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:06,539
everybody

230
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:09,809
that's why this is so so so little wet

231
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:13,019
washing those enterprises

232
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:18,119
attracting something so so so small

233
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:20,069
something so so so big so you know you

234
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,320
need the fresh plant you need the

235
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,910
availability to have the trim to have a

236
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,650
close trim well that's just the thing

237
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,110
right and of course that's one of you

238
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:30,088
might want to juice your leaf thank you

239
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,669
know you might really to you from your

240
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:34,470
stocks is that want to eat the buds you

241
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,329
might want to extract the resin from the

242
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,850
buds and eat that or smoke it or

243
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,560
vaporize it or whatever these are the

244
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,930
options you have when you grow your own

245
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:46,619
cannabis these are not the options you

246
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:50,459
have when a licensed production facility

247
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:53,129
is offering to sell your cannabis bud

248
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,990
only probably I'm guessing not even in

249
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:57,450
bud form they'll probably brine the

250
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:02,129
plants down into a powder and sell it

251
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:04,980
like that I was required by some

252
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:07,338
standards to they say to get rid of mold

253
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,339
and bacteria

254
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:15,129
for such exploits clearly there's so

255
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,610
many of us patients are willing to buy

256
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:19,529
their product right now

257
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,710
I see a place for them don't get me

258
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:24,779
wrong really see a place nice as

259
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,730
producers you know there's elderly

260
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,089
people there's people with kids that

261
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,379
have that syndrome and stuff they don't

262
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:33,269
yeah some people don't want to go to the

263
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:34,620
dispensaries or don't want to grow there

264
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:38,090
go with the guy down the street that's

265
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,090
kind of maybe screwed them over before

266
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,220
that but at the same time everyone needs

267
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:46,919
to have the right to chill with their

268
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,500
home in medicine we indirectly in the

269
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:52,799
Canadian Charter it says we have access

270
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,409
to cannabis in all of its forms and

271
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,139
three

272
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:59,600
give direct access to so if that's the

273
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:01,970
whole plant and its leaves producing and

274
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,120
it's trichomes for absolutely and it

275
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,769
buds for tinctures and we'll see toil

276
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,190
exactly for being a breeder I use I use

277
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:13,779
my mind on viable seeds I think just

278
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:18,010
like how's the great gardeners yeah

279
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:21,730
he does he knows about it he didn't see

280
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:24,220
the highlights of the job I all have

281
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,690
seats on my post every morning it's it's

282
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,399
just one of those things like it gets

283
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,400
into your system

284
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:37,079
that's it that's my new mantra you need

285
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:40,769
your endocannabinoid system daily now

286
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,150
that is Wow that's also so G could say

287
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:45,360
that's Chrissy from Prince George

288
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:48,059
without D yeah that's D 420k this one I

289
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:53,279
cleaned that one he cleaned really Oh

290
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:55,529
so there's a difference great so grab

291
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,240
yourself one there and oh wow dangerous

292
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:59,309
might want to go pointy I think I left

293
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,139
it a little dirty on the other end but

294
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:02,699
oh and it's just stuck together

295
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,769
it hasn't been pressed yeah I know it's

296
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,470
like that's like horrible Howard you

297
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:12,720
have to kind of shave it I'm scared

298
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:15,420
yeah it's so lovely looking so these

299
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,889
producers definitely for about 90% like

300
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:19,559
I commented on your Facebook the other

301
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:21,330
day but 90% of these produce there

302
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:25,889
90% of the people will benefit from

303
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:28,800
these producers there's a large portion

304
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:31,350
of the population that will do really

305
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,609
really really well of the of the city

306
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,940
population and people that have more

307
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:38,370
money that are living in suburban areas

308
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,560
though they're able to afford that and

309
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,759
they have the luxury exactly that will

310
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,909
work well for them but the people that

311
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,319
are a little bit more rural the people

312
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:48,870
that are living in more stretched out

313
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,180
communities outside of the Greater

314
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,190
Vancouver area Toronto Manitoba stuff

315
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,719
like that we need the ability to grow

316
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,490
because we're so far away from

317
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,080
dispensaries and we're so far away from

318
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,450
the city and the hostel and bustling

319
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,670
where these productions are normally

320
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,259
happening and designated to happen in

321
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:05,250
these agriculture areas we live nowhere

322
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:07,620
in here where these are going to be

323
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:10,259
happening so everything has to be done

324
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,529
by mail and we're sitting here in the

325
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:15,389
woods suffering from a condition waiting

326
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:18,000
for a package by the mail that might not

327
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:20,360
make it on time there I mean you could

328
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,190
break it down even as simple as the

329
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,409
disconnect of getting a medicine that's

330
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,450
just you know potentially grounding

331
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:29,730
irradiated and like grown by someone you

332
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,850
don't know and you never as opposed to

333
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,230
your plants that you've collected that

334
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,920
you've acquired through your own

335
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,320
personal bio acid

336
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,759
that you've grown that you've loved I

337
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,639
mean anyone that's ever growing cannabis

338
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,549
can attest that not only is it great for

339
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,669
the fact that it gets you cannabis resin

340
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:51,219
at the end of the disciple but it gets

341
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:53,528
you excited to grow and most people that

342
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:57,660
grow cannabis will also be inspired to

343
00:16:53,528 --> 00:16:57,659
grow some tomatoes or some cucumbers

344
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:06,970
do you just start growing so it's

345
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:13,870
another one of those things that should

346
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:15,910
always have the right to grow we're

347
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:26,289
gonna with that said we're gonna pop a

348
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:29,140
few more bowls so we're here with film

349
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:31,389
I'm checking out one of his sweatband

350
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:35,400
tents

351
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:41,160
so what is this a four by four by four

352
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,160
six inchee movement for six and change

353
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,049
these are sweat pants

354
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:59,210
tell us what you liked about this plan

355
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,400
well this is the OG 18 West Coast Sour

356
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,950
Diesel but basically just the best of

357
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,190
both of those worlds I wanted to take a

358
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:10,009
really really strong sour sour diesel

359
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,200
and cross it in with a few leek m-miss

360
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:14,450
of the og 18 and just kind of play off

361
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,970
whether those on each other and create

362
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:19,279
something that was perfect for my

363
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,829
condition that started starts on the top

364
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,869
of your head and goes down to the tip of

365
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:26,299
your body and just goes to every single

366
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:28,159
tip of your fingers and your toes hence

367
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:30,829
the name swept and it starts up here

368
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,880
goes all the way down for your whole

369
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:36,470
entire body so how much how many more

370
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,490
weeks to the east have I'll have about

371
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:43,210
four and a half five I take the swept

372
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,789
into like a leverage well

373
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:48,250
especially I usually pollinate a couple

374
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:50,710
of branches for bat frothing like this

375
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:53,740
one right here is pollinated about four

376
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:58,079
or five years ago it's a semi swollen

377
00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:01,720
Kalin's isn't it it's a little seeds so

378
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:03,819
once I pollinate it's about five or six

379
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,799
weeks until the seeds on the chair and I

380
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:07,929
usually pollinate around week three or

381
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:10,779
four when there's a nice nice flower

382
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:14,170
clusters already forming right so yeah

383
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:16,920
so about 11 or 12 weeks usually and that

384
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:19,180
especially with the push heavy strains

385
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:22,090
think of dominant strains you let it go

386
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,370
that extra week nice amber heads you add

387
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:26,769
to the salary tones you bring out more

388
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:29,589
flavors more sedative with that a

389
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:30,970
stronger some would say a stronger her

390
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:31,720
but you let it go a little bit longer

391
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,470
right

392
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,289
especially for neurological diseases

393
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,880
stress pain sleeping anxiety you might

394
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:42,940
want something a little bit more

395
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,490
sedative so letting it letting letting

396
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:50,370
go a little bit longer achieves that for

397
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:52,960

416
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:44,220

oh wow that is the silver rock star from

420
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:55,370
that man sees this one we selected

421
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,120
because it just stinks like blue cheese

422
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:59,298
dressing

423
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:01,039
specifically rotten as rotten as it

424
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:01,429
could ever be but lovely at the same

425
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,690
time

426
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:08,210
and if it definitely it can be pulled

427
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,558
down in nine weeks if you want that's

428
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,480
why it looks a little bit further along

429
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:14,089
than the rest of the room is it can't be

430
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,130
pulled down but again for that extra

431
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:19,369
aroma and set it up effective just

432
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:22,690
stinky stinky stinky smell you let it go

433
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:22,689
as long as the plant can

434
