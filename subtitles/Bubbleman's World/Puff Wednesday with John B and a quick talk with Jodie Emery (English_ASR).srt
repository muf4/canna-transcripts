124
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:06,289
study yeah back two years I archived IR

125
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:09,639
boasted back issues it's awesome MRI

126
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:18,620
centers we have this falconer it appears

127
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:24,490
I think I met mark 94 depending on the

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,490
open HEVC listo here self-efficacy stuff

129
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:33,100
earn at one point we found these spools

130
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:36,780
of thread that were him and they were 30

131
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:39,700
we found in a warehouse in Manitoba like

132
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:41,500
it was pretty cool we were like all

133
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,000
excited thinks we're total like because

134
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,850
the real weakness back then was that

135
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,879
people promoted camp clothing as you

136
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,740
know the strongest natural fiber but

137
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:56,250
they would sew the hem fabric together

138
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:56,250
with coffee brettly sew the hem garments

139
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,250
it was kind of like the hypocrisy of the

140
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:06,389
original mama indica seeds treats or any

141
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:09,639
of the hemp seed treats they were using

142
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:12,759
distilled steamed seeds they were using

143
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:16,569
inert seeds which of course removes all

144
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:18,159
the properties or the health problems

145
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,330
all the essential amino acids all the

146
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,459
things that are in there that are either

147
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,160
and promoting as a healthy thing

148
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:27,900
they were you couldn't sell like seed or

149
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,899
even access see that was not

150
00:11:32,230 --> 00:12:16,220
the idea the idea was there any heavy

151
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:19,550
Afghani and shishi berry is an Afghan

152
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,790
across so it's like an Afghani process

153
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:27,969
like okay they know a sativa like this

154
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:27,969
and then they destroy a box and that's

155
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,208
really

156
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,278

193
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,730
and just yeah just give us the update

194
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,339
some people may have heard this is the

195
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:55,670
year that things has returned to Canada

196
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:58,700
the mark was extradited in May 2010 and

197
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:01,309
his early release decoded behavior 85%

198
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,500
to five years really is July night so it

199
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:05,509
takes four to six weeks after that point

200
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,909
for him to get home or maybe longer I

201
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:10,399
sure hope not but what we expect is mark

202
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:12,769
should be back by late August maybe

203
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,629
September hopefully not September but

204
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:17,360
definitely in the middle of this year

205
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:19,939
and grew past the six-month countdown so

206
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,060
it's getting very very close yeah that's

207
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,680
amazing it's been a long strange

208
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:26,509
tumultuous forever oh it's crazy to

209
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,120
think that when Mark was extradited you

210
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,679
know Canada we had a bit of hope you

211
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,659
know you could defeat heart for maybe

212
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,250
with the Thunder election and then the

213
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:36,259
United States since you've been down

214
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,299
there they've legalized it in Washington

215
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:41,269
his prosecutor helped legalize and with

216
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:43,729
our help and in Colorado or mark sent

217
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:45,828
$10,000 to make medical legal long ago

218
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,959
they've been inspired they planted the

219
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:50,208
seeds of freedom they over grew the

220
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:52,849
government and now mark is going to come

221
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:55,669
home leaving the United States making

222
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,278
marijuana legal and Canada making all

223
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:59,870
plants completely illegal except for the

224
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:01,970
corporate companies that are going to be

225
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,190
crying it so Mark's gonna come home to

226
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,110
some serious work and we're not gonna

227
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,490
use actually on that that's for sure

228
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:11,300
well it's good the way out of Bowen

229
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:13,610
wrote you know Uncle Sam has ingested in

230
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:15,889
the form of mark Emery yes and I always

231
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,499
come back absolutely he went to the Bell

232
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:20,209
the bees didn't over grew it and now you

233
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:22,159
know they stole our prints and things

234
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,838
kind of got a little rough up here the

235
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,789
marks coming home and we're going to

236
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,920
kick some conservative but yeah I'm

237
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:29,509
definitely I have not looked forward to

238
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,688
I don't know

239
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:34,129
party gathering celebration like the one

240
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:38,868
that's going to occur when Mark gets

241
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:40,519
back yeah long it's gonna be quite a few

242
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:42,259
different parties and in fact that's

243
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,418
some may be rumors you guys have heard

244
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:47,149
we know not quite sure but apparently

245
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:49,458
prisoners who are Canadian being sent

246
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:52,339
back to Canada from the US are being

247
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:53,479
sent through Detroit and Windsor we

248
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:55,189
thought mark would be coming home

249
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,918
through Vancouver getting through the

250
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:59,958
airport I've traveled to but a friend of

251
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:03,078
his who's being sent home his cell mates

252
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:05,328
coming back to Canada is in that process

253
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:07,788
and says he goes to Ontario so in fact

254
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:10,668
everyone out in Toronto might get us

255
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:12,588

256
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:14,059
