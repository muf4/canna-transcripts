could be possibly put and I think I've

84
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:19,120

95
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,960
making hash Church a thing that I was

96
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,840
putting a ton of time and energy oh look

97
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,799
at that sweet skunk dab that just came

98
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:53,198
off of there just had to share that with

99
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,000
you guys that is some sweet skunk right

100
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,639
there can see how reflective it is

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,639
pretty trippy psychedelic almost

102
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,319
yeah he sure is so I'd really love to

103
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,400
get him on

104
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,399
there uh I think he would be a great

105
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,399
addition that is for

106
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:25,399
sure where should you send your resume

107
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,400
uh in regards to going on hash

108
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:32,038
Church well Trey I know nothing about

109
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,800
that except what Todd has told me uh I

110
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:35,519
don't think of him as a liar he has

111
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,720
proof he has a

112
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:41,000
video I I stay out of things like that

113
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,840
but obviously Todd is my friend uh he

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,279
told me that a long time ago I never

115
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,239
felt it was important I never felt like

116
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,758
it was my um responsibility to share it

117
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,319
but obviously if something like that

118
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,400
happens to you in life it's a it's a

119
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,400
touchy subject especially if someone is

120
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,758
in the community what do you do do you

121
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,560
hush hush hush the way he has quite been

122
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,919
for a long time or or do you finally say

123
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,280
Hey listen this is what's going

124
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:09,079
on cuz a lot of people in this industry

125
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:11,478
you know would appreciate that knowledge

126
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:14,120
now who knows if it's ever as cut and

127
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:17,000
dry as he said she said but having your

128
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:21,000
voice on a 911 tape definitely does not

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
sound good hey welcome Christopher

130
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:32,159
Cole just not stopping just not stopping

131
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,160
that's going to go for a

132
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,439
while oh sweet's going for the

133
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,359
win oh you know Brandon I did hear

134
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:46,240
that's terrible news I don't like to

135
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,080
hear that myself it's weird that they're

136
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,960
choosing certain ones and not choosing

137
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,318
other ones you know I wish they would

138
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:55,359
get off the it's such a tricky

139
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,840
situation because you have it's money

140
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,639
right it's all about money it's the

141
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,359
ability to make money we know that the

142
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,038
reason we all started selling pot in the

143
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,759
first place was to escapee their system

144
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,079
of money if you have to be a slave to

145
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,479
their money you know you're not able to

146
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,318
do the things that you want to do and so

147
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:13,240
in the beginning for me as I learned

148
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,199
about cannabis as a young person and I

149
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,639
was working hard shitty jobs and double

150
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,280
shifts and gas stations and that sort of

151
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,240
thing I sort of quickly realized that

152
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,679
just finding great herb and sharing it

153
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,400
with my just my circle of

154
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,560
friends is is a wonderful beautiful

155
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,878
thing and so that grew obviously to the

156
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,560
point where I felt like the whole world

157
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,360
was my friends and I wanted to I wanted

158
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,000
to get it out there to everyone and uh I

159
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,400
guess that's really what it's all about

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,720
right now is that is that profit margin

161
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,679
because obviously Canada has said that

162
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,199
we can have this people can grow it

163
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,720
people can buy it people can you know

164
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,280
now can we sell it that's the last sort

165
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,159
of right that we're waiting for and Mark

166
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,598
Emery did a really beautiful interview

167
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:59,959
recently if you guys go on my Facebook

168
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:02,279
um page and it's not the most most

169
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,959
recent post that I did but I will go

170
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,559
down I think I posted it just yesterday

171
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,318
and it's definitely worth checking out

172
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,918
it's a 5minute interview with Mark and

173
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,240
he basically says Hey listen you know

174
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,038
the people that have been that have been

175
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,038
torturing and harming people over this

176
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:17,598
plant for the last 50 plus years are the

177
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:19,560
same people that now want to be a part

178
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,478
of it and you know that's utter and

179
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,598
complete [ __ ] why should they have

180
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,918
any say in it he also says which I

181
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,639
really loved uh hello from Barcelona

182
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:31,878
Lorenzo nice to see you my friend he

183
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,038
also says that but um uh people who

184
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,879
don't smoke cannabis should have no say

185
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:37,519
in where cannabis is sold because it

186
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,399
doesn't affect them it only really

187
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,320
affects people that are buying cannabis

188
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,559
where it can be bought and sold uh so I

189
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,480
thought that was a brilliant point you

190
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,399
can go on my page and it's just a few

191
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,278
it's a few things down right below the

192
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,559
honeybees you'll see Prince of pot Mark

193
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,480
Emory on the future of marijuana

194
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:56,639
legalization in Canada they should have

195
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,039
use the word cannabis but that's just me

196
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,799

cup.car abis instead of marijuana become

217
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,480
a thing well serious jer's you know it

218
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,399
became a thing when we read Jack Herr's

219
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,399
or herrer sorry Jack harrer's book uh

220
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,919
the emperor wears no Clos back in the

221
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:01,839
'90s for me 91 92 93 and by 94 95 we

222
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:05,240
started realizing that you know a lot of

223
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:09,120
this this the use of this word marijuana

224
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:12,600
stems out of like a racism and a hatred

225
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,039
of black and brown people Mexican people

226
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,000
and you can kind of see it if you go

227
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,078
back and you look at it it's not really

228
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,839
uh uh yeah exactly it's a Spanish it's a

229
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:22,958
Spanish word that suddenly people were

230
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,320
saying in English but it definitely was

231
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,679
not uh used in a positive way and I

232
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,800
think that uh because it was this

233
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,759
certain agenda that tried to make

234
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,199
cannabis look so bad uh turn cannabis

235
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,240
into something different which was

236
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,160
marijuana the drug that would make you

237
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,879
crazy or end up you know making you do

238
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:44,078
crazy things uh I just don't use the

239
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:46,879
term that much I prefer the term um

240
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:49,719
cannabis for all of whether it's

241
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:53,838
industrial uh hemp or whether it's you

242
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,839
know high-grade Recreation whatever I

243
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,279
call it cannabis so for me it's been a

244
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,760
thing for a long

245
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:03,159
time like a long time 20 years maybe and

246
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sure for other people maybe longer

247
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,319
it just really depends on if you come to

248
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,639
to grips with that sort of hairy

249
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,879
anslinger propaganda and how it how it

250
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,480
stems out of racism you can't support it

251
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,879
damn I don't know Trey you know sooner

252
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,079
than later I would like to think I have

253
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,278
so many things going on down

254
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,958
there what is it like events in the

255
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,919
states um well Stephen it is going to be

256
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,879
a bit of a festival more so than just a

257
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,679
cup but obviously she wants to have you

258
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,240
know the glass blowing community she

259
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,359
wants to have vendors with a little

260
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,320
village that you can go through and Shop

261
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,680
she wants to have educational seminars

262
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,879
like hash church and these live

263
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,039
Facebooks that I do she's invited myself

264
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,519
and she's invited normal Canada to try

265
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:49,599
and uh organize as many good people

266
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:52,679
doctors and patients and uh uh Growers

267
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,240
uh Etc processors uh to discuss all the

268
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,719
different things that we love to discuss

269
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,799
about cannabis so that's one of the

270
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,879
things that I'm quite excited

271
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:04,078
about yeah right on Steve Ola shout out

272
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:08,120
from Winnipeg Manitoba my hometown East

273
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:10,799
clonan boy right here raised on Bowman

274
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:14,440
Avenue right off Henderson Highway

275
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,799
eventually mov to McLoud close to uh the

276
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,600
number one

277
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:19,679
Highway yeah I think it's going to be

278
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,000
cool you know I'm going to be there uh

279
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,439
Tony might end up being there I'm not

280
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,720
sure if he's going to make it but I will

281
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,760
be there for certain with tpin in hand

282
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,399
doing the tpine bar and the tarpine

283
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:32,600
taste uh taster uh Booth so that should

284
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,679
be

285
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:41,519
fun why do people still call it a drug

286
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:44,198
well I guess because drugs are

287
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,560
plant-based medicines that we use to

288
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:49,919
heal ourselves and then there's the you

289
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:52,838
know the fact that the the plants that

290
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:55,519
we're using could could be considered to

291
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:58,440
at least have drug content based on what

292
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,078
we uh Define as drug uh I also don't

293
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,600
like the term drugs where it turns into

294
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:05,519
a sort of you know an uh they're not

295
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,399
calling an pharmaceutical drugs they're

296
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,399
calling like cocaine and heroin and

297
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:12,320
methamphetamines and cannabis drugs and

298
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,600
I'm definitely not down with that myself

299
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,278
but

300
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,720
uh what do you call it if not drug um I

301
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:23,919
call them you know essential dietary

302
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,720
molecules um both essential amino acids

303
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:29,759
as well as phyto canabo

304
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,639
and um tpin

305
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:35,759
are are molecules that uh have healing

306
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,079
properties have incredible properties if

307
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,039
you want to call them a drug that's fine

308
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,078
with me I'm just saying I don't like the

309
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:46,120
term drugs when trying to put down uh

310
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:49,439
illegal substances over legal

311
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,000
ones yeah exactly Phil it's derogatory

312
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,079
when you usually when you say drugs it

313
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,039
sounds derogatory I guess it really

314
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,399
depends like anything what the energy

315
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:02,919
and the and the and the message behind

316
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:05,198
how it's being said uh I get my TPS from

317
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:06,399
the Blue River tpin we are in the

318
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,399
process of actually going to be

319
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,519
producing our very own Canadian Blue

320
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,120
River tpin here in the very near future

321
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,120
so that's quite

322
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,559
exciting is that what you would say to

323
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
someone in a quick convo I'm not sure if

324
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,278
you've noticed Jeff but I don't really

325
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,440
have quick convos for instance hanging

326
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:27,120
out on YouTube or uh Facebook usually

327
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,639

365
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,919

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,519
contain uh bosy and nor

367
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:09,639
bosy which are chemicals that definitely

368
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:11,679
seem to produce uh hallucinate

369
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,519
hallucinogens you know it's their they

370
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:18,159
they produce hallucinations they produce

371
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:20,799
almost for me anyway cartoon like

372
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,159
hallucinations um so different from any

373
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,958
other mushrooms I've ever really taken

374
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:28,240
mushrooms generally for me aren't that

375
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,919
hallucinogenic usually I'll see things

376
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,039
quickly happen happening in um in

377
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:35,240
Shadows and if I take a knif like over

378
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,639
five or six gram which is a lot that's

379
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,680
not really like a hangout with your

something along that lines I was I

398
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,000

399
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:24,000
vages of Facebook and how people will

400
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,558
post these vague things it's like man

401

452
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,159
that's what I always tell people even

453
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,279
though they seem to be disappointed that

454
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:30,240
I don't see what they post but generally

455
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,839
if you're not following like imagine

456
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,120
5,000 people follow you and then like I

457
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,038
didn't know how Facebook worked

458
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:37,839
initially so I just click accept accept

459
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:39,839
accept which made me their friends and

460
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,798
then I started seeing the most [ __ ] up

461
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,918
[ __ ] come across my Facebook feed I'd be

462
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:46,400
like wow like who the [ __ ] is posting

463
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,440
this crazy [ __ ] and so I started having

464
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,240
to delete people I thank God for

465
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,759
different sort of social experiments

466
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,359
they do in the news because you know

467
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:57,400
they'll post people will allow

468
00:19:54,359 --> 00:20:00,599
themselves through news stories to uh um

469
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,840
unveil their own racis ISM or hatred or

470
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,240
nastiness and so that made it very easy

471
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:07,079
to go through Facebook and lose a ton of

472
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,480
people but uh for those of you that want

473
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:12,319
to be my friend on Facebook I suggest

474
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,679
just follow me you'll get all the

475
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,720

476
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:19,759
way for

yeah I guess so I'm not too sure it's

484
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:37,279
also social media which is a social

485
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,039
experiment on its own self that we're

486

491
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:01,760
true oh yeah well Trump was just one for

492
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:06,240
me I I allowed the Pokemon go Trump um

493
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:08,599
videos of cops arresting beating killing

494
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,880
what all that [ __ ] like all the [ __ ]

495
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:13,119
that you're super upset with in society

496
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,640
now I'm not saying that you should sweep

497
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,959
it under the rug and not expose it don't

498
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,720
get me

499
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,600
wrong but you know at the same time your

500
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,159
social media feed is what you follow and

501
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,359
allow to be shown in that feed and it's

502
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,200
uh I don't think it's a good idea to

503
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:32,839
have that much negativity just buzzing

504
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,558
all the time and making you think a

505
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:37,399
certain way and making you react a

506
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,678
certain way so my simple reaction was to

507
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,640
unfriend the people that posted all of

508
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,400
that stuff and uh I was at 5,000 for a

509
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,320
while and I don't know what I'm at

510
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:52,720
anymore but it's definitely like 4,000

511
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:54,399
or 3,000 oh [ __ ] it's actually 4,800 man

512
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,120
am I accepting

513
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,640
people I don't know I got to keep going

514
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,879
through maybe it was only a couple of a

515
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,640
couple hundred people that were driving

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,360

533
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,240

00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:02,440
Blue River extracts.

538
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:10,199
CA oh yeah that would be great Michael

539
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,720
that would be great but uh you know I

540
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,840
don't know Joe

541
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,880
personally and it is kind of a random

542
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:19,038
with like Joe would have to want to do

543
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,480
that you know we could never ask Joe of

544
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,759
that and that's the problem that uh you

545
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,919
know you can't just go to people like

546
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:25,558
that and say hey it would be great if

547
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,120
you used all your traction and your

548
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:32,480
awesomeness to like expose my much less

549
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:34,639
traction show uh you know he's he'd have

550
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,679
to love it if he saw it and he thought

551
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,919
you know what this is something I can

552
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,960
get behind to think what these guys are

553
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,559
doing as good I'm going to help them out

554
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,640
then awesome but uh I don't know if

555
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:45,200
that's ever going to happen I think uh

556
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,240
you know we're just going to keep

557
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,919
chugging along hopefully making the

558
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,839
right choices because the internet is

559
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:52,159
very reactive and all it takes is one

560
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:54,759
bad choice and all of a sudden people

561
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,559
turn their backs on you but uh as long

562
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:58,200
as we can keep sharing information and

563
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,879
people can keep learning and bettering

564
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,400
themselves I think that's what they show

565
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,960
up for you know I don't think they're

566
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,640
showing up for any other reason than uh

567
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,558
than that and that's a good

568
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,440
thing uh no my my opinion is not that

569
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:13,720
ignorance is bliss you know I had these

570
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,159
arguments years ago when I stopped watch

571
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,159
uh reading the newspaper and the media

572
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,559
because these stories are manipulations

573
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:23,440
and yes they are happening but it's like

574
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:25,759
back in the day who was it that stood on

575
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,480
the corner in Compton in California and

576
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:31,200
showed about statistically how murder

577
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,360
rate had gone down but the way the media

578
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,240
portrayed the murder rate in the area it

579
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:39,719
had gone up like 800% so although less

580
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,880
people were being shot the media was

581
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,000
showing more of the stories when people

582
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,960
were getting shot so all I'm saying is

583
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,558
don't let the

584
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:52,159
media control your thought pattern it

585
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:53,678
doesn't mean you have to be ignorant

586
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,799
because nowadays we have many more

587
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,840
sources to go to for news but we just

588
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:59,798
have to be careful if if we just take

589
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:02,798
our social Medias which were originally

590
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:06,079
used to take down regimes like in Egypt

591
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:08,398
and like to to to show to expose

592
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:12,519
corruption but you just continue to

593
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:14,000
repost the same old CNN and uh NBC and

594
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:16,240
all these other different major news

595
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
outlets you're really not getting

596
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,319
anything other than the same news

597
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,880
they've always been giving you and I

598
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:25,839
don't think it is too hard to believe

599
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,039
and understand that the media is a

600
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:31,558
extreme form of manipulation they're a

601
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,480
huge piece of the puzzle right now when

602
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:37,480
it comes to um disseminating out

603
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,079
propaganda to control the masses through

604
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,759
their particular agendas which is have

605
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,319
you smoke lots of cigarettes and drink

606
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:47,519
lots of coffee and drink lots of booze

607
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:49,918
while working many many hours uh as a as

608
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,918
a drone these These are the these are

609
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,120
the experiences they want us in and it's

610
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,640
uh it's no it's no surprise that in the

611
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,719
Cannabis industry you see a lot of

612
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,559
people that are trying to escape that

613
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,440
you know just trying to escape that and

614
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,240
cannabis kind of gives us that ability

615
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,320
when you first you know when I first

616
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,319
came across it and the ability to sell

617
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:12,439
and trade it and make a few dollars and

618
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,319
although that prohibition profit you

619
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,679
know turned out to be uh to come with a

620
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:19,879
large karmic debt and good people ended

621
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,320
up you know going to jail and being

622
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,520
busted and having their lives uh

623
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:27,439
destroyed it still is what it is thanks

624
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,359
Sean I'm glad you're uh I'm glad you dig

625
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,120
it dude

626
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,839
yeah Michael you know if it happens it

627
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:36,839
happens you know I'd never asked Todd

628
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,599
for that but if Joe Rogan and Todd did

629
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,158
that one day and or Joe wanted to come

630
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:42,038
on hash church I think it would be

631
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,080
amazing to say the least I like what

632
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:45,599
he's doing I like his audience I like

633
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,038
that he's a smart guy and he shoots the

634
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,278
[ __ ] and he talks about interesting

635
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,798
things and people they hear when he's

636
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,079
talking and the people that he brings on

637
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,599
his show although I don't watch it a ton

638
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:57,480
the few times that I have watched it

639
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:00,240
it's been quite enjoyable they're real

640
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,240
people having real

641
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,558
conversations no I do not but I'm

642
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:22,158
excited I took it

643
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,038
I do not fish off my boat I'm not really

644
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:34,640
a fisherman I have a lot of friends that

645
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,759
are fishermen they have special boats

646
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,759
for fishing

647
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:42,158
with everything you could possibly have

648
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:46,079
uh but my boat is a competition ski and

649
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:49,080
and wakeboard towboat so we mostly just

650
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:52,639
have fun we crank the stereo and we puff

651
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:55,398
