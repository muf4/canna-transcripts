[Music]

2
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,118
now we're going to have to mute that

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,118
right off the bat how's that okay

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,719
make sure that's

5
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,558
available welcome to Bubble man's world

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,480
I'm here today with uh my good buddy

7
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,878
John and uh we were thinking today that

8
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,839
we were going to share with you uh we

9
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,079
don't want to say you know the proper

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,079
way to hit a bowl of full melt but I

11
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,840
guess our proper way the way we feel

12
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,198
like we feel like a lot of people are

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,320
not hitting full melt and bubble

14
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:57,920
properly they're they're torching it

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,640
exactly John's noticing this as he's

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,519
making dry sift and wet wash these days

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,359
that is of full m quality and he's

18
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:05,158
sharing it with a lot of people I go to

19
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,118
the Cannabis Cup every year which I will

20
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,040
be at uh in a couple weeks November 24th

21
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:11,599
to 29th with John if you want to come

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,080
see us at the booth we'll be around

23
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,158
walking around and having a good time um

24
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,158
that's in Amsterdam but uh a lot of

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,280
people just they just don't know how to

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,719
hit the bong they'll especially with a

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,359
beeline they'll either suck out the

28
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,840
flame and then they get a taste from the

29
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,280
Smoke Off the end of the Bee Line and

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,000
they say they don't like Bee Line cuz it

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,478
leaves a flavor you're not really

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
supposed to burn the Bee Line out and

33
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:32,679
inhale the the smoke from the beon you

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,159
just want to use the flame as your sort

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,720
of wafting tool so we're going to do a

36
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,159
little video for you today I got my

37
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,280
macro lens so I'll do some sort of

38
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,320
showing you what we're doing from a

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,118
distance and then I'll try to put it in

40
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,199
as well clips of us closeup of just

41
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:50,560
gently the process of what we're doing

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,200
to hit the bong properly so first of all

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,359
I would begin with depending on what

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,240
bong you're hitting there's going to be

45
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,560
a learning curve cuz every bong perks

46
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,839
differently some bongs it's almost like

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,840
a horsepower of a car it's just really

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,240
strong and you're trying to take off

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,640
very slowly without screeching the

50
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:09,000
wheels some bongs are just like that you

51
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,919
know you give them the tiniest little

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,520
bit of suction and they just the water

53
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,000
goes up to your mouth it'll suck the

54
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,800
flame out so before taking a hit

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,878
sometimes it's not a bad idea to just

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,400
feel the perk when we were talking about

57
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:24,878
that feel the perk of the bong step one

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,280
you know just sus it out before you hold

59
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,560
a flame he's hitting a rure treating

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,400
yourself addition I'm hitting a

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,479
Mothership straight Fab and they both

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
perk quite differently I would not hit

63
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:38,039
his bong the same way I would hit this

64
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:41,360
one anyway smaller we sler yeah it's a

65
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,158
lot slower deeper CH it's a deeper so

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,599
with that one there I know I love that

67
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:48,479
bong this is what I use whenever I puff

68
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:51,518
Med cush mhm excellent all right so well

69
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,598
we've got uh a giant jar here of some uh

70
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,599
full melt cush bubble uh there's

71
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:59,119
probably about 30 G here and uh of

72
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:01,119
course John's got his uh superb quality

73
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,158
that we made on our our last video that

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,920
we posted making a fresh Frozen whole

75
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:08,000
plant extract and so yeah let me have to

76
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,679
smell that what do we got 120 90 oh

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,719
that's a 73 73 you know how it works so

78
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,840
well for me it's absolutely all right

79
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,000
well let's load ourselves a bowl

80
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,560
here we'll do a little a little

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
bage and and and when puff on something

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,280
like that you can see how small that's

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
all I ever really use I'm not doing a

84
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,479
big rip yeah no exactly and it's uh yeah

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,959
it gets right down to it that's the

86
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:35,798
quality is so good that you don't really

87
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,080
need to put like 300 uh there's a hair

88
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,799
right there we don't want that no that's

89
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,959
okay we'll do

90
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,640
we throw the lid back on that using our

91
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,239
Skillet tools here they can come in

92
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,158
handy sometimes it's a little bit

93
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,759
difficult to just big fingers kind of

94
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,400
trying to grab little pieces of hat

95
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,759
perfect little tools when dealing with

96
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,280
this perfect little to there's so many

97
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,518
different ones I got about 15 of them

98
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,759
actually so I never run out of two when

99
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,959
it comes in all right let's see if we

100
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,280
can find out Li that lighter sitting

101
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,039
right here I got one too a nice so let

102
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,680
us light our beines we're both hitting

103
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,199
with beine today we're not going to say

104
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,438
this is the only way to hit a bowl but

105
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,199
this is what we're doing today um

106
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,919
there's there's cordless units like the

107
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:16,279
amberber ceramic uh heater that is also

108
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,879
a great way to hit a bowl and there's

109
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,879
electric nails and there's sublimator

110
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,759
and all these different things we'll

111
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,759
talk about over time but today we're

112
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,360
talking

113
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,080
beine and uh I think John and I both

114
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,639
have a similar technique when it comes

115
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,758
to the beine which is uh wafting the

116
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,038
flame gently over the bubble allowing it

117
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,520
to melt uh hitting it and then letting

118
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:36,839
it melt for a while if you hold the

119
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,478
flame too long those volatile turpins in

120
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,560
my opinion are just destroyed they're

121
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:44,560
never really appreciated so uh here we

122
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,560
go

123
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:50,299
[Music]

124
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,240
that was just so tasty I could even pull

125
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,720
it all the way through cuz I was really

126
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,759
nice gently so nice and of course the

127
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,600
more gently you waft your flame over the

128
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,120
resin and the Less Direct

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,000
contact the more flavor and taste is

130
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,759
going to come through in that hit and I

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,560
think the the guys who are doing a lot

132
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,199
of dabbing with sublimator and enails

133
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,519
and den nails and

134
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,919
such are also finding the same thing

135
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,000
that when you bring those temperatures

136
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:36,719
down uh it's a world of difference

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,120
compared to the the young guy who's just

138
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,919
first time torching the nail orange hot

139
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,680
and then droing bubble in an orange hot

140
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:46,240
nail I used to do that many people used

141
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:49,038
to do that so thanks for joining us

142
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,120
today short video we're going to we're

143
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,759
going to sit here and do some more

144
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,600
puffing actually but um you know what we

145
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,240
were uh definitely talking about this I

146
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,400
had a little chat with jod about it

147
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,400
yesterday too about just not proper way

148
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,079
to hit

149
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,799
just to kind of gently and when we say

150
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,839
proper it's the way that seems to be the

151
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,520
most efficient and effective for what it

152
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,159
is it's such a valuable thing we just

153
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,478
did bubble we should do some full melt

154
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,880
dry sift too yeah we might do a walk the

155
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:15,359
dry sift you know so this here is

156
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:18,519
actually that product sitting right

157
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,479
there oh yes and this is medy this would

158
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:24,038
be U well that's an O

159
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:27,839
cross um unknown uh it's uh definitely

160
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:29,159
some Bag oh my goodness yeah yeah not

161
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,879
going to be able to really show it to

162
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,479
you guys but I'll take a picture and

163
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,918
I'll add it into the video so you can

164
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,918
see the quality of uh what we're ready

165
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:40,120
to puff and the same thing applies um I

166
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,279
find with the dry sift it's a little bit

167
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,439
quicker than the

168
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:47,959
Buttle yeah absolutely another thing I

169
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,759
would talk about as I'm watching uh John

170
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:52,519
load the just most awesomely huge Bowl

171
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,038
uh the guy who grew the herb and the guy

172
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:57,359
who made the dry sift is the guy who can

173
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,959
load huge bowls don't take someone

174
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,520
else's dry sift and load a big bowl for

175
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:05,079
yourself it's just not the best

176
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:07,000
etiquette I just you know it's not the

177
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,478
best etiquette I love I give it I love

178
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,240
handling it out to people who truly need

179
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,959
some nice little hint of some nice F

180
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,400
medicine and they're really afraid of

181
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,318
smoking a big joint smelling I try to

182
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,359
explain how this is a proper way of just

183
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,560
a nice little mhm Perfect all right full

184
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,400
melt dryft following um yeah this was

185
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,399

friends and here we go here we go same

189
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,720
thing same app but this one's

190
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,199
quicker and that's what you don't

191
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:44,959
do that's a prime example that even

192
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,598
someone who hits a lot sometimes gets a

193
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,719
little excited and uh pulls it on that's

194
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,399
much much easier to do in the RAR cuz

195
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,039
it's a deep juggling

196
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,079
perk the mother ship is almost a gentle

197
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,918
perk even though you can pick it up and

198
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:01,318
get it really going

199
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,120
it's got a really

200
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,439
incredible uh learning curve to it for
