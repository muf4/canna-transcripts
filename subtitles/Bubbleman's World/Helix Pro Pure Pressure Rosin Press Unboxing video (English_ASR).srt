1
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:35,920
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world I

2
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:37,030
am here today fresh after Christmas I

3
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,340
guess it's a couple of days after

4
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,160
Christmas the 27th hope you all had a

5
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,890
wonderful holidays and enjoyed your time

6
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,539
with your family I feel like a kid on

7
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,058
Christmas morning because I have a new

8
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:53,170
package from pure pressure in Colorado

9
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:57,009
my favorite rosin press company and I'm

10
00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:01,660
hoping that this is either the helix or

11
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:03,670
the helix Pro manual rosin press so I

12
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:04,539
wanted to do an unboxing video with you

13
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,150
guys I'm not sure if you're familiar

14
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,160
with the helix Pro I can put the picture

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,520
up here real quick it's the helix Pro is

16
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:15,340
a 5 ton manual rosin press they are

17
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:17,618
expected January 2019 so they're doing

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,659
25 pre-orders for this particular thing

19
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:22,899
it's got bigger heat plates and more

20
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:24,310
force than the helix it's exclusive

21
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:26,590
preorder pricing as a thousand bucks

22
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,570
down and then you know three weeks

23
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,040
before shipping you can pay the rest of

24
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:32,469
the the price I think it's another

25
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,590
twenty nine hundred for this particular

26
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:37,299
unit every pre-order comes with a free

27
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,030
matching accessory kit and entry into

28
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:42,969
their contest where one is going to win

29
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,519
a second press for free for a friend or

30
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,989
for yourself so top features user

31
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,349
friendly and easy to twist press

32
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:52,118
operation no air compressor required

33
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:54,339
ultra accurate force measuring load cell

34
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:56,920
which displays bag pressure in real time

35
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,770
that's a market first for manual rosin

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,629
press super responsive pressure control

37
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:05,109
that allows for as little as 10 pound

38
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:07,659
force increments press up to 12 grams of

39
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:10,659
flowers or 20 grams of kefir hash at a

40
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:12,729
time with ease features our press wear

41
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:15,669
technology which offers a full-color LCD

42
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:18,818
touchscreen with custom software for

43
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:21,068
even more control you can save up to 29

44
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:22,810
preset recipes so once you dial in your

45
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:25,359
settings you can repeat your results

46
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,159
over and over and over again up to five

47
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,220
tons of force which is ten thousand

48
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:32,949
pounds of force output from our hundred

49
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:35,289
percent custom engineered lead screw

50
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:36,939
twist press technology these guys have

51
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:39,340
put a lot of time and energy

52
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:41,289
so trust me when I say these guys

53
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,400
understand engineering and they really

54
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:47,019
produce their rosin presses from an

55
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,599
engineer's perspective that's how the

56
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:52,270
machine is getting built even heat

57
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,039
distribution from zero Fahrenheit to 300

58
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,110
Fahrenheit from our in-house machined

59
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:59,560
aluminum plates each with its own

60
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,180
thermocouple which is great temperature

61
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,150
accuracy to less than one degree

62
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,670
Fahrenheit ultra durable powder coated

63
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,039
construction and of course their patent

64
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:12,069
pending so I say we get started right

65
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,709
away it was just such a pleasure when my

66
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,900
long Peaks showed up I loved the way

67
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,150
they shipped it I loved everything about

68
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,670
how they packaged it it was just really

69
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,439
quite a pleasure to open that package

70
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:27,819
and I kind of have a feeling this one's

71
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:34,169
not gonna be too too different crack off

72
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:34,169
this lid see see what's inside

73
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,799
just a little bit of papers so you've

74
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:54,430
got your invoice got your invoice right

75
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,739
there you've got rosin bag filters which

76
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,270
is quite nice I'll take a photo of it

77
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,009
and put it up on the screen so you can

78
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,709
see about their press moulds they're

79
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:05,349
specialized scraping tools you know the

80
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,989
funnel kit the quick flip the bag sizes

81
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:10,750
the screen sizes all of these different

82
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:13,060
things are pretty pretty important to

83
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,620
kind of know where you sit how rosin is

84
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,988
pressed they have a really nice little

85
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,298
folder which I will also photograph and

86
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:21,099
put up on the screen so you can look at

87
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:24,099
that and see the different screen sizes

88
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,810
and from flower to Keith to bubble hash

89
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,460
and the different tips for the different

90
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,530
things and the consistencies and the

91
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:32,019
textures these guys have really been

92
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:32,809
doing a great job I gotta say working

93
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:36,049
with them has

94
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:39,709
an absolute pleasure so they also have a

95
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:42,680
little card in there for the harvest

96
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:44,269
rate pharmaceutical freeze dryer all

97
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,840
right look at that here's the top right

98
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:49,549
there be careful with our knife so it's

99
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,899
gonna be somewhat careful when you're

100
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,400
using a knife especially when you're

101
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:57,399
opening a package that you don't know

102
00:04:52,399 --> 00:05:01,579
exactly how it's been shipped all right

103
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:05,539
so these look like the little feet put

104
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:09,199
those down over here there's four of

105
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:15,560
them so that makes sense all right what

106
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:17,750
else we got here yes this is the beat of

107
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,569
the press I've seen these enough times

108
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:24,560
to know these go on the side of the

109
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:28,750
machine with the feet that screw into

110
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,579
them so that should be easy enough to do

111
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:34,728
while we're on the unboxing video let's

112
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:37,370
just screw these right into here we'll

113
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:39,909
go as much as we can I'm not sure how

114
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,918
much we should leave but probably

115
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:49,340
probably a little bit one two three four

116
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:51,049
threads one two three four threads one

117
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:52,689
two three four threads perfect that's

118
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:57,319
the right height

119
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:59,209
get the other one in here what I love

120
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,209
about peer pressure is just the quality

121
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:04,399
of the craftsmanship you know the idea

122
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:06,349
that this came from a real engineering

123
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:10,370
standpoint and they put a lot of thought

124
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:12,350
into into putting this this unit

125
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,379
together it is definitely not something

126
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:18,620
that is fly by the pants seat of your

127
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:20,509
pants construction they really do an

128
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,259
incredible job I might actually cut this

129
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:27,740
whole box away rather than try to lift

130
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:29,649
out the press I think that is what I'm

131
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:34,150
gonna do

132
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:39,489
yeah we're gonna give you a little show

133
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:41,079
on what's going on in here not sure

134
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,579
exactly what all these components are

135
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:45,310
because I've never seen this unit before

136
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:49,469
so you're seeing it really for the first

137
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:55,350
time with me here

138
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:55,350
not sure which these guys are for oh

139
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:08,379
yeah this is our little handle yeah that

140
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,889
that little guy right there for cranking

141
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:17,139
it on the top of the unit I like it I

142
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:19,418
like it a lot and on to this one right

143
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,860
here it's definitely not as heavy as I

144
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:24,519
thought it might meet which is really

145
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:28,660
nice this definitely goes down right on

146
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:32,049
top boom just like that your handle gets

147
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:34,210
inserted and then okay so the screws are

148
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,000
actually right in the unit which is

149
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:38,918
great I can take this off I like how

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,620
easy this goes on and off and it doesn't

151
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:50,589
seem to need to be locked in place which

152
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:51,970
is very nice okay so I suspect these are

153
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:54,459
gonna go like that there you can also

154
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,320
put this unit like this so you can

155
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:58,560
actually have it like this setup where

156
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,899
it's sort of horizontal versus vertical

157
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,579
so both options are there all right so I

158
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,348
already got the one leg on what are the

159
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:07,839
things with these guys that I make a bit

160
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:09,909
of a mistake is they'll have a tiny

161
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,649
little bend on their foot and naturally

162
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,260
I'll think that the feet go to the

163
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:16,029
outside this is actually the opposite of

164
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:18,728
how it goes you can see the feet go in

165
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:21,299
the unit builds up and there's three

166
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:24,788
little allen keys right here in the side

167
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,389
but are fairly easy to unscrew I could

168
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:29,839
be using a drill in making

169
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,439
easier but i'm using an allen key so be

170
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,110
it

171
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,750
and so i love the way the screws just

172
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,090
come in in place in the machine you

173
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,710
don't have to look for a little bag and

174
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,960
try and find the screws it's quite easy

175
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,550
you just go to where you're going to be

176
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,170
screwing them in and they're already

177
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:48,769
there so it's just a matter of removing

178
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:51,019
them and then screwing them in to secure

179
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:53,679
the feet and I guess that's done because

180
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:56,740
the feet can go on a variety of ways the

181
00:08:53,679 --> 00:09:01,399
way they've got it set up you can put it

182
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:06,860
vertical or horizontal so all right just

183
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:11,149
get this up here threading is just

184
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,919
really done well it's not gonna be

185
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:14,959
problematic where your screws aren't

186
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:17,779
aren't screwing in nicely or the going

187
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:22,240
in sideways everything just lines up

188
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:30,159
really really well on these units and I

189
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:35,029
appreciate that about about them okay

190
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:41,870
there we go little make sure they're

191
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:45,649
tight on both sides yep yep yep boom

192
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:48,830
look at that there it is right there it

193
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:51,169
comes with a power cord got the same

194
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:53,270
great digital screen and really left the

195
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:55,639
little screen I like the look of this

196
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:58,009
little unit I'm pretty excited about it

197
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:00,199
alright so I figured we should do a

198
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:03,019
little press I've got a little bit of

199
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:07,670
canvas here it sounds like we can press

200
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:09,169
a solid 12 grams of flour at a time on

201
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:11,689
this little unit so we're gonna take the

202
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:13,579
little flip tool that they have I've got

203
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,800
the screen over top here this is a

204
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,170
hundred and fifteen micron screen we're

205
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:20,059
just gonna flip it inside out

206
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:23,329
that's gonna get that seam on the inside

207
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:24,389
for us and it will hold a lot less oil

208
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,639
as

209
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:28,679
you know contaminants capturing oil that

210
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:32,789
we really would rather have release I've

211
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:36,120
got my little funnel I'm going to put on

212
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:39,029
my gloves so we've got our little bag

213
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,009
we've got our little 12 grams of herb I

214
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:44,189
am of course pressing my all-time

215
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:50,819
favorite where is my bike just such a

216
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:53,960
great flower to press as it truly really

217
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:58,620
releases an incredible amount of resin

218
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,389
so we'll go into there nice I've gone

219
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,669
off about these tools before but I might

220
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:06,889
as well a little bit again I just love

221
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:10,949
the ease with which these tools operates

222
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:12,750
I've got quite a bit of extra room it's

223
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,430
definitely not going all the way to the

224
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,169
top I'll have a nice little bit of

225
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:20,189
screen I'll just be able to fold over

226
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:26,639
I brought my pure pressure template here

227
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:38,400
for pre pressing the pre press get that

228
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:43,559
in there much better over there so we've

229
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:46,860
got a nice flattened piece here this is

230
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:50,069
the older one that I took from and then

231
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:52,200
we have some papers so they sent me once

232
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,960
again with some screens all sorts of

233
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,280
varieties of screens here which I was

234
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,230
very happy I'll be doing some

235
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:01,639
experimenting including stainless steel

236
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:05,370
screens right there send me some

237
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:07,699
stickers which I will be giving away to

238
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:13,320
some folks

239
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:18,480
all right so oh man oh they even sent me

240
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:21,180
a new see that so let's get this opened

241
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,980
up and access some of this paper I

242
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:25,679
wondered why this paper was a little

243
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,389
smaller than the parchment that I'm used

244
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,659
to but I get

245
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:33,529
it makes very good sense in the sense

246
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:37,490
that we're using a much smaller press so

247
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:39,889
too will we be using much smaller paper

248
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,419
so I think first things first because

249
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:44,240
we're not ready to press yet let's hit

250
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:48,199
the switch on this little boy this bad

251
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,940
boy will see the screen line up probably

252
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,320
come over to the side here a little bit

253
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:57,140
and you turn it okay please remove force

254
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:03,040
from press then press okay all right

255
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:05,899
let's remove force from press okay ah

256
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:08,569
there we go so it opens up the same old

257
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,230
LED screen that I'm used to and know and

258
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,650
love

259
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,330
it's giving me my force it's got system

260
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:16,129
settings it's got recipes it's got a

261
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:19,460
quick press it's got run recipe it's

262
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:23,870
about last run data so I say we go into

263
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:27,519
recipes I have merely turned the heaters

264
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:30,700
on here and here I've got my settings at

265
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,720
220 Fahrenheit which for the you know

266
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,530
recipe that we're gonna be running is

267
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,860
gonna work fine for me let's go back to

268
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:43,009
home let's go back to recipes and let's

269
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:46,700
go back to this one so this one edit

270
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:48,529
recipe name set material type well

271
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,910
restarted it again that's interesting

272
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:54,970
well let's you know what let's do it so

273
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:57,740
we'll go select flour select bag size

274
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,540
okay so it's adding that the weight

275
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,779
based on bag side it's got the

276
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:06,319
temperatures it's got my pressures

277
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:08,360
alright so I'll just go run and then I

278
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,940
have to push start press when we're

279
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,730
actually ready to do this and I'll be

280
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:18,620
turning this little guy to to check out

281
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:22,250
how how well it works so very very cool

282
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:25,399
little unit these guys do such a great

283
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,600
job it's got a little drip tray for

284
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,370
those of you that didn't know what this

285
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,519
was

286
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,740
it's loose weight now

287
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,189
was playing around with it now I'm gonna

288
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:37,100
hold the camera but I love the idea of a

289
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:41,540
drip tray I have to admit there we go

290
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:45,120
because these sides I've had parchment

291
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:47,909
absolutely drip down inside the machine

292
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,529
on my long Peaks so this is a very nice

293
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:52,049
little unit right here this little drip

294
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,819
tray it comes in and out very easy you

295
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:56,579
can lift it right out if you don't want

296
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,290
to use it and it's just a matter of

297
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,560
actually opening up the press a little

298
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:05,069
bit which happens very easy with a

299
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:07,049
little bit of twisting and this just

300
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,900
pops right out so that's our little tray

301
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:12,419
right there I also found out that these

302
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:15,569
particular guys are obviously clamps and

303
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:18,029
what they are for is to clamp the unit

304
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:20,220
down to any table that you're working on

305
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:23,069
if need be if you're really cranking

306
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:26,700
away at this thing so I'm going to use

307
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:29,760
the drip tray you can put it down over

308
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:34,430
this way because that's where the wiring

309
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,429
is I'll fit that a nice and carefully

310
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:43,350
there you go perfect alright so we'll

311
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:46,740
wait for these to heat up it's already

312
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:49,980
at 105 degrees potentially oh look at

313
00:15:46,740 --> 00:16:03,269
that it even came with magnets these

314
00:15:49,980 --> 00:16:05,550
guys are on the ball you can keep that

315
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:06,899
on it's quite a bit of parchment coming

316
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:09,829
off the back which is never a problem

317
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:13,019
for me because I love when I have a real

318
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:15,509
squisher to be able to have that little

319
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:19,500
bit of back room for the oil to escape

320
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:21,419
into so very excited 12 gram runs

321
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,639
obviously this is a lot smaller than I'm

322
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:25,528
used to doing I'm used to doing 35 to 40

323
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:29,338
gram runs a flower and even high

324
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:31,828
- but who knows this is like a real nice

325
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:33,600
little small unit I can carry it around

326
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:36,388
with me and I suspect I could get this

327
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,028
thing to fit into a pelican case which

328
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:40,799
means adventures in rosin making how fun

329
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:42,448
would it be to take the bubble bags and

330
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,818
the dry set of screens and the rosin

331
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:47,909
press up to the ice cave on the parrots

332
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:51,929
and ice caps and bust out some high

333
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:54,328
quality and that is what's up so we are

334
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:58,649
at a hundred and thirty nine degrees

335
00:16:54,328 --> 00:17:00,269
Fahrenheit not too bad both sixty to

336
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:04,318
eighty degrees away from the temperature

337
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:07,919
that we're looking at and as you can see

338
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:09,990
there are important components to

339
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,329
getting this you know to making this

340
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,068
easy to making it you know less

341
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:17,068
difficult and difficult and that's about

342
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:19,349
having all of the proper tools make sure

343
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:23,759
you have your bags okay what do I have

344
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:27,359
the bags I have some 90 microns I have

345
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:30,359
some 36 microns I have some 72 microns

346
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,609
and I have some hundred and fifteen

347
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,319
microns so for different sized bags

348
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:37,288
most of these bearings are used for

349
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:40,859
flour 36 micronized use for hash we've

350
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:44,129
got the template for pressing we've got

351
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:46,319
our funnels which I can put the dirty

352
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:50,850
ones in here as well as our flipper unit

353
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:54,808
which is very key and then we've got our

354
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:57,329
our bags our parchment paper so that's

355
00:17:54,808 --> 00:18:00,029
also very important just kind of getting

356
00:17:57,329 --> 00:18:04,500
all this stuff out of here that's pretty

357
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:08,730
cool the way you can the way you can you

358
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:11,548
know basically attach these two to a

359
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:15,089
table and it's it's not very difficult

360
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:20,398
to do is it you're just gonna try maybe

361
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:22,379
one while we're sitting here tables not

362
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:28,479
queue wide but definitely wide enough

363
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:31,270
that it's there's that

364
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,579
one other one of those little doctors

365
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:35,980
not sure this so that's actually a

366
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:38,230
really good idea I'm sure once you get

367
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,940
you know moving on this thing you could

368
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,630
get a little excited depending on who

369
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,580
you are

370
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,110
you could start moving the whole unit

371
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:57,279
and that's not really gonna be an ideal

372
00:18:44,109 --> 00:19:03,119
situation so when the screen gets put in

373
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:07,269
properly and doesn't doesn't come out

374
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:18,509
because then we end up with with a fair

375
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:18,509
bit of screen contaminant and a plate

376
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,789
nice to be able to put my finger in

377
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,799
there or not worry about the whole press

378
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,629
squishing it and crushing it that's very

379
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:35,460
nice

380
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:35,460
okay so let's go start press stage one

381
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:58,410
yeah so we're at 729 pounds we're at a

382
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:58,410
thousand 1,100 forces at 2,800 okay

383
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:10,590
forces at 4600 let's see if we can

384
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:17,649
turn a little bit and I can start seeing

385
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:20,440
the oil coming out now I can see quite a

386
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:24,400
bit of oil coming up the sides here is

387
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:30,400
buttering up nicely here and it's that

388
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:36,160
it's that some good force right little

389
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:38,280
close up what we got going on here there

390
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,279
we go

391
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,460
without our percentage we got 8,000

392
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:49,548
pounds of force

393
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,950
I like the drip tray I do indeed like

394
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:56,000
the drip tray and you can also see

395
00:20:51,950 --> 00:21:02,900
around back here that it's also starting

396
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,250
to push rosin up through the back and it

397
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,830
looks like it's wanting to butter up

398
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:11,029
right away and that generally is what

399
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:13,220
happens with very high THC product it

400
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:16,869
was only 12 grams so I'm hoping for at

401
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:19,610
least 3 grams of rosin that would be

402
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:24,918
maybe even a little bit more for this

403
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:30,109
particular strain cultivar cycle

404
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:33,230
complete let's stop the press and we'll

405
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:36,678
open this up it really only gets a

406
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:40,298
little bit tough at the end alright

407
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:40,298
let's go around and see what we got here

408
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:53,990
[Music]

409
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,460
here we go for our yield so I'm gonna

410
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,380
collect that up and I'll let you guys

411
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,308
know what it is in one second here

412
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,309
pretty exciting

413
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,308
alright so I have crushed out the first

414
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:18,980
and second press I did end up getting

415
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:24,289
just over 3 grams which I guess would

416
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:26,509
probably be around 26% 27% so I left up

417
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:28,159
a little bit behind from what I normally

418
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:30,220
get with my long Peaks keep in mind this

419
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,600
is my first press with this unit I

420
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,400
didn't really understand exactly how to

421
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:36,829
set it up so I'm pretty sure in the next

422
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,080
week or two I'll get that 2% back

423
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:41,669
certainly not upset with it that's for

424
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:45,599
sure three solid grams

425
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:49,470
really caramel beautiful where's my bike

426
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:51,599
flour rosin I gotta say so far the first

427
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:55,259
experience with the helix Pro has been

428
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:57,599
really cool I did also figure out both

429
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:01,470
of these how they actually go on as they

430
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:03,719
go between the wheel and the foot so

431
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,009
they go kind of like that underneath and

432
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,440
so that's why they don't need to be

433
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:09,420
different sides they both work perfectly

434
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,900
and I will set it up next time better

435
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:14,400
with the with the clamps because once

436
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,960
you get it listen the first when you're

437
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,930
closing it and opening it opens really

438
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,630
easy as you get to around 5 6,000 7,000

439
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,920
8,000 pounds per pressure it starts

440
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,510
getting a little bit harder and I can

441
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,150
see for sure how you could move the

442
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:29,160
whole press so I'm going to thank you

443
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,540
all for tuning in you're gonna see a lot

444
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,980
more happening with this press we're

445
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:34,710
gonna do a whole video and actually

446
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,870
using this press with flour dry sift and

447
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,730
bubble hash I just really wanted to do

448
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:40,379
an unboxing video today and I thought

449
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:44,099
what a great way to do an unboxing video

450
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:46,530
to also show a really quick press so

451
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:49,169
thank you to the people the the group

452
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:50,940
over at peer pressure the team if you

453
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:54,180
will I look forward to seeing you all at

454
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,730
lyft in January January 11th to 13th or

455
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,500
14th I believe here in Vancouver these

456
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,539
guys peer pressure coming out and we'll

457
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,400
have a booth you could probably find me

458
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:05,129
at their booth otherwise I would be

459
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,290
walking around with my team from embark

460
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:10,740
if you see me there definitely pull me

461
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:14,039
aside and say hello and great great

462
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,529
little unit super quality I mean once

463
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:19,529
you see this unit in person and you feel

464
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:22,379
the quality of the tools you really get

465
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:24,389
the idea very quickly this is a solid

466
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,250
unit so thanks a lot peer pressure

467
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:29,120
thanks everyone for watching and we'll

468
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,119
see you next time on

469
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:37,849
