00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:29,000
welcome you to our panel discussion on

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:32,439
ganja marijuana Sensa hemp cannabis is

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,719
it really Jamaica's green

5
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,238
gold I should tell you and I see my

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,520
beloved friend and colleague Professor

7
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,640
Morrison across the world I I must tell

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,039
you that my first and early recollection

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,719
of

10
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,679
gandra

11
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,960
is being about 9 years old and my

12
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:57,439
brother being found with a

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,280
sliff and my my parents were so

14
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,679
aggravated and agitated that my brother

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,198
could be turning raster and smokeing

16
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:06,400
this SP that they ship him off to the

17
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:11,000
United States was a very pleasant

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,560
recollection I must say and then the the

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,159
the other recollection I have is of a

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,320
woman drinking some strong gja tea and

21
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,960
screaming and shouting and speaking very

22
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,118
loudly and I thought this gja thing is

23
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:25,639
just not on but today I spent the

24
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,438
morning looking at ganja and I thought

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,920
to myself but this thing can't make

26
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:34,919
money ganja and and other medicinal

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,840
plants have the ability to generate

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,200
revenues for Jamaica let me give you the

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,920
numbers I like the

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:47,960
numbers the worldwide market for ganja

31
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:51,560
products is up to 140 to150 billion

32
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:53,639
us but if you look at natural products

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,159
well that that that those numbers just

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,159
baffle my mind .5 trillion is what Henry

35
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,560
L told us this morning and so for the

36
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,079
first time at last I'm sure that there

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,759
are some of you in the audience that are

38
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:06,639
saying to yourself but this G thing not

39
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,959
so bad enough perhaps it's something

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,959
that we should look

41
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,680
at and

42
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,800
so if you were someone who is 80 years

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,680
old in Jamaica suppose You' be ask said

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,680
should we really be making gandra

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,599
products making products from gandra

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,680
does it have harmful effects on human

47
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,399
health do people lose their mind do they

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,439
go crazy when they drink some Gadget you

49
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,080
have gja products or does it have

50
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,959
medicinal

51
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,280
benefits because today we heard that it

52
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,239
it it can help you with nausea after

53
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,959
chemotherapy you know I have a friend

54
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:47,640
you know she's a boy I had a chick be

55
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,800
for just one day guy is a soap in some

56
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,518
grum and when I drink it it gone forever

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,159
so thisen man have to try this chick be

58
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,200
thing put but the for foreigners chick

59
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:59,120
be is a virus that when you get it you

60
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,719
pray to die CU it's so so many pains and

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,319
so much no I'm serious it's pains and

62
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:07,000
high fever and arthritis has a new

63
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,079
meaning when she had it she tell me Bon

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,560
this Gand thing

65
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,519
works um the second question I think

66
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,158
that we would ask if we are going to go

67
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,560
into this gandra business can we produce

68
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:22,359
enough of it and what are the standards

69
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,560
do we we would need to meet to grow and

70
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,280
use it for medicinal

71
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,920
purposes should we register G for

72
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,959
grows whether they're growing it using

73
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:36,238
green houses or they're using growing it

74
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,239
um in the soil should we should we be

75
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,280
doing that sort of thing um or should we

76
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,239
just syn synthesize it in the lab just

77
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,199
make it in the lab as every says we can

78
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,400
do um and if we are to maintain our

79
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:54,119
competitive and comparative

80
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,120
advantage shouldn't we be preserving the

81
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,840
good stuff H told us what today so we

82
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,759
have the good stuff

83
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,680
remember being on my farm and somebody

84
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,239
says they were growing Gand on my farm I

85
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,920
said no God not today but today I said

86
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,920
to them come let me a little G you

87
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,479
understand me because you said we have

88
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,839
the best stuff as

89
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:17,639
usual but should we yes man this thing

90
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,399
is real truth I just keeping it real

91
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,560
should should we be preserving the

92
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,560
original germ plas that's a big word for

93
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,120
making certain the real Stu Still

94
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,000
Remains and or and should we be

95
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,918
developing new products so we can

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,720
maintain our competitive advantage we're

97
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:32,719
ahead of the

98
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,600
competition um there are the

99
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,000
issues one of our colleagues one of our

100
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,120
panelists will look at the economics of

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,478
of Gano but if we're going to do this

102
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,800
thing properly we need to have an

103
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,439
economic framework we need to look at

104
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,560
what incentives are we going to put in

105
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,680
place how we're going to help smmes we

106
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,600
have to look at how do we find financing

107
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,079
for do we use the regular um dbj funding

108
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,840
to to finance but I hear this thing is

109
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,758
business big business it's not small

110
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:08,279
money so how will we Finance it how will

111
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,680
we move from research and development to

112
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,359
products how we going to get that

113
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,360
Innovation into something that is

114
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,800
bankable and which people want to

115
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,960
finance so these are the questions that

116
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,960
we will be looking at in this discussion

117
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,959
this

118
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:26,159
afternoon we'll have Dr Winston de who

119
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,399
will look at the medicinal and health

120
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,280
implications he's a psychiatrist I'll

121
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,918
tell you a little bit more about it so

122
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,239
you can tell whether when you smoke when

123
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,839
you drink the good Gand tea whether you

124
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,400
do better or not and Mr haon Watson we

125
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,879
look at the scientific implications he's

126
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,318
the one is going to tell us how we're

127
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:47,519

129
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,599
about the farming

130
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:55,279
implications Mr Tony vura I hope I

131
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,800
pronounced it right Tony we look at the

132
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:02,839
economic implications and the Reverend G

133
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,759

135
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:12,360
kind of thing but you know if you're

136
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:15,839
religious it says the herbs the good

137
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:19,639
herbs are for the healing of the

138
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,239
Nations a feel of Prayer of R har but

139
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,720
he's going to look at the moral and

140
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,680
biblical um issues I said to my friend

141
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,280
but why would he care for Hy what is

142
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,918
wrong with us is we not smoking the good

143

understand so why would he care if there

147
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:46,800
are how could there possibly be some

148
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:50,239
biblical and moral issues related to it

149
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,918
but he'll tell us he'll explain it to us

150
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,519
and Dr William Corney who was scheduled

151
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:59,839
to speak will will be replaced by Mr

152
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:03,240
courney Betty from Timeless herbal care

153
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,038

154
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:10,038
tourism implications how can we get

155
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:12,639
tourists in when I looked at San G on

156
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:16,959
and I looked at the various persons that

157
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:21,199
were being um having some kind of

158
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:23,839
positive um uh relief from their

159
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,080
epilepsy or serious pain probably we

160
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:31,239
could get people to come in now Mr Betty

161
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:35,240
to to somewhere neutral else or up in up

162
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,560
in M or near to a compound and they have

163
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,879
the cool bre and everything is fine we

164
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,959
can just we won't smoke it we'll just

165
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:46,080
drink it we'll have a pill we'll eat it

166
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:48,959
but these are not the issues is what we

University I find this particularly

196
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,439
interesting that he's the chairman of

197
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,560

198

all going to go Ludy he'll be able to

talk to you about it understand me and

200
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,600
treat you but I don't think that's what

201
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,480
he plans to say he's the deputy chairman

202

203

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,240
about the format and so on but uh

213
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,559
because I do these lectures every at the

214
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,278
University it was difficult to get

215
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,958
something together for you but uh a very

216
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,439
important matter that we're discussing

217
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,958
here today uh as a psychiatrist I'm

218
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,399
affiliated with all aspects of of

219
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,518
cannabis as an addiction psychiatrist as

220
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:09,039
a specialty I certainly see the other

221
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:12,720
end of things where persons who are not

222
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:15,559
so lucky as others are uh succumb to the

223
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,480
ill effects of cannabis uh and in the

224
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,919
same breath as The Clinical Director of

medican limited and the chairman of the

226
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:26,120
a clinical committee I'm involved

227
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,480
currently at a very Advanced stage with

228
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,720
clinical trials using cannabis for

229
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,039
treating a wide range of illnesses and

230
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,680
so uh certainly recognize the positives

231
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,799
uh in terms of cabus use uh for

232
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,319
medicinal purposes and support that and

233
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,359
in the same breath give my specialty I

234
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,519
recognize the negatives and treat the

235
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,959
patients including a while ago which is

236
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,839
why I was almost need uh youngster of

237
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:55,679
age 16 with canus in psychosis so a

238
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:58,279
certain am Expos to both ends and have

239
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,599
to share with you uh that aspect I've

240
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:02,958
been asked of uh comment on the effects

241
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,759
of cannabis some of you may or may not

242
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,759
know uh persons who are pro cannabis are

243
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:11,200
more likely to be associated with what

244
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,838
for them are positive effects uh which

245
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,600
is necessarily on good balance and so I

246
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,839
certainly will speak to all aspects uh

247
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,200
very briefly this evening and it's been

248
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,040
a lot of debate around the whole uh

249
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,079
issue of decriminalization which I'm

250
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:29,879
also actively involved in recognizing

251
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:32,278
the challenges that we Face uh as a

252
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,240
country in terms of the management of

253
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,159
any substance related disorder in fact

254
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,360
I'll share with you the most recent

255
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,480
National school's drug survey of

256
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,879
November last year where and this is

257
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,759
really alarming so I've been with

258
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,720
national C on drug abuse for the past 10

259
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,360
to 12 years and I've seen the amount of

260
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,000
work theyve been doing in The Last 5

261
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,278
Years this has doubl tripled in terms of

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,320
their efforts and the number of man

263
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,000
hours for lack of a better work that

264
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,639
they're putting in educating youngsters

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,679
in particular about J despite of that in

266
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,879
the last November survey 60 to 70% of

267
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:10,000
youngsters reported not having heard a

268
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:13,519
single World about a prevention message

269
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,278
that clearly tells you that the funding

270
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,320
available for these messages is just not

271
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:20,078
where it should be uh the National

272
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,160
Council of drug abuse in spite of its

273
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:27,278
efforts needs more resources to do more

274
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:30,278
to reach persons who may not be as lucky

275
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:32,360
as others are and so uh I'm very happy

276
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:35,000
and I tell patients who come to me if

277
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,839
you see positives in what you do that's

278
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,320
fine with me very happy uh and in the

279
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,880
same breath if you're experiencing

280
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,160
negatives I'm able to identify them and

281
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:48,679
and and help you a lot so my talk isn't

282
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:52,000
necessarily for our gces as it comes as

283
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:56,120
the need arises uh and I'm sure

284
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,198
Professor low spoke spoke to this slide

285
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,360
in terms of the number of areas that

286
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:05,639
internationally were seen uh ganja being

287
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,278
used uh that includes uh as an analgesic

288
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,639
as an anti-inflammatory drug

289
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,039
antispasmodic and so on large range I'm

290
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,680
pretty sure recover this this morning

291
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:16,360
probably use the exact slide I'm looking

292
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:19,399
at because we work together uh the point

293
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,159
is at medic limited we determined that

294
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,720
we'll start our clinical trials with

295
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:27,639
pain Related Disorders chronic colant

296
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,759
pain postoperative pain uh acute pain uh

297
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,799
pain in the gynecological area and so on

298
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,559
large area with the potential to help

299
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,399
persons this why we are Physicians

300
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:40,838
because we want to to help people uh and

301
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,519
the potential to help Jamaicans do

302
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,320
better with the illnesses that they have

303
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,560
in terms of the social economic

304
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,600
development potential development which

305
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,599
others are here are far more versed in

306
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,320
what I'll just share with you uh that

307
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,199
globally currently it's a 2.5 billion US

308
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,360
business that's a medicinal cannabis uh

309
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:03,679
component discussing and it's expected

310
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,759
to be doubled in the next 3 years and so

311
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:10,120
many developing countries like ours uh

312
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,000
with uh economic challenges covers could

313
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,919
use the industry to help grow their

314
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,958
economies but is it all positive and

315
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:20,639
that's a resounding know uh and I'll

316
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:24,039
just now real quickly share with you the

317
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,759
negative effects uh and so the main

318
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,599
psychoactive ingredient meaning the

319
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,278
ingredient leading to the potential

320
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,959
problems with cannabis I treat every day

321
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:37,320
is Delta 9 trans THC I hen to say though

322
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:41,000
we support medicinal cannabis and we

323
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,879
recognize that Delta 9 trans THC is the

324
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,879
main psychoactive ingredient we also

325
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:48,320
recognize that where you separate the

326
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,958
products and use only the canab thees

327
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,879
for treatment they don't work as

328
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:54,039
effectively as when you have all

329
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:56,078
components present in the products that

330
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:58,799
you're using we appreciate and recognize

331
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:01,638
that and so the attempt is to reduce the

332
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:04,359
the Del 9 THC component to a tolerable

333
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:06,440
level in products so obviously in our

334
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,199
clinical trials we therefore need to

335
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,600
exclude persons with schizophrenia

336
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:13,399
because we recognize that they will be

337
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,399
worse potentially if they are exposed to

338
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,480
any amount of th so these are all the

339
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,720
challenges that we have in spite of that

340
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,920
the potential gain is far more than the

341
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,360
loss and so we proceed and and press

342
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:28,159
along but to look at the potential

343
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,399
negatives I start with uh addiction to

344
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:35,159
cannabis very well established that 9%

345
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:38,879
of adults using cannabis May develop an

346
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:40,639
add an addiction to cannabis the number

347
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,759
uh increases significantly for

348
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,799
adolescent so for children it's 50% of

349
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,278
those and hence the focus on the

350
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:49,559
National Council on drug abuse and

351
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,519
preventing any drug use and in this case

352
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,439
we're discussing cannabis in adolesence

353
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,480
because that's one in two and if you

354
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,800
have two children it's likely one of

355
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,759
them if the both use who may succumb to

356
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,000
some of the negative effects so that's

357
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,879
what we call the drug use disorder the

358
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,159
cannabis use disorder meaning the

359
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:09,278
addiction the DSM 5 which is the

360
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:12,838
diagnostic statistical manual mental

361
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,519
diseases which we use as our B for laal

362
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,839
better work for illnesses that we treat

363
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,560
and recognize specific illnesses

364
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:22,600
associated with cannabis the dsm5 came

365
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:25,239
about in March of

366
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:29,839
2013 and the illnesses they recognized

367
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:32,600
include I was you cannabis intoxication

368
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,160
uh cannabis withdrawal well refer well

369
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,240
established I've had a couple of

370
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:39,159
patients with that it's not the most

371
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,240
common ince it is present Canabis

372
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:43,559
intoxication delum and usually in my

373
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,440
presentations I have this one

374
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:48,039
highlighted in red because people my

375
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,120
specialty I see these patients every day

376
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:53,360
can of just Inu psychotic disorder so

377
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,399
people do get mad from smoking and canab

378
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,839
scan meing we need to be very clear

379
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:00,519
about that in persons with an underlying

380
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,440
vulnerability and susceptibility and so

381
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,679
just real quickly because this is so

382
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,400
important because we're on sure the

383
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,160
genes coding for psychiatric illnesses

384
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,880
we cannot today through genetic mapping

385
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,640
determine that you are at risk because I

386
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,319
found the gene in your system and so you

387
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,000
might not want to use we're not sure and

388
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:23,318
so you're taking a chance we're sure

389
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,919
though that if you are mentally fit

390
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:28,000
today but your cousin is schizophrenic

391
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,480
your mother is schizophrenic your aunt

392
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,798
is schizophrenic it's highly probable

393
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,839
that you have the for psychosis and

394
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:38,839
probably will Su up to use it that's why

395
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:41,519
two if today you in Utch or the

396
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:42,759
University of West Indies and whatever

397
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,960
discipline you're in you think you want

398
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:46,640
to finish with a good enough grade

399
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,640
because we are clear on the impact of

400
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,400
cannabis on memory and learning we can

401
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,600
categorically state that you might not

402
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,400
want to use Canabis uh but just to list

403
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,959
then some of the effects and I close

404
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,720
with my most recent resarch arch with my

405
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,120
team on cannabis and memory which the

406
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,480
findings of which was very alarming uh

407
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,359
the findings were alarming to us but the

408
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,400
common physiological effects I just lift

409
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:15,079
out a few decrease liido

410
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,519
constipation uh mild gr constriction

411
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:19,918
followed by

412
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:22,240
gradation uh axum and that is normal

413
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,520
gate in fact I used to be in the Army

414
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,319
was a milary officer as a medical

415
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:28,798
officer you could easily detect who was

416
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:31,158
using cannabis because of the gate as

417
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,200
assciated and so Military Officers

418
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:34,880
usually walk pride and so on so the

419
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,600
person see kind of leave a little bit

420
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,720
and so on you can rest assur uh if

421
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,399
there's no NE neurological condition

422
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,919
then they would test positive which is

423
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,480
one of the things not allowed in the so

424
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,799
that's what my job at the time uh but

425
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,240
just to lift a few more uh restlessness

426
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:51,839
depersonalization these are the

427
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,919
psychotic features now and these are

428
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:57,038
features which users of recreational

429
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:00,080
Cannabis enjoy but to others it's an

430
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,679
illness so dep personaliz is where

431
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,279
another term would be an out of Body

432
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,759
Experience where you're all seeing

433
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:08,079
yourself move around but you're not in

434
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,079
yourself if you follow what I'm saying

435
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,678
der realization you feel unreal you

436
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,558
don't feel a part of the world uh Panic

437
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:20,159
reactions paranoid ideation and of

438
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:22,119
course the the the main uh and most

439
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,159
negative of the illness is the Cannabis

440
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,639
indu psychotic disorder which

441
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:29,480
unfortunately for some present is an

442
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,400
acute psychotic State a briefy I episode

443
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,200
you treat they discontinue their use and

444
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,480
they may recover and be well but some

445
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,038
and we don't know cuz we're not magici

446
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,319
have to wait on AOW time even with and

447
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:43,839
after treatment Stills hypo that's an

448
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,079
unfortunate thing and you never know

449
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:49,279
before if that would be us taking a

450
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:51,639
chance I'll close now with cannabis and

451
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:54,158
its impact on neurocognitive performance

452
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,960
that's my most recent research for the

453
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,280
prob shortly uh we looked at the impact

454
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,519
of Canabis on neuroptic performance of

455
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,038
Jamaican adolesence we had a sample of

456
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:07,119
youngsters in Jamaican schools who smoke

457
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:09,798
we uh at least three SPS per week we had

458
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:12,279
a sample of youngsters who were not re

459
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:14,440
users and we confirmed that using

460
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,639
testing and so on and we looked at their

461
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,279
performance in various ways and so

462
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,679
learning can be broken down into a

463
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:23,279
number of areas to get into the the

464
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:25,519
intricacies of that but the most

465
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,918
important is that our findings show that

466
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,879
in all aspects that we looked at all

467
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,159
that was what was so we know there is

468
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,000
impact if we looked at 10 things we

469
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,159
expected maybe six or seven would be

470
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,839
impacted all 10 were impacted negatively

471
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:42,240
in terms of learning by E cannabists so

472
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,959
that's food for thought for our country

473
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,400
where our children are not doing very

474
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,279
well in things like mathematics English

475
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,200
they known uh throughout the Caribbean

476
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:53,759
and in Jamaica and so with those kinds

477
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,480
of challenges and given the monetary

478
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:59,480
resources or lack there off we really

479
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,919
need to stand back a little and though

480
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,240
we recognize the potential gain from the

481
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,919
medicinal cannabis not move too much

482
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,519
ahead of ourselves but keep it real and

483
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:12,600
ensure that should there be any changes

484
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:15,200
that we have the funds available to step

485
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:17,199
up the prevention messages at this time

486
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,350
I'm not so sure those funds are

487
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,250
available thank you very

488
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:24,250
[Applause]

489
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,960
much thank you very much Dr Von it's

490
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,599
really interesting because all morning I

491
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,440
heard about how good Gand is and how it

492
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,918
helps learning but

493
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,159
only um well should we drink it no

494
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:43,679
should we drink it or should we eat it

495
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:46,400
should we rub it on our knees that that

496
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,840
we can ask him in a little while but he

497
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,440
did say that the main psychoactive

498
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,798
element that affects you negatively I

499
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,038
mean correct is Delta 9

500
00:21:54,798 --> 00:22:00,519
txc and the rest of us don't know what

501
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:02,038
that means I'm correct okay but I must

502
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:04,400
tell you that a man is coming

503
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:07,079
immediately after Dr Winston de that

504
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,000
will tell us about Delta and everything

505
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:13,759
else am I correct he's going to look at

506
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,519
the scientific implications of ganja

507
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:19,960
marijuana

508
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:23,119
s you hand again no you won't cannabis

509
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,000
is it really Jamaica's green gold

510
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:29,319
because nothing in life comes with it

511
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,599
being perfect am I correct so when

512
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:36,599
law told me today that CBDs and he'll

513
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,839
explain all what that means CBDs are

514
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:41,759
more valuable than gold than an ounce of

515
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:44,839
gold I thought good Lord you tell me

516
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,079
there problems but by all that money I'm

517
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:47,519
sure that there some people who are

518
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:52,199
saying that and he will look at the

519
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:54,440
scientific implications of of of Gant so

520
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,440
we're going to ask Mr hathon Watson who

521
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,240
is the acting executive director of the

522
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,400
scientific research Council and I'm sure

523
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,000
your St said the acting executive

524
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,159
director of the scientific research

525
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Council believes in yes he does he's one

526
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,559
of the persons one of the persons who

527
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,919
isolated s of critical compounds early

528
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:18,278
in 1969 he Leed at the College of Arts

529
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,960
Science and Technology now Utch where

530
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:22,919
among his several achievements he

531
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,759
founded the chemical Technology Program

532
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:29,120
he was the first to establish and

533
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:32,679
publish the structure of a unique

534
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:35,399
compound found in minute quantities in a

535
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:37,880
plant of worldwide forensic and

536
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,360
medicinal interest we know what that is

537
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,080
that's gandra

538
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:44,918
right that's gandra let us not deny the

539
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:47,158
fact that gandra has tremendous

540
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:49,320
medicinal practice and I'm so excited to

541
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,720
hear about this that there's a whole

542
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:54,359
long blurb about him and his experience

543
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,120
at se and his experience here and his

544
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:58,678
work on science technology and

545
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:01,158
Innovation but iare you all of that so

546
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,320
Mr hon want please we invite you to

547
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,690
speak to us now about the scientific

548
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:13,240
implications of

549
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:17,240
[Applause]

550
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:22,180
G I will speak as soon as I can get over

551
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:25,368
the part about G reduced liido

552
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,369
[Applause]

553
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:33,359
about

554
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:37,319
that seriously after he lectures this

555
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,319
morning I said I was going to give it a

556
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,880
try um colleagues um we scientists have

557
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,200
yet to find a way to make science and

558
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,720
technology

559
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,720
sexy so I won't be very

560
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:07,798
long in terms of the scientific

561
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:11,000
implications of

562
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:15,240
G what we

563
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,880
SRC are really interested in

564
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:21,359
one Jamaica is known to have a high

565
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,840
grade

566
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:30,959
stuff originally so but over these past

567
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:35,639
years they have been a dilution of the

568
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:38,360
breed by various strains if not species

569
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:43,520
which have been brought into the

570
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:47,199
island we will be interested in

571
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:51,639
preserving the original ganja the

572
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:55,798
original germ plasm as the moderator

573
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:58,559
said and one of the reasons why we are

574
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:01,000
interested in preserving the original

575
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:04,798
plaz it's a science is very funny you

576
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,159
know today you vilify something and the

577
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:12,240
next day you find out is your savior

578
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:14,399
because though we vilify THC and I'm not

579
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,159
making a case before

580
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:22,119
THC in a recent study one out of Spain

581
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:24,399
and one out of France it has been shown

582
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:27,599
that THC

583
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:31,359
suppresses the growth of cancer cells in

584
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:35,000
the liver and the brain so we don't know

585
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:39,558
whether 10 years down the road CHC will

586
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
TC will be a drug in demand in any case

587
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:45,398
part of the Mandate of the scientific

588
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,278
research council is to preserve the

589
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:52,918
original plant whether it be ganja

590
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:54,919
whether it be Aki whether it be nury or

591
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,840
what have you so that is one of the

592
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:00,960
first thing that we will do with Gan

593
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:04,398
working of course with um university of

594
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,720
the West Indies you heard from B mlin

595
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:10,158
this morning of the wonderful work that

596
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:15,798
they are doing in identifying the differ

597
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:17,010
strength ganja in westand and St

598
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:18,200
Elizabeth

599
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:21,319
[Music]

600
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,278
the other aspect of the science that we

601
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:26,119
are interested in you heard mention that

602
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:28,960
we

603
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:32,000
isolated and you can

604
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,600
denno um way back some

605
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,640
time um it was isolated and

606
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:41,398
characterized so we know exactly what it

607
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,880
is but no further work has been done on

608
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:47,558
it maybe because it's one of those

609
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,559
components in ganja that is present in

610
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:51,839
very minute quantities I remember

611
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:56,759
getting you to get the ganja from the

612
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:59,278
police and a 50 of compressed G might

613
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,158
give you lesson and O of the stuff that

614
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,278
we

615
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,320
isolated and so we are going to go back

616
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,319
there you're going to look at whether or

617
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:11,079
not it has any

618
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:15,319
beneficial um property or if in fact it

619
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:18,678
is harmful to to to mankind because

620
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:20,879
sometimes um we don't have the charts of

621
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:23,720
the compound here sometimes there just a

622
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,159
slight difference between one compound

623
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:30,440
and another that makes a difference well

624
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:33,440
if you even take say t THC there are two

625
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,159
different thcs in the plant one with a

626
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,519
certain feature going this way and one

627
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,399
with the same feature going this way the

628
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:43,480
one which is going this way is a cytic

629
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:46,359
one the one which is going that way has

630
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,399
been shown to have no CYO active effect

631
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:52,558
at all so sometimes the features found

632
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:54,918
in the compound can influence the the

633
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,319
property and we believe that in the case

634
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:59,200
of canab trial which is the one that we

635
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,158
isolated

636
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,840
there are is feature there are features

637
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:08,360
present that give us um hope that we

638
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:11,398
could have something good um so we want

639
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:12,959
to go through with clinical trials with

640
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:17,278
those who see to have an effect first

641
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:20,640
and nice and if the results are positive

642
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,640
then we will move to human trials that

643
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,399
is going to take some time because it's

644
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,080
a slow process maybe year maybe two and

645
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:32,359
this can also be very costly but we

646
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:34,960
believe that is an Avenue that should be

647
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:41,119
pursued also at the same time we

648
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:44,399
isolated another true canab o c21

649
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:46,398
h304 um we know what the molecular

650
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:49,239
structure is but we don't know exactly

651
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:50,879
how the is arranged we know that Mel is

652
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,159
a clean compound because the melting

653
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,320
point is 107 218 so it is a very pure

654
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,519
compound what you need to do now is

655
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:03,240
going in back and isolate structure of

656
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:05,599
that compound and much the same as CDT

657
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,079
you want to look at clinical trials with

658
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,839
mice and then man so there are two

659
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,519
aspect of study

660
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:15,439
there um simultaneously while we going

661
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:19,200
back into the plan for these compounds

662
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,519
we are also going to look if um if there

663
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,759
are other compound here that might be

664
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,960
new and not so far known you know

665
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:31,000
interesting when I started working on

666
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,679
ganja the purpose for the for the

667
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,759
research was that at the

668
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:41,159
time it was said that it is a female

669
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:44,839
plant I don't know why they say all

670
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:48,799
things about me it's a female plant that

671
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:51,599
gave you the height true they SP it the

672
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:55,319
female plant has more of the resin than

673
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:57,678
the male um so we could distinguish

674
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:00,720
physically what they are but what the

675
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:03,120
Govern of the day wanted was the

676
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,480
chemical differentiation can you find

677
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,119
the chemicals in there that

678
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,960
differentiate the male from the female

679
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:13,079
but before about 6 months into the

680
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,159
research um the government of changed

681
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:19,480
his mind and just say gja is gja if you

682
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:19,480
pH with gja male or female you get

683
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:26,879
lock fortunately by then some very

684
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:30,319
interesting compounds started to drop

685
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,440
out of G and we want to I just say that

686
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:36,398
to say that while we go back for t for

687
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,720
CDT and this other compound we'll be

688
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,239
looking to see if any other new compound

689
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,880
will drop out

690
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,319
G if you listen to the various talks

691
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,320
this morning you will see that there's a

692
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:51,918
strong case there for neutrals and

693
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:54,359
cosmical already there are several under

694
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,559
the market and I know my visiting

695
00:31:54,359 --> 00:32:01,759
friends from the north do have samples

696
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:03,720
of various um canabo products Henry L as

697
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:09,158
you know launched seven new products the

698
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:13,399
other day and Dr lard in addition to his

699
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:15,840
two asmal and kenol is launching TOS so

700
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:19,079
is a fledging industry but we feel that

701
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:21,519
the the the the the it has enormous

702
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:24,918
potential and so we will continue to

703
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:28,480
look at developing um those

704
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:31,600
cosmical and those neuticals

705
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,679
the other area that we SRC would be

706
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:37,599
concerned with is that we need to

707
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:41,240
provide robust Backup Service in terms

708
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:42,918
of analytical support because if we are

709
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,319
going to

710
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,720
establish an

711
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:49,678
industry we have to establish an

712
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,919
industry that can meet International

713
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,639
standard we can't grow G and make money

714
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,278
here in Jamaica yes we can make two

715
00:32:55,638 --> 00:33:00,038
shill but we don't want to make two

716
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,880
shill want to make a couple pounds well

717
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:04,119
and the only way we're going to do that

718
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,760
we have to export and if you are going

719
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:08,638
to export you have to make sure that it

720
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:11,679
needs the standard that is required by

721
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:13,398
the by the World Market certainly um

722
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,399
people are going to want to know whether

723
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:21,278
or not the the ganza they are importing

724
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:23,839
as any insecticidal residue on it they

725
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,319
want to know if any soil residue on it

726
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,240
and one of the things that we would hope

727
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:31,960
from SRC that we could do

728
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:35,278
is to provide certificate of of analys

729
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,000
in that if you bring your G and we test

730
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:41,919
it we should be able to say this

731
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:45,960
particular sample of gja has x% THC y%

732
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,880
CBD and so this is one area again in

733
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,120
which we are hoping that we can provide

734
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,278
service and when the industry will have

735
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:56,678
enlarged and got real big you we can

736
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:58,710
employ a lot of analysts and Chemists in

737
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:01,798
our lives thank you very much

738
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,798
[Applause]

739
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:11,320
thank you very much Mr Watson our next

740
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:14,039
speaker is not unfamiliar to anybody in

741
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,639
Jamaica and I told you in my opening

742
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:18,960
remarks that in the good old days when I

743
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,000
was a kid which wasn't such a long time

744
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,000
ago I told you that um my parents

745
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,519
shipped off my brother because he was

746
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,519
found with a spliff and they said Lord

747
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:34,239
God is going to get into this ra Affair

748
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:37,039
and gja smoking thing and Paul Burke is

749
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:39,439
one of those Visionaries you know who in

750
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:43,079
the period that people did not find

751
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:47,200
ganja useful and and the thing to do he

752
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:49,720
believed in something else and he said I

753
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,559
I I once when I think of Paul Burke I

754
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:55,480
think of the phrase vision is the art of

755
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:57,838
seem The Impossible because 20 years ago

756
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,760
you just couldn't think that one day a

757
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,239
group of nice middle class people would

758
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,520
be sitting in the Pegasus or wherever um

759
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:06,078
talking about

760
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:09,440
Gand

761
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:13,800
uh Paul started his campaign some time

762
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,320
ago asking the Jamaican people to Rally

763
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:20,000
around the idea of the decriminalization

764
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,599
of of ganja and the use of ganja for

765
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,159
medicinal purposes but I said before if

766
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:29,039
we're going to do this if we going to

767
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:31,239
start a ganja based um industry can we

768
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,559
grow enough of it or do we need to

769
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:35,199
synthesize it and if we grow it how will

770
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:37,159
we grow it what are the standards we

771
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,519
must meet how we're going to trace it

772
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:42,078
from start to finish how are we going to

773
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,400
do life cycle analysis well Paul Burke

774
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,160
is going to explain that to us he's

775
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:49,240
going to tell us the farming

776
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:54,199
implications of a viable productive and

777
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:54,199
profitable ganja industry Mr

778
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,000
[Applause]

779
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,838
hi good afternoon

780
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,119
everybody you know today is a strange

781
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:08,759
day I've never put my key inion and the

782
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:11,960
car has not started until this evening

783
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:15,359
and that's why I'm for some inexplicable

784
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:19,838
reason it just would not stop it's not a

785
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:22,598
about problem so I to I I apologize

786
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:25,838
for

787
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:28,200
my and will take what I minute

788
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:31,559
my entropy

789
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:34,279
was really one human rights first K

790
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:36,039
growing up in Rockport and just seeing

791
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,519
the brutality being

792
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:42,639
unleash by members of the train of

793
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:45,519
conary fors against young people young

794
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:49,358
Ras parents anybody in general for

795
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,679
having a SP and people seem to forget

796
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,639
that up to

797
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:58,039
1972 it was a 18 Monon mandatory

798
00:36:54,639 --> 00:37:00,239
sentence for a s of young

799
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:03,880
see anything at all there's no

800
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:09,199
discretion of the court so really from

801
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:12,480
that point of time we a CR Wicked

802
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:15,480
terrible law putting your people primary

803
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,480
into
