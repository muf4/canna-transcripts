00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:26,118
hey everybody Welcome to Bubble man's

3
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:29,359
world I am in my kitchen and it is the

4
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:32,238
same day I showed you the dry sift uh

5
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,520
repress pressing and reheating up to

6
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,119
avoid that Whiting out on your wet wash

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,520
or your dry sift if it's dry sift it's a

8
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,119
guarantee that it's moisture pulled out

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,920
of the air if it's wet wash it's a

10
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:43,640
little trickier it could be moisture

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,000
that you left trapped in there or it

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,920
could also be properly dried bubble that

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,238
sucked moisture out of the air through

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,359
the humidity so what I'm doing now is I

15
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,399
was going to make myself a pizza I got

16
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,480
myself the Pea pizza crust and I put a

17
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,198
little tomato sauce on there and then I

18
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:03,398
realized well this is an excellent

19
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,039
opportunity to medicate my pizza and

20
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,920
it's an excellent opportunity to share

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,359
with my audience because personally I I

22
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,960
don't know how to make the best

23
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,200
medicated pizza but I know if I make a

24
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,719
medicated Pizza you guys are going to

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,118
see it you're going to think of other

26
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,920
things that could be a better way of

27
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:19,319
doing it we could start a dialogue and

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,000
see who can come up with the most

29
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,879
awesome medicated pizza so I'm doing the

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,078
old standby that John and I have done in

31
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,599
the past I've got my dry sift right here

32
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:28,919
I got a couple grams of it actually I

33
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,039
won't be putting that much on but I'm

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,879
going to sprinkle it quite nicely I've

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,000
got my crushed garlic and a little bit

36
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,599
of Pineapple and then the key is the

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,239
mozzarella cheese so rather than put

38
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,000
this thing in the oven for 8 minutes or

39
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,078
5 minutes which I could easily cook at

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,879
400

41
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,639
420Â° I know John's favorite temperature

42
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,920
because I haven't decarbox the dry sift

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,560
uh I'm going to put it in for a a longer

44
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,118
period of time on a lower heat so I'll

45
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:00,280
probably take about 12 to 15 minutes to

46
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:01,799
cook this um pizza and I've noticed from

47
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,759
the few times that I've done it that the

48
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,439
dryy sift becomes a lot more active and

49
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,879
for whatever reason the cheese is an

50
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,038
incredible carrier uh it's a real good

51
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:13,199
fat it really gets it into your system

52
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,639
you feel it almost immediately so I

53
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,079
guess what we're going to do is we're

54
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,559
going to take a little bit of this dry

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,040
sift and we are going to gently drop it

56
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,959
down onto our pizza crust so I've

57
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:29,280
probably put so far maybe a/4 of a gram

58
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,400
um I'm not looking to get destroyed so

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,439
I'll probably just put about a half gram

60
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,560
on this pizza and

61
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,439
uh well it's still going to be quite

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,759
active that's for sure so a little bit

63
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,239
of this a little bit of that I also take

64
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,120
a little bit of the crushed garlic and

65
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,280
do the same thing drop it down on that

66
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,719
pizza and

67
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,719
just there we

68
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,800
go that

69
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,959
[Music]

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,120
down my pizza is going to be pretty

71
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,360
simple today sometimes I make them fancy

72
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,080
sometimes I make them simp simple uh

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,799
this one's going to be pretty

74
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:10,200
simple pineapple and cheese and dry sift

75
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,280
so the dry sift was oh jeez I think it

76
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,238
was

77
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,400
Barb I'm pretty sure we'll get this all

78
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,200
on there our mozzarella cheese which is

79
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,640
going to activate that sift for

80
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:25,959
us sitting in that

81
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:30,679
sauce we'll get this into the oven for a

82
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:33,719
nice slow cook I will uh show it to you

83
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,920
guys when it comes out of the oven so

84
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,919
stay

85
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,629
[Music]

86
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:01,119
tuned all right so our pizza is cooked

87
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,640
took about 15 minutes or

88
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,319
so nice and

89
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:09,158
crispy

90
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:12,798
delishes all right

91
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:12,798
so let's take that

92
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
outside

93
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,198
medicated pizza with a little bit of

94
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:41,198
pink

95
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,439
lemonade all right so I think that was a

96
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,478
great idea I've got my medicated pizza

97
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,399
I've already consumed some infused

98
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:55,879
coconut oil today about three or four

99
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,758
times nothing to give me full effects as

100
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,519
I'm inhaling through my vaporizer for

101
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,919
those things but uh never a bad idea to

102
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,799
medicate a pizza in the middle of the

103
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,279
day if you can I'm surrounded by my

104
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,240
strains in beautiful British Columbia

105
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:11,839
and uh I'm ready to try out the dry sift

106
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,840
medicated

107
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,319
Pizza thanks for watching and I hope to

108
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,719
