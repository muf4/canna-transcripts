25
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,438
right now, we don't have a wall. But we

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,680

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,519

30
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:18,000

31
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:20,000
Sorry. And continuing on tour. Yes.

32

Continuing. Nice. Got the Ramo brand

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,759
sign again.

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
You know what? Talk briefly about this

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,680
color, the colors chosen for the

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,240
company. Yeah, please. Um, as you can

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,640
see, we've chosen blue. Yeah, definitely

38
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,919
got the nice big blue wall, the blue

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,400
Remo. The blue represents um water,

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,920
which uh you know, cannabis is 80%

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,320
water. We contain a lot of water as

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,840
well. And and you moved 600 L of it

43
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,639
today. Uh 400. So 400 L. 200 to go.

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,560
Excellent. So um water is a very

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,879
positive thing. It's uh it's about life.

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,719
So that's one of our main colors. We got

47
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:58,959
white which represents uh light and

48
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,280
again which uh grows cannabis which

49
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:05,679
again positive. Yes, white is a positive

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,318
color and gold and uh gold represents uh

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,159
actual gold or wealth and bubble man

52
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,280
pointed out it also represents the color

53
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,199
of tricoms. So um exactly those are our

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,919
company colors. The golden mature tricom

55
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:20,878
heads. Beautiful.

56
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,639
And this is our uh our sales pin. This

57
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,079
is sweet right here, dude. And those are

58
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,759
our future labels we're working on right

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,840
there. Oh, yes. Check it out. And that

60
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,318
would be like a box. So, to run that

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,080
like Oh, that looks great. All the

62
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,679
future sizes. Oh, yes. This is my size

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,879
right here right now. Yeah. And look at

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,040
this. Actually, we've uh we're going to

65
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,000
go with 23 L jugs, but we decided to go

66
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,639
with 5gallon buckets for a couple

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,239
reasons. More recyclable. Um, reusable.

68
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,079
Absolutely. You take the lid off. You

69
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,800
can use that for putting a plant in if

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,000
you want or for watering or whatever.

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,360
Whipping up a batch of bubble.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,080
Yeah, exactly. See, this is our kitchen

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,480
area. Dishwasher and coffee maker and

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,640
microwave oven. Dude, great. And then we

75
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,079
have our server room. Ah, yes. This is

76
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,238
where you got all the computer action

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,800
going on. Yeah. Good call. And then, uh,

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,200
we got Joel's office, Sy's office,

79
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,080
Rebecca's office here in a row. Oh, yes.

80
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,639
And then this is the All right. So, what

81
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,480
do we got here? This is my office. This

82
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,318
is the Remo office. My little den. We

83
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,759
got our whiteboard for ideas. Beautiful.

84
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,119
You got your own little couch action.

85
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,239
And I got my computer right here. Couple

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,560
of chairs. So, this is where I'd come

87
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,560
have a meeting with uh Remo Brands.

88
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,080
Yeah. And then I have my right around

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,039
the corner here just in case. Now, I got

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,000
to vape. You never know, right?

91
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,679
You never know. Well, sweet, man. This

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,598
is great to see the beginning of Remo

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,319
Brands really starting to the heart of

94
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,759
the operation right here. Excellent. So,

95
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,238
uh we should go and this is what we call

96
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,560
the administration wing and uh we'll go

97
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,439
back into the warehouse and then into

98
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,439
production. Awesome.

99
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,680
Hello. So, this is our uh warehouse.

100
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,518
Wow. We're just waiting for pallet shel

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,040
uh to come in. Those are going to be all

102
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,319
the boxes for our materials. bought a

103
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,598
forklift. That was $17,000. Wow. Toyota.

104
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:19,560
That's got to be better than paying a

105
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,560
limo bill. Yeah.

106
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,720
Really nice unit.

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,680
Let's drive it around. I'm just joking.

108
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,560
Funny. It's got another sign. Oh, yeah.

109
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,560
Unit 14

110
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:39,959
deliveries. Future lab.

111
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,959
Future lab.

112
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,400
We got somewhere intrinsic.

113
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:52,159
Yeah, we got a bunch of weird furniture

114
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,839
and stuff. And we'll go into the uh

115
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,240
production side of things. Uh the

116
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,918
production side of things.

117
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,478
Oh, I see. So, we're in the same unit

118
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:05,240
here. Yeah, we just did a full circle.

119
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,240
We just go outside. Excellent.

120
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,038
All right. You got some some buckets.

121
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,800
Yeah, this is actually going to be our

122
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,519
future showroom, but for right now, we

123
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,038
just have it as storage for all our um

124
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,478
our containers. Uh eventually when we

125
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,959
get our pouch shelving will be stored in

126
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:21,599
the other side. So, this is temporary.

127
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,799
Be a nice storage uh or not storage, but

128
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,840
a nice uh showroom. And behind this

129
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,560
curtain here is production.

130
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,959
The production

131
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,800
facility. Now, that's awesome.

132
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:39,359
I just can't go off my page today. Okay.

133
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,120
on the top deck. Can't go on the deck

134
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,520
today. That's okay. We can just check it

135
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,759
out. You can go to the top of the

136
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,959
stairs. It's interesting because, you

137
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,919
know, uh this is very similar to how I

138
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,439
would set up a commercial uh industrial

139
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,719
water hash factory where I could

140
00:05:53,439 --> 00:06:00,639
literally pull I could run 25 lb of bud

141
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,680
in each one of these. So, 100 lb 100 lb

142
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,079
50 lb. That's 250 lbs of cannabis that

143
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,720
could be ran through these every 15

144
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,359
minutes and make like potentially a

145
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,720
pound to a kilo of hash. Yeah. So, each

146
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,639
one of our products is going to have its

147
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,960
own tank and its own pump. And

148
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,038
beautiful, man. And right here, we call

149
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,239
this is our

150
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:24,800
bartender bottle filling machine. And

151
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,439
you got this thing that caps on. This is

152
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,240
pumping out your uh both nutrients and

153
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,680
gels or just just for strictly all our

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,879
liquid nutrients only. Any liquid

155
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,519
nutrients machine runs on

156
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:39,120
air compressor over there. Ah yeah. And

157
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,079
these are all our raw materials or some

158
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,399
of them anyway. Okay. Stacked up to the

159
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,000
ceiling. And now we're going to go into

160
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:50,198
the gel area. Ah the gel

161
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,199
area. And these are

162
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:57,160
awesome big units. Okay, that's a

163
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,160
one-step gel, right?

164
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,280
Major grow a lot of cannabis with these

165
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,879
things. Just to give you an idea of the

166
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,879
uh size pretty

167
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:18,239
big. This place just keeps going. So,

168
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,758
here's the RO machine we just bought.

169
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,280
Oh, really nice.

170
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,639
And that's going to be for our gel

171
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:28,799
machine. And our gel

172
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,280
machine is right here. We call this the

173
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,639
tin mat. It's actually stainless steel.

174
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:37,439
And we make 500 L of gel at a time. I

175
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,879
switch some lights on real quick.

176
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,839
Yeah. Yeah. Do we do it again? No. No.

177
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,759
We're good. I just want to have the

178
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,598
light. That's beautiful machine, man.

179
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,919
Holy smokes. Yeah, that's a tin, man.

180
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,680
Like I was saying, 500 L of time. We're

181
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,839
just going to have the Oro uh to be

182
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,680
plumbed in line into this thing here.

183
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,959
And this is where all the labeling and

184
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,639
all the packaging and everything's done

185
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,878
right here. And so what is this exactly

186
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,598
doing? Is this creating the consistency?

187
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,560
Is it whipping it or mixing it or what?

188
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:08,120
It's a giant mixer. Giant mixer. Yeah.

189
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,120
Very very cool.

190

192
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,598

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,440
their roots? That's a one step Joe. Yes,

200

201
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,600
success with it. Actually, I remember I

202
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,279
took a picture of the roots off of a

203
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,920
clone and people were like, "Are you

204
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:56,240
serious?" Like, what the It works. Oh,

205
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,399
yeah. It works. Absolutely. I can attest

206
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,480
