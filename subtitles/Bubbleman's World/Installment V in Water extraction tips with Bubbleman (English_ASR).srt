00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,640
hey how's it going guys welcome to

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,800
Bubble Man's World um just had a kind of

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,560
a thought in regards to a reply I was

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,920
about to do on Facebook and I thought I

6
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,479
would share it with you guys directly um

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,280
it's kind of about the difference

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:38,519
between um what drying um wet hash is as

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,558
opposed to curing hash so with the

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,640
drying of wet hash what we're doing is

11
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,759
we want to Wick the moisture out that's

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,799
trapped on the outside of the glands

13
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:49,198
that the hash has sort of Trapped in

14
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,238
unto itself this is when we pull fresh

15
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:52,679
bubble out of one of our bags and this

16
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:54,198
is why we go through the process of

17
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,039
breaking it into powder whether you're

18
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:58,759
straining it or or seing it getting it

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,840
spread thinly it's why I always say use

20
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:04,039
a desicant because you need to pull this

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,880
moisture out of the hash it needs to be

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,720
removed from the hash the smallest

23
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,839
amount of it can over time degrade the

24
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,438
wax membrane and affect your hash to the

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,439
point where we've always called it a

26
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:17,438
sort of a Whitey effect where it kind of

27
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:21,118
whes out but I A lot of people are using

28
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,679
the um term butter it's buttering out so

29
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,040
uh to avoid such a thing what we want to

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,680
do is we want to dry the hash properly

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,520
with the use of a desicant this can take

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,600
5 to 7 Days easily once you get your

33
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,879
hash

34
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,280
dry then we can get to the point of

35
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,798
curing it and what I mean by curing it

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,359
is we want to allow the wax membrane to

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,240
Dem moisturize to almost dehydrate okay

38
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,399
uh that thin little membrane if you look

39
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,280
at my photos when they're living um

40
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,399
they're very bulbous and thick and when

41
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,118
they dry out after you know a good

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,799
amount of time they shrivel up almost

43
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,879
like a raisin so I'm going to be showing

44
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,439
photos of this on my Facebook page and

45
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:01,239
Instagram and talking about it a little

46
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,879
bit more but I just want you guys to

47
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:06,438
know the importance now this would be I

48
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:08,560
guess the sixth tip that I've given the

49
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:10,598
fifth or sixth tip on the bubble has

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,400
installments of uh water has tips with

51
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:15,159
bubbl man and I think it's a very

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,120
important one as a water extractor the

53
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,598
water and the ice are doing almost

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,400
everything for you in regards to

55
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:23,560
isolating the gland the grower has done

56
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,959
everything for you to create quality

57
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:31,400
resin so your really only job is to get

58
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,120
that hash dry and then to cure it out if

59
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,039
you can make a batch of hash and have it

60
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,000
selling on the shelves a week later I

61
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:39,519
mean that's great to access for medicine

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,719
but as a hash connoisseur what you're

63
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,719
going to notice over time is that when

64
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:46,800
you allow that wax membrane to dehydrate

65
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,199
and to lose that last little bit of

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,319
moisture as well as all the moisture

67
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:54,639
that was present from the water process

68
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,919
you get a final product that is so

69
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,439
smooth and such an enjoyable thing to

70
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:02,079
smoke you almost can't you you look back

71
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,400
at water hash that has moisture in it

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,400
and you feel that it's been somewhat

73
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,879
ruined it almost is the Akin of going

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,879
back in the day when someone grew

75
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,719
beautiful herb but didn't cure it

76
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,000
properly didn't dry it properly these

77
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,400
are very important processes for both

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,080
herb and hash and that's why I wanted to

79
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,000
show this uh share this tip with you

80
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,440
today so I hope it was a useful tip I'm

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,719
going to leave you with a bong rip

82
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,400
because I'd hate to uh I'd hate to talk

83
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:28,280
to and not have a beautiful bong rip

84
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,480
while I do so so while you're mulling

85
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,120
over what I just said about the the you

86
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,798
know the actual what drying is as

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,680
opposed to what curing

88
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,680
is I'm going to hit a denail dab

89
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
props

90
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,719
thanks for watching see you next time
