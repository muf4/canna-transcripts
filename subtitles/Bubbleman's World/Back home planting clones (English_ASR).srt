00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,198
hey guys welcome back to Bubble man's

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,679
world I'm freshly back home from the

4
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:30,039
airport and a wonderful trip with John B

5
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:31,479
in uh Toronto uh I say it's wonderful

6
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,640
because you know things worked out okay

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,480
for me in the end um I did lose my

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,920
camera it was extremely unfortunate but

9
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,279
um I have had an incredibly generous

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,600
person and I'm going to tell you more

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,160
about them in the future but um I've had

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,960
a person offer me um to purchase my

13
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,919
camera to to buy me a new camera uh and

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,160
it's not just out of generosity but of

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,840
course they have uh photos that they

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,518
want me to take for them and I told them

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,239
that I would gladly take those photos

18
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:02,839
and we had worked out uh sort of of a

19
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,478
deal a while ago and now they've come

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,280
and said listen we really feel sick to

21
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,959
you about this this camera experience so

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,840
they've offered to purchase a new camera

23
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:11,319
for me which is just incredible I'm not

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,719
going to mention who they are just yet

25
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:14,118
I'll wait until everything's said and

26
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,679
done but I'd love to tell you about

27
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:17,759
these guys because they're really kind

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
individuals and it was really touching

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,439
that someone would you know I could

30
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,118
never just take the generosity I like to

31
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,839
earn my own things but the fact that it

32
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,840
was like a pre- purchase and I can earn

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,320
it by taking photos for them was just an

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,799
incredible offer and I'm going to be

35
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,000
thanking those guys on the next episode

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,720
um today for now what we're doing is

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,719
I've come home and I've come home to

38
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:41,560
some plants um my clones that I left I

39
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,118
left about 18 clones uh on my way out

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,320
and they were kind of clones that I

41
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:49,399
wasn't sure were going to going to make

42
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,359
it they were a little rough as it was um

43
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:55,200
my wife was taking care of all my garden

44
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:58,359
for me and she's um yeah she's she's

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,399
kind of busy in life right now um she's

46
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:02,039
5 months pregnant and so I'm going to be

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,039
having another child in the near future

48
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,478
here and I hated to get her to help me

49
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,280
and do all this but she took care of my

50
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:10,679
garden the whole time I was away so

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,680
super props to power woman uh for taking

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,318
care of the family and the house and the

53
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,719
and the garden and rooting 11 of the 18

54
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,598
clones so there's 11 clones here I've

55
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,680
got um let's see I've got an Afghan I've

56
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,799
got an OG cross with a Romulan I have an

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,560
East Coast Sour Diesel I have three

58
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,000
barbs three sweet skunks and two Congos

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,159
and they're all rooted and I figured why

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,199
don't we transplant them I've already

61
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,159
got my one gallon buckets and you can

62
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,479
see that I've put the names on all of

63
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,239
the buckets right this is my style we're

64
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,318
labeling these and we're getting them in

65
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:47,840
the right buckets right away so we're

66
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:50,479
going to start off with the OG crossed

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,400
with Romulan I was uh received this

68
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,439
strain from John B I really didn't think

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,480
this clone was going to make it it was

70
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,959
hurting I mean it's uh it's incredible

71
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,560
that it rooted to be honest

72
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,640
but one thing that's taught me about uh

73
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,239
different strains and with cannabis is

74
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,039
that uh sometimes it's best to not throw

75
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,599
that plant away that you think might

76
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:14,479
make it or you think could make it

77
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,000
because uh it could turn out to be

78
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,318
become your favorite mother it could

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
turn out to become a plantet that you

80
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:22,598
could share and pass around and you know

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,318
you just I like to have faith in my

82
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:28,560
cannabis and I don't necessarily want to

83
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:30,719
give up on it so easily so OG ROM boom

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,199
there you go next next

85
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:36,639

and then I cleaned for the final sort of

93
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:57,000
collaboration and it took first place so

94
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,400
congratulations to those guys for you

96
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,360
pleasure to see and this Afghan is

97
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,399
actually pretty healthy so we're going

98
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,360
to pop him into a little bit of this

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,079
soiless mixture my soiless mixture is

100
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,319
just cocoa fiber and Prix nothing major

101
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,760
nothing serious I've added a tiny bit of

102
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:17,399
water but I'm probably still going to

103
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,279
give these a little feeding uh at least

104
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,879
uh a light a light feeding before I uh

105
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,239
put these guys Under The

106
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,478
Lights um you can see a little bit here

cones now these are all um very special

112
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,439
genetics that have been passed on to me

113
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,560
by friends um through you know the great

114

moving uh we mentioned in the video John

119
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,079
and I that we might be um coming up with

120
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,399
an opportunity that's in Jamaica in the

121
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,038
near future we met some incredible guys

122
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,239
had some really exciting meetings while

123
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,800
we were in Toronto and uh without

124
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,519
telling you too much we're definitely

125
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,439
hoping on one day getting down there and

126
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,319
doing a little research and development

127
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,600
doing a little bit of uh you know what

128
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,918
we do here in Canada down there in

129
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,960
Jamaica so that's exciting and we're

130
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:25,240
going to be talking more about that

131
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,318
later so we'll move into the East Coast

132
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,400
Sour

133
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,240
Diesel um the reason I'm throwing these

134
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,959
all in one gallon pots for those of you

135
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,160
that might want to know it truly is a

136
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:36,279
room issue I don't have the tent space

137
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,120
right now uh I am going to go this week

138
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:44,279
I believe and buy another tent so that's

139
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,240
good get some uh space for these plants

140
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,079
so we got our Afghani and we got our

141
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,639
East Coast Sour Diesel all

142
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,038
right

143
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,478
perfect I like to just make a little

144
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,360
hole with my fingers these little pee

145
00:05:55,478 --> 00:06:00,318
pucks just fit in perfectly just cover

146
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,160
that up

147
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,680
and you have a lovely

148
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,000
transplant little bit of at an angle but

149
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,240
we'll see if that plant wants to

150
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,720
straighten up

151
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,720
later all right that is

152
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,879
afgh okay next up on the Block

153
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,800
congales ah the infamous congales you

154
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,120
know we Tred we waited for a long time

155
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,960
to get this strained and it was funny

156
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,360
because I swear the day we maybe the we

157
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:34,879
got it my friend told me yeah that's not

158
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,240
the actual the real congales it's sort

159
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,560
and so there's always this thing with

160
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,038
the congales but I assure you everyone

161
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,319
out there in Internet land that uh we

162
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,399
got the real congales we got one of them

163
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,520
anyway not the Verde but the uh the

164
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:49,318
other one and it

165
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,560
is uh

166
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,319
seemingly gaining notoriety and

167
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,879
popularity here in BC particularly by uh

168
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,800
the help of us by sharing it and giving

169
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,039
it away it's hard to get a a strain

170
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,879
popular when you're the the only one

171
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:05,240
posting it on the internet you really

172
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,639
need to uh to share to get that strain

173
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,840
out so it's kind of what we're all about

174
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,519
me and

175
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:14,038
John and that's why uh you'll be seeing

176
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:18,399
more of John strains out there medy

177
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:21,519
Hayes medy Kush Is My Little Ponies you

178
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,279
know I've got uh I've got two of his

179
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,878
medy hazes three of his Med hazes right

180
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,318
now they're just they're looking great

181
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,840
so I'm pretty excited about that all

182
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:35,560
right so now we'll go east coast Sour

183
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:38,239
Diesel little three finger action pop

184
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,959
that right in there don't really have to

185
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,639
push down too hard on these at all

186
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,519
either they really just will sit right

187
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:47,560
there and they'll root

188
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:50,598
themselves it's amazing such a delicate

189
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,079
tiny little thing could turn into this

190
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:57,000
you know extremely powerful huge

191
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:59,918
monstrous plant we uh that we enjoy so

192
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,560
much congales

193
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,038
one more Congo this a nice Congo she's

194
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,478
rooting out pretty

195
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:09,759
hard get this

196
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:12,279
all put up under the

197
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,598
lights definitely low on space for

198
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:17,279
lights I almost need another 400 up in

199
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:20,399
here it's funny how cannabis just grows

200
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,478
and grows and grows until you have uh no

201
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,918
more room to really live you just the

202
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,240
Cannabis would take it all away my

203
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,399
friend had a great sign on his growroom

204
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,280
door uh some years ago you might have

205
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,158
seen it in some of my photo and stories

206
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,439
it was the zipline room actually and on

207
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:38,599
the front of his tall room it said give

208
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,519
weed an inch and it'll take the whole

209
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:45,600
yard and I thought wow isn't that

210
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:49,759
accurate Barb I think we got three barbs

211
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:53,000
in a row we do one two three so we'll

212
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,000
get these barbs done

213
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:58,639
up the award-winning Barb I guess we got

214
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,679
to call it now it's taking the davo

215
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:04,600
first place and it's taking the Champs

216
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:06,838
first place and I guess Matt's plan next

217
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,480
is to take it to Amsterdam and go to the

218
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,720
Cannabis Cup with it he feels that it's

219
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,159
a contender that he's not just winning

220
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,600
these cups cuz they're small but real

221
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,719
people are entering in them each time

222
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,399
and he's winning so that's off to him

223
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,959
for growing such a nice resin and

224
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,559
producing such a nice strain he does a

225
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,639
lot of work their hard workers there at

226
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,958
the great Gardener so I'm happy to call

227
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,919
them my friends and of course I'm happy

228
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:35,159
to collect collaborate with them and uh

229
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:38,479
help them uh help them win some

230
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:42,919
awards all right so three barbs what do

231
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:45,320
you got Barb we got Barb Barb and Barb

232
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:48,199
now these are also very very

233
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,760
small very small with tiny little Roots

234
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,879
but just perfect such a nice thing to

235
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,559
come home from Toronto and of course you

236
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:56,159
know you think I was thinking that these

237
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:58,000
clones would potentially be dead I had

238
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,919
gone through all of the ones that had

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,679
rooted prior I had taken quite a few so

240
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,399
this was you know I got a little zealous

241
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,838
in my clone taking as some of you

242
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,360
probably have done out there we get

243
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,360
excited right we want plants we want to

244
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,839
plant the plants and uh when they're

245
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,440
little like this you think oh I need

246
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,720
more but you don't

247
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:21,640
realize you know they turn

248
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,639
into this very one

249
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:28,919
Barb here's my Barb so you can see she's

250
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:32,879
uh she's a nice sturdy girl she's been

251
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:34,120
tough about five times and uh yeah

252
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,639
couple of yellow leaves there that I

253
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,120
could take off but

254
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,120
otherwise Barb's

255
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,600
big okay so we cover these guys

256
00:10:54,759 --> 00:11:00,200
up for the time being these clones are

257
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,680
going to end up um

258
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,879
just in these little under these little

259
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:06,319
t5s I don't have anything else for them

260
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,838
right now

261
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,278
so they will have to

262
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:14,399
stay as

263
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,240
is three barbs and what do we have left

264
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,879
we

265
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,200
have two sweet skunks

266
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:24,320
perfect can't tell you how happy I am to

267
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,320
be planting sweet skunks and

268
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,639
congales it's uh it's good it's nice

269
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,120
keep all these strains and you get

270
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,440
Plants going

271
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,480
and particularly when you're not growing

272
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,880
a whole variety of one plant a whole

273
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,959
tent or a whole room you can wash a

274
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:42,039
plant have that resin wash a plant have

275
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,439
that resin go through the plants wash

276
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:46,000
those four or five grams off each time

277
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,800
find out the ones that really work for

278
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,360
you and then start growing more of those

279
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,319
so you can actually save up that

280
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,720
particular resin it's kind of what John

281
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,040
and I are on right now doing that sort

282
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,759
of trip all right so sweet skunk I've

283
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,278
been wanting to plant you for a while

284
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,879
now

285
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:05,480
beautiful nice little clone right

286
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,360
there yeah nice little

287
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,560
clone

288
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,839
rooted

289
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,838
rooted all

290
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,680
right all right one sweet

291
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:36,000
skunker and one more I actually have

292
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:39,399
three sweet skunks that have rooted and

293
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,879
I have um a couple of the seedlings that

294
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,480
I really want to

295
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:47,399
transplant but I'm out of one gon

296
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,159
pots go figure I need hundreds of these

297
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,839
things it's amazing how fast we go

298
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,360
through these things when we're

299
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,399
growing all right one more sweet skunk

300
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,600
I'll take the one with the biggest Roots

301
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,919
I guess

302
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,000
that looks like you or you you look

303
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:09,240
pretty good that's a double sweet skunk

304
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,240
right there let's do

305
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:19,120
it cut off a few of these

306
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,120
little sick

307
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,600
leaves all

308
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,600
right so

309
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:43,838
Barb Barb sweet skunk and sweet

310
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:47,879
skunk so now it's a matter of figuring

311
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:51,680
out um getting my T5

312
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:54,399
lights mounted over these plants so I'm

313
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,120
going to figure that out probably hit a

314
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,720
bowl or two but I wanted to share a

315
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,519
little bit of transplanting with you as

316
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm freshly back and we're getting back

317
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,799
into showing you guys the amount of time

318
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,278
and energy that it takes how many plants

319
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:08,039
you need to cut the mothering the

320
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,559
cloning and of course most importantly a

321
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:13,039
couple of 8x4 t0 with a couple of 600

322
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:16,719
watt light bulbs in each one producing

323
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:19,039
those 30 to 60 gam of resin per tent

324
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,399
every 60 to 90 days that's what I'm

325
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,519
trying to show you guys here on Bubble

326
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:27,320
man's world so keep watching and we'll

327
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,320
talk to you later peace

328
