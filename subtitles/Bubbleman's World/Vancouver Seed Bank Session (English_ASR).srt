00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,599
all right guys just got here to the

3
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,038
Vancouver Seed Bank in cchq on the

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,000
second floor off of Hastings and I think

5
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:33,280
we might have a little uh

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,399
little session going on here some

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760
well-known folks in the industry it's

8
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,439
not that no see it's even more than that

9
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:44,320
what happens is is that 18 break the

10
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:46,280
plane give thanks you're so dark I can't

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,960
even see you there it is it's Matt it's

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,600
Matt the great Gardener which I guess is

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,439
marijuana man's in the house holding it

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,000
down as always good day mcm's in the

15
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:58,759
house holding it down pretty much as

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,759
always drugs drugs drugs drugs so what

17
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:07,319
are we puffing on here Matt drugs this

18
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:09,679
is our a finger hash rosin that has purp

19
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,879
purposely been left out for over a week

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,600
just to see what happens to

21
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,399
it oh this was the finger rub Ros very I

22
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,759
made a little rosin with finger rub and

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,520
I was also very impressed oh it's it's

24
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:27,280
great it's crazy so super flavorful this

25
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:28,798
one is like is piny lemony like just

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,960
what strain did you say it was we just

27
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,000
just GG one

28
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,158
oh okay yeah yeah of course this has

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,319
like the Mad pining this is I mean I'm

30
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,439
still saying it uh as a very serious

31
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,438
thing that this is the closest reminder

32
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,039
I've seen of Romulan Joe's Romulan since

33
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:45,758
back in the '90s I was going to say

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,520
that's going back yeah and I don't see

35
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,920
it all the time I see it when he puts it

36
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,759
in a in a container and he closes the

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,399
container for like a day and you open it

38
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,959
that smell to me is Joe's old Rong and I

39
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,840
just I miss it so you can check it out

40
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,599
in the gg1

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,600
The Afghani

42
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:16,878
one put the hat back

43
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:18,679
down yeah uh enrio was explaining to me

44
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,759
the importance of keeping this down and

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,000
not letting it cool even for like a

46
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,959
couple of minutes I like it for that

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
aspect because you can turn this unit

48
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,400
down yep and hold it in and I can dab

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,400
and I can put weed underneath cuz it's

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,879
not so hot yeah this little [ __ ] lid

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,000
keeps that thing no it's on point it

52
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:39,799
would be hard to carb that thing any

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,680
other way and he was saying that this

54
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,560
makes up like a certain percentage of

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,120
the mass that is heating up the atomizer

56
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,560
and so if you just leaving it up like

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,120
this for a minute or two changes it can

58
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,000
take away that sort of like I don't know

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,800
how to put it into words any other way

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,719
than the sublimator accesses magic it

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,760
just has this little point where it's

62
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,680
like I can't get that anywhere

63
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:09,280
else true do you have one of these close

64
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,000
to the best dab I've ever oh my god

65
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,280
dude yeah I'd say so I still use my

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,280
denail for dabbing

67
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,959
resins oh yeah like but I love the

68
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,280
atomizer putting have you ever tried

69
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,719
putting that in the atomizer as well no

70
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,560
cuz that also hits a little bit

71
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,639
differently where's the atomizer this

72
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,400
whole bowl is the atomizer and it's one

73
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,119
of the things with the sublimator that

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,438
the one itself is really only heating

75
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,239
the atomizer and of course if you're

76
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:37,840
dabbing off of it but for herb so what

77
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,480
are you got to take this you take this

78
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,959
whole unit on yeah you just lift this

79
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,840
whole thing out sometimes you'd lay like

80
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,199
a bed of weed or you could even just

81
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,560
take hash and drop it right in there and

82
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,238
hit it like

83
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,759
that just drop it right in there never

84
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,519
done that never dabbed in there yeah

85
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:57,679
I've uh I played around a lot with the

86
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,560
sublimator when I first got it and uh I

87
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,280
was just amazed this is the heating unit

88
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,519
though right y but it Heats Heats this

89
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,438
up that up and then just go like

90
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,519
that no what I usually do is I would put

91
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,078
like a larger chunk of hash roll it into

92
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,719
a ball or something and then put it in

93
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,519
and then put this on yeah drop it right

94
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,079
on top of the screen or onto um a little

95
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,600
bit of

96
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,199
herb we'd be here all day figuring out

97
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,960
how to drop that in let's just dab it on

98
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,680
the top I'm down for another little dab

99
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,719
de has not

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,879
has see if Mike's here got a real nice

101
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,919
tight screen in there are you see I just

102
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,319
did

103
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:40,399
it was good great Gardener is doing me

104
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:40,399
up here look at this great Gardener dabs

105
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,560
dabs it just leaves nothing right

106
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,079
there's nothing and then you look back

107
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,639
at the spoon when you're done and

108
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,198
there's like there's always at least a

109
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,560
little clear Dome on it it's just

110
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,960
liquefies on

111
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,319

they've got a couple of uh of options

138
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,879
that you can come and check them out two

139
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,199
two just on Hastings but I think this

140
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,598
one's the fun the fun one personally so

141
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,639
we're here all

142
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:15,159
day come see them it's marijuana man

143
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,840
come blaze a bowl with him and buy some

144
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,960
seeds Matt he won't be here it'll be

145
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,879
like super fluky if you hit Matt if you
