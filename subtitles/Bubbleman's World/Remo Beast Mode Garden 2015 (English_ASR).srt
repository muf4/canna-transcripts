uh we got a 5 T and A 4 T we're full 9 t

173
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,240
in here 5 ton and a 4 ton you hear that

174
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,720
a total of nine tons of cooling in this

175
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,879
room and this is

176
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,120

179
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,320
level this is a great room to grow uh

180
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:57,039
it's easy to your

181
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:02,240
results you get great results wow you're

182
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,240
not joking man this really looks

183
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,759
great this is an unbelievably crystally

184
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,440
plant this girl scout cookies I'm I'm

185
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,919
really surprised that the quality of the

186
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,040
resins growing all the way down the fans

187
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:18,039
oh yeah

188
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,000
it's another big fat girl scout cookies

189
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,838
Bush and then of

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,320
course these ridiculous

191
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,839
monsters now what what were these two

192
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,440
again which one that's a girl scout

193
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,440
that's a girl scout as well so this is a

194
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,959
very different feno from the one over

195
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,279
there yeah it's Fox tailing out a little

196
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,679
bit or just bigger buds these ones just

197
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,519
seem to have like buds a size of your

198
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:59,000
your

199
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,759
forearm look at that yep that's that's

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,639
basic

201
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,360
as big as your forearm holy [ __ ] the

202
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:08,879
lower ones oh yeah this one is

203
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:13,519
yeah I think they're at the life what

204
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:16,879
are we at 7 and 1/2 Weeks here 7 weeks 7

205
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,320
weeks my God but with a veg of what

206
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,879
six uh yeah these ones were a little bit

207
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,120
shorter I usually like go two months but

208
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,679
here as you can see all the MS are a

209
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,360
little bit smaller nice so he says he

210
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,838
usually likes to go for 2 months

211
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,800
normally but these plants are a little

212
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,800
bit smaller I guess in a sense they are

213
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,669
but my goodness they're a real nice

214
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:39,740
smaller oh yeah they're tight and

215
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:39,740
[Music]

216
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,079
compa well one of the things that I've

217
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:49,439
always been impressed with uh about rmo

218
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:51,759
and his ability to grow is that he he he

219
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,160
always constantly takes in strains and

220
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,519
genetics from many different companies

221
00:12:54,159 --> 00:13:00,159
he's not one to shy away from cracking

222
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:02,879
some seeds and finding a feno and uh

223
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,719
he'll usually do a version of it that is

224
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,679
at least as good as the best version

225
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,680
that you've ever seen if if it's got the

226
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:15,879
ability with that being said are sure

227
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,278
the con easier your oh there we go so

228
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,759
yeah uh of course Ramo received the

229
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:23,198
congales a while ago I know that he

230
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:25,480
likes the strong heavy-hitting uh action

231
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:27,319
of an indicia for his pain relief but I

232
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,800
just felt like the Congo could use a

233
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,278
place in his garden uh that he would

234
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:34,719
appreciate the uniqueness of the Exotic

235
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:37,120
smoke that it had to offer and uh he's

236
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,800
apparently got a monster downstairs so

237
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,320
it's going to be the biggest Congo like

238
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,078
seriously the biggest Congo you've ever

239
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,000
seen in your life it's going to be nuts

240
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:45,879
you will be impressed I not going to fix

241
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,278
that I just

242
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,078
did I need to do some staking and

243
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:51,360
pulling in here dude so you you guys

244
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,758
didn't even see that but I basically

245
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,839
just picked up this Bud that is like I

246
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,839
don't know an ounce or something that's

247
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,560
side and it was just hanging down like

248
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:04,480
this

249
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:07,479
side we call that Holy Christ

250
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,879
raino oh man that

251
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,480

252
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,799

253
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,399
guys here this want to see this water

254
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:20,399
reclaim system that he's pulling his

255
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,399
water out of perhaps we going to be

256
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,399
careful in here there are plants

257
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:31,879
everywhere what we got here at UBC no a

258
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:36,679
rockar what about this guy oh the white

259
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:36,679
OG there's a little white OG for you

260
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:44,638
guys white

261
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:48,720
OG next to a absolutely stunning rock

262
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:51,839
star now I am just picking any top to

263
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:56,560
show you guys to give you an idea every

264
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,560
single top is damn near

265
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,399
Perfection no bugs

266
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:06,078
no mil I mean really it's it is beyond

267
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:09,159
impressive when you have a grow of this

268
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:11,879
stature of this quality and it's just

269
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:15,078
like a machine he just he he rolls it

270
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:18,039
out much the way like he rolls it up he

271
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:20,679
rolls it out as almost as fast as he

272
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:23,799
rolls it out I know that every once in a

273
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:27,519
while rmo even himself potentially runs

274
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:29,439
out of herb so this is the importance of

275
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,959
allowing Canadian citizens is to be able

276
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,600
to grow our own medicine can you imagine

277
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:38,198
the cost to Remo if he had to buy this

278
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,959
much medicine for his head he smokes an

279
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:42,719
enormous amount of cannabis for pain

280
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:46,838
relief and to be a to have to buy this

281
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,278
cannabis for $10 to2 a gram would be

282
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,920
completely astronomical I can't even

283
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:55,029
imagine how much it would

284
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,029
[Music]

285
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,560
cost we got happen here he got all his

names written down on the bottoms of the

287
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:10,958
uh of the um cans garbage cans and give

288
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:14,958
give you an idea of the size of the

289
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:17,439
stocks that he grows Ramos's lower buds

290
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,039
on the bottom of his stocks are bigger

291
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,360
than some

292
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,360
people's bigger buds

293
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,120
well I think I'm going to get to it guys

294
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,600
I'm going to pull out the macro lens and

295
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,278

what I can see just with my naked eye

301
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,240
