00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,359
Jamaica has decriminalized marijuana. A

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,839
bill passed by legislators on Tuesday

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,279
night

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,359
possession. A major step was taken on

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,039
Tuesday in modernizing Jamaica's gang.

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,798
You have states legalizing marijuana for

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,399
recreational use here. It sends a

8
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:17,919
message to other countries that hey, you

9
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,839
know what? This isn't something worth

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,439
wasting resources on. We should stop

11
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,600
criminalizing and incarcerating people

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,600
for

13
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,719
this.

[Music]

15
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:37,359
People say it's going to be

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,120
better. Well, it was a lot worse before

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,839
because every week there are a bunch of

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,599
cops coming up here

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,079
and burning up the plants and doing all

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,679
kind of crazy stuff. It's the only thing

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,399
I love, you know? It's the only thing I

22
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:54,159
know how to do. I'm not a mason. I'm not

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,079
a carpenter. I'm not a plumber. It's

24
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,479
like, you know, when you find something

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,239
you're good at and something people

26
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,238
respect you for, you just keep doing

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,799
it. Yeah. I'm up in the mountains on the

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,519
government land. So when I get myself

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,360
legalized, I go down to my family

30
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:18,359
property and farm like bunch of plants.

31
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,359
Crazy.

35
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,000
It is the colonial path that made Ganja

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,879
illegal in the first place. Jamaica did

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,438
not have a ganja

38
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,359
problem, but because

39
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:57,758
Britain Britain had a ganja problem, a

40
00:01:53,359 --> 00:02:00,599
opium problem first in China,

41
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,200
a ganja problem in

42
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,118
India and that was how Britain decided

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,080
to

44
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:10,680
impose the illegal aspect of ganja in

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,920
Jamaica in

46
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,760
1912. Prior to that, we had no problem.

47
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:21,679
So many brothers were brutalized,

48
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:24,239
killed, imprisoned for ganja. So today

49
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,800
when we have these festivals, we must

50
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,360
honor the ancestors that went through so

51
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,200
much to make us able now to be able to

52
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,200
use

53
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,199
ganja freely.

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
We're at the Stepping High Ganja

55
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,160
Festival. The 13th annual Stepping High

56
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,760
Ganja Festival. This is the first year

57
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,919
out of 13 years that they've had an

58
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,679
exemption from the government. So, the

59
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,518
police that are present aren't arresting

60
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,719
people obviously. Uh they're allowed to

61
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,759
have ganja. They're allowed to have

62
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,359
ganja sales on the property. And it's a

63
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,359
really wonderful, beautiful ganja event

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,879
here that's been going. What's up? Ganja

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,239
plants right there. Yes. Hi. Wicked with

66
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:13,679
the police right behind him. You got to

67
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,759
love that dude. He's walking right by

68
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,360
the police. He's got the ganja plant.

69
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,280
That's a photo right there. Like bang

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
bang sheang. That cop's like I don't

71
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,719
even know what to say about that. But

72
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,080
that's great. So this is the vibe that's

73
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,000
changing here in Jamaica with the

74
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,040
decriminalization with the allowance of

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,439
56 g or less. Ganja. Ganja should be

76
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,079
free. You know, free like the bird in

77
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,359
the tree. Like the bird in the tree.

78
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,040
Everything to me. We don't care about

79
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,519
the poly. We sell the purples coming,

80
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,919
the white widow, the AK-47, the blue

81
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,080
fairy. We have all those stuff. We have

82
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,759
everything. We not having a bias

83
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,440
opinion. No. No. You follow the law.

84
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,959
Yeah. We are here. We're just doing what

85
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,280
we have to do. They can smooth the

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,000
ganja. All right. Cool. Coconut water

87
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,318
and ganja. It's like sperms and egg

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,239
together. So the coconut water is the

89
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:03,119
sperms and the ganja is the egg create

90
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,519
life. it raw and it is medical and it's

91
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,560
really helping the people. They don't

92
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:13,719
streng their immune system against Zika

93
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,719
or any little thing. Yeah, why not?

[Music]

95
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,800
And learn also. Well, that's up to them,

96
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,120
right? Because somebody would look to

97
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,800
you to learn when they could still learn

98
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,240
from me. That's all I'm saying. Or they

99
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:35,160
could learn from both.

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,160
Either way, dude, enjoy your day.

101
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,639
with me. Your profit margin was based on

102
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,439
the prohibition of the plant which is

103
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,000
actually based on people going to prison

104
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,839
for the plant. Definitely black youth

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,680
have been locked up for cannabis at an

106
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,679
accelerated number compared to white

107
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,000
youth. I've dedicated the last 25 years

108
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,160
of my life to cannabis and I have been

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,040
uh arrested for it and I have uh had my

110
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,919
problems for it.

there. That's what I'm saying right

117
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,279
there.

118
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,439
live from Negril, Jamaica, and

119
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,918
surrounded

gentleman right here for winning the

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,320
People's Choice Awards with pretty much

124
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,800
the nicest herb in this country that I

125
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,959
have uh been able to find so far. So,

126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,600
uh, the reason why they don't fully

127
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,038
legalize

128
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:09,400
it is because if they

129
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:13,399
do, a lot of poor man will get

130
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:13,399
rich. See?
