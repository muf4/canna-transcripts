wine well hemp is natural plant you know

65
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,720
it's ganja you know s marijuana well by

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,199
definition it's under 1% THC so I was

67
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,000
curious why you call it hemp no THC in

68
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,199
it well there's so many you know what I

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,079
mean because we we make a combination of

70
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,199
the real hemp and marijuana okay so we

71
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:39,359
coming to the people with you know 100%

72
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:42,720
or 200% because it's 100% each you know

73
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,800
what I mean so we come in full force in

74
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,840
one dose okay how much is in there well

75
