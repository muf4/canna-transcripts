00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:32,289
and he taught me how to grow in cannabis

197
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,680
and more than that he kind of taught me

198
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:37,359
how to be like he he groomed me to

199
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,150
become the bubble man his reality

200
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,789
