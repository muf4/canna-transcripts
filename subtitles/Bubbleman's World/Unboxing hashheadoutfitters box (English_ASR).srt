from him so I'll hold it off to the side

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,600
I'm using my desk as a stand-up desk

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,579
these days a little bit healthier on the

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,820
back not that my back is in terrible

22
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:10,500
shape but it's nice to have the uh the

23
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,019
standing ability with the with the

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,938
stand-up desk so first up is this kind

25
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:18,478

26
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:21,478
um corduroy hat so we'll open this up

27
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:24,359
if you do want to see I like how it

28
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,039
comes everything is sealed in sealed

29
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,579
bags this reminds me of back in the day

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,920
Harvest keeper bags packing packing lbs

31
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,780

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,240
pretty cool stickers I'm a big sticker

33
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,799
guy so I'm always happy there's one of

34
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,158
his classics

35
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,079
we got the hasher instead of thrasher I

36
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,579
think that's super cool I really like

37
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:46,078
that I hope Thrasher doesn't give you a

38
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:49,798
hard time about that

39
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:52,258
and then uh yeah

40
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't even know what this says but I

41
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,840
like it it's a Halloween something about

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,840

color

57
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,659

58
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,859
try something outside of your comfort

59
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:40,259
