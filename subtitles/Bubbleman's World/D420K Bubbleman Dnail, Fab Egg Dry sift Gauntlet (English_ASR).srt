to be open together and well he he told

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,920
me he wasn't going to open it and that's

21
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,478
why I didn't but I think he's crazy for

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,640
not like he shouldn't have said that so

23
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,759
he could have come home and just hit

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,840
every one of these and been like what

25
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,640

in the cush right away they like playing

34
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:42,839
with one another there's the Holy Grail

35
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:45,359

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,520
holy CRA it's a it's a plethora

37
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,759
parchment up so I guess what we're going

38
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,158
to do here today is we're going to do a

39
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,920
little taste tester we got the mother

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,000
ship out with the quartz Bowl we've also

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,159
got the silicon carbide bowl over there

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,438
on a fresh whip I brought the Swiss perk

43
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,840
just so that when we flip whips from the

44
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:05,199
D we'll be able to have another 14 mil

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,320
pipe to put the the hot quartz or

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,118
silicone carbide into so look at you

47
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,239
like a kid at a candy store I can just

48
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,000
see your smile in the video I'm like

49
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,239
[ __ ] these all teeth you couldn't slap

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,039
the smile off my face I wouldn't [ __ ]

51
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,280
try just being

52
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:26,199
honest oh [ __ ] that's uh we OG you know

53
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:29,439
it's not it's it's been cured up for a

54
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:31,000
month it's not um it's not overly cured

55
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,560
or anything the resin heads if you

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,439
looked at them up close they wouldn't be

57
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,159
wrinkled like little raisins type thing

58
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,719
in the curing process so you could take

59
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,400
it and just basically well I love that

60
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,840
it's still powder it's done right I

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,760
really love that it's still powder like

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,158
I can but I can also tap it and it's

63
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:51,479
still powder yeah so it's an instant

64
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:53,639
press but it's still powder of course

65
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,079
I'm going to show you up close video of

66
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,719
each one of these hashes as we o as we

67
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,640
as we uh open them so yeah you can

68
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,158
really see that uh I think you should

69
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,399
hit hit that one this little hit that

70
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:06,280
you just dabbed out yeah well I accept

71
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,120
that cuz uh now now this one here

72
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,878
there's this is there's there's a few

73
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,000
ogs now it's from the same OG but

74
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,679
different screen grade now with that

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,318
static with the static parchment paper

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,640
trick yeah the that's a carding

77
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:24,119
technique as well and stuff what it what

78
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:27,119
it does is um it sure does I'll take the

79
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,438
the set of four screen wood set from

80
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,319
fresh hes and I'll take the once once

81
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:33,799
I've got it through my big screen and

82
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,560
before I start doing the static I'll

83
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,480
card it through the different levels

84
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,640
yeah that's a great idea and then I will

85
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,798
then I contaminants out through those

86
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,719
screens yes but the thing is is is I

87
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,599
separate the heads on the different

88
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:49,120
sizes of the screens so this is a little

89
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:51,438
darker than than it should be like than

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,879
the other OG but it's because it's a

91
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:57,438
different screen size and as you can see

92
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:59,840
it just melts like water what screen

93
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,199
size is this one I believe that's the

94
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,200
the uh

95
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,158
120

96
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:15,158
yum even the ASN tasted pretty good but

97
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:18,798
the first hit tasted really nice really

98
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:22,279
like a nice uh

99
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:25,120
intense OG

100
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:27,359
flavor with a tiny little bit of that

101
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,399
sharpness in the throat where it kind of

102
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,479
grabs you give you a little TP

103
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:36,679
TP hit there you go brother well that

104
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:40,000
was beautiful really nice so that was OG

105
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,439
OG 120 so we're going to just write that

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,879
down on

107
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:50,279
here first and then it goes to the 110

108
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:52,639
and then the 70 right and it's uh

109
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:57,719
impressive oh let's write that on the

110
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,720
back side one and 120

111
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,919
so there's the first

112
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,919
one

113
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:06,918
done

114
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,959
beautiful now what a gift to get full

115
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,560
melt dry sift even in just a pile like

116
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:17,239
that alone let alone a jar with many

117
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,319
many many piles like this we were

118
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,439
talking to Mark Emory uh yesterday we

119
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,400
were we he was on his way out with jod

120
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,120
but uh Darren was like let's uh let's

121
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:27,198
blaze markdown I haven't had a puff with

122
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,319
him since he's gotten out of jail and I

123
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,360
actually hadn't had a puff with him

124
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,720
since he got out of jail either so so um

125
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,479
we invited him over and I think it was

126
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,520
his first time hitting the D nail this

127
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,519
particular nail he's hit some other

128
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,359
types definitely his first time hitting

129
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,359
a Mothership Fab bag and his first time

130
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,800
hitting some really nice full melt dry

131
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,840
sift and it was neat to see his surprise

132
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,038
as he exhaled it cuz he's been smoking

133
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:50,439
shatters and butanes and all these dabs

134
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,318
that he's been giving out at the stores

135
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,319
for the last you know month plus he I

136
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,639
think he really noticed the difference

137
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,600
in how oh absolutely you could see it

138
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,240
you could see him notic when he exhaled

139
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,039
it I I'm sorry that I didn't videotape

140
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,439
it for you guys or record it I guess

141
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:07,680
we're not using videotapes anymore

142
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,800
there's a I'm aging Myself by saying

143
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,038
such a thing but uh no next time I we

144
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,520
hang out with Mark we'll do a little

145
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,240
video and get a couple words from him

146
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:19,038
and uh show him dabbing out on the

147
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,560
mothership now here's the same OG 70

148
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,279
Micron ah yes you can tell right away

149
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,560
just from looking at it and it was why I

150
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,959
think I was going to guess this was a

151
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,839
120 if you look at it you look how it

152
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,439
looks grainy yes it's heads it's like if

153
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:36,399
you had a bow of marbles and you had big

154
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,560
marbles in the bow you would really see

155
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,560
the pronunciation of each curve in the

156
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,280
marble that's a really good way of

157
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,240
looking on if you got tiny little

158
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,038
Marbles and you filled the bowl from a

159
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,079
distance it could almost look like the

160
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,560
bowl was full of liquid you know if they

161
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,079
were colored and this is what I'm saying

162
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,680
right here you can really see obviously

163
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,038
you can't you can't go like that to that

164
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,478
and split it up all you're going to do

165
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:59,800
is press it more yeah I could I could if

166
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,878
I froze it yes if I froze it and gave it

167
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,240
a couple of these absolutely yeah but

168
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,360
then you you worry about breaking the

169
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,759
gland heads what I like doing with that

170
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,520
I I've taken it like I did the Tony

171
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:15,560
sodas that uh with um the water the

172
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:17,839
water y um melting right and also the um

173
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,360
the hair straightener yes just in the

174
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,839
parchment paper sure don't need a hair

175
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,800
straightener with this though oh you can

176
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,598
do it just on your own just press it

177
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,360
with your finger and that's it right

178
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,839
yeah I just did really nice color on

179
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,160
this one also I'd say that the the

180
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,758
tackiness of the hash is is unique in

181
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,599
the sense that I'm so used to people

182
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,919
showing me water hash that hasn't been

183
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:41,199
dried properly um you know this the

184
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:44,198
stickiness of this and how how strong it

185
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,520
is in the pull and snap it doesn't break

186
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:50,720
easy and you can just press it right out

187
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:53,799
real nice so yeah I'm excited to dab

188
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,919
this flavor and so this is the OG again

189
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,720
70

190
00:07:54,918 --> 00:08:01,439
Micron we are going to be destroyed by

191
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,440
the end of this uh

192
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,679
session which I will add as my wake and

193
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,120
bake

194
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,959
session so you know that feeling when

195
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,598
you have that wake and bake hit can last

196
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:21,878
a good hour without even really needing

197
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:21,878
another

198
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:30,079
rip well that's not going to be the case

199
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,079
today no

200
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:38,319
I love the um sliding of the piece on

201
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:42,479
the nice smooth table with the uh Dil

202
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,879
dab rag yes a to WRA that one close that

203
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,360
one up sure I'm kind of just putting

204
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:47,039
them all here oh yeah perfect and then

205
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
I'm going to some pictures later right

206
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,639
yeah we'll go over each one with the

207
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,639
camera and show them yeah that one was

208
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:58,879
destructive literally

209
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:04,319
awesome very strong narcotic high on the

210
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:06,838
OG just just very um you know relaxing I

211
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,560
think of the I wouldn't say anxiety but

212
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,959
the anxiousness that I have today for

213
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,759
getting ready to fly I'm always anxious

214
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:17,679
when I fly not not because I'm afraid of

215
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:20,120
flying but I am just yeah you don't like

216
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,639
[ __ ] hate flying man I'm like VA

217
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,639
baracus from the 18 you got to [ __ ]

218
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,838
drug me up knock me out get me on the

219

plane if you want to take me anywhere

220
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,480
yeah I'm not that way at all I don't I

221
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,320
don't like turbulence obviously but I

222
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,800
don't trip out about it I'm mostly uh

223
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,959
it's the Cannabis the hash the pipe like

224
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,519
having stuff like that for so long and

225
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,479
now that I have a license it's just like

226
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,720
it still feels like I'm not allowed even

227
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,360
though I'm allowed and I don't mention

228
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,639
it I'm not like I'm not really like Remo

229
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,800
or Mark cloaked who are very like

230
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,799
pronounced and loud when they go through

231
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,359
uh the security they they have all their

232
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,719
weed right on them in their bags and

233
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,278
stuff and not sealed well hey you know

234
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,600
when they're licensed upu and everything

235
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:03,039
you you can do totally but I still

236
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,440
prefer to avoid those uh interactions

237
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:09,439
for the most part I hear you just

238
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,839
yeah this is the

239
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:17,360
110 of the OG as well yeah and uh tell

240
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,480
you man it's it's uh that's one of my

241
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,560
favorites the 11

242
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,360
yeah the 11 10 is your

243
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:31,199
favorite

244
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:34,759
yes oh yes this is some old older stuff

245
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,360
all Sly smelling that this is at least 6

246
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:41,399
months old this one very

247
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,680
nice very nice my friend and it's stuff

248
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,519
from when I was carding it with the

249
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,319
iTunes card and not using the static

250
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,159
trick and everything like that right

251
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,959
well it sure looks great yeah it's well

252
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,600
it goes to show you you know like uh the

253
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:56,319
carding techniques that I've been

254
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:59,920
sharing for I don't know 5 to 10 years

255
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,839
now will get you exactly this place that

256
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:05,719
we're sitting at the static parchment

257
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,399
trick gets you there faster it do so

258
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,440
it's just any anytime we can increase

259
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,078
yeah of course you still need those

260
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,360
screens to do it the [ __ ] purest man

261
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:18,039
you're not just sucking heads up yes

262
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,839
you're pushing contaminant through and

263
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:23,519
that's the key with with the way that I

264
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,040
do it I separate you know I got the big

265
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,959
set of screens I do initially then I

266
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,199
take that and I separate it in the

267
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,958
smaller screens so I about each grade

268
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,399
and then I use my parchment paper I

269
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,518
don't use the parchment paper until then

270
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,159
just because it's the parchment paper

271
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,159
will pick up too much heads while I'm

272
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,799
doing that and I want to separate those

273
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,399
grades like we just did here so it's

274
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,199
darker lighter which is which is why I

275
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,879
sell those screens that's why those

276
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,959
screens are there to separate when I

277
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:54,240
have a four screen set in Wood they have

278
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:56,000
different microns to do exactly this to

279
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,919
separate out the heads that's what

280
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
they're there for they're not to clean

281
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,000
there's only one cleaning screen screen

282
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,000
the bottom one the 70 Micron so people

283
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,519
always ask me what are these other

284
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,120
screens for I'm like to capture heads

285
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,480
that are bigger than those screens and

286
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,078
those heads are substantially every

287
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,720
single stage is sub bub bag process of

288
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,278
course you want to separate them we

289
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,879
separate all of our resin glands in

290
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,278
water hash why don't we want to do it in

291
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,679
dry sift I mean honestly watch for the

292
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:24,519
10 screen sift kit coming soon well yes

293
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,958
but and you can look at it if you're

294
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,399
looking at it on on the on the medical

295
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:32,239
charts that they have now with every

296
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,839
single glandular sized head everything

297
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,680
about the THC molecule and everything

298
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:40,680
that it helps you out with so if you

299
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,519
separate everything 1 to 10 even 1 to

300
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:46,319
four there's different medicinal

301
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:48,000
qualities in each separate one as you go

302
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,320
different for each person I don't know

303
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,480
them all myself because they're

304
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,920
different they're not it's not a

305
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,240
standardization it's like for one guy

306
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,039
who might get the most out of a 73

307
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,959
another guy might say no I don't like

308
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,198
the 73 the 120 hits me where I need it

309
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:04,399
yes and so it's definitely this is why

310
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:07,159
Bubble Bags went from a three bag to a

311
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,799
four to a six to a seven to an eight bag

312
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,639
system when all of my competition was

313
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,879
claiming that I had no idea what I was

314
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:17,278
doing uh that I was using way too many

315
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:19,360
bags and um you know aside from payload

316
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,399
who actually added a bag they have a

317
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,519
nine bag kit uh which I just have never

318
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,120
felt the necessity to do I've played

319
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,560
around with those numbers and haven't

320
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,440
had enough requests but uh yeah there's

321
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,919
these little things things there's back

322
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,040
in the day there were bags sidewalls

323
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,078
that now Nick uses those sidewalls came

324
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:41,078
out 10 plus years ago and in fact Bubble

325
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:44,198
Bags experimented with them I just found

326
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:46,679
that because of the cost of the screen

327
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:48,799
and the it just didn't seem to to me a

328
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,719
make a better product or do anything

329
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,198
like people say it drains the bags

330
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,720
faster um I've I never found that I can

331
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:58,519
drain a bag in under 10 seconds yeah

332
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,399
jerk and puller I how you can pull a bag

333
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,600
tug or whatever it

334
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:06,600
is yeah exactly that's what we'll call

335
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:09,240
it the yeah I like that well what do we

336
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,600
hit four three that's three number four

337
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,799
is a is a older cured OG both 6 months

338
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,240
just just feel it oh yeah you can tell

339
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,958
right and and the smell of it is uh is

340
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,399
substantially different as well yeah of

341
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,479
course well what's that that's going to

342
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,559
be our and we've been talking about this

343
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,600
uh Horatio was talking about off gasing

344
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:33,078
of tpin but alcohol tpin um you know

345
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,639
hydr these like um alcohol-based tpin

346
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:37,439
that seem to evaporate out the quickest

347
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,440
that you I smell them in the fresher

348
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,759
fresher ones in particular with sift

349
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,120
that maybe the material's only been

350
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,079
dried for like weeks or maybe a month or

351
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,120
two compared to stuff that was dried for

352
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:50,679
a year like a cleaner like a pine salt

353
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,000
strong yeah it's like strong and so when

354
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:56,198
you cure hash you those are so volatile

355
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,559
they off gas in the Cure and they're

356
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:02,198
gone and when they leave you're left

357
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,319
over with the these now subtle um tpin

358
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:07,278
more subtle but not that can also come

359
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,040
across very very strong in their scent

360
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,078
which is so strange to me that something

361
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:14,159
that strong could have been suppressed

362
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:16,399
sometimes by one of these alcohol tpin

363
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,799
that are really not even that strong of

364
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,879
a smell it's just like a blanket where

365
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,639
you can't access those other those other

366
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,519
smells and then you cure your hash it

367
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,320
doesn't take a genius to get the same

368
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,720
kind of hash and there's so much

369
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,759
learning in this you guys like you have

370
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,560
to understand like how you learn is by

371
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,278
separating out all your grades curing

372
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,479
your hash not just like making it the

373
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,559
same all the time and smoking it right

374
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,680
away you know some of this has come to

375
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,039
me in my dreams too in my sleep I've

376
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,599
woken up and been like holy [ __ ] and

377
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,278
almost got up and went out to the shop

378
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,278
to try that little method yeah dude I

379
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:54,120
believe it when you're thinking about it

380
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:56,559
I've got a I've got a box at home that

381
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,919
um and a list that I'm going to this is

382
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:03,879
my plan on my next video Wicked and uh

383
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:05,919
it's which is d420 k d420 k YouTube yep

384
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,240
so you should che check that out it's

385
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,879
it's going to have I've got a list of

386
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,079
things that are positively charged and

387
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,439
negatively charged and I have mostly

388
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,799
everything on that list in this box of

389
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,839
of tools to see exactly what charge is

390
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,719
the best what holds the best charge what

391
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,000
picks up the best what deflex the best

392
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,278
you know whatever it is yeah plus I've

393
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,519
got I've got this Tesla on order oh

394
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,278
Tesla coil this little yeah so I'm going

395
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,959
to I'm going to see what it does with

396
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:36,039
that too and there's there's so much

397
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:39,119
that just playing around yeah but you

398
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:42,719
know the parchment paper is the most is

399
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,679
is the collects the most separates the

400
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,680
the worst like it it really helps out a

401
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:49,879
lot yeah it's a quick quick process well

402
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:53,719
you know it it's it it cuts the time

403
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:57,799
down like less than half so shout out to

404
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,199
me m McMan maze I just grabbed the wrong

405
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:04,078
bom m

406
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:05,918
YouTube thank you that was uh that

407
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:09,198
[ __ ] trick works change change the

408
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,280
game in in in in my eyes you know

409
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,558
another game Cher cuz cuz the the the

410
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,798
iTunes card for me yes the iTunes card

411
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,720
for me was like uh you know I discovered

412
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,639
the little bit of the contaminant and

413
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,439
then the good clean I was like oh cool

414
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,640
so you know I I spread that I shared

415
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,038
that because of course why not and then

416
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,360
uh mhm he was telling me and his

417
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,000
comments that that was an influence on

418
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:37,319
his part and then he uh come up with

419
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,960
that parchment paper and holy [ __ ] and

420
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:41,678
you can you can follow it right back to

421
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,480
skunkman Sam through M to Darren through

422
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,120
me through skunkman Sam like yeah and

423
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,919
all well it was like for me it was

424
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,479
direct from I was lucky enough to have

425
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:53,160
my information come direct from from Sam

426
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,360
just in the sense of just learning about

427
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,960
sifting because first all he really did

428
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,719
was show me sift and so then I was like

429
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,038
I gotta get like I didn't know how he

430
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,880
was making it but I looked into you know

431
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:06,279
hashish and it was like screens and I

432
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,840
already had a multiscreen ke box and it

433
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:11,440
was like okay do this we need more than

434
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,558
one screen and so I finally got to a

435
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,000
point where I got to a tighter screen

436
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,158
and I was like okay like I can card

437
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,038
contaminant through which only worked

438
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,039
because I did it one time accidentally

439
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:25,079
in the very very cold mhm and it changed

440
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,839
the structure of the resin it changed

441
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,720
everything people are trying these

442
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,439
techniques in too warm condition if you

443
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,200
can't get yourself steing your resin if

444
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,519
you can't get yourself into the right

445
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,480
conditions which is cold cold cold if

446
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,759
you can do that then you can start

447
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,000
playing around and doing all these

448
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:43,679
really cool experiments that may or may

449
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,200
not hit for you they're going to have a

450
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,038
better chance of hitting if you have the

451
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,120
resin in the condition that it needs to

452
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:53,200
be in which is a dry and B cold dry and

453
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:57,759
cold

454
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,919
yeah very nice a ni and one thing I was

455
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,319
I that was REM Ed of me with when you

456
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,038
were telling me about your screens and

457
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:04,599
stuff like that before when I got the

458
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:07,759
screens in the beginning when I got the

459
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:10,439
tumbler and there's that that stuff I I

460
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:13,359
figured that what you carded through the

461
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,519
70 screen the bottom cleaning screen was

462
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:18,759
the [ __ ] everyone thought that yeah and

463
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,879
of course that is what what the what was

464
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:24,720
taken from that everyone thought that it

465
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,919
was right up there with 70 um OG another

466
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,120
OG yeah um well we haven't even hit this

467
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,600
one yet have I did did you yeah I

468
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:35,279
pressed up a little hit the [ __ ] going

469
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:39,079
on behind for 20K what's wrong with you

470
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:41,119
it was nice it was uh it was it was diff

471
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:43,798
it wasn't actually as enjoyable as these

472
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,918
ones this one was nice still melted just

473
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:47,359
as much it just didn't I think some of

474
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,640
the turkey well you know what it is I'll

475
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:54,399
tell you right now

476
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:56,400
okay Sugar Leaf yeah bud oh there you go

477
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,000
that's there you go I don't know why I

478
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,840
didn't tell you that I totally [ __ ]

479
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,839
well you did just now yeah

480
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,279
yeah

481
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:09,940
[Music]

482
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,880
yeah yeah yeah

483
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:32,919
yeah dos that's the absolute difference

484
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:35,280
yeah Sugar Leaf and Bud oh it's a pretty

485
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:38,919
substantial difference night and day

486
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:43,000
yeah AB in in dry sift anyway I find

487
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:47,038
that there's some sort of a haish plant

488
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,319
matter cellulose taste that is passed on

489
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,038
and I've even how you explain it to me

490
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:54,279
so they can do it

491
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:56,279
themselves how how you get that smell

492
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:58,599
how you acquire how how you know it's

493
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:59,839
either from bud or from the leaf well

494
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,439
you know what it would be the difference

495
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,319
the easiest way to tell would be to put

496
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,840
a bag of leaf into a you know put a

497
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:06,279
bunch of leaf into a little bag and put

498
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:08,319
a bunch of Bud into a little bag and

499
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,278
just open those after an hour of them

500
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,960
off gassing and sitting in the bag or

501
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:15,359
jar and open them and smell each one and

502
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,480
one will smell like hay which will be

503
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,719
the leaf it's just chlorophyll or

504
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,839
whatever it is that's present more in

505
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,798
that like in a lesser con it's in a

506
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:26,639
higher concentration than resin glands

507
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,158
whereas butt is just so stacked with

508
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,000
resin glands that you you can get the

509
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,640
nice smell obviously it's nothing

510
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,200
compared to when you extract just the

511
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,240
heads yeah and then that smell is like

512
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,640
just the P the but it's just

513
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,759
unbelievably different and smell taste

514
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,360
totally everything you know the buzz is

515
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,038
is still killer from the Sugar Leaf and

516
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:51,719
you know this trash turns into your

517
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:54,960
stash quite easily like

518
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,480
it's that it's still [ __ ] melty and

519
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,480
killer yeah it melted into a liquid for

520
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,480
sure

521
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:07,038
coconut oil infused with uh THC I love

522
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:10,000
eating yeah I woke up with mine this

523
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:13,400
morning got to have

524
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,400
it for you

525
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:22,640
D really nice flavors and just an

526
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,240
amazing uh smorgus Borg of even though

527
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,240
that's all OG so far there's been

528
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,240
nuances and differences in the different

529
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,278
size heads from the tpine profiles and

530
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,960
the cannabinoid profiles and then

531
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:34,720
hitting three bud and then going to a

532
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,159
leaf and then going back to a bud I

533
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,880
believe

534
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:43,559

missed the conference that was just

549
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,599
there recently I really tried to make it

550
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:29,119
out but my schedule was just not

551
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:32,480
allowing me to leave for that that

552
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:34,079
period of time so more was as early as I

553
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,720
could get

554
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:41,678
out so strong such a bite in the lung

555
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,679
that just uh yeah it was really

556
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,679
nice

557
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:50,119
super

558
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,278
that keeps you from really

559
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:56,759
talking yeah totally like bite yeah I

560
00:23:54,278 --> 00:24:00,440
like the uh head space of it it's really

561
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:02,480
like intense in the head like super body

562
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,159
numbing in the sense of like any pain or

563
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,480
discomfort you have is definitely gone

564
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,760
in the high of this this strain which

565
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,000
obviously people know OG is

566
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:16,278
extremely extremely

567
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,200
medicinal for sort of you know pain

568
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:20,480
relief and that sort of nerve damage and

569
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,440
whatnot I've heard a lot of people say

570
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,159
OG has been the one for them well or any

571
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,360

be holy GOI holy [ __ ] Goji OG this is

589
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,919
just question mark it's just a big

590
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,278
question I don't know what it is it

591
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,720
should be holy question then we got the

592
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:19,398
diesel that's tasty flavorful tasty

593
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,159
tasty that's the one where once you hit

594
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:26,000
it all every other hit tastes like that

595
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,640
and then uh we got some 70 Micron of uh

596
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,960
I don't know I don't know question am

597
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,840
again so I don't know I think uh you

598
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,079
know the diesel is a dominating flavor I

599
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,798
get like it's like the Astro Boy that

600
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,798
Astro Boy it didn't matter what I what

601
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:44,038
we smoked after the Astro Boy hit still

602
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:46,000
tastes like Astro Boy of course crazy

603
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:47,879
super strong so these will be the same

604
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,079

sifting it it's I'm a person that has no

648
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:46,600
patience for a lot of different things

649
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:49,919
and you know all that [ __ ] High strong

650
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:53,359
[ __ ] crazy son of a gun but this I

651
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,360
have a patience for all day had a very

652
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,079
nice

653
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:59,319
taste um grabbed me for sure got me a

654
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:00,720
good head Buzz

655
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:03,720
just still taste that difference between

656
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,759
the bud and the leaf absolutely it is a

657
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,640
it is a difference

658
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,119
yeah yeah you definitely want to be

659
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,799
bringing sift made from Bud to Legends

660
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:15,558
oh yeah there's there would

661
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:17,639
be I would it's so smooth and like it's

662
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:21,599
the difference might be subtle to some

663
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,919
but it's massive to others well to uh to

664
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,678
the judges of those types of

665
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,840
competitions

666
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:29,840
yeah you this stuff wouldn't even be the

667
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,599
the the the leaf even though even though

668
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,839
pure good everything it is and the

669
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,879
microscope everything still different

670
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:40,639
than the bud and and and and if somebody

671
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,000
had a lesser quality but from Bud right

672
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,559
it would win over that because of that

673
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,159
flavor that that after and those guys

674
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:50,720
would be on it all over it particularly

675
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,039
uh Sam and

676
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,679
Dave well that's why I would enter the

677
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,558
bud would not even waste the judge's

678
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,120
time with sugar beef I would keep that

679
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:01,918
for myself in my and smoking that one's

680
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:03,599
got me coughing for sure like not just a

681
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,399
turpine cough but that little bit of

682
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,959
that that difference whatever that is

683
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,398
whatever that taste and smell is from

684
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,679
the leaf to the bud it's weird cuz I

685
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:16,359
really rarely got that in like that it

686
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:18,320
seemed to wash off in water because I

687
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:21,158
remember running batches of water hash

688
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,639
from Sugar Leaf and I mean real Sugar

689
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,919
Leaf real trim not no fan Leaf at all

690
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,640
and it came out

691
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,559
spectacular like as nice as the butt cuz

692
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,840
I ran the same bud before as well and

693
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:33,759
just thought oh this is going to even be

694
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,839
nicer and we were kind of like okay it's

695
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,879
it's still a 9.5 or whatever but I don't

696
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:40,119
know we were just thinking it was going

697
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,120
to be a

698
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:43,119
15

699
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:50,720
yeah oh my golly

700
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:59,360
doodle Holy Grail eh the Holy Grail cous

701
00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:01,079
it's the cush man you got any of them

702
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:05,519
you know reason I say it like that is

703
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:07,759
cuz uh um what is it Bill Clinton yeah

704
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:10,880
in the movie

705
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,359
uh Pineapple Express okay I don't

706
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,000
remember he's talking he's talking to

707
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:17,798
Seth Rogan I think and or not Seth Rogan

708
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,119
Seth uh oh I think I now remember he we

709
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:21,079
Whispers over or something and says

710
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,639
something this is the this is the OG or

711
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:25,038
this is the something cush it doesn't

712
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,159
say cush he says

713
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:30,919
cush this is the cous

714
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,880
this is the Holy Grail cous it's the

715
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:36,200
cous man you guys need some cous get

716
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,240
it's made out it's made out of really

717
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,480
good Sugar Leaf

718
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,359
actually you know what there was a batch

719
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,599
that was made with Sugar Leaf and with

720
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,278
bud this might be the one with Bud

721
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,439
because it looks really nice and it

722
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,240
smells really nice it has that smell

723
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,759
we'll just have to see once we smoke it

724
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,120
cuz we'll be able to tell them yep true

725
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:58,759
like I'm leaning more towards the line

726
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,278
of it's from the

727
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:02,919
just from the look of it and the smell

728
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:02,919
that I had

729
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,480
mhm yes uh well once again I'll need for

730
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:11,479
the herb

731
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:14,599
iron no no not at

732
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,159
all if it needs that it's not clean

733
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:18,918
enough and I need to clean it some more

734
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:21,080
right that's the way I look at it or

735
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:24,360
it's Whited out and you got to heat it

736
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:27,519
up a bit now the Whiting out what's the

737
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:29,278
bad parts of that is there a bad part to

738
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,599
it cuz I've you know I have stuff that

739
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,679
I've that seems to be Whited out and it

740
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:37,119
still melts beautifully and smoked

741
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,720
killer and I get I mean you know the bad

742
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,719
part is the longer you let it go that

743
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,558
it's okay here's the bad part get it

744
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,360
tested and see what is making it white

745
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:47,599
out if it's just Tarpin and it's natural

746
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:50,638
then probably nothing's going to be

747
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:53,199
wrong if water is present then mold can

748
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:54,918
occur and if there's mold in there and

749
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,639
and that's that's kind of like from my

750
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:58,600
perspective the older guys that every

751
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:00,558
time they ever have seen it it's to them

752
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:02,719
told them water has that hasn't been

753
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,720
dried properly generally cuz that's what

754
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,880
it was back in the day now we start

755
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,278
seeing it with some dry sifts is it

756
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,399
because the tur too fresh was done in

757
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,440
the ice ice cold so the resin heads were

758
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:15,079
frozen nice and add fresh like that and

759
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,960
then put together so that moisture is

760
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:19,439
doing that maybe yeah you know maybe so

761
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,079
it's it's hard to say that really we

762
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,558
don't know until we get a lab and we

763
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:23,839
start testing these things it's all just

764
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:25,480
a bunch of people sitting around and

765
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,158
theorizing about oh I think it's this

766
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,399
and I think it's that and it's great

767
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:31,880
they're all cool ideas and Concepts and

768
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:34,079
thoughts but none of them are basic uh

769
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,278
based on reality as much as based on our

770
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,278
assumptions of reality that's right

771
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:41,079
there's no fact there's no fact in any

772
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:42,960
it unless there is fact behind it and

773
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:47,398
someone out there knows about it send us

774
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,600
the link I'd love to learn more and

775
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:51,638
more

776
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,000
absolutely you know it used to be about

777
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:56,638
smoking [ __ ] dope and all that kind

778
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,960
of stuff and it's taken the the world

779
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:02,599
has taken it in such a

780
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:07,319
greater picture it's just uh it's true

781
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:09,599
did you hit that not yet hitting the

782
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:12,398
cous

783
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,599
well I'm definitely the highest I've

784
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,439
ever been the day before I'm flying out

785
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:18,638
of the

786
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,360
country then again I've never left right

787
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:23,199
after a Legends cuz that would be crazy

788
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,798
to try and wake up the next day after a

789
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,919
Legends which is literally like what I'm

790
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:31,278
doing right here except with 27 to 35

791
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:32,880
hits all in a row all in a very short

792
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,599
period of time probably the length of

793
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,440
this video non-stop just bang bang bang

794
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,119
bang and there's really only a few

795
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,919
people that can sit at the table and get

796
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,879
that done I'm telling you like it's you

797
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,679
start sweating you start kind of like

798
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,080
holy [ __ ] and you got to pace yourself

799
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:49,320

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,200
that was a big one Darren's just taking

in the video d fall dir fell down again

821
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,679
this video actually took 14 hours to

822
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:02,598
film we just cut it down

823
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:04,799
49 minutes that was uh that was the most

824
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,519
enjoyable hit off off of all of them

825
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,880
because I the pins and needles in my my

826
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,800
whole head Tangled I seen the little

827
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,079
stars [ __ ] doing the loops and I

828
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,160
[ __ ] had to hold my head down serious

829
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:19,480
that's awesome yeah I love rips like

830
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:21,960
that we got four M to go the fourth one

831
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,440
the diesel flavor I'm almost [ __ ]

832
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,079
scared of both that really yeah oh not

833
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,079
me man I'm looking forward to that one

834
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,160
cuz it's so do it of course so much

835
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,920
flavor yes it is flavor but you know you

836
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:35,879
you you love the flavor more but I I I

837
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,280
love the flavor too but the power from

838
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:42,240
it really surprises me like it uh it

839
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,519
bites me and um I don't know maybe the

840
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:47,000
turps get me high on it higher I don't

841
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:48,440
know but like uh yeah it could be it

842
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,880
could be modulating the effect if you're

843
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,280
smoking like 10 rips of OG before you

844
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,160
hit the diesel that could definitely uh

845
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,960
shut tone it down well just give you a

846
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:01,318
really good high on your diesel thinking

847
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,240
man this Diesel's super strong it's like

848
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:06,880
okay cuz generally when I say that I've

849
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:08,519
never considered Calo uh the diesel um

850
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,760
some of the Tangi is some of these

851
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:12,480
strains I've never thought of them as

852
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,960
the most powerfully strong strains what

853
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,800
did you think do you think it came from

854
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,480
bud or Leaf I think it could have come

855
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,039
from Leaf it's possible I think so too

856
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,159
yeah I didn't you know I I took the

857
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:25,838
first smell I smelt Leaf then you were

858
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,358
like and it smells pretty good then I

859
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:31,239
took another smell of it was smell more

860
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:32,719
smooth yeah it's got a nice Amber kind

861
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:36,239
of reddish

862
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:40,719
color that Holy Grail cou well this one

863
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:43,358
I believe is from Bud excuse me it's the

864
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:47,118
70 um yeah I don't smell the any leaf on

865
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:49,480
that one it's the 70 question mark the

866
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,838
what the [ __ ] I don't know the the what

867

multitude of raccoons actually

these Ripples and oh yeah yeah that's

896
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:01,838
where he got

897
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,358
mangled little sons of [ __ ] you think

898
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,039
of how hardcore that is he's had his

899
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,039
throat mangled oh that's worse than a

900
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:10,159
[ __ ] outright gang prison R he's been

901
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:11,920
hit by a car which is like well like

902
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:14,000
getting hit by a car you've been there

903
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,800
you know what that feels like and he's a

904
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,400
little [ __ ] 8B dog that got hit by a

905
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,200
car oh totally this guy is so tough man

906
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,358
he impresses the hell out of and then

907
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:25,318
taken the equivalent of what would be

908
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,719
the equivalent of like having like a

909
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:29,358
multitude of dudes in Bell clavas up

910
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,919
next to you in a van and put a bag over

911
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:32,960
your head and pull you into the van and

912
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,639
then stab in the animal world well he

913
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,000
was just in the mouth and it was shaking

914
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:39,279
him a bit so they weren't quite and he's

915
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,400
got a titanium hip and it's mounted on

916
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,160
both sides goes right through so I think

917
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,680
it had its teeth on his titanium and he

918
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:49,239
couldn't really sink in so we ended up

919
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,199
dropping for that titanium that's

920
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:53,000
unbelievable man lucky for that car

921
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:56,000
hitting yeah everything happens for a

922
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
reason eh somehow some way that's what

923
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,480
they say man

924
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,358
that's what they say Oreo cookie you

925
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,358
tough guy little

926
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:10,240
Oreo I love doggies I love animals

927
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,240
they're

928
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:16,639
cool I keeping around just in case you

929
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:18,440
know zombie apocalypse and you got to

930
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:19,838
eat them to survive or something you

931
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,000
never know right they're the first ones

932
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:23,799
to go he might be a he might be

933
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,838
breakfast for

934
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,079
you hey little sausages that one had a

935
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:31,279
real nice I would I would say that it's

936
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:33,440
very likely that that came from Bud okay

937
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,240
buddy have you no you're hitting

938
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,480
everything after

939
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:41,358
me much smoother delayed

940
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,760
cough could be from the bud I believe it

941
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:47,400
is actually just a bunch of the bottoms

942
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,200
of the bags of Bud pretty pretty strong

943
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,838
definitely feel that throughout and you

944
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,679
know after taking this many hits people

945
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:53,920
are going to how can you tell if it's

946
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:55,759
it's like listen you can tell believe it

947
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,200
or not I'm going to go wash my hands

948
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,240
this this level of uh of quality um

949
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:03,159
every time you hit it you are going to

950
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:05,239
feel an increase and potentially a

951
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:07,000
change in your high especially if you're

952
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:08,399
hitting different strains what what was

953
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,400
the strain

954
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,639
Darren SE oh 70 Micron question mark we

955
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,639
don't know what the strain is so that

956
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,960
was interesting it was different from

957
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:18,000
the other things that he has here

958
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,039
probably a collection of a multitude of

959
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,440
strains cuz it had a very complex flavor

960
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:27,519
to it musky and cushy but something else

961
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:31,440
maybe some of these other you know uh OG

962
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:33,159
or GOI or maybe the um e some diesel or

963
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,920
something something that's changing the

964
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:39,159
profile very nice very

965
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,880
nice so Darren's just washing his hands

966
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:43,719
um maybe I'll hit the next one while

967
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,720
he's uh doing

968
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:47,720
that

969
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:50,279
oh

970
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:52,959

00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,240
finish it off with the New York City

986
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:32,799
Diesel super Orange Citrus flavor but

987
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:35,719
not just lemon it's deeper it's valine

988
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,240
merine oopen I don't know there's a

989
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:40,598
variety of tpin in that orange that

990
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:41,838
makes it that orange it's uh I would say

991
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:45,960
it's the difference between if you know

992
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:48,719
what orange oil is versus um delemon the

993
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:52,000
one single tpine extracted from Orange

994
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:53,799
Rines look it up Google there's a

995
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,639
difference and the difference is is

996
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:00,359
orange oil is stacked full of mono cesco

997
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:03,078
and and tpin and Horatio does that right

998
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:06,159
he does the delemon yeah yeah you've had

999
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:08,720
his product very strong very very strong

1000
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:10,279
yeah you feel it instantly right from

1001
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,799
your head to your toes you just like a

1002
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,839
blanket going over you yeah you you do

1003
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,680
feel it I like that a lot not unlike

1004
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:19,558
this

1005
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:21,639
Tri yeah I mean the first time I hit um

1006
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:25,839
Horatio oil and I've only hit a few holy

1007
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:28,558
[ __ ] holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] um I've hit his

1008
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:33,318
oil uh just maybe three or three times

1009
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:34,839
now and um the first time I hit it he

1010
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:36,838
was like okay you got to hit it like he

1011
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:39,039
was directing me how I should hit it and

1012
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:40,719
I was like okay it's his oil it's his

1013
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:42,000
his Vape he's got it all low temped out

1014
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:44,399
he's like it's going to be about a 30

1015
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,199
second hit so he told me I was like okay

1016
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,680
I'll I won't suck too hard I'll go real

1017
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:51,199
slow and steady and so I I started

1018
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:52,719
hitting it and then he was like oh I

1019
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:54,118
want you to hold it in for about 10

1020
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,358
seconds just hold it in and then blow it

1021
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:00,960
out real real slowly while

1022
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:02,358
I do this of course I'm ripped instantly

1023
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,639
and then get a message from my wife that

1024
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:06,519
I have to go

1025
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:09,039
home so it was like really smoked that

1026
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:11,079
yet tell you and how was that did you

1027
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,719
well it was like uh you feel it right

1028
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:16,240
down to your toes yeah it was completely

1029
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:19,000
you know very high yeah much like I am

1030
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:21,558
right now actually it uh it works really

1031
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,599
well I like I like that product he uh

1032
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:29,359
it's impressive and it's clean yeah it's

1033
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:34,400
it's it's clean and you know holy [ __ ]

1034
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:35,880
dude holy clean is is uh is important if

1035
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,280
you're inhaling it into your lungs and

1036
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,480
your body and you want to use it for

1037
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:43,079
medication and all that it's uh I think

1038
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,519
it's important even if you're just

1039
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,200
recation we all deserve it that's the

1040
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:48,838
way I put it and then it seems to be

1041
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:50,318
like cuz I'm not trying to be an elitist

1042
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:53,119
or anything I just really feel that

1043
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:55,239
everyone deserves the best they all

1044
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,240
deserve this level of quality they

1045
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:58,838
deserve they deserve to be able to grow

1046
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:01,558
the best their own self in their

1047
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:03,719
backyard and a greenhouse to make enough

1048
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:06,040
to make medication throughout the winter

1049
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:08,239
time and their oils and their tinctures

1050
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:10,480
and their age their medibles and

1051
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:11,919
everything just to keep themselves

1052
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,519
active with it and keeping their own

1053
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,680
cannaboid systems fed and keeping

1054
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:19,519
healthy it used to be happening at one

1055
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:21,399
time at one point in in the world but

1056
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:23,639
you know maybe one point one one time

1057
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,358
again we're getting closer right it's

1058
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:27,318
all about the medicine everybody should

1059
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:31,799
be able to do it that one was sharp on

1060
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:34,960
the throat probably the uh the um from

1061
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:37,559
Leaf yeah nice but sharp out of all of

1062
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,960
the in fact the sharpest by far out of

1063
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:40,800
all of them let me know if you if you

1064
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,159
see that or if that's just a unique

1065
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,760
thing to me could be off to the ninth

1066
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:47,078
hit the ninth hit I really felt like cuz

1067
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,240
I was taking the hit and I was like

1068
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:49,880
halfway through I was like right on and

1069
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,318
then as I got about 3/4s of the way

1070
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,920
through I felt it before I exhaled it

1071
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:57,159
and I didn't feel any of that with

1072
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,358
these not a single so I don't know I

1073
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:03,159
know if it's uh my own sensitive throat

1074
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:04,759
after nine rips like he said or if it's

1075
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:08,118
um if he's going to be feeling a little

1076
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,119
bit of a sharper rip on this

1077
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,160
one you know you do become an elitist

1078
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,400
when you just get this many beautiful

1079
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:17,639
strains put in front of you and the

1080
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,280
bottom line when you have this this many

1081
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:21,159
you can find one that's shitty well they

1082
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,319
can't another way of saying it is they

1083
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:24,558
can't all be the best yeah that's right

1084
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:26,440
you know what I mean especially when

1085
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:29,280
some of these like four or five of them

1086
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,559
are just outstanding like made from Bud

1087
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:36,240
obviously the color is lighter the smell

1088
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:39,440
is Daner the hit is harder and stronger

1089
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:43,558
and tastier [ __ ] come

1090
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,000
on holy [ __ ] yeah yeah sharper y did you

1091
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,319
get it um when you were taking the hit

1092
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,760
or not until after taking it all right

1093
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:51,400
cool so then there's definitely

1094
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,240
something it's uh it's made out of leaf

1095
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,720
too right that's the Sugar Leaf yeah but

1096
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:57,439
there you have other Leaf ones that

1097
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:59,639
didn't give me that sharp of a RI

1098
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,880
it could be because of uh anything a

1099
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:04,558
million variables the size of the heads

1100
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,519
the screen size yeah the contamination

1101
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:07,760
in it exactly what yeah one thing that

1102
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:09,599
might have gotten in there that we're

1103
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,240
feeling that shouldn't be in there like

1104
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,800
you never know but I know that there

1105
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:15,479
wouldn't be anything like spray some

1106
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,760
sort of spray on it some sort of

1107
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,838
nutrient

1108
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,599
spray or yeah there there's NE oil I

1109
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:23,078
would taste right away yeah there's

1110
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,640
nobody can hide that from me there's

1111
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:29,400
nothing in it sprayed on those plants I

1112
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:29,400
didn't taste anything in it it was just

1113
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,359
sharp I'm excited I really just want to

1114
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:38,079
hit that diesel but let's uh hit this

1115
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:39,920
surprise that could be the oldest stuff

1116
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,440
too that oh there you go yeah yeah yeah

1117
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,720
the driest you know what I'm saying

1118
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,400
totally and this this is a thing

1119
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:46,838
sometimes when you evaporate turpins we

1120
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,800
were talking about this earlier you can

1121
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:52,119
lose harsh ones in the curing process

1122
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,200
and release really beautiful ones

1123
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:55,800
however it does work the other way

1124
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:58,399
around where sometimes you lose your

1125
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:01,240
tpin that were smooth and now you're

1126
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,760
left with these harsh ones and uh yeah

1127
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:05,479
it's just a matter of us learning which

1128
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:08,079
Tarpin are those what is that degreg is

1129
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:11,039
it temperature is it light is it you

1130
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:13,240
know what how are we getting to these

1131
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,199
end results we we can see the

1132
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:18,118
differences in all the hashes and their

1133
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:20,078
subtle you know color differences and

1134
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:23,200
and flavor and taste profiles even in

1135
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,839
the same strain separated out into the

1136
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:26,439
separate screens which people ask me all

1137
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:28,599
the time why do you have separate size

1138
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,159
heads why do you have four size screens

1139
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:33,280
in the wood and then only and but

1140
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:36,039
different four size screens in the metal

1141
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,240
and it's like because the four screens

1142
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:40,800
are for separating heads you're never

1143
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,919
going to like there's a cleaning screen

1144
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,760
in that kit too but really that kit

1145
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,880
should be a three- screen kit that comes

1146
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,160
with the metal framed larger kit because

1147
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,680
those are just to prepare you to take

1148
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:54,318
that resin and then go over here drop

1149
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:56,838
tune it well yeah drop it through the

1150
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:59,480
two screens you know card it with

1151
00:47:56,838 --> 00:48:01,599
parchment over the 70 and then man I'll

1152
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,159
tell you at the end of the day you're

1153
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,200
pretty darn happy with the results

1154
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:08,519
question mark question mark question

1155
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:10,558
mark it's uh what the [ __ ] I'm not sure

1156
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:14,000
dude I'm going to hit some what the

1157
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,000

00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,200
boy is to me nice you know what I mean

1163
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:34,838
like when I when I hit that Astro Boy it

1164
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:37,159

and start

1167
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,519
running just yeah Astro Boy definitely

1168
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:48,519

parchments very nice little tiny bit

1174
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:33,118
sharp but I think that might be because

1175
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,119
I just took 10

1176
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:39,759

00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,960
contaminating the hash after it takes

1246
00:52:54,639 --> 00:53:00,239
[ __ ] hours to decontaminate made it

1247
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,240
months to [ __ ] grow

1248
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:06,599
it it takes a while before you harvest

1249
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:09,039
the heads and you know if you

1250
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,079
really if you really want to harvest the

1251
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:14,199
heads in the most proper

1252
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:16,079
ways yeah you you dry it in the in in in

1253
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:18,919
your best you know if everybody has

1254
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:21,160
their temperatures and their methods and

1255
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:24,119
and uh we've been I've been told a

1256
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:27,679
method just recently that I want to try

1257
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:31,400
and that's a a 14-day cure at

1258
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:33,239
56° hanging on the plant trimmed up

1259
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,838
right like hanging on the stock not all

1260
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:37,078
just the whole plant Johnny be telling

1261
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:39,318
you about that uh no actually uh my

1262
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:42,039
buddy Jake somebody told him

1263
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:43,400
that uh down here awesome yeah David

1264
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:47,199
Allen was talking about that a little

1265
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:49,559
while back and uh John really was like

1266
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:51,118
receptive to it he was it really harvest

1267
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:54,720
the heads proper I went I went and

1268
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:56,720
visited um a fairly big the heads I

1269
00:53:54,719 --> 00:54:00,078
guess before the Harvest yeah and I went

1270
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:03,078
into their cure room and um it was very

1271
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:05,000
cold uhhuh I was like sweet good on you

1272
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:07,920
guys cold enough not to preserve the

1273
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,798
tpin it's I think it's 57°

1274
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,400
58° have mold spores starting to grow so

1275
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:15,039
if you have it like that then you can

1276
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:19,160
have that process happen but if you take

1277
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:21,679
it down to 56 55 MH you don't have those

1278
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:23,480
those mold SP preservation of the tpin

1279
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:25,318
dude you walk into the room and it

1280
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,199
smells but it doesn't smell like what

1281
00:54:25,318 --> 00:54:30,400
you know of your room to take that and

1282
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:32,558
harvest it into your into your uh your

1283
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,680
um butt into your hash right you

1284
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,240
couldn't take it off that the 14 days

1285
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:39,039
and then Harvest it because the resin

1286
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:41,239
would be too [ __ ] soft and beautiful

1287
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:44,318
oh yeah it needs to Beed it would it

1288
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:47,239
would then have to be dried exactly in a

1289
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:49,639
completely dry room no humidity low

1290
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:51,399
humidity low temperature still yes and

1291
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:53,960
just let it do its thing for maybe a

1292
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:57,480
month or two yeah exactly before you

1293
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:59,679
even move those things off glands those

1294
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,480
gland heads we want them to raisen up a

1295
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:03,759
little bit you know they don't want them

1296
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,079
as these giant water balloons with

1297
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,599
perfect edges around the heads It's like

1298
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:11,119
because here's why here's why too with

1299
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:13,720
my parchment paper when I'm doing my

1300
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:16,760
parchment paper part that that uh that I

1301
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:19,439
learned from from par the parchment

1302
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,400
paper parchment paper it it'll or even

1303
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,318
the iTunes card when you're doing it and

1304
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,880
it's and it's fresher and it's not cold

1305
00:55:23,318 --> 00:55:28,400
enough you're going to just smear heads

1306
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:32,000
and it's B on your C you're not going to

1307
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,240
get a complete easy complete surface

1308
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,838
going ACR you're going to have all these

1309
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:36,519
beads absolutely which I've talked about

1310
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:38,838
in my videos of how important it is to

1311
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:41,038
clean that card and if it's doing that

1312
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:43,159
that your your situation is that you're

1313
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:45,400
not cold enough or you're heating it up

1314
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:47,000
too much by being too fast too hard on

1315
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,519
it yeah but I'm telling you if you get

1316
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,440
it cold enough you can beat it up pretty

1317
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:53,000
good yes you know what I mean like cold

1318
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:56,440
enough is like in the minus degrees not

1319
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,679
like 50° doing it up there in my shop my

1320
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:02,960
wh BL steam out of my breath yeah if it

1321
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:05,078
can be- 10 or- 15 or- 20 like guaranteed

1322
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,039
you will see differences in those

1323
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:09,400
temperatures in the way the resin gland

1324
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:10,760
reacts to being cleaned yeah yeah so

1325
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,440
it's nice he's got the super cold

1326
