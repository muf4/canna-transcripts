00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,080
Hey everybody, welcome back to the

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,000
Cannabis Journal Club where we review

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,559
and interpret United States cannabis

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,879
patents and scientific journals with

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,879
concise overview of complex scientific

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,960
literature in an understandable and easy

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,640
to consume manner to expose the

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,039
knowledge hidden in the scientific

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,278
literature. We do not claim any medical

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,000
utility and of these government patents

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:28,640
or scientific articles. We advise you to

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
obtain your own copy of these public

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,160
documents. We will also make them

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,558
available when we can through the

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,879
description in the description of this

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,878
video. Uh, I'd like to introduce Dr.

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,719
David Allen and we're going to get into

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,718
today's show. Dr.

19
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:51,959
Allen, you're you're good to go, Dr.

20
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,600
Allen.

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,960
Okay. Thank you, Marcus. Hi, I'm Dr.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,600
David Allen. and I'm a retired

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,280
cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon and

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,519
I'm self-taught in the science of the

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,519
endocanamonoid signaling

26
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,359
system. And today we're going to review

27
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:14,158
my original article

28
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:16,400
uh entitled Ignorance is not bliss. You

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,439
can get a copy of this article by

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,920
looking up cannabis digest and Ignorance

31
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,919
is not bliss.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,599
And what happened was I I was trained in

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,560
cardiovascular surgery, but my career

34
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,640
quit me in Mississippi. And so I

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,879
obtained

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,079
a medical license in California and I

37
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,280
moved to Sacramento and started a

38
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,798
cannabis practice in

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,478
Sacramento. And I thought to myself,

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,560
well, I've not been taught about this

41
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:56,920
science and I had to train myself in it.

42
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:00,519
and I can't be alone in this. So I

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,879
thought I need to figure out what

44
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:07,840
colleges universities are teaching in

45
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:10,399
the science. And so uh myself and my

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,159
three employees

47
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,878
uh called 157 medical schools in the

48
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,959
United States. And the study was only

49
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,919
for the United States and it should be

50
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,439
repeated in other countries and should

51
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:29,159
also include veterary medicine schools

52
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:33,519
as well. And so in the summer of

53
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:35,719
2013, we called 157 medical schools and

54
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,200
asked the directors of the

55
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:42,359
curriculum three questions.

56
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:45,598
Do you have a department of

57
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,400
endocanabonoid science with a director?

58
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:52,878
Are you teaching the ECS as an organized

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,640
course or is it even mentioned in any

60
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:58,759
ancillary courses like pharmarmacology

61
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,878
uh pathophysiology

62
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:04,919
neuroanatomy and the answer was only 13%

63
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,158
of American

64
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,399
universities teaching physicians even

65
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:15,039
mentioned the

66
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:18,439
ECS. So this is a a science that is is

67
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:22,239
completely ignored by the medical

68
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:24,439
facilities and uh it's kind of like your

69
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,920
doctor not knowing the circulatory

70
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:30,400
system or

71
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:34,079
the nervous system or or any of its

72
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,280
other major components. And so the ECS

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,480
is a master control system that

74
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,680
regulates all

75
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:47,039
physiology. Um and

76
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,760
uh should be included in all medical

77
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,959
schools and

78
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:55,280
and you will find out that many times

79
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,840
the patients know more about this

80
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:03,158
science than the doctors do. And so my

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,239
study was was made entirely to

82
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:08,759
expose the hypocrisy of not teaching

83
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,280
this science to

84
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,840
physicians.

85
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,199
And so please obtain a copy of this.

86
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:21,840
It's printed in uh Cannabis Digest

87
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:25,680
uh under ignorance is not bliss.

88
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,839
And uh what we what we did was we we

89
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,600
called these

90
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,519
uh colleges and asked for the director

91
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,520
of the

92
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:37,039
curriculum and what they were teaching

93
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:39,918
uh medical students. And uh we found out

94
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,400
a lot of resistance to our survey. I

95
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,799
would call up and say, "Hi, this is Dr.

96
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,839
David Allen. Can I speak to the director

97
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,160
of the curriculum?" And they would say,

98
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,560
"What's this about?" And I would I would

99
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,960
tell them. and they they would be

100
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,879
astounded because many of them had no

101
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,519
knowledge of what what I was speaking

102
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:03,120
of. And so they were suspicious and and

103
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,959
were reluctant to give us any answers at

104
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,079
all. And so we changed our

105
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:12,799
tactics and uh when my employees would

106
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,079
call up, we would pretend that we were

107
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,879
medical students or premedical students

108
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:22,000
looking for universities to apply to

109
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,478
that would have a special uh knowledge

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,439
in this new

111
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:29,758
science. And so that worked pretty well.

112
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:34,399
And we started getting a lot of answers

113
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:36,960
from the medical schools and and uh the

114
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:42,638
employees of the

115
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,638
uh director of the curriculum. And we

116
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,519
found that a lot of their their

117
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,879
statements showed extreme ignorance of

118
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:55,120
this uh study and and like why would we

119
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,120
teach this kind of science? This is a

120
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,959
medical school. Why are you asking these

121
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,439
kind of

122
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:04,159
questions? And so, uh, please read the

123
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,639
article. It it has a lot of statements

124
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,960
that we collected from the medical

125
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,720
schools

126
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:14,560
themselves. And,

127
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,800
um, so

128
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,639
can I can I give can I give a can I give

129
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,720
a quick cliff notes on just what you've

130
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,160
said so far because you're getting into

131
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,840
you're you're almost at results. So what

132
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,080
uh this article really the sort of

133
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,679
cliffnotes of it is number one the

134
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,560
significance of the endocanam

135
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,400
cannabonoid signaling system um it's

136
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,000
considered a crucial medical discovery

137
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,159
likened to the advent of sterile

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,399
surgical techniques. It acts as a master

139
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,039
control system which of course Dr. Allen

140
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,279
just uh mentioned preventing disease and

141
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,199
combating aging by managing physiology

142
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,679
cellular communication and scavenging

143
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,240
oxygen free radicals. Then we get into

144
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,000
the medical potential. The ECS has vast

145
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,840
therapeutic potential, particularly

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,560
through cannabis, which could really

147
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:01,038
shift medicine from symptom management

148
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,199
to disease prevention. It's implicated

149
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,918
in reducing diabetes, stroke damage,

150
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,038
heart attack scars, heart attack scars,

151
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,719
and combating cancer via tumor growth

152
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:13,199
inhibition, reducing metastasis, and

153
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,120
induction of apoptosis, which all of

154
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,680
these things are keywords that you can

155
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,319
go punch in and learn about. Next, we've

156
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,959
got his survey methodology. He went to

157
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,199
contact the curriculum directors at 157

158
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,279
US medical schools asking about the ECS

159
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,639
department organized courses or mentions

160
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,719
in related classes and

161
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,960
immediately receives initial resistance

162
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,440
which led them to posing as prospective

163
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,120
students to gather responses more

164
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,918
effectively. The fact that they even had

165
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,800
to do this and then next resistance and

166
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,879
ignorance. Responses ranged from how do

167
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,240
you spell

168
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,478
endocanabonoid to dismiss? We don't

169
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,120
teach anything like that. Many schools

170
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:55,038
showed unawareness or reluctance which

171
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,360
sometimes questioning with some

172
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,120
questioning the surveys intent. Now

173
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,960
we're getting into the results and I'll

174
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:07,280
let Dr. Allen continue.

175
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:10,878
So our our survey study uh proved that

176
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:13,318
only 13% of American medical schools

177
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,039
even mention this

178
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:19,720
uh science and nobody has organized

179
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:24,439
courses. There's no directors or

180
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:27,879
departments of this science.

181
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:31,360
And so

182
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:34,320
uh one mistake that I made is after we

183
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,800
did completed the study, we mailed

184
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,039
copies of the studies to the directors

185
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,639
of the

186
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:43,639
curriculum, which didn't have the effect

187
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:47,838
I wanted it to have. I should have uh

188
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:51,199
mailed the the copies of this article to

189
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,600
the dean of the medical school which

190
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,080
would have more impetus in changing the

191
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,600
curriculum to include this in their

192
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,160
future

193
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,360
uh studies.

194
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:08,639
So

195
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,120
um this is exposing the ignorance of the

196
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,159
medical school which is which was caused

197
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,839
no doubt from the drug

198
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:20,039
war. So the drug war is trying to

199
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:23,959
suppress this science and

200
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:28,159
so my entire life has been to try to

201
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:31,759
expose the medical efficacy of cannabis.

202
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:33,838
And it's it's fairly hard to do because

203
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,399
uh there's no place that you can

204
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,399
actually

205
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:42,559
uh publish studies anymore regarding

206
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:45,759
this. So this study needs to be repeated

207
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:48,719
uh in Canada, in South America and in

208
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:52,720
Europe and should include

209
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,839
uh veterary medical schools and my

210
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:00,480
suspicion is the veterary medical

211
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:03,600
schools will have more knowledge

212
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,278
uh and and they will be teaching this

213
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,120
this science more so than than the human

214
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:13,039
medical schools. due to the political

215
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,959
repression basically. Exactly. Yeah.

216
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,919
Which the article argues these political

217
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,239
barriers, not scientific merit. So we're

218
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,719
getting into this dangerous thing where

219
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,200
it's like something other than

220
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,120
scientific merit is being responsible

221
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
for the restriction of the ECS and

222
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
cannabis research. Obviously, the

223
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,879
government's classification of cannabis

224
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,160
as a schedule one drug creates a catch

225
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:39,120
22 which limits studying that could

226
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,799
prove its safety and efficacy. So, how

227
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,799
about some positive exceptions from the

228
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,799
article?

229
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,958
Well, a couple of schools mentioned that

230
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,079
they were doing some studies and

231
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:55,000
research and and uh would would include

232
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,799
this in in their future lectures and

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,639
stuff, but

234
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:05,359
uh so uh we're hopeful that uh that this

235
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,199
study that I've done and I just did this

236
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,759
with three employees, so this study

237
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,920
could be repeated and and will show that

238
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:17,679
this is a science that's worthy of

239
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:22,319
doctors and veterary medicine doctors to

240
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:26,639
learn about. And uh so that's my that's

241
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,519
my impetus. That's my motivation is to

242
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,639
have doctors learn about this so they

243
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,159
know more than the than the the patients

244
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,958
that are coming to them

245
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:41,600
uh with questions about this science. So

246
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,759
it's a call to action, right? The study

247
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,159
urges medical schools to integrate ECS

248
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,720
education, comparing its neglect to

249
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:51,120
historical resistance against sterile

250
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,160
techniques. It suggests public pressure

251
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,000
on deans to adopt this science. If you

252
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,319
want to reach out to Dr. Allen and

253
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,958
myself, please do so. You can reach out

254
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,959
to me at

255
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,720
bcbubblemanicloud.com. And I believe Dr.

256
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,879
Allen is

257
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,278
cali215gmail.com. Did I get that right?

258
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:14,278
Yeah.

259
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:14,278
ci215 docgmail.com.

260
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:21,278
I'd be glad to answer any questions you

261
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:25,360
have regarding this science. And uh you

262
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:28,838
know cannabis and is a neutrautical that

263
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:32,720
should be in the diet of all humans and

264
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:36,200
animals. And maybe even more important

265
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:40,278
than that, it's a metabolic

266
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:43,440
necessity and maybe even a metabolic

267
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:45,000
imperative because they proven if you

268
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,560
block this

269
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,278
ECS that sperm cannot enter the OBM. So

270
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:57,039
you need a a functioning ECS for

271
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,360
conception to occur. So without a proper

272
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,799
functioning

273
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:07,120
ECS, conception won't occur and may be

274
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:10,799
responsible for many uh uh women not

275
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:14,000
being able to full-term birth a child.

276
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,319
So this has great implications and

277
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,720
should you should put this cannabis and

278
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:23,360
hemp in your diet. And actually hemp may

279
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,399
be more important

280
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:30,480
uh a medical substance to be put in your

281
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:34,000
diet than even marijuana.

282
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,560
Yes. While breast milk contains both uh

283
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,799
uh endockinabonoids and essential uh

284
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,638
amino acids and hemp is pretty much

285
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,838
cannabis is the only plant that produces

286
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,278
all of the essential amino acids uh

287
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,519
including the three that children

288
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,000
require for organ and bone development

289
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,120
as well as phytoinabonoids. So it's

290
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,679
almost this breastlike milk substance

291
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,440
that cannabis produces in two of its

292
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,239
forms. And I'm glad you hit on the

293
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,680
broader implications because cannabis is

294
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,639
framed as a neutrautical with

295
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,679
antioxidant benefits, not just a

296
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,799
pharmaceutical. And it could potentially

297
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,319
revolutionize medicine towards

298
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,559
prevention. You know, you Dr. Allen

299
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,959
questions why ECS study is suppressed,

300
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:18,159
linking it to funding and political

301
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:21,359
interest, which I don't think is a very,

302
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:24,000
you know, big jump. I think it's

303
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,440
probably very accurate. Um, maybe we

304
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,759
want to finish off with some of the

305
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,360
historical parallels uh that your

306
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,120
article references.

307
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:38,120
Okay. Well, there was a a doctor in

308
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:41,600
Vienna who was an OB/GYN doctor. And

309
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:44,000
um they had two hospitals that delivered

310
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,879
children at in Vienna, a doctor's

311
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,519
hospital and a midwife's hospital. and

312
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:56,078
the doctor's hospital had a uh massive

313
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:59,360
death rate for for birthing children and

314
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:03,519
the the midwives hospital had much

315
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:08,320
better results and so Dr. Sema Wise was

316
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,320
uh doing an operation an autopsy on a

317
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:15,240
a woman that had died during her child

318
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,959
birth. And what happened was his

319
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,360
assistant got a they were opening the

320
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:24,638
abdomen and the abdomen was full of pus.

321
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,919
It's called purplal fever and was the

322
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,879
cause of death for many women. And so

323
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:34,559
when his assistant cut his hand two days

324
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:36,799
later he died of sepsis of the same

325
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,278
thing that the woman had died from. So

326
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,958
Dr. She knew that there was something in

327
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:48,480
the pus that caused this reaction and

328
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:52,838
killed his assistant. And so he started

329
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:57,199
uh scrubbing his hands with uh

330
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,600
uh caroxyic acid I believe and it was

331
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:04,240
costic and it caused people's hands to

332
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:07,278
be red and inflamed. But uh he proved

333
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:11,680
that by handwashing that they lowered

334
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:14,720
the infection rate in surgery. And so

335
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:18,078
that's this was before microscopes and

336
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,680
nobody knew about germs. So this was

337
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:23,039
before germ theory. And so he was

338
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,719
washing his hands and he was trying to

339
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,799
get the other doctors to wash their

340
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,800
hands and they all objected to it

341
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,078
because it wasn't

342
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:34,758
uh known science at the time. and they

343
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,319
actually ran him out of town because of

344
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:40,079
this. And

345
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:43,680
so just suggesting that you should wash

346
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:47,198
your hands before surgery was a new and

347
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,120
radical idea and was rejected by the

348
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:52,399
medical

349
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:55,839
establishment. And so today the medical

350
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:59,198
establishment is ignoring the science of

351
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,959
the endocanabonoid signaling system. And

352
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:06,159
so we're trying to get people to

353
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:07,720
understand that this is this is a super

354
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,558
important

355
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:15,038
science and we want everybody to learn

356
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:17,558
about this because it can affect you and

357
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:22,480
the family, the people in your

358
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:25,918
family. So uh please look at our other

359
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,038
uh studies we've published on uh

360
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,919
cannabis and heart attacks. showing it

361
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:33,319
that it decreases the size of a a heart

362
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,360
attack by

363
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:39,759
66%. Another article we reviewed proves

364
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,399
that it it decreases the size of a

365
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:46,240
stroke by

366
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:49,360
50%. And so this is amazing information

367
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,919
that could save the lives in people in

368
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,159
your own families if you learn about it.

369
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,120
And you want to know what the world did

370
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,440
to Dr. Ignes Semlowise? It wasn't just

371
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,079
the medical establishment denying and

372
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,120
ridiculing and mocking him for washing

373
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:09,439
his hands, if you can imagine. But in

374
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:12,558
1865, the increasingly outspoken Seml

375
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,519
Weiss allegedly suffered a nervous

376
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:18,720
breakdown and was committed to an asylum

377
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,879
by his colleagues. Now, what happened in

378
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,400
that asylum is he was beaten by the

379
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:28,799
guards very badly. He died 14 days later

380
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,440
from a gang greenish wound on his right

381
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:35,359
hand that was probably caused by the

382
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:39,038
beating. How insane is that? The guy who

383
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:42,319
brought handwashing to just save lives

384
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:44,558
ends up getting probably falsely accused

385
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,240
of a mental breakdown by his colleagues

386
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,918
cuz they loved to do that back in the

387
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,679
day when people stepped out of line.

388
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,880
Forget about destroying your life. We're

389
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,798
just going to put you in a mental

390
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,720
hospital. And then in the mental

391
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,200
hospital, they damn near beat him to

392
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,759
death. And then he ends up gangrinous.

393
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,279
And his hand, the very thing that he

394
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:05,519
learned to wash to reduce this type of

395
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:08,480
fever, is what kills him. It's so sick.

396
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,879
And it almost parallels the way Dr.

397
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,679
Allen was treated when he came out just

398
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,480
asking if they even taught about this

399
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,480
process. So you can see we're dealing

400
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,079
with a very unique group of people who

401
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,038
are not willing to hear uh what is being

402
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:28,480
said sometimes so much so that they'll

403
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:30,400
take it to the most extreme level. Uh

404
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,120
and that's what happened unfortunately

405
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,160
to Ignas Semawis.

406
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:38,159
That almost happened to me as well. Of

407
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,480
course it did. Of course it did. So

408
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,400
listen, the call to action is if you

409
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,558
think you can help, we are going to be

410
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,519
organizing this program again in the

411
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:49,519
near future. We're going to uh acquire a

412
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,839
bunch of interns, hopefully people that

413
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,079
are in veterinarian and in the medical

414
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,079
world in some way, shape or form and

415
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,079
we're going to kind of build a team up

416
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,839
and we're going to start calling these

417
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,519
uh hospitals again and these medical

418
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,119
schools. And what we'll do is we'll make

419
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,798
sure, I guess, that we create a really

420
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,959
proper template to approach them so that

421
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,798
they don't get the claws and the and the

422
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,960
fangs out. You kind of got to come at

423
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,839
them from the side angle like Dr. Allen

424
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,600
did. If you come at them too direct, uh

425
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,399
you could end up in a mental hospital

426
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:22,558
being beaten to

427
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,640
death. And that, my friends, is Cannabis

428
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,079
Journal Club. Anything else to add, Dr.

429
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,600
Allen?

430
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:32,639
Thank you so much for this uh for this

431
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:36,798
platform that we could spread this news.

432
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,440
Uh we want interns to help us because if

433
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:43,119
you help us do another study in Canada

434
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,960
or or South America, your name will go

435
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:49,959
on a paper that will be that will make

436
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,759
history. You could have your name on in

437
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:57,360
history by exposing that this science is

438
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:59,759
not being taught to physicians and we'll

439
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,759
find out if veterary medicine doctors

440
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:06,960
learn more about this than the than

441
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:09,200
their human doctor counterparts.

442
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Awesome. So, thank you, Bubble Man.

443
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,038
Yeah. Well, thank you. I love doing this

444
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,120
project with you and I'm looking forward

445
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:18,079
to staying more consistent and releasing

446
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,319
at least one of these videos uh a week.

447
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,158
Uh and I guess for that we'll see you

448
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,839
all next week on the Cannabis Journal

449
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,600
Club. Thanks for watching. Thanks for

450
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,759
your support. And if you can give a

451
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,678
little thumbs up on the video and a

452
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,079
subscription, uh of course we would

453
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,080
appreciate that as well. Thanks

454
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,079
everybody.
