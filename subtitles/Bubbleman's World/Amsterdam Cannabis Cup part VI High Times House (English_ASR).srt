good buddy of mine. I live in I was

172
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,480
wondering that actually cuz when you

173
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,759
said you were living in Eugene, there's

174
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,519
only so many [ __ ] heads living in

175
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,360
Eugene. He lived like two blocks away

176
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,080
from me and he would always buy his weed

177
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,120
from me. That's cool. How about uh

178

happening with that guy? I don't I have

182
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,278
no idea. I just I just remember he was

183
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,519
Yeah, he did. I want to know if he's

184
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,759
still alive even. He must be. I hope he

185
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,600
he is. Philip Hoffman. Yep. There you

186
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:50,319
go. I met him in like 96 or 97 when I

187
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,759
was in Vancouver and he was I think he

188
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,040
had also just gotten busted or

189
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,559
something. Yeah, he had big time

190
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,000
trouble. Yeah, he had some trouble.

191
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,479
Plus, he was kind of crazy. He came up

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,039
to Vancouver and was running away. I met

193
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,039
Seuss in

194
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,480
19 now 1990. I met Seuss at a rainbow

195
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,880
gathering in Florida. Okay. And we got

196
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,278
to be friends. And he was an amazing

197
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,720
carver, artist, right? And he said,

198
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:21,838
"Look, I can carve you a piece of pipe

199
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:24,000
stone into an amazing pipe." So, he had

200
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,600
this raw piece of pipe stone. Nice. We

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,399
were at the Rainbow Gathering, the red

202
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,200
pipe stone, and he started carving it.

203
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,720
He started carving this pipe. And it was

204
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,440
an eagle's

205
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,360
claw holding the bowl, the bowl. Mhm.

206
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,720
And then another friend of mine who I

207
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,720
just got back in touch with, he

208
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,480
beaded around the pipe. Really nice bead

209
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,440
work. Nice. And it was one of the

210
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,240
choicest bowls I ever had. And Seuss

211
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,399
made it. Wow. And so we became friends

212
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,799
after he made that pipe and I traded him

213
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,278
for it. And then I was we were in

214
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:02,399
Florida and I was having all this

215
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:04,639
problems with cannabis bus, you know,

216
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,399
activists and everything. And and he

217
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:07,600
says,

218
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,759
"Look, why don't you just come out to

219
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,079
Oregon sometime, you know, come out to

220
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:15,078
the West Coast?" Nice. He goes, "I got a

221
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:18,879
great place up in the mountains. I got

222
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:20,559
like uh diesel gas generators and I make

223
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,039
my own electricity and I got a couple of

224
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,199
really nice brooms and you know I'll

225
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,319
share some genetics with you and stuff

226
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,278
like all right. So I [ __ ] drove

227
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,720
across the country with my

228
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,240
girlfriend went to his place. I had a

229
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,079
camper, you know, so I didn't need a

230
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,720
place to stay. I just needed a place to

231
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:41,639
park. He let me park on his land. I

232
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,800
started helping him with a few crops.

233
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:47,278
Um, and then I eventually got my own

234
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,199
place in Eugene. So, I moved out away

235
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,200
from his place. Oh, yeah. And I made my

236
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,079
own grow room. And then I started

237
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,240
getting He had some really nice genetics

238
00:11:54,078 --> 00:12:00,879
like the um the uh uh big skunk Korean.

239
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,079
Okay. I got from him. Wow. The one I

240
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:08,439
started breeding with. It's going a

241
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:11,278
while back. I got from him. Nice. And so

242
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,920
um after I after I moved away, I lived

243
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,320
in Eugene for five years. And in those

244
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,958
five years, most of the that time I was

245
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,600
friends with him. And then after about

246
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,479
four years, he wigged and he like made

247
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,000
me like his enemy, which I never was.

248
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Terrible. And uh is that after he got

249
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,480
busted? Maybe he got all he he was very

250
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,959
schizophrenic, right? Yeah. He was super

251
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,000
talented. Yep. He was super cool with

252
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:39,919
his birds. Mhm. He [ __ ] grew some

253
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,559
great ass weed man and and uh but he was

254
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,479
also an egoomaniac. When I met him, he

255
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,919
had a a picture book full of those

256
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,680
parrots and like pictures of his

257
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,599
property and stuff. And it was kind of

258
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,278
like all of that was the past for him

259
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,600
now. And he was kind of carrying it

260
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,200
around in this in this book. And that's

261
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,040
kind of how we met him though. Made you

262
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,200
made me think. Barge became really good

263
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,039
friends with him. Yes. Barge became

264
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,720
really good friends with with Seuss for

265
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,120
quite a few years. They were uh they

266
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,920
were very close. So Seuss had some good

267
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,039
talents, boy. He was just a crazy guy,

268
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:13,919
man. And and and he like he loved to

269
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,319
blame other people for [ __ ] Oh yeah.

270
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,919
Classic. Oh, I've been guilty of it

271
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,278
myself.

272
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,278
$30,000. Oh my god.

273
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,278
Nice, man.

274
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,399
Nice. All right. Well, we're going to

275
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,799
see you tomorrow and we're going to make

276
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,240
some uh some candy. Did you smoke out of

277
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,278
it? Oh, yeah. Of course. I have it.

278
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,200
We'll come out, smoke out of it

279
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,958
tomorrow. You must be good at You must

280
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,160
be great at cleaning pipes. Yeah, I'm

281
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:42,479
pretty good at cleaning. What do you

282
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:44,078
use? Um, ISO 99%. Yeah, I use ISO, too.

283
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,600
So, what time are you thinking? I also

284
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,199
have friends that are glass blowers and

285
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,000
I can kill them and it just burns away

286
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,759
all the That's nice. Kill. It's not 99%.

287
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,839
70. 70 works. Yeah, it's hard to get 99%

288
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,679
stuff works pretty good. That's like

289
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,839
hydrochloric acid. Yeah, but it's really

290
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,919
expensive. We're uh we're going to come

291
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,240
back tomorrow and watch you make your uh

292
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,689
candy. Cool. Sound good? Nice. Awesome,

Did you see him shake the Joe Peters out

301
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,159

Tarpin. What do you have to say about

305
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,720
that? I I I had faith he wasn't going to

306
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,838
drop it. This mic. Oh, I knew he wasn't

307
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,160
going to drop it for a moment. This mic.

308
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,920
He's not that guy. I'm just chilling.

know. I got to find out. I'll call you.

bubble in the straight
