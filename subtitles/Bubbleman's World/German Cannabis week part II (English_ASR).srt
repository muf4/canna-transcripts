00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,199
full moon session party yesterday so not

40
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,780
very often that I open up my pupco or my

41
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,598
Carta and it's dirty I'm very obsessed

42
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,479
with keeping it extremely clean so let's

43
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,780
hope I brought

44
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,780
my uh

45
00:02:55,699 --> 00:03:02,399

everything right and you get everything

97
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,779
