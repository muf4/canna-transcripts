132
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,120
know I mean I'm sure if I really looked

133
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,418
around I could probably find something

134
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,978
and make it work but you know what the

135

emails heating up and we're about to get

136
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:25,759

137
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,560

yes it's very soon to talk I'm just

144

waiting for the email to get up over 500

145
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,639
degrees and once it is well you know I'm

146

of money well like you know that kind of

149
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:51,899
money that that person owes you and that

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,479
you see them around shopping for a new

151
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:56,339

205
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:29,730
Bob malla Mead says to us when he

206
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:32,910
explains the law of thermodynamics and

207
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,500
far from equilibrium theories very cool

208
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:38,309
stuff if you haven't heard it I do

209
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,720
implore you to go check out dr. Bob I'll

210
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:41,189

216
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,300
YouTube channel fairly easily and it is

217
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:55,710
the weekend Wow we got one more week and

218
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:57,539
bake for the week and then we got hashed

219
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,339
Church I'm excited for hashed Church

220
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:01,199
we've had a couple of good ones in the

221
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,300
last couple of weeks and we're just

222
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,240
gonna kind of try and keep it going as

223
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:08,399
much as we can my drop down was made by

224
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,120
Corey Cottenham and you can check him

225
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,329
out at Corey glass KO r ey underscore

226
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,669
GLA SS on instagram I'm pretty sure

227
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,620
that's his Instagram but I'm sure if you

228
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:24,088
punch in Corey glass or Corey Cottenham

229
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:25,889
it will pop up yeah what's the oldest

230
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:31,080
hash you still have probably my 10 year

231
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:33,838
10 years pretty old pretty old batch um

232
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,089
no not not as it yet we don't sell the

233
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,089
this is actually more than a poster it's

234
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:41,250
actually quite like almost like a thick

235
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:42,930
advertising I can't remember what they

236
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,450
would call it but we could definitely

237
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:47,039
sell it it wouldn't be cheap I mean just

238
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:50,520
to have that printed off I think is a

239
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,929
hundred bucks so but it's not poster

240
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,429
material it's you know that material

241
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:55,859
that's weatherproof and you can put it

242
00:11:53,429 --> 00:12:01,079
outside it's not canvas that's some type

243
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:02,610
of a nylon or something that's a banner

244
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,200
I think we should hit one more bowl

245
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,730
before I have to bugger off because I

246
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,759
can promise you today's got to be a

247
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:10,889
short one focused on the children of

248
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:12,330
course and for those of you that wonder

249
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:14,519
and think that here I am just getting

250
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,200
stoned what I'm actually doing is I'm

251
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,909
medicating for the morning I'm getting

252
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,740
my medication on it's gonna help me with

253
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:22,049
my focus it's gonna help me with minor

254
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,190
pains that I have in my body and it's

255
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:25,439
gonna help feed my endocannabinoids

256
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,740
system in a way that will allow my cells

257
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,770
to communicate with one and

258
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,299
and keep my body happy healthy and my

259
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:32,949
two main systems to the immune system

260
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:35,259
and the central nervous system in

261
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:39,070
homeostasis and the importance of this

262
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:41,409
is should never be underestimated

263
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,180
keeping these systems in homeostasis is

264
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:45,100
extremely important and when you have

265
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:47,289
someone who's an alcoholic pill-popping

266
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,269
maniac telling you that you're the drug

267
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:50,860
user burning your brain cells while

268
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:54,100
they're actually damaging their brain

269
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,980
physically with alcohol and other

270
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,259
substances you gotta wonder what kind of

271
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,080
a topsy-turvy world we've been born into

272
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:04,240
that the whole world has flipped Thank

273
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,620
You Shelly Lynne I will stay i rien you

274
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,330
as well hey right on true well no it's

275
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,159
not about a judgement it's about a

276
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,629
conversation and a dialogue that we

277
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,850
opened because it's very important that

278
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:17,409
people don't catch a whit glimpse of

279
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,379
this video and think oh my god that man

280
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:23,049
is he's getting high on drugs while he's

281
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:25,299
know what he's doing is he's medicating

282
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:26,740
on a little bit of cannabis and it's

283
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:29,049
very different than getting high on

284
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,180
drugs and we've got a long way to go

285
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:35,199
still on places in the wisk

286
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:37,719
west coast it's very much accepted the

287
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,149
cannabis use but let's be honest in a

288
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,129
lot of other places it still isn't if

289
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:44,589
you're following Shona Banda story she's

290
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:47,588
in court right now I believe it's in

291
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:49,660
Missouri having a hard time so anything

292
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:52,120
you can go do to support her if you want

293
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:55,028
a googol Shona band a fundraiser now she

294
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,289
is raising money for her Court and we're

295
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:57,879
gonna try and have her on hash Church

296
00:13:56,289 --> 00:14:01,208
again maybe raise some more money for

297
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:02,769
her I did send the other 350 US dollars

298
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,028
that we raised through hash Church it

299
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:06,909
was actually a couple hundred but I

300
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:09,039
threw 150 in there myself plus the 300

301
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:11,289
from prior so that was six hundred and

302
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,689
fifty dollars that hashed Church donated

303
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:15,759
to forest heard and the khalad rias

304
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,470
Network and it made me feel good it

305
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,958
wasn't a huge amount but it was a lot

306
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:22,480
you know in a sense that you guys really

307
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:24,009
pushed that boundary we'd never raised

308
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,720
money like that before so I want to

309

00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,559
spend the whole day focused on the

325
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,519
little guy and all the things that he

326
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,518
loves and needs and wants

327
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:57,059
dean al just keeps delivering well

328
00:15:54,149 --> 00:16:00,328
drying tips you know it's not going to

329
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:02,489
dry properly if you have it in large

330
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:05,008
chunks the smaller the pieces the powder

331
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:08,009
the dust the better this will get you

332
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:11,490
dry if you're in a environment that is

333
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:13,699
very humid like the west coast and you

334
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,870
get a high amount of precipitation a

335
00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:17,938
desiccant is going to be important

336
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,470
I used the pizza boxes they close they

337
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:21,088
keep dust and debris in hairs from

338
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,939
falling they keep people from knocking

339
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:25,769
[ __ ] over I can stack them on top of one

340
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:27,389
another and the cardboard acts as a

341
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:29,610
desiccant and pulls moisture out with

342
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:31,198
the help of gravity from the hash it

343
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:35,188
really is one of the best ways to go

344
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:37,649
about doing it and it's it is what it is

345
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:39,328
well don't get pizza boxes with weird

346
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:41,519
coatings I just go to the like

347
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:42,750
healthiest pizza box pizza store I can

348
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,459
go to the place that sells the

349
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,889
whole-wheat the gluten free the blah

350
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:49,138
blah blah vegan broccoli pizza if you

351
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:50,690
have a pizza place like that go there

352
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,329
and get your boxes not to fight

353
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:56,750
dominoes or to [ __ ] Pizza Hut or any

354
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:58,250
of these other swag dumps you know go to

355
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,589
a good pizzeria somewhere that you

356
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,528
actually enjoy eating at and you'll find

357
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:05,419
that you probably will get a pretty

358
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:07,759
decent box what was the last Phish show

359
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:11,120
that I attended you know that's crazy

360
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:14,390
that I don't even really know it I don't

361
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:17,058
know if it was 9 999 in Vancouver or if

362
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:20,630
I ended up going to some shows and 2000

363
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:25,578
I must have done some 2000 shows but I

364
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:27,709
really really don't remember yeah the

365
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:29,629
good fiber exactly well it's not the

366
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:33,529
quality of the fiber it's just that you

367
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,669
don't want any chemicals to have been

368
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:36,470
sprayed in there and that's always the

369
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:39,169
problem right there's always chemicals

370
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,019
ah good to hear man shale that means

371

00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,109
years that you just had stacks of

373
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:49,279

378
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:01,788
record I got to get going

379
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:04,519
I got priorities in these in the shape

380
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:05,929
of my progeny my young almost three year

381

have a wonderful day keep keeping on

384
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:14,359
keep learning about cannabis keep

385
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,980
sharing information about cannabis we

386
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,689
have to normalize this so people don't

387
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,360
look at us like we're miscreants like

388
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:22,640
we're you know the the lowest of the low

389
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:25,129
were not in fact quite opposite we're

390
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,600
here to help people who have elements

391
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,010
and people who are sick and people that

392
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:30,558
don't know they have an endocannabinoid

393
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:32,390
system just from us getting into herb

394
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,038
and enjoying it and smoking weed and

395
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,590
listening to records and feeling that

396
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:38,480
vibe that's what brought us to wanting

397
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:40,369
to help people we didn't go and take

398
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,788
degrees at school and learn to become

399
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:46,009
doctors or any of that we just you know

400
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:47,710
I'll take the word from dank runner we

401
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:50,390
just stewarded this plant

402
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:52,940
we've stewarded this plant to where it

403
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:56,320
is and everyone should be proud of that

404
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:59,960
for sure because you fought against the

405
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:01,939
the main stream society and what they

406
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,548
said and thought should be

407
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,460
and we fought it and it's now entering

408
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:09,019
mainstream society and I think that the

409
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,929
world's gonna be a better place before

410
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:13,700
because of it so if you won today please

411
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:16,129
send me an email at BC bubble man at

412
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,960
icloud.com I will be trying to send out

413
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:19,878
the bottles today I went to send them

414
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,740
out the other day I had a backpack full

415
00:19:19,878 --> 00:19:24,019
and I got on my motorcycle and I went

416
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,169
down to the post office and an old

417
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:28,940
friend of mine was there hanging out by

418
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:30,230
his car and he was like hey mark and I

419
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,788
kind of looked over and I didn't

420
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,190
recognize him he says do you remember me

421
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:36,648
and I was like no and I got about 10

422
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,808
feet closer and I was like oh man holy

423
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:40,878
[ __ ] I haven't seen you in years

424
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:42,769
and so he was visiting a friend of his

425
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:44,269
here in my neighborhood and he

426
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:45,950
introduced me to him so I ended up going

427
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:48,548
over to his place having a nice time

428
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:51,080
meeting some really nice people and

429
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:53,599
because of it I didn't send all of your

430
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:55,099
DC glass cleaners instead I went and I

431
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,808
met some new people and had some new

432
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:58,519
conversations so I know you guys

433
00:19:56,808 --> 00:20:02,990
understand and I appreciate you for it

434
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:05,269
those bottles will be coming out soon

435
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,849

436
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:10,609
tuning in and watching give it a like if

437
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:12,349

438
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,758

439

442
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,190
cleaner and I guess I'll leave you as I

443
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:24,109
always do with a special special wish

444
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,659
