or 50 days I was going to be giving away

84
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:45,819
one of Dana Larson's books I guess I'll

88
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,370
old partners but he's offered to give

89
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,109
away a bunch of those books the only

90
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,730
problem is the reason I didn't give one

91
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,350
away today is because I went to my

92

93

he's going to be shipping it he's going

94
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:05,530
to be signing it but I want it to still

and then have to see who won I kind of

164
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:20,529
like to get it given away prior but I'm

165
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,530
not saying that I wouldn't consider it

166
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:33,020
Tommy chunk is amazing I just don't have

167
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:35,839
a relationship with him that way

168
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:40,598
I'm not quite sure that I would have the

169
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,598
ability to get him going that same way

170
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:47,348
yummy

171
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,960
do you like bubble caps you'll have to

172
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:57,229
be a little bit more what kind of bubble

173
00:07:53,959 --> 00:08:03,620
cap are you referring to what is this

174
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:04,699
bubble cap you are Bon Apetit we have an

175
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,519
episode of hashed Church about the

176
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,528
annual cannabinoid system yeah I'd

177
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,939
probably have to invite some people that

178
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:14,538
are a lot more knowledgeable on me

179
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:17,329
perhaps at the doctor Bob or a David

180
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:19,338
Allen I'm always wanting to link with

181
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:21,109
these guys by the way it's not easy I

182
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:22,310
invite David Allen on to hash Church

183
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,750
weekly

184
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,399
he doesn't have the connections he

185
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,158
doesn't have the proper computer to come

186
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:30,829
on and actually be a part of it dr. Bob

187
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:32,360
himself even comes in on a phone which

188
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:36,038
is always a little bit rough oh did we

189
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:42,168
lose the video did we lose the video I

190
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:44,149
think we did lose the video ah okay

191
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:45,740
we're back not sure why we lost the

192
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:49,549
video the connection says it's solid on

193
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,919
my part hope everyone's doing well okay

194
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:53,929
good good good yes I always want to make

195
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,750
sure that I'm not wasting my time and

196
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:59,328
talking to nobody what screen should I

197
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,009
but should I press - umm stick with

198
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:02,659
Terps I would say get some screens that

199
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:04,458
would allow you to clean the kief I

200
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:06,409
think the real valuable lesson is in

201
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:08,000
learning how to clean that sift and not

202
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:10,669
taking the lazy man's way out and

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,620
pressing it into Ross and now don't get

204
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:14,599
I love rosin and it's wonderful and it's

205
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,450
fun but don't you think you should have

206
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,460
some of that sift cleaned to a 99.9%

207
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:24,770
degree so you can actually understand

208
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,330
what the quality of that is oh the

209
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:27,740
bubble cap for the thermal Bangor I

210
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,660
don't personally have one but I've hit

211
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,100
it I like it I think thermal bangers are

212
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:33,289
pretty cool I could see myself getting

213
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,990
one in the near future but I'm not gonna

214
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:37,730
run out and try to get to get one any

215
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,090
time soon we'll see if it comes to me

216
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:43,460
we'll see what happens I don't think

217
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:45,320
that's bad Geordi your system you know

218
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,330
keep in mind the endocannabinoid system

219
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,950
regulates biological functions and

220
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,780
taking a [ __ ] and eating are both

221
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,129
biological functions so the fact that

222
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:54,350
you're regulating them with cannabis

223
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:58,090
isn't overly surprising I wouldn't feel

224
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:00,830
too bad about it the real worry would be

225
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:02,690
potentially being away from cannabis and

226
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,400
affecting your day by not being able to

227
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,670
stimulate your appetite and your bowels

228
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,829
I would suggest taking orally cannabis

229
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:11,659
extract in a coconut oil or something

230
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,850
that is easier on your system but you

231
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:16,219
can take daily and micro doses building

232
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,620
up to larger doses not necessarily for

233
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,779
the effects but for this system

234
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,419
regulation that's going to be a little

235
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:26,809
bit more above and beyond maybe what you

236
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:29,360
get from a DAB or a puff so always good

237
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:31,429
to cover both bases puffing is great it

238
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,850
got us where we are today but I think

239
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:37,459
that it's very important to know thank

240
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,840
you melty heads just got your your shot

241
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,120
of course we'll give you a shout out

242
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,269
Scott Dunlop is in the room I want

243
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,129

246
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:51,409
happy to give people shout outs we're

247
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:52,819
not here to bust on people's balls we

248
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:54,860
might have a little bit of comedy here

249
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,410
and there and sometimes my sarcastic dry

250
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,570
humor might offend you but you know what

251
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:01,189
shout out to Scott Dunlop and I hope

252
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,390
you're having a great day dude I hope

253
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,770
you're having a great day you got a

254
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:05,299
hundred and forty-three people all

255
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:08,539
thinking about you all giving you the

256
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:08,899
what's up Scott dizzle what's up what it

257
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:11,449
is

258
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:13,429
Scott wish it is that's just nice you

259
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,990
know this is all we want this is the

260
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:17,809
connection that people are looking for

261
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,879
they want to be seen they want to be

262
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:21,278
heard and they want to be loved we all

263
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,838
have that in common

264
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,448
it's interesting that the guy who would

265
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:28,509
connect us through this interweb of

266
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:29,639
connectivity Steve Jobs just happens to

267
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:31,419
be the person who is the most

268
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,909
disconnected or was the most

269
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:35,860
disconnected from his actual family from

270
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:38,198
his parents giving him up for adoption

271
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,850
right up to him you know in his own

272
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,919
words in his books not really

273
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,420
recognizing the importance of spending

274
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,399
time with his children towards the end

275
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:47,860
of his life and just making some bad

276
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,480
decisions it's so strange that he would

277
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,999
be the person that would set up this

278
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,188
link that everyone would connect through

279
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:56,980
on these computers and phones and in the

280
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:59,649
meantime he was unable to create true

281
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,110
meaningful relationships outside of

282
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:04,208
outside of work hey what's going on big

283
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,459
squirrel nuts I love to say hi to big

284
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:09,849
squirrel nuts mostly just for his name

285
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:12,068
alone but the avatar also shows a dude

286
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,050
that I think I would get along with I

287
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:16,568
picture me in big squirrel nuts having a

288
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:18,429
blast sitting by a fire doing some dabs

289
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:24,188
and beheading off on some bikes

290
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:26,828
afterwards motorized ones of course yeah

291
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:28,778
yeah that's true Sal hello from San

292

saludos saludos Scott that's deep job

294
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,169
was the only one link in the chain of

295
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,230
thousands who made the things and did

296
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:40,000
the work yeah I'll tell ya squirrel

297
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,308
testicles KTM footage there's a little

298
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,049
bit of KTM footage on my website here

299
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:47,679
YouTube you can go check it out I think

300
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:50,469
one of the videos is called I don't know

301
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,179
if I named it Broome Ridge I'll have to

302
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,790
go back and if you punch in KTM

303
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:56,349
dirtbiking bubble man into Google you

304
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:58,568
should come up with the videos that I

305
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,040
have up there okay this may be kind of a

306
00:12:58,568 --> 00:13:01,479
dumb question but if bubble doesn't turn

307
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:03,068
out as clean as I want it what is the

308
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,778
best way to go about cleaning it can you

309
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:07,058
use screens or just press it to rosin

310
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:09,208
okay so I'm not sure if what you're

311
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:13,419
talking about is actually cleanliness or

312
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:15,909
quality because sometimes the quality is

313
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:18,938
not there and so even when you purify it

314
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:21,458
to 99.9% heads it might come across as

315
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:23,379
dirty or not clean when really it's as

316
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,958
clean as clean can be but the quality is

317
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:27,938
not there now there's the other side of

318
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:31,239
the coin where the actual cleanliness

319
00:13:27,938 --> 00:13:32,948
has not been achieved but that's rare

320
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,528
especially if its water hash because

321
00:13:32,948 --> 00:13:36,688
water makes this almost

322
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:39,600
like a no-brainer everything syncs

323
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:41,879
everything floats heads syncing

324
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,159
everything else floating creating a

325
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:47,220
transfer chamber of sorts that really

326
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:49,078
allows for almost even a monkey to be

327
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,579
able to mix up a batch I could come

328
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,308
along and pull the bags and they would

329
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:54,659
be isolated down near to 99.9% now of

330
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:57,539
course there are mistakes that you could

331
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:59,039
make you could use too little of ice you

332
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:02,188
could over mix you could beat dry

333
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:04,230
material into powder and have the little

334
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:06,838
pieces not have the proper amount of

335
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,449
surface area that would allow for it to

336
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,100
float in water and it'll be affected by

337
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:13,109
gravity and sink and contaminate your

338
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,100
final product but those are two very

339
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,199
different things

340
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,209
Oh is Jordan not being being a good dude

341
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:22,019
or what for a million dollars would you

342
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:24,748
do a porno yeah we'll put him in a put

343
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,909
him in a timeout there for a second all

344
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:29,040
right so yeah that's kind of the

345
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:31,169
difference right there bubble hash water

346
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,698
hash is almost a no-brainer it's going

347
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:34,498
to make a very clean product for you

348
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:37,469
purity is what you're looking for with

349
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:39,990
bubble hash dirtiness can be cleaned

350
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,660
over screens you could rerun it through

351
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,629
the bags and float it in water there

352
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:46,980
must have been a reason that you I have

353
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:48,930
tried CBD crystals

354
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:53,459
do you like crystalline I like the idea

355
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:55,979
that crystalline in masoom purity when I

356
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,149
see a crystalline structure I'm not sure

357
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,129
why the people who are growing the

358
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:01,169
really beautiful crystals of CBD and THC

359
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:03,209
are smashing them into powder because

360
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:04,769
once it's into the powder of course

361
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,750
we've seen a variety of different colors

362
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:09,269
some are almost yellow some is like

363
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,458
white white white I'd like to see it in

364
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:14,519
the in the crystals just because it

365
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:15,838
implies purity hello good morning Sun

366
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,419
grown trichome hope you're having a

367
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,490
great day blended in first set of bubble

368
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:23,909
bags in high school oh my god sir smokes

369
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,889
a lot oh I had a few of those let me

370
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:27,480
tell you just blending and then pouring

371
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:30,089
the soup through and they're wondering

372
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,519
what did I do wrong and then also maybe

373
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,720
not the best material to you know it's

374
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,519
because I'll tell you the people who

375
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,439
have the best material their

376
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,269
consciousness is already at a level

377
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:39,750
where they know not to throw that into a

378
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,850
blender

379
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:44,580
and zip it all up you know what I mean

380
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:47,279
that's more like the fear and scarcity

381
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,570
mentality of I don't want to lose any

382
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,370
and in the beginning when people were

383
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,110
first putting their material into water

384
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,269
and I second I can assure you they were

385
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,360
tripping out they didn't think it was

386
00:15:54,269 --> 00:16:00,029
real and they thought I'm gonna lose a

387
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,980
lot so they would over mix you know some

388
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:04,319
guys actually got an outboard motor like

389
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,820
an electric trolling motor to mix their

390
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,280
material up with just turned it into

391
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,690
soup definitely not the good idea I

392
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,579
could do it with a spoon and a lot of

393
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,920
ice and get just as beautiful of an

394
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:17,970
extraction from both my yields and of

395
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,889
course my purity dabbing on reclaim that

396
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:23,879
sounds wonderful

397
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:25,500
I bet you were luster bird imagine how I

398
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:28,980
felt the first time I threw eight ounces

399
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,379
of dry sift into into one any tips

400
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,000
running 20 gallon bags well you know 20

401
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:35,250
gallon bags that's a lot of water I

402
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,799
usually when I run 20 gallon bags I run

403
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,419
multiple sets of 20 gallon bags I love

404
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,399
having all the bags inside of one

405
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:44,069
another I mix in the machines but I also

406
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,259
use an all screen 220 bubble now bag I

407
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,820
put a lot of ice to make sure that the

408
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:49,500
temperature has been achieved that's one

409
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,520
of the most important factors ice ice

410
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,710
ice and more ice

411
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,860
it usually melts in the mixture and as

412
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:57,420
long as you're hearing that crushing of

413
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,440
ice you know that the that it's

414
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:03,779
happening proper mixing trim versus

415
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,220
mixing bud is very different as you get

416
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:10,309
larger amounts of bud or plant matter

417
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:13,019
into larger amounts of water you have to

418
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:16,438
really be careful that you're achieving

419
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:19,199
your sweet spot in your threshing ratios

420
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,600
you want the threshing to be perfection

421
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,310
so the amount of water versus the amount

422
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,019
of plant matter and the plant matter

423
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,789
variables are going to matter whether

424
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:29,009
they're thick strong buds whether

425
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:32,399
they're loose tiny little sugar leaves

426
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:34,200
or a mixture of the two those these are

427
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,269
more things that are very difficult to

428
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,809
teach and to put into words because they

429
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:41,759
change much the same way you know when

430
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,500
we drive the resin and depending on

431
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,750
where you are if you're in Arizona or if

432
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,089
you're in Washington those are two very

433
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,730
different places once dry and arid and

434
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:52,459
ones wet and humid and so drying the

435
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,589
hash is going to be different and then

436
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,110
in between those two differences are

437
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:58,669
also very little bits and changes so you

438
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:01,250
can see there's certain things in the

439
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:03,230
water hashing process that it's kind of

440
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,630
like you have to learn by making little

441
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:08,960
mistakes and how you do it as you either

442
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:10,790
go past or go under and then get closer

443
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,710
and closer and closer you hone in on

444
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:15,470
that sweet spot that is going to be

445
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,090
sitting in between your two points but

446
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,549
I'm not exactly sure where it will be

447
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:21,379
sitting in between your two points so

448
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:22,759
there's that I think that was some

449
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,370
pretty good information right there

450
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:27,349
definitely you know that's the problem

451
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:29,419
with people trying to give advice on

452
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:32,240
this hash making thing there are a few

453
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,310
points where you can take the basics but

454
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,140
once you get to the few points you you

455
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:39,619
have to really go and make your own

456
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:41,390
mistakes right on Mitchell O'Brien glad

457
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,859
you're using those bags what's your

458
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,240
weight for 20 gallons I usually run nine

459
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:45,769
hundred to a thousand grams after the

460
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,670
machine seems to be slowing yeah nine

461
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:50,059
hundred grams

462
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:54,110
dry through four thousand plus grams

463
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:55,789
fresh frozen and it's just all about

464
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:58,429
your thrashing how long you thrash for

465
00:18:55,789 --> 00:19:00,529
you know we don't Thresh trim as long as

466
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,390
we try Thresh bud four trim is very

467
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:04,819
quick and I can wash trim in one to

468
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,920
three minutes one to three minute wash

469
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:08,659
is on really tightly grown oh geez or

470
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,100
cookies is not going to give you your

471
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,259
yield you might get a really small

472
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:15,019
percentage of something awesome but I'm

473
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:17,720
more inclined to get the majority of my

474
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:20,869
yield in the highest purity that I can

475
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,559
in my first batch I don't want to be you

476
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:25,939
know going back and forth and having to

477
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,889
run the material three or four times

478
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,559
that's not efficient that's why you

479
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,509
don't over stack your bags if you over

480
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,240
stack your bags the heads aren't able to

481
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:37,819
fall they get captured in the material

482
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,339
that's plugging up the hole and then you

483
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:45,289
have to re wash multiple times to get

484
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:47,289
all the resin out you can use a couple

485
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:52,069
of like a half pound dry in that

486
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:54,049
5-gallon bubble washing machine paint

487
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:55,279
stirrer is too aggressive yeah area if

488
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:57,259
you really have to do something like

489
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,539
that even a little cake mixer with the

490
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:02,240
two little pieces I made fire bubble

491
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:04,869
with those four years nowadays I use the

492
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,170
spoon because I can really get around

493
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:10,539
everything and then of course the bubble

494
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:12,850
now once I saw the washing machines and

495
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:15,129
how well they spin I loved the fact that

496
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:17,230
they spin everything to the left and

497
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,600
then they spin everything to the right

498
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,460
and they just continue to do that and

499
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:25,209
that's a really good process of having

500
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,769
it go one way stop and go the other way

501
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,350
I'm certain that there's an enormous

502
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:31,269
amount of resin loss and falling

503
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:34,179
happening in that process of where it

504
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:34,839
turns and stops and then starts going

505
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,460
the other way

506
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:38,740
there's going to be some sort of force

507
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,250
that has felt in there and of course the

508
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,109
ice

509
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,819
smashing back and forth and the

510
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:45,729
glandular trichomes head's being

511
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:48,639
extremely brittle and cold it's pretty

512
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:51,579
sweet pretty sweet

513
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,160
well we gave a bottle away of dc-8

514
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:55,659
cleaner as it was made in Canada thought

515
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,340
that would be a real easy question today

516
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,140
so I will get that off to you melty

517
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,789
heads thank you for sending me your

518
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,520
address I now have like four or five

519
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:05,470
packages once again that I need to go

520
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,480
send up so I'm probably gonna go deal

521
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,610
with this now maybe gonna put the boat

522
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,380
in the water today I got it all off a

523
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:13,119
little bit of interior work needs to be

524
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,790
done hopefully my son can get down there

525
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:18,879
and clean it but otherwise everyone have

526
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:21,940
a great day if I go live from the boat

527
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,750
later I will see you then otherwise can

528
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,549
you talk about the difference between

529
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,679
all the bad companies bum bags bolt ice

530
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:29,259
track well bolt and ice strap extract

531
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:32,410
came after bubble bags I don't believe

532
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:33,879
they have paid for reinhardt's patent so

533
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,340
they would both be in the breach of

534
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,809
patents and then I don't really know how

535
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:39,730
much they've been teaching everyone how

536
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:41,678
to make bubble hash for the last

537
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,779
eighteen years I feel that I'm a little

538
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,640
bit higher on the podium but the

539
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:47,500
beautiful thing about being a customers

540
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,480
you yourselves get to choose who you

541
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,490
want to support if you do support me I

542
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,960
do appreciate it and if you don't I'll

543
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,730
still be here for you

544
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,890
when those companies are unable to offer

545
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,690
the same level of customer service that

546
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,820
I do and if you need a question answered

547
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:04,330
whether you got bolt bags or ice extract

548
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:06,189
bags or whoever's bags I'm happy to help

549
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:08,859
you out I just want people making more

550
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,019
water hash and up until the point that

551
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:12,699
it actually starts to affect my business

552
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:15,309
I'm not going to be too worried about it

553
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,620
so thank you everybody for the support

554
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:19,539

555
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:22,949
