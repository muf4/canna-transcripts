for 15 plus years we've both been I've

9
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,519
mean he's been at it longer than I have

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
uh growing cannabis and breeding and I

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,199
remember hearing about him when I first

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,320
came to BC in the early 90s uh when we

13
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:51,960
first linked up with Emory and uh

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,520
Hillary and all those guys at hemp BC

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,039
and I guess you yeah give give us a

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,600
little bit about your history man like

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,320
what uh well I've always been a fan of

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,439
the the Canabis plant uh for me it was

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,760
always about quality not about money it

20
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,599
was about how high I could get not about

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,799
how much money I could make although the

22
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:13,319
money came later yeah it seems when you

23
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,759
have the passion yes the passion I might

24
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,719
add that in my travels since I was 18

25
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,118
years old I've been to virtually every

26
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:23,200
major cannabis Center in the world

27
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:26,118
including uh katam Morocco balbec and

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,520
Lebanon uh mazari sheriff in Afghanistan

29
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:33,519
Northern Pakistan Kashmir Nepal Northern

30
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:37,199
Thailand and um Southern India all over

31
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:40,438
uh India for that matter um in search of

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,600
the best weed I could find and uh that's

33
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,478
awesome that is something that I know

34
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,839
for a fact right now that the the

35
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,799
viewers watching even I got goosebumps

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,680
when you said all those spots I haven't

37
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,479
myself even been to all those spots I

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,039
hope to one day say that I've been to

39
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,799
all the major you know cannabis and hash

40
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,920
producing countries in the world well

41
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:03,000
it's interesting because each one has

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,039
its unique profile and also the

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,639
environment in which you consume it uh

44
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:13,439
has an effect on how you feel um I I

45
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,318
came to learn that and then when the

46
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,959
world of hybridization came around the

47
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:23,000
possibilities were endless because we

48
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:26,759
could combine multiple strains or a few

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,159
or or any combination thereof and wind

50
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:32,120
up with another experience and uh we

51
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,039
keep going well here's a question for

52
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,959
you

53
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:38,400
um when in your collection like when you

54
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,920
were collecting a seeds in these

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,120
countries were you collecting initially

56
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,079
to grow for you and your friends or were

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,560
you right away initially thinking I'm

58
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,040
going to collect these and save them and

59
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,000
eventually one day I collected them

60
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:53,519
because I wanted to grow them and have

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,800
the best marijuana to smoke myself and

62
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,920
for my friends that was my sole purpose

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,879
I had no business interests at the time

64
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:05,039
time it was strictly from a I I hate you

65
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,560
use the word but a spiritual point of

66
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,359
view for me it always had a spiritual

67
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,598
aspect to it and for that reason uh the

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,680
higher I

69
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:18,199
got the less businesslike I

70
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,680
became um it was only later on when I

71
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,119
hooked up with people that were more

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,760
business-minded

73
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,280
uh to get that part of it together but

74
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:27,919
uh well and thank God that they did

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,840
really because you know you say it like

76
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,479
it's a bad word but at the same time the

77
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,560
business end of it is how the people

78
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,759
gained access to your strengths exactly

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,799
and the but because of my nature uh I

80
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,359
hear you I wasn't that type of guy no

81
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,760
you know what that's why when we came

82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,360
together I think almost 12 years ago and

83
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,798
we made our first batch of bubble

84
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,920
together which we're going to share some

85
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,760
photos in this video of when the doc and

86
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:52,479
I got together this was kind of a

87
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,438
special time we got together to make

88
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:58,238
this I mean he brought a pound or two of

89
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,359
this beautiful Bud all different

90
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,280
varieties and he was like let's run well

91
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,159
it would particularly it was the

92
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,799
blueberry Northern Lights we made a 73

93
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:11,479
Micron golf ball or a little bigger yeah

94
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,640
uh it was absolutely full melt beauty

95
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,759
that I brought to Nepal to Shiva ratri

96
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,639
to Shiva ratri which is shiva's birthday

97
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,720
for the that for those of you that don't

98
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,879
know it's like Bubba Woodstock okay well

99
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,639
puffer Central this was in N 2002 and

100
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:31,360
yes if you went 30 years younger than

101
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,519
that to 1970 to I was actually smuggling

102
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,639
hash from Nepal to Canada but this was

103
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:39,279
before there was an indoor grow scene so

104
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,800
30 years later years later I'm bringing

105
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:45,879
it back to Nepal awesome and offering it

106
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,759
to these shites to these holy men and

107
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,879
saying here I I created this in a room

108
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,840
with no windows with high press sodium

109
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:57,000
lights and then I threw the product in

110
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:59,198
ice water and mixed it up and here's the

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,720
result and they looked at me kind of

112
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,720
dumb sounded like are you

113
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,320
crazy I know the look well and then my

114
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,680
American friend in Nepal happened to

115
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,079
have a double bubbler and I said here

116
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,439
why don't you try this out of a double

117
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:15,639
bubbler and throw that mediocre hash

118
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,279
with the cheap tobac that was Mark who I

119
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,400

even in the shite cave yes and I you

128
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,879
were in the cave I was said to them here

129
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,360
were all these high level Babas and

130
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,319
their bells and Beads and orange and

131
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,720
dreadlocks and and people kissing their

132
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,520
feet and I was the new Shaman came to

133
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,600
town yeah with the medicine with a

134

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,120
yeah it wasn't your first

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,120
rodeo no I love the fact that

138
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,720
simultaneously while the doc was blowing

139
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,840
Minds with the Babas in in Nepal in

140
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,360
Katmandu I was in Jamaica during the

141
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:21,318
exact same time in February and it was

142
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,840
Bob Marley's birthday bash and I had

143
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,319
some of that same beautiful I call it

144
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,918
the stained glass window I didn't get

145
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,919
the ball I got a different piece that

146
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,839
was quite thin and really nice full melt

147
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:36,560
and it was literally blowing Minds at

148
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:38,359
the Bob Marley bash in St St ANS in

149
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,680
Jamaica but for me it was one of the

150
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,000
most fulfilling things of my life to

151
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,680
have these highlevel Babas taking them

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,038
to a new level with full melting glass

153
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,000
comparing it to mediocre hash and Cheap

154
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:56,560
Tobacco there was just no comparison and

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,079
they were amazed and and continue to be

156
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,879
and for me that was very fulfilling in

157
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,680
spite of the risks I took bringing it

158
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,560
there yeah crazy risks one day we'll

159
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,240
look back when this plant is legal all

160
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,918
over the world and we're able to access

161
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,280
it and travel with it that um that there

162
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:12,598
should have never been those risks in

163
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,198
the first place I just want to say this

164
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,000
is the first time I've ever been on

165
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:20,000
camera and the reason being I'm now a

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,439
medical exempt as my friend Marcus we're

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,598
legal in here in Canada to produce and

168
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:30,439
consume cannabis and for me it's kind of

169
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:33,399
like after 40 Years of a

170
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:36,319
paranoia coming out and being real and

171
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:38,359
saying there's a real person yeah Behind

172
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,759
These seen and I can attest this is the

173
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,158
Dr Atomic the one and only Dr Atomic

174
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,680

back we just took a little break there

181
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,199
we threw the herb into these containers

182
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,960
that the dock brought over you want to

183
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,520
tell us a little bit about this herb

184
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:06,079
these are just a mixture of the current

185
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,399
line um just the little nugs on the

186
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:11,000
bottom the ones that are you know kind

187
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,399
of a pain to uh the current line as in

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,319
the current seeds that are currently

189
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,918
available oh yes the current seeds are

190
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,919
current these are seedless there is some

191
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,639
seeds in here I have used some of that

192
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,799
but it's it's basically a

193
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:28,400
blend excuse me um it's sure dank I know

194
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,520
it's very perfumey um one of the main

195
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:35,319
characteristics of the sativas train is

196
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:37,199
it's Citrus it's it's lemon fru yeah

197
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,680

198
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:45,278
more of a skunky uh AR yes U this I've

199
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:48,199
always been a uh a fan of sativas there

200
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:52,200
I find them more exciting more uplifting

201
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,640
capable of um doing things uh not being

202
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,440
couch locked my favorite you know lying

203
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,078
around watching horror movies which has

204
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,120
its place um but on a beautiful day like

205
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:02,439

way absolutely so what we got here is a

208
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,559
blend we call I guess we call it an

209
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,399
atomic blend uh my good friend Mark here

210
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,799
we're we're going to process this I'm

211
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,440
going to use this a lot personally for

212
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:19,359
my own medical um

213
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,920
requirements um like I was saying before

214
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,959
this is the first time I've been on

215
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:27,639
camera ever uh because I'm now legal I'm

216
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:30,039
a medical exempt here in Canada under

217
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,559
federal law as is marked so

218
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,278
here it is we are We Are Who We Are yeah

219
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,039
we have the safety to be able to share

220
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:38,799
the information and the knowledge and

221
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,679
the experiences that we've had now that

222
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,599
it's getting to this point and I we were

223
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,000
talking off camera just before filming

224
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,200
this and you know the doc was kind of

225
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,320
like oh uh I never I don't I don't ever

226
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,278
do that I was just like well you don't

227
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,079
have to by any means but just remember

228
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:57,759
like you know you you are Dr Atomic and

229
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:58,838
it's nice to let the sort of people out

230
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,519
there that have been breeding your

231
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,880
strains and are growing your strains and

232
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,959
using these medically and recreationally

233
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:09,078
for their own selves for decades

234
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,479
literally I just have to say that you

235
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:14,078
guys out there the ones that have sent

236
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,600
me emails and uh said how good the

237
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:19,159
result was I want to thank you all and

238
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,759
that means a lot to me it means as much

239
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:24,039
as making the money that we all need to

240
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,639
survive but that's another matter what

241
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:29,559
matters to me is having as good a

242
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,600
cannabis in terms of seeds that I would

243
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:35,078
want to grow myself I wouldn't send you

244
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:39,399
any less and uh that's my mission and

245
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:41,399
now that it's legal I'm here this is me

246
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,399
I don't have to put a George Bush mask

247
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,879
on or anything like that exactly thank

248
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,240
God for that I'm in the same boat you

249
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,519
know for years I didn't show my face and

250
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,519
uh it was unfortunate that we sort of

251
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,320
it's one more part of prohibition

252
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,480
hindrance of change and of the you know

253
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,000
to keep prohibition locked in what

254
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,759
better way than to have the people that

255
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,200
are trying to move prohibition out of

256
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:09,000
power have them have to hide themselves

257
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,879
have them have to be secretive have them

258
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,240
have to be you know non- trustworthy and

259
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,879
worried about interacting with certain

260
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,639
people or with with strangers you know I

261
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,519
feel super good nowadays that when

262
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,000
strangers approach me and they're like

263
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,278
hey bubble man I saw you on YouTube or

264
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,919
whatever that I don't I don't have any

265
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:28,000
negative thoughts I don't wonder like oh

266
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,799
my God I wonder if this is like an

267
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,360
undercover I wonder if this person said

268
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:33,919
to like I don't have those feelings

269
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,720
anymore well it reminds me of a a lyrics

270
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,719
and a song by Peter Tosh where it says

271
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,839
there ain't no need to smoke and hide

272
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,920
because you're taking a legal right and

273
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,079
now we are taking a legal right it's a

274
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:48,879
legal right for us to have this medicine

275
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:51,159
which we are going to convert for you

276
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,679
I'll smoke to that right in front of you

277
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,958
we are we've got a good little uh you

278
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,638
know what when the dog called me and

279
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:58,199
said he had some more U herb that he

280
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,440
wanted to process and it had been so

281
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,879
long since the last time we did it and I

282
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,600
said well what do you want to do how do

283
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:05,240
you want to go about it and he said well

284
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,200
all all of it you know like let's dry

285
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,079
sift and wet wash and coconut oil let's

286
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,079
do everything so this video is basically

287
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:16,559
going to be showing uh dry sifting wet

288
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,278
washing and uh coconut oil extraction so

289
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,919
I guess we're going to start with uh the

290
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:22,039
dry sifting because I've got the screens

291
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,719
literally sitting right here in front of

292
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:26,838
me um these are the new screens they're

293
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,680
still not up on the website

294
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:34,160
unfortunately these are 2T X 1T

295
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:35,638
and they are a 90 and a 60 line per inch

296
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,159
and I'm showing this to the doc for the

297
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,759
first time this is a little dry sift

298
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,159
trick that we learned uh online over at

299
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,559
IC magag

300
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,639
originally and basically what it is is

301
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,759
the screens are much larger than our

302
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,799
regular dry siting screens so those

303
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,480
screen numbers that I read off were mesh

304
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,679
90 and 60 or lines per inch but in

305
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,159
Micron uh which you'll understand better

306
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,719
this top screen is a

307
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,639
250 and this bottom screen is a 188 80

308
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,278
so those are very big holes for dry

309
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:06,480
sifting generally we might dry sift with

310
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,919
a 150 and then card over a 70 which is

311
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,120
very counterintuitive to this process

312
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,639
what this process is is a trick it's a

313
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,399
real quick cool trick to access a real

314
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,120
high percentage of glands uh outside of

315
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,240
the contaminant so what we do is we take

316
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,720
a little bit of this herb we just throw

317
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,240
it across the screen being as gentle as

318
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,199
we can we don't want to really this is

319
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,720
It's counterintuitive to be rough with

320
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:31,519
this particular process and and so what

321
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,199
happens is is everything's going to fall

322
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,639
and there's this quarter of an inch or

323
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:38,120
half an inch Gap and the things that

324
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,320
fall on this screen get lodged in the

325
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,039
holes for whatever reason they get they

326
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,240
get lodged and I'll show all this with

327
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:45,919
the macro uh with the macro photograph

328
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,600
because I do have my camera back now and

329
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,759
I will be able to share macro

330
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,079
photographs and so it what's on the

331
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,759
bottom is a really high percentage of

332
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,519
gland heads so we figured we'd take some

333
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:59,519
of this high-grade doc Atomic material

334
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,839
sativa do a quick bounce make a little

335
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,480
bit of this dry sift have a rip or two

336
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,880
and then we're going to run a batch a

337
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,959
200 g dry batch in one of the new

338
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,198
prototype bags from Acme and we'll run

339
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,799
that through the bubble now and we'll

340
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,078
filter it through the eight bag kit

341
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,559
we'll come up with some beautiful bubble

342
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:19,638
hash so uh yeah I guess we'll get

343
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,879
started right away should I get started

344
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,720
with a rip do you feel like you need a

345
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,278
rip here yeah little medication little

346
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,519
medication all right well we'll do a

347
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:29,198
little Barb hit this is the uh Barb from

348
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:31,720
yesterday that I made the funny video of

349
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,679
it not

350
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,959
falling just being silly it is wild

351
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:38,159
though cuz you see that that's just

352
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,198
powder right it is I know so how does

353
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,519
that even I know it's amazing that's the

354
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,519
first time I've seen that it's not it's

355
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,240
not like stuck in chunks this isn't

356
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:52,480
pressed hash no it's powder

357
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,959
yes powder that tends to uh stick to

358
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,959
itself very

359
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,039
nicely and presses instantly

360
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,480
all right got the quartz all cleaned and

361
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,480
the mothership is this your first time

362
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,159
dabbing out of these kind of rigs or

363
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,440
what have you been exposed to this much

364
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:15,120
at all well I have been I'm I'm kind of

365
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,320
an old school joint guy um but I more

366
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,399
and more still a lot of young people

367
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,278
hitting joints though I mean the joint

368
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:25,000
is it's almost just the standard for

369
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:27,078
getting turned on to cannabis like yeah

370
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,879
you know this would be weird if this is

371
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:32,239
how you got turned on to cannabis

372
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,278
like it looks like it's going to take

373
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,799
off man yeah well you know what it's

374

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,880
line just well there's there's the lemon

419
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,600
thae which is the thae lights I mean I

420
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,679
call a little more lemony this time so

421
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,719
still the Highlights Highlights awesome

422
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,360
awesome yeah there's the atomic Haze

423
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:04,839
which is the Northern Light

424
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:06,959
and uh again Cambodian Tha sativas M

425
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:09,359
there's the Northern Lights the pure

426
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:15,038
Northern Lights which is a primarily an

427
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:18,479
Afghani it's about um 65 to 70% Afghani

428
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:21,319
the other is um sativa uh it's hard to

429
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,960
say it was the story of the Northern

430
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,839
Lights goes back to

431
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,240
the early 70s when hippies from

432
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,678
Afghanistan brought the seeds to the

433
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,319
Pacific North West and hybridize them

434
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,440
with the SAS of the day which back then

435
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:39,000
were

436
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,200
Colombian um probably Mexican Cambodian

437
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,839
yeah I was going to say those exact

438
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,519
three like either Thai Cambodian Mexican

439
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:47,319
or Colombian those were the sativas of

440
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,599
the day so those are the ones that were

441
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:51,678
bred uh into this that's basically what

442
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,038
the haze brothers were selling back then

443
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,038
yeah and I acquired it in the'80s and

444
00:18:54,038 --> 00:19:00,200
I've pretty much preserved it um in

445
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:02,879
the'80s the pure Northern yes that's

446
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,840
awesome you still have it yes that's so

447
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,640
cool I still have the mother I the

448
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:09,599
mother I currently have is about this

449
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,679
one's the dry 15 years old but it goes

450
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,399
directly back to those

451
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:19,000
lines these are the the same this whole

452
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,240
lot is a is a blend just like I said I I

453
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,640
took the bottom buds I took the Sugar

454
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:28,200
Leaf I took all the good stuff I got rid

455
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,120
of most of the stems uh ready for bubble

456
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,240
MS who dude I'm still can't believe get

457
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:37,319
over your Northern Lights from the 1980s

458
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,599
yeah well the line it's uh it got what

459
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:42,720
in my opinion and my opinion it's humble

460
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:45,119
of course uh um companies like centi

461
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,200
seed and uh Holland

462
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,599
have they're kind of washed out uh

463
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,558
they've had different breeders in and

464
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:55,480
out of there and it's very important

465
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:58,200
that what you decide to cross it with uh

466
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,159
which male you choose is very important

467
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,240
when it just becomes a business and

468
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:07,039
people are just working for money it's

469
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:10,079
less passion so less selection yeah it's

470
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,158
true it's the as profits go up Integrity

471
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,678
goes down I know but this is the fine

472
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,720
delicate this is The Balancing Act of

473
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:19,240
every successful company sure that

474
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,679
balances those two things yeah as long

475
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,120
as you recognize that it's there then

476
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,679
you can pay attention to not allowing uh

477
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:30,359
well having quality with integrity and

478
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,480
making money absolutely absolutely and

479
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:34,839
it's fuel yeah I mean it's generally

480
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,360
like I use my passion to fuel to create

481
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:38,240
something awesome and then when I create

482
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,519
something awesome then people have no

483
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,960
problem um paying for that awesome thing

484
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:44,440
that's right that's right so I guess uh

485
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,919
we should throw a little bit of Bud down

486
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,919
here yeah this is a I I must say a lot

487
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:52,440
of the times I barter uh for things that

488
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,159
I need and other people know how to do

489
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,240
and alra barter butd or seeds or clones

490
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:01,520
or whatever it may be for their

491
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:03,880
expertise yep and whatever it is over do

492
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,879
you need a

493
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:11,480
drywaller not presently but you never

494
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:13,079
know all right so we're going to take a

495
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,400
little bit of this which is really we

496
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,079
don't need to take too

497
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,759
much it's windy too right now the

498
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,558
camera's in the open door and it's kind

499
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:27,158
of one of those like real nice windy

500
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:29,158
summer days so I got to be uh careful as

501
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:32,480
to not one of the things when you're

502
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:35,400
producing really clean resin is to be

503
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,919
mindful of where the plant matter ends

504
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,640
up because just getting some on the edge

505
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,320
or the rim of your frame can later be

506
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,960
brushed by your arm onto the table and

507
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:48,480
right into your pure

508
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,000
glande

509
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,960
so yeah this is a kind of a real gentle

510
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,440
process you know probably the gentler

511
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,519
the better you could probably literally

512
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,919
throw it down and pick it up

513
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,720
and you can see all that contaminant

514
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,200
that got caught there hey on the screen

515
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,240
now that's not to say that all of that

516
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,240
is contaminant some of that is heads but

517
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,240
the good stuff will be right on the

518
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,519
bottom that'll be diamonds pure

519
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,798
heads you can kind of see it in the blue

520
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:21,679
of where it says go canu

521
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:25,000
okay but what I've got is uh I've got a

522
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,519
little brush we'll use to uh to brush it

523
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,880
up so actually why don't we just collect

524
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:33,158
that

525
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,159
call it the pure of the

526
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:44,918
pure very small

527
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:47,678
amount but it also came

528
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,799
instantly I'll have to photograph it to

529
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:54,840
see I can see some contaminant in

530
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:57,879
it let's throw this back over

531
00:22:54,839 --> 00:23:00,199
here and just kind of move some of this

532
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,159
into the corner

533
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,159
drop a few more

534
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,079
piles all

535
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:23,558
right pretty much learning with each

536
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:25,599
batch and each material you know there's

537
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:28,000
certain

538
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,199
things why you want to do what I did the

539
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,079
first time which was be Uber Uber gentle

540
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,319
and just see what you got you want to

541
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,119
see sometimes a certain strain might

542
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,558
rain resin like nothing you've ever seen

543
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,278
and the gentler the

544
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,480
better

545
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:43,759
um all right let's see what that gives

546
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,759
us

547
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,759
here so there's substantial amount more

548
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,278
this time I've just got a little

549
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:57,440
white piece of

550
00:23:52,278 --> 00:24:00,440
sheer paper that collects it quite

551
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
nicely

552
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,038
well I'd say there's a good dab right

553
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:12,599
there you ready for a

554
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:15,480
dab all right so just got done uh macro

555
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:17,839
photographing the first little bounce

556
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,558
which we got I don't know I'd say two

557
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:26,199
Hefty size dabs there yeah um the Purity

558
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:28,720
looked real good 90% gland heads I'd

559
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,759
say and uh yeah it's got a nice sticky

560
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,519
feel to it uh we didn't do the second uh

561
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,599
trick yet but I'll show uh we're going

562
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:39,079
to have a quick dab of this

563
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:40,319
each and uh here I'll actually load you

564
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:43,599
up

565
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:47,359
first with a nice little

566
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:49,519
dab all right don't worry about that

567
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,558
there you

568
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:57,319
go there you go

569
00:24:52,558 --> 00:25:00,240
lad some of that oh yeah it's melting up

570
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:05,119
nicely

571
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,120
M that's a unique uh

572
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:11,879
profile give her a little go nothing

573
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:15,319
like test testing uh some strains or the

574
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,159
quality of of what you've grown by hit

575
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:19,240
in full melt dry sift you know no

576
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,720
flavors lost it's only gained in the

577
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,720
purifying of the gland head

578
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:30,319
ratio

579
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:47,679
some nice flavors in there

580
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:57,240
yeah very fruity and full in the head

581
00:25:53,038 --> 00:26:00,079
yeah you yeah totally heady heady on a

582
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,880
multiple there's still plenty

583
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:07,079
left so with that little trick I'm going

584
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,679
to put the macro camera safely down here

585
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,199
the second part of the trick is that we

586
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:13,399
lift the first

587
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,278
screen and with the contaminant that's

588
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:19,319
sitting on the top we simply

589
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,079
flick the

590
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:25,158
screen about six times once in each

591
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:27,119
corner and once on the on the middle you

592
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:31,679
can do it as many or as little times as

593
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:34,719
you want and uh I actually did the big

594
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,159
one off camera my bad that's why there's

595
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:41,120
a little pile there now but you can see

596
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:43,480
that even more was acquired from our

597
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,639
little our little flick there in fact

598
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,120
that looks like some pretty decent

599
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,559
quality right there I did photograph um

600
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:53,479
this one here which is probably the same

601
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:55,038
quality I'll check up later but so this

602
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:59,519
is just another I'd say this is more

603
00:26:55,038 --> 00:27:02,240
like 60% heads but still very pure for

604
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,918
dry sift it's in it's as you get a

605
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,919
powerful lens or a microscope and you

606
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,840
get under dry SI into dry sifting you

607
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:12,120
realize how hard it is to make it really

608
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:15,439
pure and so this this is a fairly pure

609
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:21,798
product uh made fairly

610
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:25,759
easy so pass that trick on that's a good

611
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:28,679
one throw that back on

612
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:32,839
here um I guess what we're going to do

613
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:35,320
is I'm going to potentially dry sift the

614
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:39,000
rest not over these smaller screens but

615
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:41,000
I'll probably use um my larger screens

616
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,119
and I'll film that later but I think

617
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,919
right now what we're going to do is

618
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:47,439
we're going to get ready to run a batch

619
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,159
of this um dry material through the bags

620
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,278
and we'll get on that here I guess in

621
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,600
the next couple minutes you ready to

622
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:57,599
rock it or what yeah awesome all right

623
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,000
well all right guys welcome back to

624
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,959
Bubble man's World Doc and I are outside

625
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,240
in the uh I would say it's pretty warm

626
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,278
weather I'm surprised you still got the

627
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,960
wild Fiers Che yeah the wild fiber just

628
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,798
kind of bre yeah keeps you cool keeps me

629
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,600
cool so I got the original eight bag kit

630
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,679
here the same ones that I've been

631
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:18,199
running my uh my own personal out of

632
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,240
lately so I guess what we'll do first is

633
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,679
we'll line our bucket I have the water

634
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,640
chilling this is a good tip for those of

635
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,559
you that don't know about it um chill

636
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,000
your water my water is sitting over here

637
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:31,278
in a 5 gallon

638
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,759
bucket you can hear the ice there's a

639
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,558
bunch of beautiful ice in there just

640
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:37,558
keeping it nice and cold and uh the

641
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:40,879
colder the better for this process right

642
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:44,359
right colder the better so we're using

643
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,919
the old Tibetan Tibetan flag

644
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:50,079
colors when I hang my bubble bags it

645
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,080
reminds me of the Tibetan

646
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:57,319
Flags ah so tell us a well tell us

647
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,519
something cool it's a worthy thing to

648
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:04,720
remember the theet Flags yeah and the

649
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:08,159
heritage of theet absolutely and

650
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,159
uh so as

651
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,880
well a little bit of little bit of gummy

652
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:18,439
bubble stuff on are we using all the

653
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,399
bags today yeah absolutely oh yeah

654
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,960
that's a nice resin let's put that aside

655
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,599
for a little bit little bit just got

656
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,558
stuck on the inside of the bag I always

657
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,839
like to use all the bags I have to say

658
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,839
it's very rare that I won't use use them

659
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:33,798
all

660
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:36,798
um it just seemed to makes the most

661
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:39,119
sense to use them all and and figure out

662
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,798
what you're uh what you're dealing with

663
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,319
each time rather than assume that you

664
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,759
know what's going on better than the

665
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:47,879
bags and then just leave certain ones

666
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:49,519
out which uh people do which is fine if

667
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,799
they're happy with their final product

668
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:55,359
I'm not one to complain if you're if

669
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:58,639
you're bubble is melty and liquidy and

670
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,879
everyone loves it well awesome

671
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,519
you're doing things right or however you

672
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,039
need to be doing them

673
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:07,079
but still have to teach a certain way

674
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:10,079
when you have your own kind of way of

675
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:16,558
doing it right all right so we got our

676
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:16,558
25 45 73 and 90 in there next up is the

677

679
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,720
and uh I actually had uh my dog got

680

'90s this the 90 no no this one is 160

683
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:47,398
the black one is the 90 yeah 9 7390 then

684
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,640
the orange one is 120 red and green are

685
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:50,879
our sort of last two filter bags that

686
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,519
keep everything

687
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,679
clean um we are using material that did

688
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,480
get a bit powdered up so it's not full

689
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,038
nugget it was nugget but dried and so

690
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,798
there's some powder so we'll we'll make

691
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:05,960
sure we double up on our 220 which is

692
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:09,278
the main filter bag that the uh that the

693
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,798
all screen bag is made out of as well as

694
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,440
what this blue bag here is made out of

695
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,960
this screen and the one inside the

696
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,798
bubble now are the same size so we'll

697
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,440
double

698
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:21,480
up we got our bags ready for

699
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,440
filtering we've got

700
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,919

00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:32,799
Micron numbers

703
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,278
so that's ready and uh I'm going to grab

704
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:36,759

714
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,278
Dr Atomic has decided that he's going to

715
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:06,558
show us his technique of cloning today

716
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,000
we weren't able to get around to the

717
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,839
hash making that we were going to do

718
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,440
last time around but this time we were

719
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:12,918
going to do a little bit of cloning Tim

720
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,519
actually just got himself a couple of

721
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:16,639
cuts what do you got happen in there we

722
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,638
got the uh

723
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:23,599
Congo East Coast Sour

724
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:26,079
Diesel and the island sweet skunk nice

725
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,480
so and Doc is now I'm about to take

726
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:31,720
cuttings here from the Congo I've got an

727
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,360
NOA blade that's a 25% sharper for a

728
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:38,079
better cut nice so we want to go just

729
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:43,959
below uh below two notes Here sure get

730
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:46,960
the wood get off get those off into the

731
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,960
gel

732
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,199
dip

733
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,240
gel all

734
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,840
right and these are called rapid rooting

735
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,519
plugs by General Hydroponics they're

736
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:03,480
excellent I've had tremendous success

737
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,638
with them I just in there just that's a

738
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,240
nice Woody

739
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:10,558
clone yeah awesome you want the woodi

740
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,599
Clone you can for the fastest rooting a

741
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,839
soft I

742
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:18,199
agree so what you want to do is give it

743
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:21,079
no nitrogen for at least a week 10 days

744
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,919
before cloning right um the best thing

745
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:25,038
if you could flush it with plain water a

746
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,639
few times if when you're anticipating to

747
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:29,000
take CL strengthens up that bark a

748
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:31,719
little huh yes stiffens it up and makes

749
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,638
it Ro quicker well there's a great tip

750
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,558
getting tips from uh doc Atomic here on

751
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:38,678
Bubble lands World okay now we'll go for

752
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:40,519
another one here yeah anyone you want

753
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:42,360
absolutely anyone you want and you said

754
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:45,960
you like to get two nodes at least in on

755
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:47,119
that I I at least one at least one yeah

756
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,319
and so then the bottom one you're

757
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:50,359
cutting right off and that's where

758
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:52,439
you're opening up on the sides that's so

759
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:54,038
you don't have to do your slice yeah

760
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,360
well you just get more places for the

761
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:59,359
roots

762
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:03,599
to excellent this one

763
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:06,839
here so great to be uh sharing the Congo

764
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:09,639
yeah I'm stoked really am yeah dude

765
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:12,918
awesome it's [ __ ] it's a killer it's

766
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,039
beautiful yeah it's one of my favorites

767
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:17,799
but as we've been discussing people

768
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:19,159
think they own the world I think they do

769
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,960
yeah it's it's a good thing that they

770
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:22,440
don't because some people that don't

771
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,480
think they own the world shared this

772
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,159
with me and now with with the obvious

773
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,199
understanding that I'm sharing it yeah

774
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:31,960
I'm not not going to share it yeah and I

775
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:34,279
I I implore all of you out there who are

776
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,159
watching to share what you have you

777
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,119
might think that it's uh the value is

778
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,878
that only you have it but there is no

779
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,480
value in that I assure you you'll lose

780
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,759
the true value of having something

781
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,240
special and not being able to share it

782
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,800
with your friends because my friends

783
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,918
something unexpected happen something

784
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,919
will come back to you when you do things

785
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:55,559
selflessly absolutely absolutely it's

786
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,319
when you have

787
00:34:55,559 --> 00:35:01,000

my finger off with one of those [ __ ]

814
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,119
things well you you know they cut

815
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,679
through carpet man yeah exactly cut

816
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,160
through everything all right so you done

817
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:20,039
with Congo yep done with Congo all right

818
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:23,759
what is next up for the dock uh let's

819
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:25,199
see where was that that such a healthy

820
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,000
sweet skunk is that one right there

821
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,919
second one this one that's sweet skunk

822
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,719
yeah going to compare the feno abolutely

823
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,599
I'll give you a feno of that one sure

824
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:36,399
yeah I'd love to check out your feno of

825
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,640
sweet skunk and Congo do a compar yeah

826
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,838
exactly I'm I suspect they'd potentially

827
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:44,239
be the same but you never know you never

828
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:45,559
know oh yeah these ones are a little

829
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:47,519
harder to get Woody oh there's a nice

830
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:50,440
Woody one right here yeah were you

831
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:53,000
saying the Congo is is a little harder

832
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,440
to root than J um you know what I think

833
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
not so if you take these bigger woodier

834
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,559
Cuts but if you take the real small cut

835
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,480
that it definitely has the potential

836
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:03,719
that's going to be an amazing clone look

837
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,280
at that clone it's like a little sweet

838
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:07,838
skunk for the

839
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,839
win man it's such a beautiful day out

840
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:11,679
right now the birds are chirping the

841
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,400
Clones are getting cut and the genetics

842
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,000
are getting shared so really what a

843
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,400
better what a better way to spend the

844
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,760
day you know and some of these I'll work

845
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,960
into my line we'll see how they go and

846
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,680
perhaps you out there it can be yeah you

847
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,000
might be able to buy some like Northern

848
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:30,719
Lights Congo or some yeah that's that

849
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,318
sounds some Northern Congo pretty that

850
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:37,959
sounds pretty good yeah I'm down with it

851
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:37,960
oh wait a minute it's like my all

852
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:45,240
right got to be scientific now and label

853
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:47,599
label yeah definitely it's always best

854
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:49,318
to label before rather than after I say

855
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,880
you know do it while you're doing it

856
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:54,279
don't wait till after you've done it you

857
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,039
can definitely uh find yourself in a

858
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,400
situation where you're like oh what I'm

859
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,880
pretty sure that

860
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,519
was no but you lose credibility and then

861
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,039
yeah exactly what's the point it's

862
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,480
important for us to know the the names

863
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,920
of the strings I really like the idea of

864
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,519
even keeping like the little tags with

865
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,760
the little right around the bottom of

866
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:16,838
the stock it's like each individual

867
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,040
plant that way you know I folded the uh

868
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:22,639
tape over onto a toothpick and just kind

869
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:24,039
of yeah excellent exactly perfect yeah

870
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,279
all right we're back guys we're back

871
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:27,960
we're just continuing here with the uh

872
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,800
sweet skunk sweet skunk

873
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,280
I believe I have this but you never know

874
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,240
it could be a different fenel it'll be

875
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,319
interesting to grow it out C it's

876
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:37,559
certainly not one that's around so often

877
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:40,358
that you would pass it up when it came

878
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:42,519
by your plate no whether you had it or

879
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:44,239
not even when I heard that he had both

880
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:46,960
the sweet skunk and the konggo I also

881
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:49,159
thought should probably make sure that

882
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,079
there I have yet to bloom out either of

883
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:54,078
these however this sweet skunk I know

884
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,960
for 150% fact it is exactly the sweet

885
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,359
skunk because I've I've cleaned the

886
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:02,039
resin from it from uh from the great

887
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:04,239
Gardener getting some sweet

888
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,199
skunks some nice Wy strands this thing's

889
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,719
hella Woody but it's weird it might not

890
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:09,039
be tall enough if you cut it right at

891
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:11,598
the bottom maybe and then you can cut it

892
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:16,400
at the no not woody

893
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,400
enough let me see this

894
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:23,639
is he knows what he's doing he knows how

895
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,358
to do it you've been doing this a while

896
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:30,920
haven't you

897
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:34,759
yep owned a few Clon

898
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:36,159
beautiful let me get that in there oh

899
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,839
it's certainly a nice day of course you

900
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,719
can see the Clones here that we've taken

901
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:42,279
already have uh drooped over that's

902
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:44,598
because of the sun generally we wouldn't

903
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,000
do it in the wide open sun like this

904
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:47,760
we're doing it like this because it's a

905
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,519
nice atmosphere and we want to share and

906
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,640
do an educational video for you but

907
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,960
ideally if you can do this in your you

908
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:56,879
know in your controlled environment uh

909
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,079
you take the Clones you cut them they go

910
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,358
right into the

911
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:05,359
Dome and uh with the Mist that it keeps

912
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:09,719
them from from sagging over that's right

913
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:12,078
you want a high humidity environment

914
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:14,838
absolutely all right so we got sweet gun

915
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,039
yeah generally I I would put them under

916
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:20,358
fluorescent I'd use a warm an a cool for

917
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:23,039
a full spectrum of uh

918
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:25,159
light so that's the asteroid that's real

919
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,800
nice that's a sweet skunk is this a

920
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:30,559
different sweet skunk no it's the exact

921
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,480
same one oh um it's a clone from that

922
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:34,358
plant actually how about this East Coast

923
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,800
Sour Diesel yeah yeah you want that but

924
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:38,480
here grab it from here if you want a

925
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,800
nice Woody clone this is the mum that's

926
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,358
just the Clone that came off of this

927
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:46,318
plant right here okay and so this

928
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:49,119
actually came uh via uh row as

929
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:51,838
well all right

930
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,880
yeah quite a nice little oh yeah he took

931
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:56,159
one a nice Woody there's a nice Woody

932
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,680
one right there these were these are

933
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:00,078
really trippy in the sense that they're

934
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,639
super stretched out they're different

935
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,560
from you can tell the sweet skunks which

936
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:06,199
have so many nodes three four nodes just

937
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:09,358
in a short clone these ones are very

938
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:11,159
stretched out well it's it's a special

939
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,960
strain no doubt about it it's sativa

940
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:16,318
Heritage obviously it's making it

941
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,760
stretch like that yeah it's definitely

942
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:21,440
the leafes wouldn't give it away like

943
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,440
that but the the stretch certainly

944
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:30,880
does certainly

945
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:34,598
does soal sweet stunk East Coast Sour

946
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,599
Diesel nice to share

947
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,199
genetics there we go now we'll have to

948
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:46,159
have a bowl or two after this and tell

949
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:48,598
some good stories you've always got some

950
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:51,920
great stories okay let let me think up a

951
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:54,280
few to tell yes think up a few okay

952
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,240
something to do with cannabis maybe that

953
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:00,760
would be super

954
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:02,199
cool I really like this uh this plant

955
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,520
yeah it's very different from all my

956
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:06,239
other plants you know a lot of my plants

957
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:11,559
look like this we got we because their

958
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:13,879
sativa M um you know it's uh how have

959
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:15,880
you found this rooting wise have you um

960
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,480
it rooted really strong really yeah and

961
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,480
I've only cut it a few times like maybe

962
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:24,440
four or five root uh Cuts since I've had

963
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:27,639
it but it it it cut real nice and fast

964
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,318
rooted good within a week it had uh nice

965
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:32,598
healthy roots that

966
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:34,480
we're that we're ready to plant and you

967
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:36,920
can see the one plant that I've grown of

968
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,920
it which is you know I only took this

969
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,760
not very long ago have you have you seen

970
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,599
these

971
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,319
before um I have not seen those before

972
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:49,119
they look good though and and they've

973
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:52,800
apparently injected some something

974
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:55,680
Secret in oh really yeah that uh but

975
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,240
it's tree bark yeah it's very foamy yes

976
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:01,838
it has the ideal ratio of oxygen and and

977
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:03,479
water which is and and it's still sturdy

978
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:05,318
when you when you put the Clone in it's

979
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,039
not all loose like sometimes the pee

980
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:08,440
pucks are that's right you get into that

981
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,679
middle you want to put it in until it's

982
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,880
just snug you don't want to squish it

983
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:15,039
right sure you know that makes sense

984
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,400
that's a nice one no but that's already

985
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,480
been taken yeah he just cut it doesn't

986
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,440
mean you're not going to have one two

987
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:25,519
three four beautiful SES do you and it's

988
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:29,679
very Woody yes that's the main main the

989
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:29,679
main one that the plant

990
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:35,960
was all right that's it for diesel for

991
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,400
this Sour

992
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:41,480
Diesel I think you should look at maybe

993
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,119
some Bob would you look at some Bob

994
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,880
where's the Barb Barb do you have an

995
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:47,480
interest in Barb she's the Shish Berry

996
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,920
crossed with the Afghani or would you

997
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:54,159
rather go straight Afghani you go both

998
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,240
well bubble man in your wisdom in my

999
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:58,279
wisdom what is your opinion of the Barb

1000
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:00,479
well I love the Barb the Barb produces

1001
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,760
resin kind of unlike any other strain

1002
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,760
I've seen oh really yeah it just

1003
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,240
produces resin it's just a resin

1004
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:10,079
producer it's right there actually and

1005
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:13,318
how would would you put it the Inda

1006
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,160
sativa side it's a hybrid obviously yeah

1007
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:17,880
it's a hybrid you know it's definitely

1008
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:20,399
got that it's not what I would call an

1009
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,079
overwhelmingly Wicked Strong smoke but

1010
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,760
it's just super enjoyable the tpine

1011
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:28,039
profile is Loud meaning it's very very

1012
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,960
strong smelling and it's just an

1013

1023
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,799
it's great cuz I was about to cut these

1024
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:05,358
all down and it's so nice to see them go

1025
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,519
somewhere where they'll survive rather

1026
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:08,880
than uh get thrown into my compost pile

1027
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,719
are you going to really do that what do

1028
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,318
you mean like well yeah I usually cut

1029
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:14,879
them down I don't let them get too big

1030
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:16,599
right now they're a good size but like

1031
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,760
for instance this one is probably going

1032
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:20,440
to get cut down a little bit you know

1033
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:23,119
just keep I don't like to get them too

1034
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,519
tall what I mean you're going to kill

1035
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,720

00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:35,519
I cut them back I throw dozens of these

1039
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:39,079

Place yeah man of course that's awesome

1056

that is gratifying no because I mean I

1057
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,240
don't have strain so I wouldn't know in

1058
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,838
that sense but you know and we know that

1059

that Dome on there better to get them

1072
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,558
all than to not get them

1073

1074
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:19,318
there is the

1075
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:21,760
Dome actually I really have my eye on

1076
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:26,079
Mark I can't lie

1077
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,520
is nice yeah that's great yeah I'm glad

1078
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,039
I'm glad you have it

1079
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,559
make sure you get it yeah just in case

1080
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:33,199
the one you don't have isn't the one you

1081
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:35,359
know we're not going to discuss it on

1082
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:37,078
camera but we already discussed the the

1083
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,119
politics of yeah there's politics

1084
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:40,519
there's genetic politics in every group

1085
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,200
I'm sure you guys know that certain

1086
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:44,960
people always feel whether rightfully so

1087
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:46,799
or wrongfully so either way I don't

1088
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,880
think that really matters it's just you

1089
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,920
never own any any strain really you just

1090
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,519
uh we come into the world with nothing

1091
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,400
and we leave with nothing yeah and in

1092
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:59,719
between we can hoard or share

1093
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,880
yeah that's it fear fear or love it's up

1094
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:03,519
to you so I'm happy with the way these

1095
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,240
were shared with me you can see as the

1096
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:08,039

00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,920
when I come over again and uh take these

1102
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,280
nice top Pointes cuz they're going to

1103
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,119
get thrown away

1104
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,880
