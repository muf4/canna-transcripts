00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:25,598
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world I

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,118
am here at high integrity glass art and

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,439
feeling very blessed indeed not only

5
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:33,280
because I'm standing in front of the

6
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,320
most EP epic denail electric nail table

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,200
that was ever built uh it's been an

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,159
absolute joy to be puffing on this table

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,000
but also there is some incredible

10
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:46,159
quality uh congales hash rosin just here

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,320
to my left which is uh what we're going

12
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,759
to be hitting today don't want to turn

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,480
it too sideways cuz there are little

14
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,119
shards and I don't want to drop those

15
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,878
but uh you can see the quality is on

16
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:57,439
point I'll throw up some macro

17
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:00,039
photographs just to give you an idea of

18
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:05,118
the quality of this resin and we are

19
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:08,320
hitting the one of one punty deppy ball

20
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:11,640
Fab with cold work and faceted work on

21
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:14,118
the base uh the mouthpiece and the joint

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,239
got a brand new quave Banger in there

23
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:18,319
and we're actually kind of showcasing

24
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,359
which is pretty cool when you're hitting

25
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,078
such an incredible one of one piece you

26
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:24,680
would think the Showcase was obviously

27
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:26,559
the piece but the Showcase is actually

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,680
this incredibly

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,879
beautiful uh Innovative design on a carb

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,759
C app from JS glass that's jsor glass if

31
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:37,319
you're checking them out on Instagram

32
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,759
not sure if you can see this I'll kind

33
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,719
of get a little closer for you maybe a

34
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,438
little update on that you see how the

35
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:46,399
the tip of it is a little bit offset

36
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:49,478
what that allows us to do is while we're

37
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:54,239
doing a lower temp dab to put this on

38
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:56,799
and spin it around the the um Banger and

39
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,438
what it does is it moves the rip and in

40
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,280
instead of letting it just sit where the

41
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,478
glass or the quartz is cooler it moves

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,239
it around consistency and you can really

43
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:09,399
get a pretty substantially uh better hit

44
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:12,280
using uh a carb cap like this so we're

45
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,680
going to rip it up here right now uh I'm

46
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,400
super blessed uh and honored to be able

47
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,680
to hit this piece because it's

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,719
definitely one for the books from

49
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,280
2013 so a solid three three plus years

50
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,800
old now and uh yeah we're going to torch

51
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,800
it up and hit

52
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:34,639
it L's world uh got the timer on it's at

53
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,439
about 15 seconds probably around 40

54
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,559
seconds 40 to 50 seconds depending on

55
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,519
how low temp of a dab you want to rip on

56
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,759
this uh and you can see I've done a

57
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,000
close-up video how the the resin well

58
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,560
I'll show you in about a second here

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,719
when I take my rip that it really sort

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,959
of moves around the bottom of the quartz

61
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,959
Banger it's a it's Innovative and that's

62
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,878
what I love to see in the community so

63
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,878
we're hitting 37 seconds 38 39 let's do

64
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,878
this

65
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,759
that

66
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,079
wow one of the things I found that was

67
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,560
really cool right off the bat is as I

68
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:13,760
was turning

69
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,519
it you could see sweet spots where if

70
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,560
you turned it too fast it would milk for

71
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,399
a second and then stop melking but if

72
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,918
you brought it back to that spot and

73
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,239
made the oil go over that hot spot of

74
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,839
the Banger it just gave this really

75
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,360
lovely really lovely Hit And The Taste

76
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,399
was on point we we've been puffing out

77
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,919
of the sapphire which was one of my uh

78
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,799
one of my favorite um dishes to hit off

79
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,000
of I love the way it preserves the tpin

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,800
and the flavor but I have to say this

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,279
