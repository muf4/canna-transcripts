00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,899

Japan is over there right now dosa is

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,618
over there right now and they are

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,340
blowing up a storm on the torches that

30
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:13,140
high integrity glass art has put in and

31
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,520
super stoked super stoked to go down

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,280
there in film I've never met the

33
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,618
Japanese crew I've never met dosa so I'm

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,719
very much looking forward to you know

35
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,310
just being the humble filmer showing you

36
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,109
guys all this beautiful beautiful

37
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,359
glassblowing that's going to be made and

38
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:28,590
you know I'll probably see flap-flap

39
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,118
lives over there as well and he'll

40
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,380
probably come over for a visit but I'm

41
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,049
actually heading over to high integrity

42
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:35,429
glass art slinger will not be there but

43
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,170
boy wouldn't that be awesome and I'm

44
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,939
sure with him building the facility the

45
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,769
way he did I think his interest is to

46
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:45,298
invite glass blowers he's got beds for

47
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:47,368
them to sleep he's got torches for them

48
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,430
to work on and it's a great idea for his

49
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:52,739
business what better way to get you know

50
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,868
to gain control over the pieces that are

51
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:59,218
blown than having them be blown in your

52
00:01:54,868 --> 00:02:02,790
own studio so without further ado I

53
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:06,509
think we should have a big old dry sip

54
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:09,090

00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:23,818

62

someone you're gonna send something and

88
00:04:04,908 --> 00:04:10,280
then they don't just don't receive it a

89
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:11,569
UPS didn't drop it at my door so it took

90
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,389
forever for me to actually get to the

91
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:16,189
store and pick it up oh [ __ ] I didn't

don't you think let me get rid of that

102
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,560
real quick it's amazing how many

103
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:41,089
messages I get and how many things come

104
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,560
in on my phone while I'm doing these

105
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:46,409
videos it's absolutely unbelievable

106
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,110
so yeah I was tempted to do the

107
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,669
wake-and-bake from the ferry I thought

108
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,900
that might have been fun and you know

109
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:53,579
what if I see something really cool on

110
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:55,318
the ferry I'll go live you know if

111
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:57,240
there's some whales or dolphins swimming

112
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,620
around on the side I'll film it with the

113
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,259
camera make sure you guys get to see

114
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,379
some of that and yeah

115
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,060
in the meantime I'm really excited I get

116
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:08,280
the ferry is in one hour and 15 minutes

117
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,620
and if I were in a car I'd probably be

118
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,388
leaving soon to go and drive and get in

119
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,769
line but I'm on a bike so I'll be

120
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:15,329
getting on the ferry first and I'll be

121
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:18,089
getting off the ferry first and that's

122
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:22,500
the beautiful thing about being on a

123
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:24,269
motorcycle it's quite a bonus yeah what

124

126
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,908

127
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,810
strawberry-banana from DNA and the

128

00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:07,740
yeah DNA it's got some great selections

141
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,180
there's no doubt about it from day one

142
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,460

time slot it's kind of like being the

165
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:10,069
string cheese incident back in the day

166
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,199
when fish was touring or Dave Matthews

167
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:14,839
it's like those guys would always go and

168
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,180
tour literally the day that fish had off

169
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,469
in between the two places that they were

170
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,540
traveling from which was brilliant

171
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,850
really you know that you've got a large

172
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,970
audience that just came off of watching

173
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,560
a great show and then boom there you go

174
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,790
that's that's a pretty good slot but

175
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,370
there are a few people that have

176
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,990
definitely done that slot I can't

177
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,879
remember the names of the shows but

178
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,730
there's there's a couple that do their

179
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,110
shows right after hash Church on well

180
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,270
you know what sach it's called being

181
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,600
inspired I don't look at it as copying I

182
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:49,009
mean sure the the little insecure child

183
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:51,350
inside of me might be like but who cares

184
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:53,930
about that in reality it's not copying

185
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,820
its inspiration what how do we we take

186
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,009
steps in a ladder well how did the next

187
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:00,550
step in the ladder get there if the

188
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:03,589
first step said oh you're copying me

189
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,270
hmmm it's like no I'm the next step in

190
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:06,859
the ladder and then the next step and

191
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:08,689
then the next step and then the next

192
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:12,020
step and it's how we climb it's how we

193
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:15,139
elevate ourselves it's how we raise the

194
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:18,049
bar so don't look at it as copying so

195
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:18,589
much as keep in mind here we go here we

196
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,728
go

197
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:25,399
I was not the first one to sell water

198
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:25,819
hash bags isolator bags were the first

199
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,879
bags

200
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:32,088
everyone bitched and whined and said I

201
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,729
was copying I was copying I was copying

202
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:37,160
well 10 to 20 years later I can assure

203
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:40,440
you that they all say bubble bags set

204
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:42,750
the bar bubble bags brought the new

205
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,880
brought the new level so it's like it

206
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,639
it's it's inspirational to have new

207
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:50,159
shows coming and and and coming up and

208
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:53,100
creating new they're fitting and filling

209
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,569
gaps that are there that the the maybe

210
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,580
you know when you're the first than

211
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,170
anything there's gonna be so many gaps

212
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,879
and everything that you do and then the

213
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:01,769
next people that come along can fill

214
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,559
those gaps or fill some of those gaps

215
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:06,569
and in the end it's always for the

216
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,149
people you can never have enough we want

217
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:12,510
more we don't want to fight against

218
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:15,899
something that always exists and having

219
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:18,840
a YouTube channel is not competition

220
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:21,090
especially here in the cannabis world I

221
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,220
mean my god I work every day at this and

222
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,570
I get a hundred and sixty people of

223
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,080
watching you know with a couple of

224
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:30,870
thousand views Joely Olli has like 1.5

225
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,370
million YouTube YouTube YouTube he's got

226
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,200
his own little thing and he does bond

227
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,750
rips and it's ridiculous and hilarious

228
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,930
but that [ __ ] gets hundreds of

229
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:43,169
thousands if not millions of hits every

230
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:45,389
time he posts a video so when I see

231
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:47,969
videos like that I don't think about

232
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:49,860
competition in regards to me and my

233
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,920
friends Remo was one of my huge

234
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,110
inspirations Remo had his channel years

235
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,000
before I had mine and I watched his

236
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,159
channel and I kind of got inspired by it

237
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,620
and I talked to him and I asked him what

238
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:03,059
camera he had and these are the this is

239
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,669
how we inspire each other and because

240
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:07,500
Remo is not a scared little boy he just

241
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:10,019
shared all this information he's like

242
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,629
yeah I do this do that you can you can

243
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:15,120
get this camera it's so great thank you

244
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:16,830
so much Remo and because of it I've done

245
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,320
the same thing for anyone that's asked

246
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,120
me why not same with my macro

247
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,030
photographs anything that people want to

248
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,100
learn you know if I hadn't shared the

249
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:28,529
information some of the some of the

250
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,019
people that are doing and doing great

251
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,909
things today they might not be doing it

252
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,980
on the same level you know and I feel

253
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:36,629
the exact same way because Remo and some

254
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,519
other key people shared information with

255
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:43,110
with me including me monkey who was from

256
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,659
overbroad days the sky this guy from the

257
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,690
UK man he gave me so much information on

258
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:51,480
macro photography when Jason King the

259
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,059
author of the canna Bible would not tell

260
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,069
me a single

261
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:57,139
I asked him if he would show me some

262
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:59,658
tips about macro photography because I

263
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:03,079
had an interest and he said yeah as soon

264
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:05,088
as you show me how to manufacture bubble

265
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:06,918
bags and sell them all around the world

266
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:10,789
on the internet that's exactly what he

267
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:13,188
said to me so yeah my channel I think

268
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:16,149
started in oh five but I didn't really

269
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:20,538
start posting till around twenty twelve

270
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:22,458
or so well that's exactly in Amelia I

271
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:24,619
don't really feel so much that it's

272
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:27,108
competition okay yeah I was a little bit

273
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:28,849
shocked when Todd was not coming to hash

274
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:31,309
Church anymore and had started his own

275
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:33,709
show with many of the panelists that

276
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:35,418
have been on hash Church before but that

277
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:37,278
was just a scared little boy in me and

278
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:39,798
after the community sent me many many

279
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:42,349
wonderful messages saying hey you know

280
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:44,688
just keep doing you it's all good and it

281
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:47,179
is all good it's gonna be good his show

282
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:50,988
will be great I'm not gonna be against

283
00:11:47,178 --> 00:11:52,999
it and you know I think that my show

284
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:54,079
hash Church is going to be about

285
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:56,538
inclusivity

286
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:59,298
it's about including people and not

287
00:11:56,538 --> 00:12:00,588
trying to create only the cream of the

288
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:02,629
cream of the cream because I think

289
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:05,899
everyone is the cream of the crop in

290
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:09,438
hash Church I think I love my bros D

291
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:11,298
420k and John Barr fellow you know they

292
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:12,769
they sit there they laugh they share

293
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:15,078
what stories they can and what

294
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:16,849
information they can and I love them for

295
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:19,428
it they may not be chemists they may not

296
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:21,649
be doctors with PhDs but they certainly

297
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:27,158
belong on the show they're they're a

298
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:30,528
part of it and that's why that's why I

299
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:32,778
want to be inclusive and that's exactly

300
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:35,269
it injury you know having someone tell

301
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:38,058
me that someone I'm not going to come on

302
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:39,438
if so-and-so is on your show just seems

303
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:42,288
childish to me and it doesn't seem

304
00:12:39,438 --> 00:12:44,238
inclusive and so I'm gonna continue on

305
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:47,109
the way we're doing it be inclusive and

306
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:50,329
invite as many people on as possible and

307
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:53,329
most paid miss potheads well I don't

308
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:55,368
think I'm on that list myself but

309
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:58,698

328
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:48,709
from the real Green Dragon who are some

329
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:52,850
old-school

330
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:54,288
Cali growers that they just really

331
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:58,519
started Instagram you can check them out

332
00:13:54,288 --> 00:14:00,708
the real green dragon and yeah we're

333
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,269
actually working with them here in the

334
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:04,278
lab in the next couple of days we're

335
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:07,068
processing resin for the real green

336
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:09,948
dragon and we just processed some for LA

337
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:11,688
Kush so a couple of companies down there

338
00:14:09,948 --> 00:14:13,838
that the bubbleman brand and Blue River

339
00:14:11,688 --> 00:14:16,639

340
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,339
yeah nice to be produced in five star

341
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,918
plus uh Anthony you won't be

342
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:22,939
disappointed I still have a bloody K so

343
00:14:21,918 --> 00:14:24,528
that I got to get back to these

344
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:28,009
giveaways but you know what the problem

345
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:29,389
with the giveaways is I stack all the

346
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:31,158
things that need to be shipped and

347
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:32,989
sometimes people send me emails that are

348
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:35,928
a little confusing they don't say what

349
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:37,639
episode and what they won and so I have

350
00:14:35,928 --> 00:14:40,488
to kind of go back and it becomes this

351
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,899
sort of silly thing that it's just a

352
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:45,109
little bit difficult for me to keep

353
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:46,970
track of so 11 o'clock man it's soon

354

half an hour I get to go to the Sunshine

355
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,970
Coast I'm not sure if I'm gonna go live

356
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,139
on the Sunshine Coast or not and if I do

357
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,149
I'm not sure if I would go through

358
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:57,979
Instagram if you guys don't follow me on

359

387
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:12,609
my life through my friend Emilio from

388
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,940

David's place in Barcelona called HQ

391
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,320
minutes before I split and went and sat

392
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,029
with my friends but ya seem like a fine

393

395
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,500
sorry I just read someone say be real

396
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:34,929
the more known you become the easier it

397
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:38,470
is for people to just hate you I'm not

398
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:39,969

for days begging me not ever to do that

404
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:06,779
again in fact I think the Australian

405
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,640
Legislature legislation passed up some

406
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:11,399
policy saying that I'm absolutely not

407
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,190
allowed to do it anywhere in the world

408
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,980

Dylan some of them some people hold on

488
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,710
to [ __ ] you know they just hold on to

489
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:04,349
[ __ ] in a way that is almost

490
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:07,048
unbelievable I should probably do one

491
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:10,079
more monster sifter if I gotta tell you

492
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:13,288
it is unbelievable how strong full melt

493
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:15,808
dry sift is as you puff two or three in

494
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:16,170
a row I'll never forget the first time I

495
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,750
smoked

496
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:20,279
to skunkman Sam man that wasn't it that

497
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,140
was an experience it really was an

498
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:26,160
experience especially because he

499
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:30,030
for-sure for-sure for-sure was trying to

500
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,910

501
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:35,759
I'm I'm happy to be a friend I'm happy

502
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:38,460
to help I'm not sure you want to you

503
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,529
know follow me everywhere but maybe I

504
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,360
can offer inspiration here and there I'm

505
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:44,430
fallible I make my own mistakes

506
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,019
maybe one day I'll just share a bunch of

507
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:49,380
my mistakes with you guys some of them

508
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:50,849
are good some of them are bad but it's

509
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,110
just about a positive outlook you know

510
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:57,569
people are always wondering it's it's

511
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:58,740
how oh how did you how did you get where

512
00:21:57,569 --> 00:21:59,759
you are how did you do what you did and

513
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,380
I'm just like I just had a positive

514
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,779
outlook even though in the negative

515
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,820
things in fact most importantly in the

516
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:09,149
negative things it was when I had a

517
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:11,549
positive outlook that the negative that

518
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,550
energy that intense energy there's so

519
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:17,250
much energy in that moment that with

520
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:20,000
with positivity you can transfer that

521
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,799
energy into good and it is like a big

522
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,670
crack you know out of the park Grand

523
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:29,639
Slam everyone hit the bases whoo-hoo it

524
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:32,150
happens it happened to me it can happen

525
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,150
to you

526
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,079
David I'm blessed in life you know even

527
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:49,090
when I wasn't blessed I was blessed I've

528
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:51,308
been blessed with health which to feel

529
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:55,329
good to me is the most important thing I

530
00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:56,889
love people so my value in life comes

531
00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:59,168
from people not people that are

532
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,600
well-known or famous or whatever or they

533
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:05,230
can do my personal agenda well but

534
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:07,509
people I see every person as a person

535
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,460
who can help you and more importantly

536
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:11,470
that you can help if you couldn't make

537
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,929
someone's day better by saying a couple

538
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:17,319
of words or giving them a [ __ ] eight

539
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:20,380
dollar bottle of balm cleaner why

540
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:22,689
wouldn't you why wouldn't you and then

541
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,450
the way I look at it is it's contagious

542
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:28,210
it gets passed on you know someone

543
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,370
smiled at me the other day it was just a

544
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,019
lovely smile and I and I literally

545
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:35,018
minutes later I found myself helping

546
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:38,138
this guy deliver his Pat his he had

547
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:40,089
these things on a roller super heavy

548
00:23:38,138 --> 00:23:41,619
bunch of boxes and I just lifted it up

549
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:43,599
over the lip to let him get into the

550
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:45,099
store that I was walking to I probably

551
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,319
would have done it anyway but as I was

552
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:49,719
doing it I felt that woman who had

553
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:51,730
smiled at me just a nice smile good

554
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,960
morning it's like it's nice to be nice

555
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:57,970
to each other I'm not sure it's a good

556
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,649
idea to be living in cities that are so

557
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,269
close that we're all miserable and angry

558
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:03,099
with one another and complaining

559
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:06,388
constantly yeah Toni Brazoria is a

560
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:06,388
genius [ __ ] great guy

561
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:14,808
we work really well together Tony and I

562
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:19,519
like peanut butter and jam very

563
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:22,369
symbiotic and always always always doing

564
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,019
great things you're gonna see a lot of

565
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:25,519
what we've been doing you know Tony's

566
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:28,339
been showing little bits and pieces of

567
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:31,670
the lab work and you know the new

568
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:34,069
technologies with the terpenes and some

569
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,210
of the new products and the you're gonna

570
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:36,409
see a bunch of new things that are

571
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,058
coming out and we're gonna be talking

572
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:40,840
about Jamaica in the near future as well

573
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:42,019
so there's lots of good things happening

574
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:44,509
um

575
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:48,558
I currently do not own shares in scene

576
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:49,519
AB not yet I'm working out to make that

577
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:51,950
happen in the very near future

578
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,750
apparently they say I do but I haven't

579
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,929
seen the documents so I really will be

580
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,779
waiting for those documents but yeah I

581
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:01,519
would definitely you know United

582
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:03,230
cannabis is doing great things prana is

583
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,150
an amazing product and the fact that

584
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:08,990
it's in harbor side and Steve DeAngelo

585
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:11,450
loves it but the fact that it was it was

586
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:15,500
the basis of Riverrock success I think

587
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:17,000
that we're very very very excited at the

588
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,910
prospects of being able to one day

589
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,730
produce the raw product medicine in

590
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:25,820
Jamaica so we can produce prana and ship

591
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:29,710
it worldwide out of Jamaica Sun grown

592
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:31,689
tropical grown you know lion bred

593
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,460
cultivars from Jamaica

594
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:37,039
I've seen some cultivars with Valentin

595
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,450
Terps absolutely off the top of my head

596
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,700
I'd have to go through my list there's

597
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:43,220
if you go on SC labs you can go through

598
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,230
their terpene tests and most of like

599
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,058
Tony Blue River all the ones we had done

600
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,798
our public so you can click on it and

601
00:25:47,058 --> 00:25:51,619
you can see them they're also at Blue

602
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:55,220
River extract CA and Blue River extracts

603
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:58,849
calm under terpenes and you can look at

604
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,380
all of the different terpene laboratory

605
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:02,808
tests and it'll show you

606
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,400
Valentin's towards the bottom just look

607
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:07,460
for one that has some present it's

608
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:13,100
always a very small amount but it's

609
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:14,600
there it is there yeah yeah man it's

610
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:18,500
gonna be good it's gonna be good trust

611
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:21,369
me we're very excited about it yeah head

612
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,660
ear if you know it's not a bad idea

613
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:25,219
dude I'm right down the street from both

614
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,419
harbor sides we'll go check it out dude

615
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:31,548
they have bubble man brand they have

616
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:33,650
blue river they have prana well the

617
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:35,418
super dupe that's oxidization it could

618
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,160
be water present that's doing that if

619
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:38,840
you don't dry it properly if you dry it

620
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,090
in a paddy and the water stays there

621
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:42,798
that'll you know magnify the light

622
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:45,048
that's getting into it it'll oxidize it

623
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:48,200
faster get the water out break it into

624
00:26:45,048 --> 00:26:50,450
powder use a desiccant to with gravity

625
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,240
to pull the moisture out of the resin as

626
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,650
soon as possible and if you want to

627
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,480
preserve the color you can put it in the

628
00:26:54,650 --> 00:27:00,140
fridge and keep it cold and the color

629
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,029
will stay the same however take a little

630
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,860
bit and go both ways and you'll see the

631
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:06,589
preserved is often a little more racy

632
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:09,019
and the cured is often a little more

633
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:10,668
Spacey so it really depends on what you

634
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:12,470
want for your high those are total

635
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:13,759
generalizations by the way I don't want

636
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,370
you to think that that's the way it's

637
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,960
gonna be all the time but it is kind of

638
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:20,029
a generalization you know you cut the

639
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,460
the cultivar down a little early it's a

640
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:24,139
bit racy I eat blonde Lebanese hash you

641
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,740
cut it down a little late it's a little

642
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:33,710
more Spacey ie red Lebanese hash same

643
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:37,609
hashes just cut early cut late hey they

644
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:40,100
see a lot of product Frankie a lot of

645
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:42,168
product to get in there you really got

646
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:46,359
to have your price point and your

647
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:46,360
quality has to be on point

648
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,100

687
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:55,690
[ __ ]

688
00:29:58,118 --> 00:30:03,468
everyone thinks that Frankie

689
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:06,588
everyone thinks that but when you get

690
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:08,659
into a level where many many people who

691
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:11,448
have that same level and some who have

692
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:13,009
even a bit of a higher level it's you

693
00:30:11,449 --> 00:30:16,308
have to understand like those guys see a

694
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:17,690
lot of material or they just have their

695
00:30:16,308 --> 00:30:20,358
own greenhouse coming down with five

696
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,179
thousand kilos or whatever and they they

697
00:30:20,358 --> 00:30:26,148
they don't need it so it's like who

698
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:31,940
knows price quality it's got to be one

699
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:33,768
of the two quality always sells quality

700
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,959
always sells no one ever says no to

701
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:38,149
quality like that's it's the thing about

702
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:40,009
cognitive dissonance when we think what

703
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:41,928
we have is you know I'm not saying this

704
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:45,078
about Frankie cuz Frankie very well may

705
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:46,548
have the utter and complete kill I'm not

706
00:30:45,078 --> 00:30:49,489
saying that he doesn't but let's just be

707
00:30:46,548 --> 00:30:51,199
honest Frankie is everyone everyone

708
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:54,798
believes they have the utter and

709
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:58,329
complete kill and sometimes often most

710
00:30:54,798 --> 00:31:00,408
times they don't it's like it's like if

711
00:30:58,328 --> 00:31:02,148
every restaurant thought they were the

712
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:05,179
best and it's like actually you guys are

713
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:07,488
all three-star and below and these four

714
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:09,889
and five-star restaurants are actually

715
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:12,798
the ones that are quite you know on

716
00:31:09,888 --> 00:31:15,588
every level from the environment to the

717
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:18,979
dishes to the food to the service to

718
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:21,378
everything is just better and so it's a

719
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:24,619
weird thing every yeah he's he's all of

720
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:26,778
us we've all done this we've evolved on

721
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:29,448
this oh dude I hear you bro well the

722
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:31,940
2400 K pounds you know and down to like

723
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:33,019
much lower people are selling for

724
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,410
fifteen

725
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:38,629
tene some 4:12 all these greenhouses are

726
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,730
coming down I feel you bro I feel you

727
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,290
but understand tomatoes cost about $10

728
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:45,289
to grow so the day of you get in two

729
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:48,889
thousand dollars a pound are slowly

730
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:51,529
coming to an end we're gonna grow this

731
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:54,410
[ __ ] agriculturally bro we're gonna grow

732
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:57,319
this in fields acres and [ __ ]

733
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:59,810
hectares and sections large and then

734
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:02,269
guys like solvent las' mind and myself

735
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:05,269
are going to extract them and then all

736
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:07,549
of you guys are going to dab and smoke

737
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:09,559
it that's how it's going down

738
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:11,629
it's not gonna happen any other way I'm

739
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:16,700
damn sure making sure of it

740
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:18,410
and our acres get floured soon and think

741
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,120
of the acreage that I bet you it's not

742
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:22,519
that many acres that you would need to

743
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:25,279
produce the world's resin think of how

744
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:28,220
much oxycodone and fentanyl and all of

745
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,970
these morphine based drugs all of these

746
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:33,980
opium based drugs 90% of that opium has

747
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:35,230
grown on a tiny little island off the

748
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,120
coast of Tasmania

749
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,980
they grow tons and tons and tons of it

750
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:43,369
but it's for almost the whole

751
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:45,049
pharmaceutical world and so I think we'd

752
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:47,479
be surprised that we could get it done

753
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:52,519
in a pretty decent amount of land to

754
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:56,839
grow the world's resin oh let's not get

755
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:58,299
political no no let's not do that that's

756
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:01,399
like saying let's all argue about

757
00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:07,940
vaccinations let's all talk about our

758
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:10,070
religious beliefs [ __ ] that's funny

759
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,390
we're not gonna do any of that hey how's

760
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:13,519
it going solving this mind I was just

761
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:16,910
talking earlier how badly I want to get

762

765
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:26,269

00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:33,170
happen but let's try to make it happen

769
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:34,369
in the near future and now that I've

770
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,350
