me if you know the words are over

574
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:14,160
here oh

575
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:19,318
canabus the sacred plant of

576
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:23,199
peace pot junkies we have to make a path

577
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:25,318
starting about right here that goes off

578
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,199
and you go spread up spread out this way

579
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:28,199
spread out that way make a path right in

580
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:30,439
front of

581
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:32,639
make a path and then make another path

582
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,000
that goes off in that direction and goes

583
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:36,759
off in that direction and the reason

584
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,358
we're going to do this is it's easier to

585
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:43,200
get you the free weed if you make a path

586
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:46,279
so if you want free weed to be thrown at

587
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,239
your head make a path one that goes that

588
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,240
way and one that goes that way someone

589
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:53,279
should be out walking the path so that

590
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:54,479
uh it's for sure being made is it can I

591
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,680
get like a

592
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:01,199
