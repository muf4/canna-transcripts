other day I was like oh man I got I got

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,920
to beet him you know the doctor the the

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:40,919
atomic Haze and was one of the strains

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:44,840
that we lost in the 2004 raid on the bit

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,879
Cree uh in in Victoria with the with the

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,000
Vicks and that was one of the strains

19
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:54,238
that we absolutely lost 04 04 so you've

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,280
Lo you've had it's been gone for 10

21
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,198
years yeah wow yeah it was great it was

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,320
it was super popular well like for sure

23
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:06,438
hook you up with oh something or be

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,680
awesome like we we were a discussion

25
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:11,079
I'll just jump in here we were

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,280
discussing about you know ownership of

27
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:16,438
genetics if you will and sharing of

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,359
genetics I suppose you could you could

29
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:23,000
allude to like the internet file sharing

30
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,478
whether it's a a violation or whether

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,319
it's okay right yeah I guess it is very

32
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:30,599
much like it right well it is software

33
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,438
ultimately

34
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,640
yeah yeah I mean if you've bred it and

35
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:39,639
you and you and you work with it and

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,719
you've created your own sort of species

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,079
yeah I understand that I I feel you know

38
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:45,118
if you don't want to share it then don't

39
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,359
share it don't give it to anybody and

40
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,759
then say I gave it to you and then don't

41
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,959
you know don't share it right it's like

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:56,118
if you want it and you want to keep it

43
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:58,319
private keep it private and you know if

44
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,759
it's if it's like a cut that's out

45
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,639
there it's out there there right like

46
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,159
just share it I don't that's how I feel

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,599
of it and I'm I'm pretty open with my

48
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,200
genetics yeah just because I for me it's

49
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,919
the medicinal side of it if it makes

50
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,598
somebody feel better yeah then I think

51
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,639
it you know the plant needs to be out

52
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:21,280
there make it making people feel better

53
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:23,719
yeah we uh doc took the uh took the Barb

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,159
home the other

55
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:30,318
day so there you go he's got some of

56
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:32,919
your genetics Barb yeah Barb bar by the

57
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,439
Berry uh line that was one of the

58
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,799
strains that you grabbed from him so

59
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,280
it's a pretty

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,239
nice little strin maybe that's we had an

61
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,039
old friend come up to me in London he's

62
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:51,120
got the uh yellow line really oh yeah so

63
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:54,400
uh hopefully we'll be able to uh bring

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,200
some Pier Shish Berry

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,760
back Shish I think was another strain

66
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,799
that we lost in the

67
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:03,798
vitc raid along with the princess the

68
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,719
princess for us and the vix was the

69
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:10,080
number one painkiller overall medicinal

70
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:12,840
strain that we had it couldn't keep it

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,239
on the menu it just sold sold

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,598
sold it was another one that was lost

73
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,080
completely lost you want to hit some of

74
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,959
that

75
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,959
barb good

76
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,680
Barb Barra this is dry

77
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,158
sift of

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,159
course the award

79
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,920
winning just did some fresh frozen

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,598
yesterday I saw dude I was looking at

81
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:41,318
that picture today that piece was like

82
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:43,318
that piece like solidified like that I

83
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:45,759
couldn't I put it into the Sie to scrape

84
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,359
it and I and I couldn't I had to put it

85
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,560
into the freezer to sort of Chunk it

86
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,760
back up temperature it's going to be key

87
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,280
is temperature crazy you know I had the

88
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,280
same problem I don't know if you saw my

89
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,158
last video of the Astro Boy Fresh Frozen

90
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,479
that I went to run through my strainer

91
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:02,919
and then it just

92
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:05,479
went and just I was like what am I oh oh

93
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,798
put it in the freezer for like 2 hours

94
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:09,560
took it out smacked it with a hard cold

95
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,640
spoon that was also in the freezer and

96
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,438
it just broke like glass on top of the

97
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,199
parchment so yeah we just left it in for

98
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,279
like 10 minutes or so just enough to

99
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,358
sort of get that gumminess off and we

100
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,839
were able to get it through the SI oh

101
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:25,719
okay good but uh it was crazy we threw a

102
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:28,319
we threw a wet piece just through it in

103
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,120
sizzled away but just white it was like

104
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,800
did you see that one shot

105
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,120
same color of theen I thought I liked it

106
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,520
and even commented on it

107
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,680
unbelievable holy smokes I drooled when

108
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:41,038
I saw it that's for sure and just the

109
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,759
amount just the amount like that that's

110
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:44,360
that's when I told doc about that's why

111
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,000
you grabbed the Barb when I was like

112
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,280
grab that one because it produces resin

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,478
like that's a strain that should be bred

114
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,758
if that is a genetic trait then it

115
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:58,839
should be

116
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:01,160
somehow isolated and passed on into

117
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:03,478
other strains cuz you just you're

118
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,720
disappointed like I was running I have a

119
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:07,918
a warlock a warlock canonic and I mean

120
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,800
the Warlock the Warlock is up there for

121
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,439
producing it is it makes great dynamite

122
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,680
dynamite hash but I cross it with the

123
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,560
canonic and all the fenals that are

124
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,038
coming off of it they're great but the

125
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,959
hash is doesn't produce the quantity I

126
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,639
put it in the big tumbler that you do

127
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,758
the hour run and you're like the hour

128
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,759
run open up up and you're just like hm

129
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,038
no you know it fills a fairly good

130
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,520
container up but an hour run with Barb

131
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:36,120
will fills entire zock bag like a half

132
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,478
pound bag unbelievable a half pound bag

133
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,079
I se I've seen it

134
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:43,000
myself what comes off the the tricomes

135
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:46,839
yeah the tricomes and here's the crazy

136
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,199
thing in an hour run it's still like 50%

137
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:50,638
heads which to people okay that aren't

138
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,800
hash makers you might that might not

139
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,720
sound like anything but even by itself

140
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,360
would be that much

141
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,080
stronger I mean with without extracting

142
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,600
it from the hatch just the but

143
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:08,598
itself I don't know there's something

144
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,599
about smoking the bud that's not as the

145
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:15,038
flavor in the bud for some reason

146
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:17,519
doesn't fully carry over to the to the

147
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:20,000
to the taste like with the with the with

148
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,120
this tan with the new Tangi it does it

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,560
has it when you smell it it's like oh my

150
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,560
God it's fantastic and it carries over

151
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,120
in the flavor and with the Barb it

152
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:35,399
doesn't so much in the bug but the

153
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,879
resin is is just is like phenomenal I

154
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,279
you can smell maybe you know maybe it's

155
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,598
me and I'm and I'm just around so much

156
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:45,359
other flavorful butd and no the bottom

157
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:48,399
line is I make a lot of it's a it's a

158
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,479
it's like um skunkman Sam skunk number

159
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,279
one produces resin like that and so did

160
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:57,000
the strain that they crossed what did

161
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,000
they cross to produce the SLE

162
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:03,680
stack heard stor stack is also well that

163
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:07,198
SLE stack stunt cross was the one that

164
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,160
also just produced an enormous amount of

165
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,879
resin so one day we'll be focused on

166
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,599
that when we all have green houses going

167
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,919
and we were able to grow way larger

168
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,120
amounts and there's just like oh I got a

169
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:19,399
55 gallon drum just full of material I

170
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,800
have to run oh really I have 10 of those

171
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:24,679
running in the hlc right now see what it

172
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,439
tests at yeah see if exactly little it

173
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,120
won't even be an HSC it'll be that

174
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,800
little have you seen that little device

175
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,478
that you can just like they're making it

176
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,680
for fruits and vegetables it's like the

177
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:36,199
same idea as a as a spectrometer but

178
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,319
they needed to take a spectrometer which

179
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,879
is like a large tabletop machine and

180
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,199
they turned it into this tiny little

181
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,080
chip took them three years to do it and

182
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,240
it fits in this little hand thing and

183
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,878
it's basically like a molecular sniffer

184
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,598
or whatever they call it it's like you

185
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,759
you point it at fruit and it'll tell you

186
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:56,158
if there's pesticides used like I know

187
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,038
it's I was just reading online the O

188
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:01,519
phone where they can send and now

189
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,279
they're like like 30 programed cents but

190
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,399
you can mix them together to make over

191
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,198
300,000 different smells and you can

192
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,959
send it to your friend that's cool send

193
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,079
a picture along with a smell to your

194
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,959
friend like that's the technology is out

195
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:15,000
there so it's pretty wild I was sitting

196
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,038
on the ferry I was like man the smoker

197
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,519
kids of Tomorrow are going to have what

198
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:20,918
you they're going to have the whole

199
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,799
color spectrum have you tried this

200
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,560
variety like and potentially spectrums

201
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,720
outside they go look it for it and they

202
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,280
go look it for those smells yeah that's

203
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,840
awesome that's a whole you know when you

204
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,679
turn the flashlight on in the dark room

205
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,879
it's amazing how easier you can move

206
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,958
around you know the metaphor as you get

207
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,918
in deeper and you understand what you're

208
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:43,079
getting into I can only imagine how do

209
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:46,278
you see all this stuff I was just going

210
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,639
to say you really taking it to the next

211
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:51,080
step mean all like even this gear you

212
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,480
know like I've always been a joint guy

213
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,920
okay but now the dabs and the butter and

214
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,600
the and the shatter and the all the

215
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:04,120
hardware and the tools yeah and all the

216
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:09,839
talk the six-year-old Master

217
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:13,000
Kush yeah stable no but it's it's um

218
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,839
what do you call the technological

219
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,839
side Innovation

220
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,640
yes it's kind of

221
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:25,680
fun might be getting a little dirty and

222
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:30,399
and I I must say that you really refined

223
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:33,120
the P by zeroing in mhm on that triome

224
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,519
oh yeah and and the triome

225
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,240
head really cleaning of it the cleaning

226
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,600
of it and getting it down to CU on the

227
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,600
on the island for know for 10 years like

228
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,000
we've we've been sort of dry sifting on

229
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,600
the island for a long long long time and

230
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,799
for us it was always just trimming the

231
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,800
buds on the screen and that's it and

232
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,919
sort of collecting this and collecting

233
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,159
this quality but I've always ever just

234
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:02,078
had like little balls of it and little

235
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:04,958
containers of it and the and the like it

236
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:07,439
was really the cup the last cup for me

237
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:10,000
you know sort of opened it up to

238
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,240
cleaning it cleaning it to a and getting

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,759
rid of the contaminant contaminant

240
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,120
that's in there right really the

241
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,838
difference between s that's where the

242
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,799
high is 90 and 100 once you get up to

243
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:26,040
those crazy levels even from 95 to

244
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:28,759
98 that 3% is like it's

245
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:30,000
like telling you it's insane wow and

246
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:32,159
that's why the first time I ever went to

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,039
skunk man's place and he puffed me down

248
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,519
with that stuff and Rob Clark would

249
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:37,278
always tell stories of like oh man I

250
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,039
left his place like crosy the other day

251
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,120
I was like oh come on I got to do like

252
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:44,159
really like come on the first time I

253
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,039
like sat there one night and po I left

254
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:51,278
so destroyed I was literally just

255
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:53,039
like okay I understand now

256
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,639
99%

257
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,078
99% especially because he's in control

258
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,440
of like growing that resin and and

259
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,799
cleaning and everything it starts I

260
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,959
think that's where it really starts and

261
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:07,078
that's what uh that's what I'm learning

262
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:09,518
I mean I love cleaning resin and and

263
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:10,919
playing with resin and running different

264
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,320
people's stuff through my bags and

265
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:17,039
screens but I also love growing resin

266
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,839
for sure man it puts a smile on your

267
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,879
face for sure and now I've got some doc

268
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:25,240
atomics doc Atomic brought me some NL

269
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:28,000
some Northern Lights yeah some beautiful

270
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,560
oh dude of course it's yours and um

271
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,639
awesome and the Harmon

272
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:34,958
which is Froman yeah yeah so yeah pretty

273
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,039
seen I've SE we've seen that on the

274
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,838
island hary mhm it's nice it's nice yeah

275
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,838
I saw it I photographed it recently at

276
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:47,839
that license production facility that I

277
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:50,279
went to uh till and so they had

278
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,279
Harmony they had

279
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:54,480
Harmony and a whole bunch of different

280
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:58,559
things it was good to see it was nice to

281
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,519
see um nice Bud oh yeah yeah nice

282
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,559
facility

283
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,039
yeah you know not allowed to talk about

284
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,000
the facility but can definitely say the

285
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,838
bud was nice didn't smoke the bud don't

286
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,240
smoke bud photograph the resin looked

287
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,680
killer photographed lots of resin have

288
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,120
to say it was like just kind of right up

289
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:20,838
there with most of it so I guess the

290
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,519
real the the real sort of test would be

291
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,519
to um isolate the resin and then be able

292
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,039
to try it and then I could literally

293
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,078
that would be a cool thing for the for

294
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,679
bubble man to be able to offer to do

295
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:31,559
like or even a crew of us you know where

296
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,719
we're like well you know we're

297
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,838
well-known people in the Cannabis

298
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,480
industry and what we're offering is

299
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,040
we'll come in we'll extract your resins

300
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,399
we'll smoke them and then we'll give you

301
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,759
a review on them and you can keep it

302
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,559
private if you want or you could use it

303
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,720
as you know your sounds like a great

304
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,719
idea yeah you know like that'd be fun eh

305
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,120
cuz it's like here's the thing

306
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,199
everyone's bashing these LPS I'm just

307
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,120
like okay fine if they're selling moldy

308
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:53,759
weed or they're not growing good herb or

309
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,360
they're selling strains that aren't the

310
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,799
real strains then fine then that they

311
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,560
deserve to have people on that cuz it's

312
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:02,000
important that they they don't do those

313
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:03,799
things but if there are ones that are

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,639
just literally good people they're like

315
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,759
well we're just growing herb to sell it

316
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,079
to people that's you it's like an old

317
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,600
business yeah I would just like to know

318
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:14,359
which ones have good herb because I

319
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,879
haven't been able to get behind and you

320
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:21,000
know unfortunately for us to order herb

321
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:23,600
um as licensed users here in Canada we

322
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,440
lose our ability to grow so they put

323
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,000
that in some amendments so it's why I

324
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,360
didn't I was going to order herb from

325
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
all of the licensed production

326
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,199
facilities can't do that either but I

327
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,679
thought I'd do it with a bunch of my

328
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:36,359
friends if we each picked one well you

329
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:39,239
could like you can get your doctor to

330
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,480
say sign five different forms right and

331
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,879
say you have 20 gr and you can just say

332
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,600
I'm getting you know four G four GRS

333
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,519
from five different guys and then

334
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,199
therefore you can you can get that many

335
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,720
now it's a hassle to the

336
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,519
doctors still I wanted to do a review

337
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,240
you know I wanted to be able to buy like

338
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,360
I wanted to get like a half pound from

339
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,639
each one

340
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,000
and then run it through my screens

341
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,198
photograph the resin show the resin

342
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,600
whether it melts or Bubbles and

343
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,559
literally have it in a room full of

344
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,040
people where we all do a little mini cup

345
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,239
and just say you know like listen I've

346
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:12,919
I've been all over the world and smoked

347
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,278
all over the world that's good resin

348
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,679
yeah this one I didn't like that much

349
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:18,958
but I you know it'd be a nice honest

350
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:20,919
review and I think some of these LPS

351
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,319
could really use it I think I think if

352
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:26,078
you're out there and you're in an LP and

353
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,720
you want some professional advice from

354
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,159
people that have been in the industry

355
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:35,399
for 25

356
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:37,519
35 think a there's probably close to 80

357
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,320
years in here you know there it is right

358
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,240
there and it's like you know and and

359
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,240
we're not the only ones by any means you

360
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,079
know guys like Ramo and get you know

361
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,399
there's a lot of different people out

362
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:49,958
there not just even in British Columbia

363
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:54,278
all across the board that could sort of

364
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:55,919
I think suit that you know that need

365
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:57,879
where it's like you have respected

366
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,759
individuals who you know people are

367
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,559
following them on the Instagram and

368
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,639

369
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:08,159

488
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,960
brought Mark another medy he did the

489
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,918
last run of it and he was uh talking

490
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,440
about how great the resin was and how

491
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,240
much he really appreciated and he says

492
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,720
it's definitely his medicine he took

493
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,400
some great shots of it some macros which

494
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,038
uh you know he's uh well like he's

495
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,400
understanding is how good M Kush works

496
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:31,000
for me and a lot of other people um but

497
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,759
beautiful we got one two three four five

498
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,960
six seven eight nine 10 beautiful clones

499
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,480
from not such a small plan I did my

500
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,400
fimming of course not fimming I peel the

501
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,519
top apparently fimming is something

502
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,919
completely different but I do my peel

503
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,918
people have seen it some of my previous

504
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,159
vide so it's being peeled so it's split

505
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,360
my top right there already which is

506
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,280
forcing these bottom really nicely here

507
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:55,558
so you'll definitely get a great little

508
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:57,599
bush with this plant special

509
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:59,759

00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,000
charger cuz um I basically ordered

559
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,200
everything for John he was like just get

560
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,640
me what I need and then I was like like

561
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,600
okay I'll tell you this is the dream

562
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,159
package right here although I made one

563
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:08,480
uh fail at not getting him a tripod and

564
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,880
I'm hoping he himself goes and gets one

565
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,599
I've been telling him this for about a

566
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,080
week now since we ordered this camera go

567
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,480
get a tripod go get a tripod even today

568
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,639
we probably would have filmed with that

569
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,440
camera had he gotten a tripod cuz you

570
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,440
you need a tripod well where do you put

571
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,000
the camera well see I have a few tripods

572
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,440
at home but I realized com to think that

573
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,119
I'm going to go need to get a better one

574
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,640
so and I was just curious on on a cple

575
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:33,439
things I was looking at how yours was

576
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,559
and how it was slid back and forth and I

577
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,880
was reading on on the site there where

578
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:39,480
they had that one that motions with you

579
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,799
so if you're talking and stuff like that

580
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,360
like that's a $500 tripod 275 yeah well

581
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,639
and then if you look next to it the

582
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:48,479
other compart component that you need to

583
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,640
make that work that you would wear on

584
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,000
your belt yeah is like another 200 oh so

585

630
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,440
no This was um tell you a little bit

631
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:30,240
more about this guys this is

632
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,960
actually hemp oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so

633
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,599
um the the what we're looking at was uh

634
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,079
the CBD and I was curious of um what uh

635
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:42,278
is being sold in town in clubs uh they

636
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:44,000
sell CBD caps and they $3 to5 and we

637
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:46,359
were curious what was actually in that

638
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,398
so um we took a good look and what we're

639
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:51,719
realizing is uh well how much of that is

640
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:54,239
really completely like absolutely

641
00:25:51,720 --> 00:26:00,079
nothing in there would you say I'd say

642
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:03,359
maybe about 85 to 95% 85 the 95% of that

643
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:05,439
is pure waste so I I'm really seeing

644
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,359
that this doesn't even seem like a plant

645
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,840
I what is that it's like carpet or

646
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,240
something yeah yeah it's weird so so so

647
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:14,439
you know what we're taking a better look

648
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,880
at what's going on with what's happening

649
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,840
with the new Industries and everybody's

650
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,760
getting into these CBD caps and what's

651
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,798
out you're hearing it all over the place

652
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,480
but you know what this is what people

653
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,038
are putting in those caps this is what

654
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,480
people are putting in these caps Bey be

655
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:30,200
very wary um if you can I you can't grow

656
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,880
your own hemp that's the only problem

657
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,319
and but you don't need to grow hemp no

658
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,399
you just grow grow grow your own

659
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,480
cannabis if you if you're needing caps

660
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:40,479
and if you're needing a CBD product then

661
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,038
grow a CBD know strain and it doesn't

662
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,640
matter if there's THC in it just don't

663
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:46,278
DEC carboxilate it the THC or the CBD

664
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,399
will still be active you'll still be

665
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:49,519
able to acquire it through your

666
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:52,278
bloodstream yes and you don't need to

667
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:55,038
activate the THC and so there's no

668
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:57,159
worries of needing a a hemp product

669
00:26:55,038 --> 00:27:00,079
that's grown for food that isn't grown

670
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:02,520
for medicine exactly or grown for other

671
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:05,038
things but uh we were just curious and

672
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:08,119
uh got my hands on a bag nice well I had

673
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:10,158
no idea that I cleaned I I spent like an

674
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,439
hour and a half cleaning that you had me

675
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,559
clean hemp and no one's ever going to

676
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,600
use it for medicine but that's okay it

677
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,079
was time well spent for the experiment

678
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:21,119

679
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:22,639
