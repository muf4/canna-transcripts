up some of that 22 we Bloom yeah 22 we

174
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,959
flour 22 we FL the hash that Matt had

175
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,120
that's they actually won with right

176
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:32,679
which one Matt Baron yeah yeah he he w

177
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,519
one with Barbara that was the best

178
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:37,239
[ __ ] thing I

179
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:40,480
smoked that was so good dude Matt does

180
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,000
it up man he he gives he gives love to

181
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,079
his plants you can i' I've spent time

182
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,480
with him in his garden he's gone already

183
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:53,559
too right yeah yeah I had to leave today

184
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,560
we have some of his uh water some what

185
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:01,029
[Music]

186
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,920
all right I guess we're going to get

187
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,919
back to making hash a bit

188
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:28,980
[Music]

189
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,000
okay

190
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,000
okay uh all right so the thee this is a

191
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,639
preferred method because it works

192
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,720
throughout the year and um so you can

193
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,799
use it most of the Year Without Really

194
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,399
having to change it very much much

195
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:05,958
unless the humidity levels are way too

196
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,100
low and uh stuff could get to dry too

197
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:11,558
quick

198
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,558
[Music]

199
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:52,078
the the first times you chop it with the

200
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:56,919
card seems to be a little hard but it as

201
00:15:52,078 --> 00:16:00,919
as as it goes breaking down it dries up

202
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,919
a little bit and it becomes easier

203
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,399
so he prefers this meod rather than

204
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,199
deceiving because he uh gets the

205
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,879
impression he gets to preserve more

206
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:28,879
heads if he's gentle enough with the

207
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,879
car um

208
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:32,370
[Music]

209
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:40,480
and for storage purposes it's always

210
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:44,360
storage as gray how do you store yours

211
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,639
you um when drying we're storing it out

212
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,318
on a cookie sheet um on parchment maybe

213
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,839
with a layer of paper towels underneath

214
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:54,639
that other than that with the with the

215
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,440
dryness of our climate in Colorado you

216
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,039
can uh keep it jarred up the vast

217
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,800
majority of the time I personally either

218
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:06,480
store my hash like a dark closet uh or

219
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,480
drawer or all the stord in the fridge

220
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:44,380
[Music]

221
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:53,200
so he he prefers or he

222
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,960
relates making hash to like taking care

223
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,080
of troms in a plant so when when he

224
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,558
would smoke it then he would make

225
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:05,000
extraction so not before or after kind

226
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:08,359
of that's I guess when it's possible too

227
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,359
right super

228
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:24,678
greasy and and the reason that he gives

229
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:26,798
three weeks of it to try is because he

230
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:30,480
he does he just does it as he would with

231
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:32,440
the weed anyway so

232
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,200
three

233
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,640
weeks MH yeah I could see that with this

234
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,200
humidity uh in this geographic region

235
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:45,120
that uh two to three weeks of proper

236
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,120
drawing would be um would be could be

237
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:55,399
[Music]

238
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:59,440
necessary how what's what's your times

239
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:02,280
like in the west coast Mark the West

240
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,960
in Vancouver how long do you find you

241
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,440
have to dry your n i mean in Vancouver

242
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,319
I'd say minimum 7

243
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,600
Days 7 to 10

244
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,599
even well I guess

245
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:36,720
um it it can be done in a week in here

246
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:38,038
but it's it gets it's possible to get

247
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,720
for it to get

248
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:42,960
moldy but I was just going to stress the

249
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,960
fact that we have three like different

250
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,319
geographical areas and they all seem to

251
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,519
work very different with their weather

252
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,519
so I should probably

253
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:15,180
[Music]

254
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:28,440
he he has one of he is notice among his

255
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:29,399
own variety also difference on what back

256
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,320
just

257
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,038
better

258
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:35,918
so even within their own line of strange

259
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:39,960
there's one that would

260
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,520
be better 90 than the rest or as the

261
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,640
other the rest of them present the

262
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,639
pretty good

263
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,640
73

264
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,599
as

265
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,159
for I like his gentle

266
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:17,278
style straight

267
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,120
grease straight grease and he's still

268
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:20,960
managing to get it powdered up though

269
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,558
it's kind of and I can tell the powder

270
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,319
that he's got now if he spread it

271
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,960
thinner on a bigger screen I think that

272
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:30,960
it would yeah like if you if that powder

273
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,480
that for 120 he just did he needs a

274
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,159
screen twice to three times to four

275
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,880
times the size of that pressing screen

276
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,600
more like the screen that's underneath

277
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,440
the cardboard there and that spread out

278
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,038
on that screen with the proper air

279
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,840
surface and stuff maybe even some of

280
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,480
these shammies pushed up against the

281
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:50,278
screen on the bottom it would dry this

282
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,798
hash much

283
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:58,679
faster interesting I think he's going to

284
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:58,679
transfer to the car okay um

285
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,368
[Music]

286
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,919
oh he's still he's still make he's going

287
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,119
to chop it even finer than yeah I

288
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:34,120
figured this was a first

289
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,119
level

290
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:45,599
yeah ah but he he thinks that it's how

291
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:47,679
resin resiny it is that the fact that we

292
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,839
could really get it through yeah I think

293
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,919
so too we left not enough moisture in it

294
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:56,199
it Wicked too fast we needed to pull the

295
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,440
patties and within pretty much about

296
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,440
four or 5 minutes we should have see

297
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,370
yeah if more moisture is

298
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,410
there it's

Morocco at all so doing a little dry

319
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,558
sift caring with jibs uh we just put a

320
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,839
tiny little bit of this sift I think

321
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:52,038
it's also zombie Kush sitting here with

big bud good and uh so yeah we're just

324
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,880
kind of playing around with the dry sift

325
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:00,880
Hud's been a fan of the dry sift geez I

326
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,679
guess from the right after his first

327
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,200
Legends dinner it seemed like you you

328
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,880
would really stepped it up right at that

329
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,120
point I remember seeing you be like no

330
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,760
you don't understand I want the screens

331
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,719
I need to do this I need to do this I

332
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,278
need to do this and and it's what we're

333
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,399
showing right now I'm showing the guys

334
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:20,278
is that it's very patient work there's

335
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:22,558
no rush it's just patient consistent

336
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:24,440
work so jibs is gently bringing the

337
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,200
resin back and forth we're we're in a

338
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,320
warmer environment so we have to be

339
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,120
careful uh not to create too much fr

340
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,398
friction but what he's doing here and

341
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:34,519
getting it as thin as you possibly can

342
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:37,599
and spreading it out as over as much of

343
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:40,440
the screen as he can is going to ensure

344
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,519
more surface area for more contaminant

345
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,399
if you work on a small little section of

346
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:45,480
the

347
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:47,398
screen you're just cutting your own

348
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,399
surface area down in which case you're

349
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:52,519
making this patient work even slower so

350
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:54,398
I carted for what would you say maybe 10

351
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:56,319
minutes or 7 minutes yeah at least 10

352
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:58,879
minutes yeah 10 minutes I carted for and

353
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:01,558
I got about 50% of the contam out of

354
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,200
this particular hash jibs just started a

355
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:06,720
couple of minutes ago and I suspect he's

356
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,240
going to go for a good 10 minutes and

357
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,480
then maybe we'll get Milo on there we'll

358
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,839
get big Buddha doing uh doing a little

359
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,720
bit of carting and this will be a

360
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:19,359
collaboration between uh Ripper

361
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:24,519
seeds big Buddha bubble man and

362
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:25,759
jibs fun trip oh great trip sure welcome

363
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:30,240
to

364
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,240
Spain you've known for a while yeah

365
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,519
exactly I like to collect it up too and

366
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,839
you know what another good thing is jibs

367
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,398
is working on small sections at a time

368
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,720
like breaking them into lines the way

369
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:46,558
you're breaking them into and then

370
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,079
literally working on just those little

371
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:51,200
lines I like that feedback yeah well

372
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,119
it's the smaller you work with the the

373
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,120
faster and more effective you'll be but

374
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:58,398
it's counterintuitive so you end up

375
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:01,000
working with more than you can deal with

376
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:03,558
like when I first put it was too much

377
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,278
when I put it down and that's why the

378
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:09,240
beginning of the carding for me sucked

379
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,038
yeah but it looks like it's getting a

380
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,278
little bit better slowly but surely

381
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:17,359
being cleaned up

382
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:21,319
yeah all right we're going to card for a

383
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,319
while and we'll come back to it

384
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,200
just came back and grabbed us and said

385
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,840
uh they got some stuff they want to show

386
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:57,279
us some top secret

387
00:27:50,839 --> 00:28:00,608
stuff yeah what do we got bro thank you

388
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,608
[Music]

389
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:07,240
sick oh but uh what's that we were

390
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:10,639
driving everybody out here so you can go

391
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,640
do your that's what I

392
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,798
thought see you later make sure you're

393

[Music]

397
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:32,558
the only only she's been born I'm the

398
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,960
proud father of some pure heads are you

399
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:36,720
did you do it yeah Tony is officially

400
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,000
done with a

401
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,759
s did you have too many did you have too

402
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,759
much so many

403
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:48,440
Ed up a few

404
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:51,039
times one time he woke up real food he's

405
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:54,278
like I need I need real food he was

406
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,278
waiting for the magic

407
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,480
trick [ __ ]

408
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,480
you

409
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,439
[Music]

410
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:13,319
want so that is the clearest so this was

411
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,360
very dirty

412
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:18,359
sift it had a lot of hair in it it still

413
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:20,678
does even though I've cleaned it it's

414
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:22,439
there's hair in each pile which could be

415
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:24,600
removed with a simple trick using a

416
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,038
balloon rubbing a balloon on your head

417
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,359
and spreading this thin on the screen

418
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:28,679
you could probably lift those hairs out

419
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,918
I didn't have the time to like want to

420
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,159
go through it myself but that's your

421
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,759
first grade right there which will be

422
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:37,360
very very pure

423
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:38,960
heads this will be your second grade

424
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,479
which will still be very pure heads and

425
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,480
about 10 times cleaner than most

426
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,558
people's dry sift and then this is

427
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,519
talcum powder powdery powdery powdery

428
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:49,519
feel this one with your fingers

429
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:57,980
[Music]

430
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,640
that one that'll feel a little bit

431
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,640
different

432
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:16,399
to yeah and also lower

433
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:17,918
quality if we use the high quality it

434
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:21,079
would be incredible all I can do is

435
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:25,320
purify it so it's pure but the quality

436
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:30,359
is the quality very bad much better very

437
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:30,359
good so those are your three three

438
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,879
piles that's

439
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,880
amazing

440
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:55,480
see well that's that I guess uh BR a pu

441
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,639
was really good

442
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:02,079
uh coming and hanging out and making

443
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:03,918
hash and cleaning up hash yeah no it was

444
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:09,278
really good you guys are great

445
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:11,390
