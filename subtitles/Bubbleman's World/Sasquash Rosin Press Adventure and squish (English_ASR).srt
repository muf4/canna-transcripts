00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:16,809
these guys jumped on a plane came down

00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,529
the audience

[Music]

252
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:12,759
you pull those over the plate again just

253
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,759
to show them these are made in Illinois

254
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:28,520
would do the eaters Illustrated heating

255
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:33,259
no chinese heating elements thermocouple

256
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:37,000
wires actually can you give me like a

257
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:42,099
marker to maybe label top from bottom

258
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,099
would you like me nor orange green

259
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:31,740
doesn't an easiest way to go about this

260
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:35,370
do a mother not in stuff I don't know

261
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:38,460
what well what did you do well I don't

262
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:51,299
know exactly I was bending them but that

263
00:25:38,460 --> 00:26:00,090
I don't think that bent them yeah that's

264
00:25:51,299 --> 00:26:21,269
nice yes they want to make it so they

265
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:22,139
can replace it getting it in there all

266
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:25,799
right looks good

267
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,150
so she's heating up got the new pids did

268
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,799
you want to tell me anything about this

269
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:33,530
particular little upgrade that you want

270
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:36,269
people to know about the omega pids

271
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:38,099
actually these things [ __ ] work super

272
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:41,549
super well they get to temp state of

273
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:42,990
tent the other ones kind of fluctuate

274
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:45,180
five to ten degrees

275
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,870
these ones literally will fluctuate like

276
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:51,920
Oh point one point two degrees

277
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:53,069
ridiculous how accurate they are right

278
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,140
cool

279
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:57,269
and then the thermocouple wires like I

280
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:00,770
was showing you just now yeah the top

281
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:00,769
grade is all that [ __ ]

282
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:09,220
the difference is there so we went from

283
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:12,970
ranked myself on that reddish crazy bird

284
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:16,660
nest looking [ __ ] right to this and this

285
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:20,200
is real nice gives it that flexibility

286
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:24,970
without any chance of breaking the wires

287
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:29,230
inside the maddest thing having super no

288
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:32,910
flexibility right cool man awesome and

289
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:37,049
obviously the bubble man's world plates

290
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:39,610
think it's like 250 bucks custom

291
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:44,529
anything you guys have keep a vector

292
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:45,909
files the best tweets question we gave

293
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,950
you a new box we did

294
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:54,759
hey Dad went from the handcrafted wooden

295
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:58,090
box to Washington made plastic box I'll

296
00:27:54,759 --> 00:28:00,009
accept it give thanks until it reaches

297
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:02,589
temp and then they'll stop and cool off

298
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:05,920
right but with the other ones it takes

299
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:11,619
longer to heat up but it's a lot more

300
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:16,259
accurate accurate of the heat to this

301
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:21,179
yard is badass like both man's world

302
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:21,180
it's crazy how steep it is just like

303
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,410
super-sick

304
00:28:30,628 --> 00:28:50,589
pretty much so we don't think that was

305
00:28:32,618 --> 00:28:51,788
like three or four minutes all right

306
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:56,699
don't worry about it so what is this

307
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:59,919
here is this I believe this was this

308
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:03,129
that is head banger and tell us about

309
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:06,429
the head banger is a it's a med man

310
00:29:03,128 --> 00:29:10,469
genetic you know type number two a

311
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:14,230
little purple in it very gassy fuelie so

312
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:15,819
try squishing that super gas for just

313
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,628
maybe the first thing to get squished in

314
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:18,628
the m1

315
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:29,980
a little too dry for we're used to Oh is

316
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,990
the best but I've got some Vita packs

317
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,839
honestly like you don't want to go any

318
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,660
drier than this no what do you think the

319
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:39,788
moisture content is on that right now

320
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:43,509
maybe like five percent five to eight or

321
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:44,048
something six percent somewhere right

322
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:51,759
there

323
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:54,490
alright comfortable when packing bags I

324
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,690
always get the corners with flour I mean

325
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,548
I guess anything you're working just

326
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:00,490
make sure to pack your corners up super

327
00:29:57,548 --> 00:30:04,389
well so that you don't waste any to your

328
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:07,750
fabric yeah that's very good tip I also

329
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:12,220
use this tip try not to create any air

330
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:16,720
pockets also in your anywhere oil can

331
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:19,900
find its way and sit try to just really

332
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,288
make it as tight as possible and as even

333
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,288
as possible

334
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,570
a little bit of nugget going in better

335
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,769
to have something to hold hold this [ __ ]

336
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:35,939
open

337
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:37,190
oh yeah usually as a business card from

338
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:41,370
you

339
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:43,379
designing uh bag openers right now it's

340
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:46,258
gonna be like a little your business

341
00:30:43,378 --> 00:30:47,329
card metal slide that will hold open in

342
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:55,889
each size bag

343
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:57,569
looks like a little slit I guess just

344
00:30:55,888 --> 00:31:01,128
try to break up the weed a little bit

345
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:01,128
just to avoid any voids

346
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:10,589
what would you say this look like five

347
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:14,180
grams maybe four grams it's about yeah

348
00:31:10,589 --> 00:31:14,179
about four grams

349
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:31,579
smells money for this is honestly the

350
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:36,000
biggest pain in the ass about Rossum

351
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:44,309
preparing the bag well it's definitely

352
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:48,779
not hitting the foot pedal that could

353
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:52,409
become annoying yeah the sweet is

354
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:54,389
definitely super oily right it's

355
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:58,850
sticking the bag - yeah it's like

356
00:31:54,390 --> 00:32:04,340
already sticking for it being like that

357
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:04,339
as dry as it is it's still super oily

358
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:10,190
oh [ __ ] guys shut it down oh wait we're

359
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:12,019
not living in that world anymore I

360
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:16,548
forgot this is federally licensed

361
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:19,429
property to put to possess to grow and

362
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:22,519
to process and this part of the equation

363
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:25,929
is the processing we're doing the

364
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:30,558
processing it's very valid information

365
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:35,990
people need to know it the m1 is in the

366
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:39,710
house really like that little guy yeah

367
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:42,769
we really tried to steer clear from from

368
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:44,509
looking like anything else out there you

369
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:48,200
know we really wanted our own design

370
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:53,569
again yeah after you know kind of being

371
00:32:48,200 --> 00:33:02,870
I don't want to say it copied but it's

372
00:32:53,569 --> 00:33:07,668
just jacked completed the diamond look

373
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:14,928
is definitely yeah it looks a lot like

374
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:17,110
my new unit that I have coming out just

375
00:33:14,929 --> 00:33:17,110
like that

376
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:31,699
no voids nice and evenly packed no

377
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:33,168
corners packed you spent the extra time

378
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,740
and that's definitely all it takes right

379
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:39,740
there is don't rush packing your bags

380
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:42,409
nice and even nice and even you usually

381
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,940
won't wear gloves but right and we're

382
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:46,970
just having pumping this thing today huh

383
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:49,279
oh you're that that's a very small piece

384
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:51,579
Canadian parchment paper got that

385
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:55,788
Canadian parchment paper

386
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:58,720
we call it pars made in Canada we call

387
00:33:55,788 --> 00:33:58,720
it parsh mom

388
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,799
[Music]

389
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:12,419
we don't have little things here in

390
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:13,889
Canada there we go

391
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:18,269
that's a Canadian showing them how it's

392
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:20,280
done right there you know what I just

393
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:22,259
ripped them brutal every time I go to

394
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,649
rip it and it does this huge like leaves

395
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:32,129
that big extra peat I'm just like all

396
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:34,888
right I'll go get this I think it's like

397
00:34:32,128 --> 00:34:38,489
someone's trying to even press hash or

398
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:40,070
do larger amounts of flour it's always

399
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:42,918
good to fold in the sides like this

400
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:45,480
direction basically a directional flow

401
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:47,039
burrito tech or whatever the hell we

402
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,800
used to call it in the beginning what

403
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,179
was it we'll go with the burrito tech

404
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:56,129
sounds really familiar

405
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:57,809
let's get that burrito tech goin bro and

406
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,848
then solving this mine's like the [ __ ]

407
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:07,460
you doing making your burrito so small

408
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:10,619
oh my god that makes perfect sense

409
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:12,329
[ __ ] [ __ ] it's always be that

410
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:14,910
magnet to which we don't miss house

411
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:17,279
actually no I just did the [ __ ] up at

412
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:24,059
the back I didn't really touch that

413
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:34,820
thing at all skip the plates open enough

414
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:34,820
to magnetisation

415
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,950
I always want to Center your [ __ ] out as

416
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:40,950
much as possible

417
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,470
the other pump bro it's like six pumps

418
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,599
to the bottom

419
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:53,558
I've already pumped it like 12 times

420
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:56,470
yeah oh yeah so I'm just gonna preheat

421
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:58,390
just a little a little bit kind of

422
00:35:56,469 --> 00:36:02,019
squish the material about halfway and

423
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:06,879
allowing everything to become viscous

424
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:11,170
right go from a solid to a liquid and

425
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:17,700
then we'll apply pressure only at 200

426
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:20,500
degrees so this might be a longer press

427
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:22,509
well considering my son's losing his

428
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:32,170
[ __ ] off-camera I bet you it's gonna be

429
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:34,780
very long press 200 degrees usually I

430
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:39,099
mean it could take upwards to even three

431
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:43,329
minutes to press I think people go down

432
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:46,180
to even like 180 degrees which I believe

433
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:48,400
is just crazy it takes way too long like

434
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:51,009
hell yeah tastes [ __ ] epic it tastes

435
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,798
epic for sure and would be really bummed

436
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:59,700
but a lot of times you're losing a few

437
00:36:53,798 --> 00:36:59,699
percent on your yield and a lot of time

438
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:12,800
[Music]

439
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,530
I'm gonna swap it out right now

440
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:43,368
[Music]

441
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:49,430
hmm yeah it's a single-stage ESCO really

442
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:52,369
good I think we need to go up to like

443
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:54,798
220 I'd I totally forgot we're even at

444
00:37:52,369 --> 00:38:03,079
200 and I'm like started going down like

445
00:37:54,798 --> 00:38:08,108
god it's okay but it's gonna be you get

446
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:12,339
that first one that is so it's it's -

447
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:12,338
and it's worth it if you're doing it

448
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:18,048
some butter yeah oh yeah pulling it out

449
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:22,119
cheesed out already

450
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:22,119
the whole thing's butter out yeah

451
00:38:26,259 --> 00:38:34,400
definitely repress that it likes amazing

452
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:37,098
220 225 even definitely produce a lot

453
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,088
more out of that but that is gonna be

454
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:43,150
some really tasty for shirt Wow look at

455
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:43,150
that

456
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:59,409
I've got some other bags

457
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:03,789
I think you should this is lovely by the

458
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:06,069
way yeah the beauty of this thing - it's

459
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:09,820
only 500 watts so like you can easily

460
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:12,940
run it off a small generator just pull

461
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:14,400
it out that's awesome - no I can take

462
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,950
this thing into the bush and go press

463
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:22,059
press in the bush why would I want to

464
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:32,379
press in the bush you ask lots of plants

465
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:41,889
in the bush this fitting here I just did

466
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:45,190
it yeah yes even geniuses that all the

467
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:47,889
way close hold it there and seal it up

468
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:49,809
and then go and then you dead so when I

469
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:50,679
did that the wrong way and then you

470
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:52,329
ended up pressure

471
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,769
pressurizing it a little bit it had

472
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:55,809
pressure the one way but not the other

473
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:58,860
way pressure will go in but won't come

474
00:39:55,809 --> 00:40:01,809
out and your plates will get stuck down

475
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:03,519
always tests your plates before pressing

476
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:04,900
because I've had people call and be like

477
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:09,789
do you have a whole ounce stuck in the

478
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:10,900
press and I gave you full pressure to

479
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:13,960
where you need to get a wrench to

480
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,610
actually get it to turn and open like

481
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,139
right now I just barely did it with

482
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,120
gloves and it was it was super easy

483
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:22,089
that's awesome yeah I always make sure

484
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,250
that that connection is good there's the

485
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:34,350
other hand pump why don't you have a dad

486
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:36,730
bro of your it's out dude watch nice

487
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:41,829
that was proper so he's hitting this

488
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:46,260
resin does that smell [ __ ] beautiful

489
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:49,690
sorry to cut you off 18 cups versus 6

490
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:52,830
it's called the dual stage like it flows

491
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,829
twice as much oil

492
00:40:53,679 --> 00:41:07,149
oh yeah that's oh he must have heard me

493
00:41:06,278 --> 00:41:14,260
turn the camera on

513
00:42:58,068 --> 00:43:02,380
this is the one I'm really excited about

514
00:43:07,568 --> 00:43:18,650
wow it looks almost the same size yeah

515
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:20,660
where's my where's my bikes got the the

516
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:23,858
major we're gonna see a good squish off

517
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:29,568
of the eight grams aren't we

518
00:43:23,858 --> 00:43:40,639
let's do it right boys and girls men and

519
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:42,679
women I feel like the best thing I could

520
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:44,900
do is just sit on my ass and throw all

521
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:48,879
of this hey what you got over there with

522
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,880
that pump thing there I'm thingamajiggy

523
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:59,019
three little quick gas pumps and you're

524
00:43:56,449 --> 00:43:59,018
ready to rock

525
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:15,809
I'd like to do that no it's good to see

526
00:44:13,469 --> 00:44:18,179
like little mistakes and recoveries and

527
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:21,000
sort of flap upward so it's easier to

528
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:23,039
grab so you don't slide your bag across

529
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,360
your freshly made Razi

530
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:41,070
it's always talking about that little

531
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:42,599
there we go pre squish depending on what

532
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,280
temperature you're at your pre squish is

533
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:47,489
gonna be between like five to ten

534
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:51,090
seconds not really mm-hmm much

535
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:53,399
I always just did it intuitively and

536
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:56,850
sometimes like I mean a lot of times two

537
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:59,039
people don't do a preheat right it's not

538
00:44:56,849 --> 00:45:00,719
always recommended with certain strains

539
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,150
sometimes just want to [ __ ] start

540
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,459
dumping instantly

541
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:08,700
so uh what preheats not really nice like

542
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:13,380
this bike pretty my dark and your

543
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:18,079
product and with certain strains so

544
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:18,079
there's no we should actually got you a

545
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:48,409
gauge pressure gauge I can get one so

546
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:48,410
this is a month old to like three months

547
00:45:53,659 --> 00:46:01,558
taking care of dude for sure smell it

548
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:01,559
[Music]

549
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:23,619
you try to get most of it out on the

550
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:26,949
first scratch as well oh yeah for sure

551
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:31,299
90% a lot of times there does nothing

552
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:34,029
comes out on the second grip yeah like I

553
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,769
don't do second presses just because

554
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:37,360
there's nothing there something else

555
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:41,079
yeah I'll give them the people who've

556
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:45,099
make it up both but yeah some people

557
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:48,750
make like coconut capsules just whatever

558
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:58,730
took them down with some coconut oil

559
00:46:48,750 --> 00:47:05,820
just make some capsules see that purple

560
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:09,570
[Music]

561
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,570
well done Neal

562
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:15,599
[ __ ] yeah daddy I think I want to get my

563
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:20,340
macro lens out and shoot this wheres

564
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:23,610
myself it's such a nice color look at

565
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:26,730
just so people over we're here you want

566
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:29,370
to see this you can see the corners of

567
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:31,920
the bag when when the weed is packed in

568
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:35,279
here it wasn't squared out yeah so these

569
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:41,070
corners after the fold when you make the

570
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:43,110
fold it got some oil trapped so like

571
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:47,550
what you want to do is try to square out

572
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:49,860
everything as much as possible make it

573
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:54,090
nice and square not have any kind of

574
00:47:49,860 --> 00:48:01,559
rounded edges so that when you fold it

575
00:47:54,090 --> 00:48:04,019
over it has no voids in the corners try

576
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:11,989
to make sure those corners are packed up

577
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:11,989
as well first this is at 220 with the

578
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:20,070
head banging right came out a little and

579
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:24,090
we haven't actually wrapped these up yet

580
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:29,610
we should gather all this and we can oh

581
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:47,880
yeah I think it's less less of an amount

582
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:50,630
that we're pressing I'll get this one

583
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,630
we'll be able to

thing about resins nicer it peels up the

589
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:49,720
way this is so stable too with smells

590
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:52,559
the way I already know it hits and this

591
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:52,559
was eight grams

592
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:43,639

for it wants the oh yeah all right so

596
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:47,750
let's see what this is that ended up

597
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:47,750
being two point three holy crap eight

598
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:57,719
25% would be you two so it's two point

599
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:58,820
three twenty eight twenty nine percent

600
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:02,309
or something

601
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:16,980
thirty percent yield on that where's my

602
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:24,779
bike that's a beautiful beautiful and

603
00:52:16,980 --> 00:53:02,849
this is the other one here yeah okay

604
00:52:24,780 --> 00:53:12,240
sure yeah what was two point eight order

605
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:15,380
five or something could be could be just

606
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:17,489
moved to point seven as you said that

607
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,450
128 it's back to point it's back to

608
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:23,299
point eight we're good we're good

609
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:26,909
did we say 4.50 just on the back here oh

610
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:29,640
she produced I mean even then you can

611
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:30,269
probably impressed it lower and this

612
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:33,449
will either

613
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:37,759
I usually press up to ten perfect like a

614
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:37,759
I usually press set up to ten excuses

615
00:53:42,809 --> 00:54:00,840
hitting Z Faberge egg aunt Ziva is my

616

all right we've decided that that's

620
00:54:34,568 --> 00:54:38,528
enough pressing of rosin it's been a

621
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:43,179
good day though hasn't it team of rows

622
00:54:38,528 --> 00:54:44,798
and pressors now we're gonna head to the

623
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:46,538
salmon house on the hill I doubt I'm
