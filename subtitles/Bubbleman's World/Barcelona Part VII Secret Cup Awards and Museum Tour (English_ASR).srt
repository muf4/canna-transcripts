people can really fathom or understand

54
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,479
the level of collecting that had to

55
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:03,039
happen before a place like this could

56
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:05,039
exist so um hats off to Ben for creating

57
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,078
such an incredible collection preserving

58
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,759

236
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:44,919
in my head to work my

237
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,759

totally bewildered so yeah so

383
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,279
essentially think about it like you're

384
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,840
you're turning the resin heads right

385
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:35,079
uh into a liquid and they will be pushed

386
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:37,519
out from the side of the bug so yeah

387

407
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,558
the wall okay that would have been

408
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,559
something looking at at at the display

409
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:43,440
people are doing that no way yeah no way

410
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:46,440
yeah the original paint I know you know

411
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,919
he didn't paint over it he had it

412
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,240
revealed yeah that's original he didn't

413
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:54,000
that's why it's not like popping popping

414
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,440
he didn't have it repainted he had it

415
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,079
unveiled it's unbelievable man you know

416
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,519
how much more money it is to uncover

417
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:05,439
and just paint it over holy smokes true

418
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:08,440
restoration so we got this Bud

419
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,759
here and then we got this

420
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:15,080
thing pretty riing hot getting it up to

421
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:17,679
temperature this is a true Testament to

422
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:22,319
how much resin is on the bud too cuz and

423
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,320
then you come over here and you go like

424
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,880
this so this way you can see also how

425
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,079
much oily it is

426
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,559
right and there's a little little tiny

427
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:33,839
dab on it we'll try it again wow I

428
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,678
wouldn't say much no no no but it

429
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,439
depends it varies from Bud to Bud if

430
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,798
there's a lot of RA we were gifted this

431
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,880
so I can't speak to what it is yeah like

432
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,038
the other day someone gave us a

433
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,120
beautiful Bud we squeezed the dab out of

434
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:49,319
it but then someone else gave us a bud

435
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:52,119
and we got like three Dabs out of it I

436
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:55,519
see what's happening you can see the oil

437
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:57,439
now little bits squeeze it first time

438
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,400
really

439
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,200
hard

440
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,200
yeah now it's wa

441
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:09,799
for now the but should be wa for

442
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:12,038
I yeah that's

443
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:14,240
one yeah which is what you'd expect out

444
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:16,558
of a bud a small little bud I think

445
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,679
that's one it will be when he collects

446
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,440
it

447
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:24,320
up here collect it up well I see why

448
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,919
it's $100 a gr I see why it's $100 a

449
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,399
they have to show it to him with

450
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,240
hash it's good bu than you

451
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,038
do you want to try dabbing it Mark we'll

452
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,038
we yeah collect it

453
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:47,440
for the parchment paper is great yeah

454
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:50,278
parchment and the the slick sheet oil

455
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,720
just picks the resin up

456
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:55,880
beautiful you see how the dabs Gathering

457
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,880
now on the on the edge of

458
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
the

459
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,798
all right that's kind of

460
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,320
fun

461
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:18,440
right get you to hold this

462
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:23,000
pipe beautiful oh the Dil or electric H

463
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,000
this is a dabinator from Germany all

464
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,760
right so that was on a bud like 10

465
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,120
seconds ago and now Mark's dabbing it

466
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:38,079
wow it surprised me it is that's the

467
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:41,599
part that really is surprising you know

468
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:43,199
that you just dabed that bud yeah well

469
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:46,319
that was an interesting

470
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,480
process well think of how many years

471
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:52,000
that was definitely one good hit low

472
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,399
side of it from that same amount of bud

473
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,480
I've seen three times three times same

474
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:59,599
as me and that would be too much so you

475
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,640
know but it's no I mean that

476
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,038
it's good way to determine potency like

477
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,679
take one gr and see what you can get out

478
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:07,278
of that one G see how far it will take

479
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,159
you it's a great way to test butt if

480
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:12,599
you're buying pounds as a dispensary to

481
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,278
a great way as a breeder to test tpine

482
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:15,278
and oil

483
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,520
content exactly you're but you're a

484
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,440
Compassion Club buying pounds we want to

485
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,519
see the resin content squeeze a bud you

486
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,360
can weigh the bud before you squeeze it

487
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:28,918
Mark and then you weigh the bud after

488
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:31,439
you squeeze it and you find out

489
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,120
the weight of resin on the

490
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,480
plant yeah all right we're going to try

491
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:38,719
with the moist but that's moist and

492
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,038
given to us by someone else moist butt

493
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:46,640
okay a little different sure all right

494
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:51,079
more pressing

495
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,799
I we saw him yesterday together the blue

496
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:57,240
the blue

497
00:25:52,798 --> 00:26:01,000
blue was there it was from a purle fresh

498
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:04,319
ptuh yeah from a fresh Bud it was it was

499
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,839

n and if you want to follow the kid on

510
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:56,639
Instagram who really came up with the

511
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,960
idea of squishing buds his name is soil

512
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,440
grown would it be fair say that if you

513
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,519
took the bud apart into little pieces

514
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,960
and then likees it's better the smaller

515
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:09,278
the pieces the more you get out he uses

516
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:12,600
a t-shirt press and and puts like 12

517
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:15,159
buds in at a time with big sheets of

518
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:17,398
parchment we have to make it with hash

519
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:19,278
smell S I don't know but this is the

520
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:22,798
travel method

521
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:25,558
you this is like anybody can steal their

522
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:29,319
sister's hair iron instead of like

523

too what happens in the we're going to

529
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:49,038

530
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:51,558
hash into high grade oil well this is

531
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:54,398
nice grade hash yeah yeah we'll turn it

532

call it is still in its primitive stages

662
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,639
that it's using

663
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,559
hair and when it turns into using

664
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,159
different temperatures and finding

665
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:16,239
different activation levels I mean so

666
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:19,800
much potential at that leftover gummy

667
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,959
gooy and now it's like power and and

668
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,639
from my perspective I can tell you for a

669
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,800
fact this is definitely less than half

670
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,639
of what I gave you yeah so we got more

671
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,720
than 50% return out of

672
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,000
that an

673
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,759
ashay oh yeah right

674
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,320
there thank you so much all right now we

675
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:45,119
have the dry sift to rosin up oh nice so

676
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,679
we'll go right from Bud water hash to

677
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,039
dry sift I would like a DA that one

678
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:54,639
excellent well we're that's he's up next

679
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:57,400
the re whatever you would like Ros who

680
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,640
wants that no just put put in that rock

681
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,599
or something yeah like if you put in too

682
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,679
much it's not efficient what you want

683
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,079
right here and I will do I want to share

684
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:09,000
with the it's not

685
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,960
just we're just turning it into dabs

686
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,838
yeah yeah how many dabs would you like

687
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,838
as many as we can get all right then

688
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,838
they're all there how much did you put

689
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,720
in twist it

690
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:28,880
[Music]

691
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:30,559
up that's a SE Cup represent yeah

692
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,358
you're doing this with a how do you feel

693
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,119
high smoking decar weed well it's not so

694
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,199
decarbed everything you smoke is

695
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,838
decarbed cuz when you burn it you decarb

696
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,439
oxalate it this temperature is not

697
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:44,880
enough to decar that's why when Jeff had

698
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,880
his tested a

699
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,639
of%

700
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,480
sure we'll get it so that

701
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,400
that the test means that the heat

702
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,280
obviously it would be the first one to

703
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,920
be gone for sure the Turin are being

704
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,960
affected but activated and destroyed not

705
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,960
necessarily at this

706
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,760
point from the scientific perspective

707
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,599
when you test the material after you do

708
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,400
it de decarbox silation doesn't

709
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:31,559
generally Take 2 minutes unless you use

710
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,358
like 5 or 600° plus of heat which is

711
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:38,000
like when you burn a joint or take a

712
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:39,078
dab but this is 5 10 seconds it's not

713
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,880
just not

714
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,560
enough yeah and and you know if you put

715
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,680
a little bit more in there like looks

716
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:50,159
nice you should dab that too much you

717
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:52,679
got line heat you know so there's a fine

718
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,838
balance with this technique but when you

719
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:57,838
upscale it what about doing it without

720
00:36:54,838 --> 00:37:00,759
the screen I just want the PIP um your

721
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:03,358
contaminant runs with the oil I'm going

722
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,280
to give it back to you in a

723
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:09,199
second no problem he just wants to take

724
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,200
a picture you want a picture of this

725
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,240
pipe this does to be a big dab I'll just

726
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,519
give you a little dunk okay there you go

727
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:22,039
a little dunk I'll do you mark and then

728

no purging and no butane so here's a

823
