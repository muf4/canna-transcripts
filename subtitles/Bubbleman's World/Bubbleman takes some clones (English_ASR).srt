00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:23,910
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,849
thanks for joining us today on this

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,160
beautiful sunny afternoon today I'm

5
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,929
quite excited because I'm going to be

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,768
taking a couple of cuts from two of my

7
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:35,399
favorites

8
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:38,850
sativas the sweet skunk and the combi

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,530
leaves so I was thinking about how I was

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,660
gonna go about doing this and I was

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,359
figuring I'm going to cut a fairly large

12
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:47,849
I basically had to top the sweet skunk

13
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,308
anyway today about here I had to cut it

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,780
almost a third of it off and I figured

15
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:53,579
rather than just cut that off and not

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,710
actually use it I could grow myself a

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,960
nice plant rather than cut it into four

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,448
or five available clones I'm just gonna

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,920
take it and do one large clone kind of

20
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:03,750
as an experiment I haven't done this for

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,280
a long time since back in the day I'd

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:10,618
say 25 years ago I experimented with a

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,799
process called air layering not sure if

24
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,618
any of you were familiar but it involves

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,850
cutting some grooves into the stalk

26
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:20,159
wrapping a medium that you then keep

27
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:22,739
moist after applying rooting hormone of

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,140
some sort powder or gel injecting that

29
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,390
material whether it be rock wool or some

30
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,009
sort of soilless mixture to keep it

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,609
moist over the course of a ten to 12-day

32
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,099
period and roots appear even without a

33
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:37,650
clone having been taken it ensures

34
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:40,199
rooting so then you can then cut below

35
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,790
that and plant it's slower than cloning

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,560
but for this particular purpose I want

37
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,720
to cut a mother plant down and I want to

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,618
have myself a bigger plant right away

39
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,209
rather than many small plants so we're

40
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:53,790
gonna do that today we've got Remos

41
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:58,339
roots cloning gel that i've been using

42
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:00,930
so far this hasn't done me wrong and

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,780
I've got myself a couple of bucks here

44
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,170
that I've saturated with some water

45
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:10,929
squeeze them out so they don't

46
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:14,469
completely full we go and yeah get ready

47
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:16,680
to cut the seats come here so I think

48
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:19,330
with the sweet skunk I'm going to take

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,120
one large one but at the same time I

50
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:29,020
also want to take a few small ones so

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:31,800
we're gonna cut it right here do the

52
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:41,530
scissors trick so when I do cut it that

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:44,230
seals the deal all right so that's

54
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,409
sealed perfectly around the stem of that

55
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:50,109
stock and so you see that's actually a

56
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:52,209
quite a large cut to be taking as a

57
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:59,040
clone but what I was thinking of doing

58
00:02:52,209 --> 00:03:02,959
was peeling off this bottom one John

59
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:05,560
her fellow style

60
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,560
right

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:13,050
just get that gelled up that gives us

62
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:25,100
one perfect little sweet Scout clone and

63
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:28,670
one big giant sweet skunk clone as I

64
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:30,949
pulled the stem off that little clone as

65
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:33,019
I pulled it off alone off it stripped

66
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:35,780
the stalk of a piece of material fiber

67
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,250
opening it which is why I brought the

68
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,400
the cloning gel there and that's gonna

69
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:45,439
help me with my cloning so imagine

70
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:50,180
taking a clone this big now that's a

71
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:52,699
clone full plant now we're gonna cut

72
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,409
that down a few more times actually did

73
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:59,329
you imagine though we'll be right back

74
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:02,210
alright so we're back we've got our big

75
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,340
monster momma clone here that is just a

76
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,580
little bit too big even for a big clone

77
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:12,200
so we're gonna cut it down to sections

78
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:22,069
I'm gonna do that simply take this guy

79
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:25,149
off a little bit of a dip I'm gonna peel

80
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,149
this guy off as well

81
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:40,408
just a little snip see what we got here

82
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,408
nice big troll

83
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:49,589
these leaves are Giants so we're gonna

84
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:59,550
clap them it's too too big of a leaf for

85
00:04:49,589 --> 00:05:11,758
too small of a clone don't need it so we

86
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:13,530
got that guy we got this guy deck all

87
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,270
right so we've got two little guys left

88
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:21,179
on here and so I'm just going to do

89
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:25,159
John's little little trick for these

90
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,160
guys which is just peel them right off

91
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:42,859
the day loving this taking the sweet

92
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:47,300
skunk clones I have to tell you

93
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,300
something I'm definitely stoked on

94
00:05:53,449 --> 00:06:01,500
okay alright so for for sweets gun

95
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,970
clones have just been taken I'm gonna go

96
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,889
get these guys sprayed and under the

97
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:07,320
dome and we'll come back and we will do

98
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:11,849
the same thing to the congolese stay

99
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:15,209
tuned alright guys welcome back to Belle

100
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:17,490
man's world we're going to take the

101
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:20,669
congolese cuts quite excited about this

102
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,740
I have to say just waiting as for as

103
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,050
long as I did to acquire this strain and

104
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,759
it's I've had it just a couple of weeks

105
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,639
and now I'm already able to take a clone

106
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,759
or two so I've got a couple of pucks

107
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:36,089
prepared here I've got my Remos roots

108
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,189
rooting gel in the house and I've got my

109
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:41,250
Congolese so I think we're gonna go

110
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:44,339
right from the top here my little

111
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:47,209
scissor trick with a little bit of a bit

112
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:47,209
of gel on there

113
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:58,160
alright I'm gonna come in here angle

114
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:58,159
take that guy

115
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:10,300
finding its new home all right

116
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:21,000
one Congolese number two coming up

117
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:21,000
number two I think you're over here

118
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:44,090
alright number two well that felt great

119
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:45,800
to take a couple of Congolese clones and

120
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,888
I'll keep you guys updated on to how

121
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,060
long it takes them to root and hopefully

122
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,658
we'll be able to give at least one of

123
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,389
them away

124
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:55,389
keep watching bubble man's world peace

125
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:01,850
hey welcome to bubble man's world

126
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,668
everybody I'm back here with another

127
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:08,509
update on my garden I have here the

128
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:10,909
Barbara bud and the Afghani from the

129
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:12,740
great gardener I have not taken a cut

130
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,830
for myself off of these I have taken a

131
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,210
just a single one off each one for John

132
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:20,359
which we updated you about a week ago

133
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:23,388
and his are just rooting now and I

134
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,370
figured I would actually sort of cut

135
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,490
into these and start gaining and getting

136
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:31,629
some cuts from them I've got five bucks

137
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:35,649
apiece for each strain so a total of ten

138
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:39,408
and I guess what we'll start with is

139
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:42,820
adding the water got some nice real warm

140
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:46,250
water here which of course John be

141
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,140
taught me the trick if you want to sort

142
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,379
of you know these can take a much longer

143
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:54,649
time if you don't use as warm water and

144
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:57,559
this will just ensure that they sooner

145
00:08:54,649 --> 00:09:01,089
than later absorb that water and then

146
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:01,088
fill up get up to size

147
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:09,610
all right now I'm just Darrin your

148
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:13,269
exploded thanks all right so while those

149
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:15,100
are filling up with water

150
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:17,860
hydrating I've got a little plate here

151
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,240
of some are Ian's Hayes dry sip that I

152
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,919
clean for the great gardener recently

153
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,039
I've got a couple of grades here and I

154
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:26,649
figure we would just take a rip or two

155
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:30,990
while we were at it here just table down

156
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,990
there safety D nail in hand

157
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:56,939
absolutely love the haze it is no

158
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:59,879
coincidence that I named that we named

159
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:02,700
our son his middle name is haze I love

160
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,789
the haze there's no doubt about it all

161
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:12,390
right these jumped up real nice in size

162
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:15,299
pretty much got right to size later so

163
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:18,299
we'll just get these sort of minorly

164
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:23,490
squeezed out from all the water that

165
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:24,829
they've absorbed get them up there super

166
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,930
beautiful day here in British Columbia

167
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:32,700
as you could probably notice from the

168
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:34,769
view behind me it's 80 85 degrees

169
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,940
Fahrenheit right now we're just quite

170
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:38,269
nice for this time of year for British

171
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,270
Columbia

172
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:55,399
okay I got these out of here I'll be

173
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,930
able to rearrange things a little bit a

174
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,059
little bit tricky when you have all

175
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:00,289
these different things especially

176
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:02,659
priceless dry slipped on the table we'll

177
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:08,480
put that back over there and we'll get

178
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:11,329
this warm water under there all right

179
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,070
I've got my Remos roots which is what

180
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:17,360
I'm gonna be using today to do my

181
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:20,090
cloning little pair of scissors that's

182
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,529
pretty much all we need really put the

183
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,350
DNA louver there I guess we'll start

184
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:26,569
with let's start with Barbara we know of

185
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,029
course a part of me just wants to cut

186
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,800
these tops and bring this plant down in

187
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:32,269
size and whenever I cut a plant like

188
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,889
that I have a hard time just throwing it

189
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:38,720
away I'd love to take these monster

190
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:41,689
clones however I'm not equipped so we're

191
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:47,899
going to take nice small reasonable size

192
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:49,910
qualms today I love the real roots just

193
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:52,069
a little piece on the lid I use the lid

194
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:55,069
I almost never used the other time I'll

195
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,530
dip in there but the lid has more than

196
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:01,750
enough gel on it that you can get that

197
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:05,649
job done so let's look around in here

198
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,649
for a beautiful little clone

199
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,480
LaBarbara

200
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,509
why

201
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:32,090
we'll put barber over here we'll keep

202
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,089
Barbara separate from

203
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:39,959
from the rest all right

204
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:54,189
yeah these are good feel a little bit

205
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:58,040
warm but not too bad okay next up

206
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:59,840
Barbara bud with some perfect little

207
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:02,110
clothes in here as to matter of finding

208
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,110
them

209
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,430
I scooped it on there quite a bit I

210
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,889
don't really overdo it but I definitely

211
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:22,909
put on a decent amount of cloning gel

212
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:25,250
number two barbra nice little clones

213
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:27,559
these leaves at this point are okay I

214
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,149
have a lot of room in my dome but often

215
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:32,529
I would cut these down a little bit if I

216
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:32,529
have them squeezed in a lot tighter

217
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,949
of course sometimes below towards the

218
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:54,069
bottom the the little ones seem very

219
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,360
strong in the stock so I don't

220
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,710
personally have a preference I mean I

221
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,330
haven't grown in 20 years so I don't

222
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,720
pretend to know what's what works better

223
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:07,030
and this that the other thing but just

224
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:10,269
doing some honest cloning I've had a

225
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:13,419
hundred percent rate so far since I

226
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:15,069
started and I pretty much had that back

227
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,809
in the day when I was doing this I just

228
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,340
find if you pay attention and keep them

229
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:21,879
hydrated and make sure that you're not

230
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:23,769
you know too high or too low of a pH and

231
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:27,820
over you know don't overfeed them when

232
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:28,899
they're young babies and Lynne sack

233
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,650
they're landed on and kind of freak me

234
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:34,629
out for a second he's friendly though so

235
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:37,629
yeah we've got three let's take two more

236
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:46,179
two more Barb's there's a nice one right

237
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:47,710
in the center here doesn't have any bend

238
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:50,399
in it I'll be able to put this one in

239
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,400
right straight

240
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:05,680
for Barb's one more to go

241
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:08,289
I know I held up two fingers just making

242
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:13,198
sure you're paying attention one more to

243
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:13,198
go all right barb

244
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,810
let's take one off the top

245
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:47,019
number five

246
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:49,029
those are five pretty good-looking

247
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:51,159
clones that'll go into the dome in a few

248
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:54,839
minutes here I think they're fine to

249
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:57,429
wait while I take five off the Afghani

250
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,139
so both of these are just I can't

251
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:01,269
imagine not having them in my stable now

252
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:03,610
that I have them it's a strange thing to

253
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:06,399
rely on a friend for a particular flavor

254
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,470
or resin it's it's very nice when your

255
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:13,689
friend can just say you know what here's

256
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:17,070
the strain do well with it my attempt

257
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,070
with what I'm doing here

258
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,748
and these will be marked in the domes

259
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:43,519
ASAP as well I'm not going to be mixing

260
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:48,899
them these five will stay in here one

261
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:50,490
seems so loose there's a bummer one

262
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:55,318
seems you know what I think that's a

263
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:57,299
leaf that I could cut this cuts down on

264
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:58,860
that weight and pulling the plant around

265
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,990
and moving it around and that lets it

266
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,639
sort of stabilize the plant is focused

267
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,669
on producing roots it's not worried

268
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,959
about those particular leaves and often

269
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:08,730
you'll notice on your clothes when you

270
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,980
take them those particular leaves end up

271
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:18,439
dying and falling off they're not super

272
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:18,439
important so all right has been taken

273
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:39,418
I cut these leaves as well

274
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:48,179
all right missile Afghani she's more to

275
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:50,918
go

276
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:53,740
I'm feel very blessed to be able to sit

277
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:55,299
here of all the places and just be able

278
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,220
to take my clones bring them back into

279
00:17:55,298 --> 00:17:59,558
my dome but the mothers back in the tent

280
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,210
it's a it's a blessing that I really do

281
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:03,190
hope for all of you out there and I know

282
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,509
some of you have it even better I look

283
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,538
sometimes if some of you guys in

284
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:09,308
California and whatnot all the amazing

285
00:18:07,538 --> 00:18:11,138
things you guys are doing out there with

286
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:13,619
you know the ability of these two

287
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:16,628
hundred gallon pots that you can plant

288
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:18,459
big multi pound plants that you grow

289
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:22,449
some coolest about some beautiful ones

290
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,370
each year and some other people alright

291
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:29,288
there's number three on the Afghani I'm

292
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:32,768
gonna trim that leaf down as well just

293
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:36,730
the one is good it's so much more secure

294
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:38,138
and we have two left two Afghani it's

295
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,750
such a treat because you're literally

296
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:43,209
picking another line we're picking this

297
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:48,628
planet to create another another another

298
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:52,319
plant it's a very cool concept the clone

299
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:52,319
well it's pretty nice

300
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:56,969
it's pretty good in there

301
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,809
somebody lovely little combs on these

302
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:09,670
plants these particular ones were quite

303
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:12,399
healthy and grown-up when Matt gave them

304
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:13,840
to me they've gotten even more happy

305
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,870
since they spent the time here on the

306
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:23,649
deck and now to think just BAM boom BAM

307
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:27,759
like that I'll have a bunch more it's a

308
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:30,600
very very cool all right let's get you

309
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:30,599
out of the way here

310
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:42,470
that's the one nice and tall cut it at a

311
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:43,119
45 angle I always cut at a 45-degree

312
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,529
angle

313
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,239
sure house over here important this is

314
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:49,420
they can even cut that down a little

315
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,420
more

316
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,019
and she goes

317
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:12,199
[Music]

318
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:15,740
so there we have five Afghani clones and

319
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,660
five Barbara bud clones definitely don't

320
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,599
mix these up for the time being I'm

321
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:25,640
gonna take this barbed tag I'm gonna

322
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:27,889
throw it in two LaBarbera top don't

323
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,470
underestimate your own ability to get

324
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:32,060
too stoned and mix up your plants it's

325
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,710
such a shame it's one of the things I

326
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:35,509
believe we should really sort of step up

327
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:38,390

rip on the RMT's just because it really

337
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:07,150
is quite nice it's got that old-school

338
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:07,149
flavor

339
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:39,539
um sure is a beautiful day out here

340
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:41,460
today let's sit for a bit and enjoy this

341
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:44,879
view and we'll catch up with you inside

342
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:47,220
when I've got the plants in there see in

343
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,070
a bit alright guys so we're back here in

344
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:54,569
my room I've got the barb clones right

345
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:56,970
here I managed to write down Barb and

346
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:59,849
afghani I've got the base of the dome

347
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:02,279
right here so I'm just gonna put five

348
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:14,429
and five on one side five on the other

349
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:16,289
and so barb first goes in there to this

350
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,880
one little bar kind of leaned over I

351
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:19,859
didn't realise but I set it down for

352
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,970
about five minutes without the dome in

353
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:25,799
my in front of my window and the the

354
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,960
drape blew out of the way and the Sun

355
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:29,460
came down just on that one plant but I

356
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,250
have faith that we'll bring it back I

357
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:36,440
just sprayed them before it came back in

358
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,440
so there's five Barb's

359
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:43,529
that's more spray just to have the whole

360
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:46,470
its moisture inside the dome everywhere

361
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:54,480
nice to have that moisture trapped in

362
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:57,200
there they start like that bar back and

363
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:02,110
these afghani just look awesome

364
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:07,990
one two

365
00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:10,419
three four and five

366
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:21,460
just think that's almost the same amount

367
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:22,058
of don't look so healthy there one there

368
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,170
we go

369
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:29,440
so I also spray the inside of the dome

370
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:30,100
these particular domes close and open on

371
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,009
top

372
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:35,168
I suggest having enclosed in the

373
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:36,789
beginnings when the planet really needs

374
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:38,620
that moisture level especially if you're

375
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:41,019
using these new lights that I use and

376
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:47,709
I'm about to show you the ones that John

377
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:50,019
mentioned just the other day yeah they

378
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:53,980
just have little lids that slide open on

379
00:23:50,019 --> 00:24:03,339
both sides just slide this right in here

380
00:23:53,980 --> 00:24:05,410
okay here we go this is the light I'm

381
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:09,189
using someone that John brought over but

382
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:10,919
nanotech t5 reflector pretty nice t like

383
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:17,400
t5 with a with its own singular

384
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:17,400
reflector right here

385
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:28,099
then it fits fits right into the dome so

386
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,350
boom

387
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:32,129
