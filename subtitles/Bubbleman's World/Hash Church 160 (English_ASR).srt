88
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,219
experience that happens out in social

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,500
media out of Instagram or Twitter or

90
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:35,879
Facebook or all these things it kind of

91
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,169
got a little heated there for a while

92
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,969

93

96
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,199
thank both of you guys for for coming in

97
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,389
and being willing to do that especially

98
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,949
in this day and age where you know

99
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:52,229
people might be a little bit freaked out

100
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:53,458
it's like oh no there's disagreement in

101
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:55,500
the community well we thrive on

102
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,019
disagreement here in hash Church I think

103
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,300
it's you know apples and apples is less

104
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,610
than apples and oranges and so that's my

105
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,760
metaphor I love the I'm all about the

106
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,950
quiver in this day and age of

107
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:10,709
information so I'm happy to have both

108
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:11,699
sides here on on in hash Church and I

109
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,550
think we can have a great little

110
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,529
conversation in regards to you know in

111
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,879
regards to both what you guys are both

112
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,679
doing because I thought maybe a good

113
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,209
idea would be to maybe have Jeremy give

114
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,100
us a little background on build a soil

115
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,918
and let us know what he's been up to and

116
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,340
then we can start the discussion in

117
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,519
regards

118
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:32,339
- you know some of the I guess I would

119
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,168
call it dramas that occurred in the last

120
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:37,769
couple of weeks did you want to also

121
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:41,219
maybe introduce your guest Peter yeah

122
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:43,228

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:58,800
that you've got quite a few questions

128
00:04:53,370 --> 00:05:01,290
for me and the reason actually everybody

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,530

130

132
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,639
so thank you making the time to speak

I before I introduce you yeah I just I

135
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,720
just wanted to say one thing really

136
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:23,339
briefly I wanted to share a few things

137
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:27,680

on

141

but I've actually been able to realize

142
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:44,929
that this whole thing has really been

143
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:47,909

00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,420
20 years and I know how hard it is so I

167
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,579
can personally relate to to how you know

168
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:52,060
he wants to protect his clients so I

169
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:53,469
have I've no anger towards you Jeremy or

170
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,870
the way that you've done things I

171
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,150
respect you for your work and the things

172
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,040
that you're doing for the industry so on

173
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:02,979
a serious level man thank you thank you

174
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:06,879
for that and and Shannon I'm sorry I

175
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:09,490
just wanted to say that I wanted this is

176
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,579
Shannon way she's in charge of our

177
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,079
company's public statements and PRS and

178
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:16,149
we're both going to pretty much like

179
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,449
take notes and try to learn as much as

180
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:21,279
we can from this business meeting so so

181
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:24,569
the first thing we're curious about is

182
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:27,189
Jeremy's thoughts on the white paper

183
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:29,319
that we put out after we hear of course

184
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:31,089
about him this company so yeah and just

185
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,889
before Jeremy starts what I wanted to

186
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:34,899
let everyone know that I had never heard

187
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:36,339
of Jeremy or build a soil before but

188
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,929
there's a lot of people in the community

189
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:40,239
that I haven't heard about but one thing

190
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,990
I'll really say about Jeremy is he had

191
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,759
an increment

192
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,710
credible group of people back in them

193
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,089
Jeremy may have come across aggressive

194
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:48,859
but yeah that's because he's looking out

195
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:51,379
for us he always has been looking out

196
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,819
for us and man people had great [ __ ]

197
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:55,069
things to say about you and it's why I

198
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:56,779
felt like you know what if this guy is

199
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,980
the way people are saying he is then

200
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:00,019
we're gonna have to we're gonna be able

201
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,050
to have a great conversation I know it

202
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:04,579
so go ahead Jeremy and give yourself a

203
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,360
little introduction there tell us about

204
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:10,569
your company and okay yeah my name is

205
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,430
Jeremy for those of you that don't know

206
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:14,870
Bill the soil is a website that started

207
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,709
actually right here and in my kitchen

208
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:21,050
and I'm just kind of got built from the

209
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:23,000
ground up and really what set us apart

210
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,590
as unique from day one is we didn't open

211
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,410
the same catalogue that everyone else

212
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:29,719
had to distribute products from and so

213
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:33,110
while we're not a manufacturer like like

214
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,759
their product is we wanted to reach out

215
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,529
to other manufacturers that have the

216
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:39,319
same goals with us and we realized right

217
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:41,959
away they were hard to find because they

218
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,350
didn't have huge marketing budgets they

219
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:48,560
were aligned with a major agronomy or

220
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,180
farming outside of our industry or there

221
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,589
was just really hard to find him in one

222
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:53,719
place where shipping was an issue so

223
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,940
bill the soil was born to solve the

224
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,100
issue of sourcing quality organic

225
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,710
ingredients or ingredients for no-till

226
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,909
and for that type of farming and then

227
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,650
putting them in one place where we can

228
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:06,409
start to combine the shipping bundle and

229
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:09,500
lower that burden and since then it's

230
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:10,639
been really rewarding we've been able to

231
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,529
look at a ton of different Bowl I

232
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,360
actually looked at soil balance Pro from

233
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:17,929
kind of from that perspective to bring

234
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,279
it on or build a soil and I didn't pay

235
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:20,809
too much attention because we have a

236
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,370
number of other products and one of my

237
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:25,849
rules is I don't want to confuse my

238
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:28,909
customers um and I don't want to offer

239
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:31,040
every product that's out there I want to

240
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:33,079
offer ones that we have personal

241
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,659
experience with and we can translate

242
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,180
that to our customers and so that being

243
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:39,829
said it got to the point where we

244
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:41,120
started to get a lot of questions about

245
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,400
soil balance probe because they were

246
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,100
doing a very good job getting into the

247
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,199
marketplace so at that point in my

248
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,090
opinion the way the universe works is

249
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,690
that when you hear about things multiple

250
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,759
times

251
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,800
kinda like a sign to start doing more

252
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,399
research and so that's what happened and

253
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,379
I

254
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,149
well you know totally mr. meyen it was

255
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:01,970
like a series of events where I was

256
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:03,500
definitely excited because I kind of

257
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,960
hold on thread and it started to come

258
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,769
loose and that hadn't happened before at

259
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,950
least when I started researching

260
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:12,500
products in the way this happened and so

261
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:14,780
I just like I normally do view things in

262
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,129
a spur of the moment and that's the way

263
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,529
that all the information will be

264
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:19,909
portrayed here today I don't have a list

265
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:21,559
of questions I didn't prepare for

266
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:24,500
anything I just wanted to come have a

267
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,389
conversation I didn't know up here and

268
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,279
you know it's nice to meet you before

269
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:29,899
this experience and so none of this was

270
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,419
personal I feel that he totally

271
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:35,629
understand that and so coming up from

272
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:38,659
the perspective cure Lee of what's good

273
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:40,159
for the community and we are by no no

274
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:41,839
means the watchdog of the community

275
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,449
there's a number of other products that

276
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,580
were probably maybe even better in line

277
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,950
in front of slow balance to deserve this

278
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,530
type of attention but soil balance in

279
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,960
particular have very good marketing

280
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:56,899
referencing university studies that in

281
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,180
my opinion gave it supreme leverage to

282
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:01,850
bypass some of the betting industry does

283
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:03,379
through these seniority of who's been

284
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,570
around a long time who has proven their

285
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:08,269
products work the way our community

286
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,800
normally adopts products and so we've

287
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:11,210
seen so many products come that now

288
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:13,429
we're all looking for scientific

289
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,500
evidence I mean it is shifting and so

290
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:17,809
we're really hoping for that and I feel

291
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,929
a lot of this conversation started

292
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:22,009
because they have that evidence that

293
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:24,919
allowed them to jump ahead of the pack

294
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:26,720
so to speak and now we're finding that

295
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:28,909
some of that may have been misleading

296
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,860
some of it may have been in accurately

297
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:32,329
portrayed and now maybe more accurately

298
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,320
portrayed so I'd like to get to the

299
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,030
bottom of all of it

300
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,350
we'll go through all the questions that

301
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:38,179
have already been kind of posted out

302
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,090
there and anything new that maybe users

303
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:42,829
have so at this point I kind of like to

304
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,870
see it I'm guessing everybody knows and

305
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:49,370
is up to speed with where we're at do

306
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:51,289
everybody have an idea I mean it's you

307
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,639
know what there's there's gonna be four

308
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:54,349
or five hundred people watching and

309
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,769
maybe some thousands over the course of

310
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,960
the next week so probably it's not a bad

311
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:01,879
idea to go over it a little bit just go

312
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,070
over the threats you polled mention each

313
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:06,830
little thing and then we can create the

314
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,850
discussion back and forth also Graham

315
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,290
really quick cuz it'll help me on my end

316
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,519
not gonna go play them all I'm not gonna

317
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:13,429
go through each little thing because

318
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,659
obviously some of those things have been

319
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:17,909
have come to light that some of them

320
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:19,009
were different the MSDS has changed a

321
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:20,789
few things like that

322
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:23,940
but I'll go through with where it

323
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:25,948
started and where I was at there has

324
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,300
been talk about you know maybe losing a

325
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:29,519
sale that kind of thing

326
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:30,870
there was actually several times where

327
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,778
this Jeff brought up but not in really a

328
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:35,009
sales fashion it was more in hey Jeremy

329
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:37,350
I'd like some information about this

330
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:38,610
product we do that across the board

331
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,889
because a lot of times we want people to

332
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,870
source more regionally and so then we

333
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:45,120
had another aspect where we had a

334
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,500
consultant that behind-the-scenes was

335
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,629
asking about swirl balance program

336
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,299
particularly cuz they may be working in

337
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:53,309
a grow beyond the line in bed then I

338
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:54,990
used the product before so I started to

339
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:56,758
do some more due diligence that I

340
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,778
normally would and that's where these

341
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,430
things started to come up and so

342
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:03,328
normally I just go to walk jump and look

343
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:04,620
at the MSDS meaning that that is 100

344
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:07,198
percent accurate a lot of times there's

345
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,049
no information to be found we have to do

346
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:12,179
more digging but it's one place to start

347
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:14,338
then I just went to his website or to

348
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:16,379
your products website found the MSDS

349
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,910
predator that went oh my goodness this

350
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,370
is very different than what I've heard

351
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:24,328
and so right away I think it got me

352
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:26,188
excited in the sense of this there may

353
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:27,659
be more to it than I thought and I think

354
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:30,208
we can all have that feeling room in our

355
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:32,578
gut feels a certain way and then a fact

356
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:34,409
come in a line with that I don't want to

357
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,269
admit that maybe I was excited about

358
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:38,188
that I was right but it's human nature

359
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:41,370
and I was thinking my goodness MSDS is

360
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:43,860
different and so I shared that

361
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,209
information and a lot of times what

362
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,829
happens is the truth will come out right

363
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:49,008
after that will find that either the

364
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:51,059
MSDS was accurate was the whole product

365
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:53,068
products have been removed whatever the

366
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:55,318
case was and so you guys can see that

367
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:58,318
information that was the MSDS that was

368
00:13:55,318 --> 00:14:02,009
listed on the website and later on it'll

369
00:13:58,318 --> 00:14:04,588
get into how that happened but but that

370
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:06,419
that catalyze the conversation then from

371
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:08,130
there as doing due diligence I just

372
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:11,159
started dialing numbers or the

373
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:13,169
university studies that now they're

374
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,769
being listed as University trials and I

375
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:15,688
respect that

376
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,129
and they also don't seem to them here in

377
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:20,338
such a whitepaper fashion the way

378
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:22,559
they're listed but dr. smiley and he was

379
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,240
the one that I called first

380
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,859
and you know the way the universe works

381
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,060
sometimes when you're in that flow those

382
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,039
are the things that line up and he

383
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:30,269
called me back I mean like that and none

384
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,778
of the others have called me back nearly

385
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:36,600
as fast communications not been as easy

386
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:38,519
um was interested that that his name is

387
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,379
being used and so then we were talking

388
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,019
about the timeline I've posted that

389
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,338
information and after that we got more

390
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,990
in the university trials I said I was

391
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,560
gonna call everyone I started calling

392
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:51,240
them all and then later on we found out

393
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,519
something I think I got an email back

394
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,129
from dr. smiling and I confirming that

395
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,569
he had not been part of the trial and

396
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:00,720
then it couldn't happen because he

397
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:02,400
hadn't been there for 32 years time they

398
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,889
started to dig and find out okay Eric

399
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,289
Nelson was working there you know so the

400
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:08,278
story started to come together

401
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:11,699
eventually we got to the fact that I got

402
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:14,070
a an answer back about it may have been

403
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,900
a student work for dr. smiley and so

404
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,210
then we got a writing a letter back from

405
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,679
dr. smiley saying that was not possible

406
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,690
and he didn't have any undergraduate

407
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:25,528
students working for him when he left

408
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:29,160
in 1985 nor during any time after that

409
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:31,200
period so that led us said it was

410
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,838
definitely solidifying this at least

411
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,960
this one trial wasn't accurate and so as

412
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,630
that started to happen we lost trust

413
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,009
then we started to scrutinize things we

414
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:42,779
may not have scrutinized so much where

415
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:45,419
there was terpene analysis before so I

416
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:47,250
clicked on it the percentage math wise

417
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:49,588
was probably accurate but the percentage

418
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:52,710
that we talked about was they compared a

419
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:55,020
very low percent and then they showed an

420
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:57,269
increase in quality using their product

421
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:59,309
with a still very low terpene number and

422
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:00,870
so after that came out they said that

423
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:03,119
was a home grower and so I was a little

424
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,289
bit concerned with the fact we thought

425
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,580
maybe there was some professional

426
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:07,860
testing done on the product instead of

427
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,379
just on the home grower level and so all

428
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,459
in all you can see how this story

429
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:13,559
followed through on our Instagram you

430
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:15,119
can watch the videos and I think we'll

431
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:16,289
get into some more specifics I think

432
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,450
that's what everybody's interested in

433
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:19,980
but that's the basic story to where

434
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,140
we're at so now we're both together here

435
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,209
on hash search there's a lot of

436
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:27,720
information regarding University trials

437
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:28,979
terpene data MSDS and so I think we can

438
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,470
just hit on the high points that the

439
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,209
customers might be interested in get the

440
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,160
you know the heart of the story I

441
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,689
noticed on your website a lot of things

442
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:38,809
as change

443
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:41,300
I think had your weapon I've been the

444
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:42,949
way it is now when I first started doing

445
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:44,299
my due diligence that it would have been

446
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,540
a dead end and I would have recommended

447
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:50,449
that they just try the product and see

448
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:52,399
what their results are what happened and

449
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,500
so we've looked further into some of the

450
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,699
products the bacteria that are listed on

451
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,210
the product and I'd love to talk about

452
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,980
that see if that's changed at all but

453
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:03,080
I've heard some claims about all of the

454
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,180
material in there colonizing cannabis

455
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,170
and it's pretty clear from the label

456
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,959
that there's a number of them that just

457
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:10,579
won't and so I wanted to talk a little

458
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,500
bit about that left um

459
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:13,909
I think everyone's up to speed so

460
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,980
bubbleman if you want to kind of take it

461
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:19,610
to that next step I'm ready to ask some

462
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,740
question yeah I mean I'll give my

463
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:24,619
perspective I I woke up one day you know

464
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,120
I had a kind of a unique racehorse in

465
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:27,859
the race because it was you know I had

466
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,419
brought Peter into the community and

467
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:32,299
shared my platform with him and when I

468
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,100
saw the post I didn't even really see

469
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,750
what you had said and like I had I

470
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:37,159
didn't really like it was a quick sort

471
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,880
of Instagram thing and I've been on the

472
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,320
internet for 25 plus years doing this

473
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,060
stuff and I've kind of learned over the

474
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,579
years ways to go about it and ways not

475
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:49,309
to go about it and I just immediately

476
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:51,769
saw people attacking Peters character

477
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:53,869
and I was hurt by it I was like whoa

478
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:55,609
like just a second like what's going on

479
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:57,919
here like why are people attacking Peter

480
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:59,689
like he just came on hash searching it's

481
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,730
like so I looked into it more and then I

482
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,200
was like oh my gosh a doctor says he

483
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,670
wasn't part of the study that's weird I

484
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,569
can't believe those guys would do that I

485
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,820
just thought there must be a

486
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:09,349
misunderstanding like he seems like such

487
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:12,169
a good dude is the world really this

488
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:13,819
[ __ ] up and then and then I was like

489
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,920
well maybe the web guy made a mistake

490
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:18,009
I've been dealing with a web guy for two

491
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,390
years and I can't believe how borderline

492
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:20,839
you know brain-damaged they are in a

493
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,700
sense

494
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:25,339
sometimes the things that get put on my

495
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,350
website are literally the opposite

496
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:29,269
things of what I would have on my

497
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:32,809
website and it's kind of my own fault

498
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:35,210
for being so distant from that component

499
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,799
of my business but I'm involved in a lot

500
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,779
of components of my business and so I

501
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,609
thought I was like maybe they made a

502
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:41,960
mistake on that and so I called him up

503
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:43,369
and I was like hey what's going on and

504
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,350
he was like oh yeah there's this and

505
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:46,909
that and it was a student and I did

506
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:48,269
there was a mistake on the website and

507
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,950
we changed it and everyone thinks

508
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:52,528
hiding now and I'm like oh my god this

509
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,690
is a crazy catch-22 the Internet is a

510
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:56,669
dangerous place as you well know people

511
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,229
love to choose sides even when just

512
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,570
solid information might be getting

513
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:02,848
shared I was blown away at how many

514
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:04,979
people were like loading the guns

515
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:07,138
lighting the tiki torches I was just

516
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:09,869
like whoa we our community needs to slow

517
00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:12,868
down just a little bit and because you

518
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:16,108
know for me I haven't used soil balance

519
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:18,658
I have never received like payment or

520
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:20,458
sponsorship or money from them I just

521
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:24,778
invited Peter in as a guy that I felt

522
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:26,700
like I I related to and funny enough I

523
00:19:24,778 --> 00:19:28,108
feel like I relate to you as well Jeremy

524
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,578
that most of the things you said at the

525
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:31,199
start we only want to sell products that

526
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:33,178
we ourselves know work I mean that's

527
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,009
what I've been doing for 20-plus years

528
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,778
and a lot of the things that you said in

529
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:39,838
regards to how you go about doing things

530
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:42,569
is very much the way I myself go about

531
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:45,769
doing things so I kind of see this as a

532
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:48,269
unique opportunity for us to kind of

533
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:50,098
obviously show all the information get

534
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:52,429
everything out there's still people in

535
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:56,668
chat right now going on it's all fake

536
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:58,649
advertised on 'old Trump and media and

537
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,538
the way it all plays out that we all owe

538
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:03,718
ourselves we have a big responsibility

539
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:06,298
to one another in a sense in how we

540
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:08,729
react and I I can respect that you were

541
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:09,929
in the moment because I felt that I felt

542
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:11,129
that when I watched your little videos

543
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:13,559
and you were like oh my god it just

544
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:17,088
keeps going deeper and I can see how

545
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:19,469
those key things would easily easily

546
00:20:17,088 --> 00:20:21,208
make you believe those things but I'm

547
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:23,308
glad that we could come come out onto

548
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:26,190
the chatroom and sort of open it up as a

549
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:29,098
discussion even if it turns out that it

550
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,538
is all you know whatever the end result

551
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:33,088
I just think that a real discussion

552
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:35,239
between the actual people is more

553
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:38,428
important and less damaging than

554
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:41,489
allowing for I don't want to say social

555
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:43,739
poisoning but definitely manipulated

556
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:46,259
assumption which is not necessarily

557
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:49,169
anything that anyone's you know we all

558
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:51,838
do it we all do manipulated assumption

559
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:53,489
on a daily basis and I don't think that

560
00:20:51,838 --> 00:20:56,759
it makes us evil people I mean here's a

561
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:59,399
perfect example Johnny B's been hooking

562
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,348
up these people like crazy he's been

563
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:02,069
helping these guys with the Erwin clamp

564
00:21:01,348 --> 00:21:03,569
he gave me

565
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:05,399
he gave a bunch of different people one

566
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:06,899
well he gave one to breeder steve

567
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,970
breeder steve posted it the other day

568
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,769
he's like oh I love Johnny B's new

569
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,930
product manipulated assumption

570
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,490
accidental but Johnny B forgot to

571
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:17,130
mention that this is someone else's

572
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:19,259
product and so he got the props from

573
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,030
breeders Steve and and the guy who

574
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:23,190
actually invented the product didn't

575
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:25,170
actually get the and now John doesn't do

576
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,910
that because he's evil it was a mistake

577
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,380
and we all fall victim to this

578
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,019
manipulated assumption and from my

579
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,420
perspective we really need to be careful

580
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:37,109
it with the internet because it's so

581
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:38,640
easy to lead people to lead people to

582
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:40,079
something that and and you know online

583
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,660
as well if you've been dealing with

584
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,299
customers for a long time it seems like

585
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,490
the ones who are angry are willing to go

586
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:50,309
out of their way to destroy companies

587
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,990
and to destroy people more so than when

588
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,220
we just are able to be like okay well

589
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,410
let's sit down and have a conversation

590
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,529
about this I mean I personally been

591
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:00,990
embroiled in lawsuits for patents in

592
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:02,849
this industry I've been I've been

593
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:05,370
socially poisoned by different people

594
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:07,949
who I become business partners and

595
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:10,859
friends in the end because I know I can

596
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:13,470
see how when the two groups stay apart

597
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:15,029
it can just and it's it's often not even

598
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,100
the two groups it's the people around

599
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:19,589
those two groups that love those people

600
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:22,469
that go to war for those people and they

601
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:24,149
start defending in a way that is really

602
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,980
truly social poisoning and its

603
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,800
destructive and it's not going to help

604
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,329
any of our of the patients or customers

605
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,180
that are out there so I really do

606
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:34,889
appreciate both of you for coming on I

607
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,360
was super surprised when both of you

608
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,790
guys were just like yeah of course I'll

609
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:41,759
come on hash church and talk dude I have

610
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:43,409
nothing to hide like and so I I just I

611
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,539
guess I pass it over to Peter if you

612
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,160
wanted to mention you talked about the

613
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:49,769
white paper I'm not exactly sure what

614
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,410
that is but yeah well dude thanks for

615
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:53,910
giving us the platform to come and talk

616
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:56,370
because that's just what we wanted we

617
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:59,210
haven't been really ever asked about any

618
00:22:56,369 --> 00:23:01,619
of this stuff it's been more just that

619
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,539
social paradigm shift that the

620
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:06,719
supporters are trying to find the truth

621
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:09,379
and we really appreciate you because the

622
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,940
opportunity to talk about it so so yeah

623
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,509
one thing I will just kind of go back to

624
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,509
which was the MSDS I

625
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:20,028
another thing that I'm grateful to

626
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:23,209
Jeremy for is that we we did upload

627
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:25,699
being correct I missed a mess so one of

628
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:27,109
our scientists sent it in to us from

629
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:29,739
another product that we were working on

630
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:32,718
did absent some synthetic ingredients

631
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:34,879
that was loaded onto our site Jeremy

632
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:36,440
found it and we were like holy [ __ ] that

633
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:39,858
shouldn't be on there why is that even

634
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,929
on there and you know I can see how that

635
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:43,608
would lead to the hype you know hey man

636
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:50,538
it's not the product but it's on the

637
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:52,098
MSDS you know we we were about seven

638
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:53,658
months into the industry we're trying to

639
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:56,088
do a good job uploaded a ton of

640
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:57,709
information pretty quickly to build the

641
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:59,418
site out Jenna and I worked on it

642
00:23:57,709 --> 00:24:01,849
together that's one of the reasons she's

643
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:03,729
here and we put a lot of stuff on real

644
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:07,098
quick and we made a mistake by putting a

645
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:10,669
bad MSDS it was sent to us in good faith

646
00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:13,968
we didn't double-check it and and so you

647
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:16,069
know we I called them that morning and

648
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:17,979
actually asked about the MSDS before I

649
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:21,048
posted this to give you guys a chance

650
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:25,009
and I called it in and I I went to the

651
00:24:21,048 --> 00:24:26,898
technical support okay and I asked them

652
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:29,058
why I said that I wanted to run a trial

653
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:31,818
and then I was curious in making the

654
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:33,528
trial fair I was looking at the MSDS and

655
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:36,078
I found all of these ingredients and I

656
00:24:33,528 --> 00:24:38,179
read them to the back and I said is

657
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:40,098
there a lot of them is it a small amount

658
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:42,709
should I add some of these ingredients

659
00:24:40,098 --> 00:24:46,128
to my trial and the other side and fair

660
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:48,979
trial and unfortunately your customer

661
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:50,778
service department it wasn't for was

662
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:54,229
ready to make up an answer very swiftly

663
00:24:50,778 --> 00:24:55,848
and they without skipping a step that

664
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:58,489
there would just trace amounts of all of

665
00:24:55,848 --> 00:25:02,378
those ingredients just to feed the

666
00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:05,659
microbes as an initial micro food and so

667
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:07,278
that to me was enough proof saying hey I

668
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:09,909
called company I asked about the

669
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:12,739
ingredients yes MSDS is listed there

670
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:14,809
what other opportunity could I give them

671
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:16,940
not knowing Peter maybe was the person I

672
00:25:14,808 --> 00:25:18,408
should have talked to him and so now I'm

673
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,349
in a situation where immediately was

674
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:22,460
changed nothing I just and they said

675
00:25:21,348 --> 00:25:25,220
it's in there

676
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,829
it's why is this changing and so you can

677
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:31,279
see that this was not a manipulated

678
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:33,619
assumption this was black and white and

679
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:37,399
I was sharing mmm

680
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:39,259
yeah no I don't mean your manipulated

681
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,780
assumption I just mean like the people

682
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:44,539
who the people who love and trust you

683
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:46,190
were so quick to just I mean I read

684
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:48,680
everything you said and I was like okay

685
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,120
well let's just let's check it out

686
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,500
no one else needed to check [ __ ] out

687
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:53,359
they were on the ball they were like

688
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,950
they were good to go they were just like

689
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:56,359
alright let's burn this [ __ ] company

690
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,819
to the ground I'm good to go let's

691
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:00,529
[ __ ] and so that alert that bar

692
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:02,329
frightened me because of course it

693
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:05,329
should frighten you as well because we

694
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:08,119
both own companies and the idea of like

695
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:09,769
Anna and I'm fallible I'm human so I've

696
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:11,329
made all sorts of mistakes in my life

697
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:13,759
and if people start calling me out for

698
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:15,019
my mistakes like I'm actually and I and

699
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:16,129
I've had it happen do you want it you

700
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:18,200
want to know what happened with me I'll

701
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,970
tell you a funny story I started bubble

702
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,069
bags a couple of months after Mila

703
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,650
Jenson started the isolator bag company

704
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:27,679
so I wasn't the first I was second and

705
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:30,170
so I took so much slack because of it it

706
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,539
was an unbelievable starting the bubble

707
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:34,310
bag company second was was was quite

708
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:37,220
something so now check this out I had

709
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:39,259
two cats at the time I had a cat named

710
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,630
Dutch he was a Maine [ __ ] and I had a

711
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:45,379
cat named tripper so my email at the

712
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:47,750
time was Dutch tripper well someone who

713
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,850
loved Mila cuz Mila owned a psychedelic

714
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:53,630
shop and was Dutch and was a tripper

715
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:56,029
figured I was stealing heard like name

716
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:57,710
like I was the Dutch tripper he's trying

717
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:59,210
to make it seem like he's Mila will do

718
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,590
it I can promise you the last thing in

719
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,450
the whole world I wanted people to think

720
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:04,279
was that I was coming across as Mila

721
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,110
it's the reason I called it bubble hash

722
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:08,509
and stayed away from isolator I didn't

723
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:10,129
call it bubble hash keep in mind 20

724
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:12,890
years ago when I called it bubble hash

725
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,960
there was no hype train for people to

726
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:17,180
name things so they could own it that

727
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,920
didn't exist that happened after the

728
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,450
term bubble hash came out and I

729
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,789
certainly didn't name it because I

730
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:25,069
wanted to own it I wanted to distinguish

731
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:27,230
myself differently from a product that

732
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:30,259
already existed that I knew I was going

733
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:32,599
to be taking massive flak as the copier

734
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:34,910
now if you look back at the history not

735
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:35,928
only did I copy it I destroyed it I made

736
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,340
it so much better and

737
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:39,919
worked out for the customer so it ended

738
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:41,868
up being a good thing but wow did people

739
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,999
think I was [ __ ] with Mila just

740
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:46,788
because my email address was Dutch

741
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:48,980
tripper at hotmail.com so you can see

742
00:27:46,788 --> 00:27:50,929
these weird little things out I wasn't

743
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:53,509
trying to [ __ ] with Mila like honestly

744
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:56,538
and and the only cannabis cup back then

745
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:59,599
the only event in all of the world was

746
00:27:56,538 --> 00:28:01,519
in Amsterdam was in her backyard so you

747
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,469
can only imagine from my perspective man

748
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:04,970
those were uncomfortable years at my

749
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:09,579
booth where people would come up to me

750
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:09,579
from her her booth and threaten me

751
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:20,340
yeah they were doing it out of love they

752
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,250
loved her and they wanted to come over

753
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:25,289
to me and tell me I love Mila and I will

754
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,759
smash your face and one guy threatened

755
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:29,759
me with a hockey stick at the mouth bag

756
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:31,798
you know over over water hash so the

757
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,910
fact that you guys are both sitting here

758
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:36,269
right now and having a nice conversation

759
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:38,190
I and the chatroom also really

760
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:40,889
appreciates your maturity on all these

761
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:42,450
levels Peter being able to accept what's

762
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:45,690
being told to him acknowledging that the

763
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:48,179
MSDS sheet was wrong not for you know a

764
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:50,580
purpose of like to manipulate and lie

765
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:52,470
but being shown and being called out

766
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:54,720
immediately it gets changed now one of

767
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,370
the funny things I saw about that was

768
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,410
they changed it and then I saw a bunch

769
00:28:56,369 --> 00:29:00,599
of people going there trying to hide it

770
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:03,540
and I'm like well no you pointed it out

771
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:05,579
that it was wrong and they changed it so

772
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:07,019
it's it's such a crazy situation maybe

773
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,579
they should have given more credit we

774
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:10,379
want to thank Jeremy for pointing this

775
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:13,109
out as Peter did when he came into the

776
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,450
room which to me was a big boy thing to

777
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:17,159
do that's got to be hard you know what I

778
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,110
mean thank someone for pointing out

779
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,179
something in a way that for sure you

780
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:23,428
weren't overly stoked about but at the

781
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:25,798
same time he swallowed that and he said

782
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,540
you know what we we made a mistake we

783
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:29,819
were wrong and now she's taking notes I

784
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:31,230
like that calling customer service oh we

785
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:32,668
need to make sure our customer service

786
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,169
isn't you know what it means so we're

787
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:36,210
trying to better things and the fact of

788
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:40,290
the matter is Jeremy you're helping and

789
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:42,450
so I hats off to you dude yeah and as

790
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:47,009
far as the MSDS goes like thank you for

791
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:49,230
that Jeremy because for that one for

792
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:50,819
switching it out and honestly after the

793
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,669
fact I realized that we probably should

794
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:55,589
have put a press release out to that

795
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:58,110
just for the industry as a whole to know

796
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:59,759
that we made a mistake but on at that

797
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:01,829
point I didn't realize there was so much

798
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:05,460
hype I didn't realize that it was such a

799
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:07,589
big deal and so I will definitely take

800
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,940
the fall on that one well you also

801
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:12,000
didn't understand the depth of the hype

802
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,039
that people how seriously people take

803
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,200
your product so I think this makes you

804
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:19,109
aware of how seriously the marketplace

805
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,269
takes your product and wants to see it

806
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:22,769
move forward as a proper product cuz

807
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:23,220
nobody wants [ __ ] product nobody wants

808
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:25,319
chemical

809
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,759
that were listed you know I had problems

810
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:28,798
back when at a cycling team we had a

811
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:31,048
supplement company put illegal

812
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,629
supplements into writing supplements for

813
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:35,700
actual cyclists and cyclists failed

814
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:38,880
didn't go to the Olympics because of it

815
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,890
okay so this happens across the board in

816
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,679
all types of industries unfortunately

817
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:46,020
people and it screws over many people so

818
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,210
I command also bubbleman thank you for

819
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:49,829
allowing the platform so that this

820
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,390
because discussion could happen so that

821
00:30:49,829 --> 00:30:53,548
the trolls and everybody else can see

822
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:55,770
that it didn't come up from a place of

823
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:57,990
evil it came from a price of trying to

824
00:30:55,769 --> 00:31:00,029
do the right thing out of that you know

825
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:02,099
thankfully you have a you know wise

826
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:03,569
consumers you know like build a soil

827
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:05,639
that are actually keeping their eye on

828
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:06,990
on things to make sure that they're not

829
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,570
getting ripped off so that you're not

830
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:12,900
getting ripped off so it all came from

831
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:14,490
genuine care from all points so thank

832
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,769
you for being responsible adults in

833
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:19,529
discussing it and bringing it to you

834
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:22,349
know a understanding that people can see

835
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:25,980
that it is what it is for what it is and

836
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:29,579
that for some you know fallacy that it

837
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:32,970
is it yeah thank you for that for that

838
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:35,579
sentiment um I did want to also talk a

839
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:39,538
little bit about we worked really hard

840
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:42,720
for the last like week with with our

841
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:44,069
doctor Brooke to try and because there

842
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,440
was a lot of questions about the white

843
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:49,019
or the University results on her website

844
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,360
you know especially after what Jeremy

845
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:54,960
found out with regards to talking to dr.

846
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:57,658
smiley so what we did was we we took all

847
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,269
the original test results that were sent

848
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:03,480
to us by dr. Brooke we put it in a white

849
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:06,929
paper and and like honestly I really

850
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,640
like Jeremy's feedback on that like what

851
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:10,500
his thoughts are if we did it you know

852
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,990
if we did a good job what he thinks

853
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,500
about that disclosure of information to

854
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,500
the industry

855
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,750
um yeah everyone can go look at that

856
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,910
that information that feel again it was

857
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,589
pretty misleading it was just a

858
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,779
regurgitation of all the information

859
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:28,819
that you've already chaired website from

860
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:31,490
all these reports and then to further

861
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:33,679
separate yourself from talk but said

862
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,930
it's not dr. smiley not a student of dr.

863
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,269
smiley the dr. smiley laboratories which

864
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:40,400
doesn't make any sense yet and therefore

865
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:45,019
you know at least 10 12 years at that

866
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:47,240
point and then the 40-plus pages is

867
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:52,430
basically a resume for your life your

868
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:53,720
vice president mr. Bruck and that might

869
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,310
be relevant and then a separate

870
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,240
conversation I'd be impressed with his

871
00:32:55,309 --> 00:33:00,799
resume I feel that putting in for Artie

872
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,920
what seemingly looks more like a white

873
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:07,069
paper and is not his resumes that

874
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:09,050
there's more science words looks again

875
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:12,049
deceive to the average person that would

876
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:15,099
click on and say hey they got proof me

877
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:18,680
there was nothing at all different there

878
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:20,779
and what I'm looking for is anytime I

879
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,630
look for a white paper it is red bird

880
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:24,920
typically as a real study that one of

881
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,360
the websites where you can purchase the

882
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,509
study or downloaded if you're a student

883
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:31,849
and it has duplicatable information and

884
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:34,160
in the bottom it typically says if

885
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:35,329
there's a conflict of interest it'll say

886
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,019
competitive interest

887
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:40,759
it'll state that dr. Brock president is

888
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:43,930
on the board he stands to profit from

889
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:46,519
this information there's any other

890
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:48,370
reasons why maybe there were there were

891
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:52,339
some discrepancies

892
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:53,839
duplicatable testicles I can't duplicate

893
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:56,119
any the stuff from the results that you

894
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,529
shared with us and I also see you

895
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,989
removed the endless tests from the

896
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:02,119
website that were previously there and

897
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,430
so I gotta say I just don't think the

898
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:07,339
white paper is a white paper it's just a

899
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:11,480
statement um and and again some more

900
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:14,210
it's been in my opinion okay so so thank

901
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,280
you I'm definitely trying to learn from

902
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:19,490
you Jeremy and make my company you know

903
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:22,310
better for the industry so so what what

904
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:25,609
I'm hearing you say is that you feel

905
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:27,608
that dr. Brock who is a highly

906
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,559
accredited professor who

907
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:31,778
been helping protect the environment

908
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:35,739
from chemicals for probably longer than

909
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:39,329
you and I have both been alive is is

910
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:42,789
it's your professional opinion that is

911
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:48,068
association with those trials is is is

912
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:49,599
not valid it's bogus bogus yeah for the

913
00:34:48,068 --> 00:34:53,679
most part because we were just looking

914
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,909
for a white paper by the action and I'd

915
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,200
like to see that white paper now

916
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,920
now that I know there will not be no

917
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:02,199
white papers it changes the conversation

918
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,088
into where the data may have come from

919
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:05,649
whether they're from you know

920
00:35:04,088 --> 00:35:07,389
handwritten journals from doctor brough

921
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:10,059
walking around looking at studies were

922
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:13,420
they from well-documented side by side

923
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:15,910
trials blessed with the ability to

924
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:18,389
properly concern if he's trouble done

925
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:21,098
right or not what I'm thinking is that

926
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:22,868
million trial that he made that he did

927
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:24,640
that were real trials and that we're

928
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:25,028
really working with products to look for

929
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:27,219
the better

930
00:35:25,028 --> 00:35:30,039
he's using his gut to determine that

931
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:31,808
these did work and that even differ from

932
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:34,539
that even if these trials were accurate

933
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:37,028
they're not on product or marketing and

934
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:38,650
to me the way microbe microbials work is

935
00:35:37,028 --> 00:35:40,838
on a process called quorum

936
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,358
which I'm not a scientist but if you

937
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:45,369
look up they have ways to control how

938
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,909
the population interaction which one to

939
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:50,858
grow adding new microbes even one let

940
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:53,409
alone dozens is going to change the

941
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:55,449
results that we get so perpetrate these

942
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:56,858
tests as trials got on the product

943
00:35:55,449 --> 00:35:59,679
you're selling to me it's completely

944
00:35:56,858 --> 00:36:01,420
bogus I would imagine that some of them

945
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,548
were done in previous trials but even

946
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,079
any of that data I would just say that

947
00:36:03,548 --> 00:36:07,838
it was positive and still when I see

948
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:10,239
that now we're going off his memory and

949
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,009
off of his notes saying that all these

950
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:15,940
ones at different points in time or

951
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:18,670
really method SC twenty step or slow

952
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,920
balanced protein cause of that I mean as

953
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,358
a translate he's a scientist he knows if

954
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,519
you change something there's a different

955
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:27,838
result and so I do feel that his is

956
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:30,880
[Music]

957
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:32,259
motivation has been tainted because none

958
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,818
of the other scientists that have no

959
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:36,298
motivation have taken the initiative to

960
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:39,460
come why or why not

961
00:36:36,298 --> 00:36:40,989
eric nelson tired has probably plenty on

962
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,550
the talk to us has not

963
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:44,799
and I'm thinking cuz he doesn't want to

964
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:46,510
be in the middle maybe I'm wrong but dr.

965
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,300
smiley did take the time to write and so

966
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:51,880
what fact I do have to go on is if this

967
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,050
study did not exist in his name to

968
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,358
question everything

969
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:59,470
and unfortunately for you a lot of the

970
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:03,400
mistakes that were made were in favor

971
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:06,459
and started to add up as if it was

972
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,980
manipulated instead of mistake here an

973
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:12,088
email formula like he mentioned some

974
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:15,309
things that are far-fetched but

975
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:17,829
mathematical mistake so to speak the

976
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:19,358
different picture and so on this if all

977
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:21,159
of a sudden someone coming out that has

978
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:25,059
financial interest in the company

979
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:27,279
without any further documentation to me

980
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:28,329
is manipulative or the average person

981
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,490
that is not going to happen these hard

982
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:32,019
questions especially when it already

983
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:34,469
invested in the product and they just

984
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:37,150
want any proof that they could not wish

985
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:39,098
after a number of my friends have used

986
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:41,710
this product and I don't think if

987
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:45,088
they're working for it at all I have an

988
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:47,949
employee side by side using your product

989
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:52,690
it's just that the the statement doesn't

990
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:53,588
validate our donors okay so so I'll tell

991
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,670
you this

992
00:37:53,588 --> 00:38:02,139
our company is extremely extremely

993
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:05,650
fortunate to have a pedigree such as as

994
00:38:02,139 --> 00:38:08,920
dr. Brock to support our team and our

995
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:13,980
company and the studies on our website

996
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:17,400
or completed independently by dr. Brock

997
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:24,909
before his tenure with our corporations

998
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:26,740
does that make sense but there's no data

999
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:28,629
that I can actually compare that I can't

1000
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:31,479
see those trials because it's not been

1001
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,980
recorded properly and the data is on a

1002
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:40,088
different product than you're currently

1003
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:42,250
selling okay well I appreciate the

1004
00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:44,289
advice they've given us you know I think

1005
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:47,469
there's one thing Marcus that I that I'd

1006
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:50,289
really like to get some clarity on what

1007
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:51,819
I'm what I'm gonna do real quick and

1008
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:53,179
this is a question that I that I have

1009
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:56,990
for Jeremy I wanna

1010
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:59,989
my screen really really quick and show

1011
00:38:56,989 --> 00:39:03,919
people this I think it's it's important

1012
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:07,578
I'll hold on real quick we also look

1013
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,260
this is a we also look and they quote

1014
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:11,240
Danny Danko to be their senior

1015
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:13,220
agronomist which I don't believe he's an

1016
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:15,289
agronomist we also look at me quote

1017
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:17,750
Danny Banco to be their senior and grown

1018
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:19,400
in there as soon as our community we

1019
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,769
also look in that quote Danny on

1020
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:25,660
turn-turn Europe the YouTube off there

1021
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:25,659
Peter it's coming through pretty loud I

1022
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:33,640
have a question on can you do that okay

1023
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,760
it's the it's someone's got their

1024
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:49,159
YouTube on as well as the Google chat so

1025
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,410
you have to mute the YouTube so we don't

1026
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:53,539
keep hearing the reverb Bri I think that

1027
00:39:51,409 --> 00:39:54,920
was the Instagram right and that was a

1028
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:56,269
little bit there you go there you go

1029
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,650
listen what he was trying to point out

1030
00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:03,079
and that I miss leading ly that it was

1031
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:05,269
their teen euronymous and says let go of

1032
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:07,760
that statement just quoting it he's a

1033
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:11,000
senior dramatist and more question okay

1034
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,180
the reference alright okay well it's

1035
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,469
okay perfect

1036
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:17,629
welcome forest we're just in the middle

1037
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:20,629
of it here with bill the soil and soil

1038
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:22,579
balance probe real quick because I don't

1039
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:24,858
think that this got to be just got to be

1040
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:27,140
thoroughly looked at so because of the

1041
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:29,029
reverberation of the of the text but

1042
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:32,029
essentially this is this is just how I

1043
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:34,609
feel you know what he just said

1044
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:37,130
misleading about dr. Brooke it's the

1045
00:40:34,608 --> 00:40:40,670
same rhetoric that kind of defines

1046
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:42,380
everything right here so on Instagram

1047
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,480
what ended up happening and I can play

1048
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,640
this you guys can go to his Instagram

1049
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,760
channel and essentially what happened

1050
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:53,328
was he cut off the bottom of the actual

1051
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,250
testimonial that that's on our website

1052
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:57,710
so this testimonial has been there for

1053
00:40:55,250 --> 00:41:01,068
seven months and on the bottom it says

1054
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:03,949
hi times we never claimed that he was

1055
00:41:01,068 --> 00:41:05,090
our senior agronomist but what Jeremy

1056
00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:07,639
did

1057
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,230
he cut off the high times and that's

1058
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:11,719
what I wanted to play for you guys I

1059
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:15,909
took a shot of the video he cut off the

1060
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:19,969
high times and he just focused on the

1061
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:23,619
the top part Oh Mike and kinetically

1062
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:26,509
like that we yeah he said we also look

1063
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:28,819
we also look here and they quote Danny

1064
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:30,980
Danko to be the senior agronomist now

1065
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,019
how I know this is true the bottom of

1066
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,639
this video has the little red thing

1067
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:37,210
which means we didn't change it like

1068
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,480
he's insinuating so this right here

1069
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:44,559
Marcus

1070
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,559
it pretty much lets me know that he's

1071
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:52,699
purposefully trying to slander us this

1072
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,570
right here is not playing nice it's not

1073
00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:56,210
being an adult

1074
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:58,340
this is purposefully doing something

1075
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:00,829
that you guys can all go see what he did

1076
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:03,170
and what he said to purposefully slander

1077
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:06,409
us and every single comment other than

1078
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:09,139
our MSDS has been in this fashion and he

1079
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:11,409
admitted it him he got heated you know

1080
00:42:09,139 --> 00:42:14,779
and I get that I understand

1081
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:15,889
I never Danny venko this is a silly

1082
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,720
statement and nothing to do with your

1083
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:20,900
product I didn't cut it off Instagram

1084
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:23,989
has square recording it cut it off the

1085
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:26,240
bottom no manipulation was done because

1086
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:29,389
to me just quoting him as a senior

1087
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:31,129
agronomist to anybody was the funny part

1088
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:32,529
because you're in our industry man you

1089
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,910
have to know who these people are

1090
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:37,340
so all that that's what it was coming

1091
00:42:34,909 --> 00:42:38,779
from and just let you know it was

1092
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,579
misleading enough that even with the

1093
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,970
High Times listing there everybody knows

1094
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:45,529
he's worth High Times I thought you were

1095
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:47,539
actually attributing him to be on the

1096
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,910
board as part of your senior Ron as your

1097
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:52,130
senior promise because any economy we

1098
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:53,869
work for high time does not you can send

1099
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:57,380
information out and you can work with

1100
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:58,759
that agronomist and so whether it was

1101
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,920
High Times or not just listed as an

1102
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,440
agronomist and so again it was a mistake

1103
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,010
I've given you many mistakes and that's

1104
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:11,119
fine

1105
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:14,480
you guys were probably I just and say

1106
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:18,618
listen really you what you guys need to

1107
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,679
do is hash this out in private in

1108
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:25,910
like this is no good because it's just

1109
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:28,219
dip per cat and well what we should have

1110
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:30,828
back on the show is when you two guys

1111
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:35,179
have reached a conclusion and you're in

1112
00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:38,059
agreement so there's there's a friend of

1113
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:40,129
mine out there whose name is Pedro and I

1114
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:41,720
hope that this video answers his

1115
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:44,930
question the other day because he

1116
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:49,278
literally called me a whole show and he

1117
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:51,469
said Amen why did you say that that this

1118
00:43:49,278 --> 00:43:53,960
is your agronomist why would you lie

1119
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:56,268
like that and I felt bad because he was

1120
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,659
given information by this corporation

1121
00:43:56,268 --> 00:44:03,528
build a soil but that was right on there

1122
00:43:59,659 --> 00:44:06,828
that he he thought through your every

1123
00:44:03,528 --> 00:44:09,018
time you listen it does both of you a

1124
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:12,289
disservice it does the industry just

1125
00:44:09,018 --> 00:44:15,169
service come on let's find agreement

1126
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:18,380
before we that this is not good you

1127
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:20,509
really think so Marcus well I like the

1128
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,880
idea listen what was really not good Sam

1129
00:44:20,509 --> 00:44:25,789
what was really not good was having no

1130
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,278
conversation and letting it grow with

1131
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:30,470
socially I agree with you Marcus but

1132
00:44:28,278 --> 00:44:32,960
this it's we're not coming to a

1133
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:35,838
conclusion we're just like airing our

1134
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,818
dirty laundry well because that was what

1135
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:40,009
needs to happen so that all the things

1136
00:44:37,818 --> 00:44:41,659
can be out and then here's the thing I I

1137
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:43,099
give my props up to both of these guys

1138
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:45,048
for putting it out there because here's

1139
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:47,210
the thing everything has changed with

1140
00:44:45,048 --> 00:44:49,518
social media the way we do business the

1141
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:51,318
way we learn the way we we connect with

1142
00:44:49,518 --> 00:44:54,258
one another it's all changing and it's

1143
00:44:51,318 --> 00:44:55,969
happening in real time it's changing

1144
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:58,519
like nobody knows what's happening

1145
00:44:55,969 --> 00:45:01,429
tomorrow because it changes so fast so

1146
00:44:58,518 --> 00:45:03,348
for me yeah it's a little bit I hear the

1147
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:05,690
tip for tad and that people not wanting

1148
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:08,119
to like kind of you know like jeremy has

1149
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:10,099
his perspective and so does Peter my

1150
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,869
only hope was really that we could be

1151
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:14,390
able to have a conversation that would

1152
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:15,769
move things forward for both companies

1153
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:18,048
to have because right now what's

1154
00:45:15,768 --> 00:45:20,179
happened is what happens and humans are

1155
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:23,028
so limited in the way they react and

1156
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:26,328
think in life it's just it creates sides

1157
00:45:23,028 --> 00:45:28,460
and I after spending 20 years Sam 20

1158
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:30,970
[ __ ] years on the on the other side

1159
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:33,460
of the water hash thing you know have

1160
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:35,259
Wars and and and and little you know

1161
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,970
social poisonings and it just doesn't

1162
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:40,240
stop and sometimes when you can like

1163
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:42,549
uncover it and expose it and open it up

1164
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:44,439
and look right into the nastiness you

1165
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:45,460
can clean it out and you can get it you

1166
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,369
can get it working again

1167
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:51,340
I believe both of these guys are a huge

1168
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:53,469
benefit to the community how I know is

1169
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,450
because in the chat there are people

1170
00:45:53,469 --> 00:45:56,980
defending them to the death and and

1171
00:45:55,449 --> 00:45:58,899
that's the part that scares me when we

1172
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,639
don't have the conversation [ __ ] [ __ ]

1173
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,690
Jeremy from build a soil thought Peter

1174
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,299
from soil balance

1175
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:05,530
I will go to it's like no no that's not

1176
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,420
what you need to do what Jeremy is

1177
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,400
trying to do is uncover information what

1178
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:11,559
Peters trying to do is answer questions

1179
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,780
nobody's trying to trick you or just or

1180
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:15,659
or or or take your money and these are

1181
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,490
both two companies that are trying to

1182
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:19,750
share information in a way that right

1183
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:22,029
now they've got a little bump in the

1184
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:25,119
road you know it you got to admit from

1185
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:27,280
Jeremy's perspective especially I've

1186
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,980
been there I have absolutely done the

1187
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,080
internet investigation myself and it's

1188
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:34,090
when you get that thread and you and you

1189
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:38,369
pull on it whether it's a mistake on an

1190
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:41,050
MSDS sheet whether it's an elderly

1191
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:42,730
doctor who can't remember a thing that

1192
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,920
he did because one of his students did

1193
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:46,059
it under his name

1194
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,950
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah at least we can

1195
00:46:46,059 --> 00:46:49,570
have a conversation about it and uncover

1196
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:52,089
it and expose it because right now what

1197
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:54,610
you have is half informations being

1198
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:56,950
assumed by people and I can promise you

1199
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:59,769
what is happening is hurting both of

1200
00:46:56,949 --> 00:47:01,449
these companies so I think that it would

1201
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:02,829
be wonderful and if it's hurting both of

1202
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:06,629
these companies then it's not really

1203
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:08,769
that great for say the end result of

1204
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:11,170
customers getting products that they are

1205
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:13,570
happy to be using and that's really what

1206
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:15,940
it's supposed to be all about that we're

1207
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:18,670
happy with the end results of a product

1208
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:21,250
that we're using so that's I get where

1209
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:23,500
you coming from - Sam yes I can Steve

1210
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:26,949
here how you would think that I'm

1211
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:29,710
cutting off I it was in the moment I had

1212
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:31,569
no no reason to many of you like that

1213
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:36,429
whatsoever and I could definitely yeah

1214
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:38,650
from your perspective right its Jeremy

1215
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:40,869
that one's a strong that one's as strong

1216
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:42,369
as the MSDS sheet being wrong and then

1217
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:44,539
getting changed and people assuming

1218
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:47,179
they're hiding it well it's just this

1219
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:49,820
as seeing a clip and that you can see

1220
00:47:47,179 --> 00:47:52,039
how when we react and these experiences

1221
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:54,890
happen that it doesn't necessarily have

1222
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:56,840
to be a sort of evil connotation for

1223
00:47:54,889 --> 00:47:58,609
things to play out in a way that people

1224
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,059
are go look look at what happened look

1225
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,890
look

1226
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:03,349
you see he's totally full of [ __ ] it's

1227
00:48:00,889 --> 00:48:05,779
like well you look for the worst you

1228
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:07,670
often find it and that's another way of

1229
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,890
saying it as well so what I'm trying to

1230
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:11,630
do today is I'm trying to pull the best

1231
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:13,190
out of build a soil and the best out of

1232
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,840
soil balance here's the bottom line from

1233
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,610
so a balance I have not yet used the

1234
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:19,010
product so I don't have a personal

1235
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:20,599
opinion on it however some of my friends

1236
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:23,990
that grow some of the best pot that I

1237
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:26,809
know of this 30 percent yield err 30

1238
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:29,209
percent yield off of where's my bike

1239
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:31,130
these guys have the soil balance going

1240
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:32,809
right now and they're both just they

1241
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:34,730
told me the other day that like dude I

1242
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:37,130
want to buy a couple kilos of it it's

1243
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:40,460
unbelievable [ __ ] so these guys are not

1244
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:43,610
the kind of guys to be tricked to be

1245
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:45,860
manipulated or to have something of that

1246
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:47,660
level convince them that it's working

1247
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,970
when it's really not I can tell you that

1248
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:52,429
is an impossibility with these guys here

1249
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:54,019
so I can I can give props through my

1250
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:56,089
grower friends that I have friends that

1251
00:48:54,019 --> 00:48:59,989
are using it and are growing with it and

1252
00:48:56,090 --> 00:49:01,430
it's it's it's working so you know there

1253
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:03,919
that's why I wanted to have the

1254
00:49:01,429 --> 00:49:05,929
conversation to sort of fix you know get

1255
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,300
all this out in the open and I totally

1256
00:49:05,929 --> 00:49:11,629
hear where Sam's coming from and I'm

1257
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:14,030
just I I wish we could do this on so

1258
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:16,849
many levels of business I wish we could

1259
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:18,890
I would like this to be resolved and I

1260
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:20,960
think it would be absolutely a good

1261
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:23,809
thing but to be resolved and the

1262
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:26,000
industry can use products like these if

1263
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:29,960
they're safe and effective which I

1264
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,659
believe they probably are but yeah I

1265
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:35,780
mean I don't think we're gonna really

1266
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:37,579
resolve it I think they need to resolve

1267
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:40,250
it and then they can come back on the

1268
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:42,529
show and that's how but did resolve it I

1269
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:44,030
like that idea too like I said it was

1270
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:45,040
just the start of conversation get it

1271
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:48,550
out in the open get these guys

1272
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:51,860
communicating and get more exposure to

1273
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:54,700
both of them in their in their journey

1274
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:57,789
that's what for me listen has Church I

1275
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:59,409
quit hash Church [ __ ] three weeks ago

1276
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:02,380
stop doing this I didn't I was like I'm

1277
00:49:59,409 --> 00:50:02,769
done I can't put the energy into it

1278
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,950
anymore

1279
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:08,679
Rob Clark came on the show and say

1280
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:10,989
goodbye remember vaguely vaguely

1281
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:15,579
remember that it wasn't that

1282
00:50:10,989 --> 00:50:19,209
'rememorable but I will say that oh you

1283
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:21,789

1285
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:24,820
it was Tony three weeks ago he said oh

1286
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:26,710

1287
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:29,590

1288
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:31,720

1290
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:36,279

00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:42,489
another episode then the bill the soil

1295
00:50:40,929 --> 00:50:45,759
soil balance thing happened and I

1296
00:50:42,489 --> 00:50:48,669
thought could we offer this platform to

1297
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,740
these two gentlemen to explain their

1298
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:55,240
positions and to you know at the same

1299
00:50:50,739 --> 00:50:56,949
time to also to give exposure to two

1300
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:58,119
more people so they can hear more of

1301
00:50:56,949 --> 00:51:00,699
what's going on because I can tell you

1302
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:03,339
right now this conversation is just

1303
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:04,960
sided and there's people on build a soil

1304
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:06,280
side and there's people on soil balance

1305
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,409
side so what I was trying to do is just

1306
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,360
create more of the people on both sides

1307
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:12,099
get rid of that fence so there's no

1308
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:14,559
grass is greener on the other side if

1309
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:16,179
there's things to be exposed they will

1310
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,670
be exposed and that's the bottom line

1311
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:20,469
you're just trying to open dialog you

1312
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:22,240
see a point and you're just trying to be

1313
00:51:20,469 --> 00:51:23,949
a good mediator you see a point where

1314
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,750
there could be discussion and you're

1315
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:28,149
just trying to promote the discussion

1316
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:29,949
however I think that Sam is correct I

1317
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:33,490
think this is a little more complicated

1318
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:35,589
and you know I'm always a fan of not

1319
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:37,599
airing your dirty laundry when if not

1320
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:39,700
needed I think you both presented your

1321
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,349
points but I think you need to work it

1322
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:43,809
behind the scenes otherwise this is just

1323
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:45,339
gonna be a back-and-forth all day and I

1324
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,900
don't have all day for this and I

1325
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:49,300
respect you both for what you do because

1326
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:51,519
I know growers who use both your

1327
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:54,220
products so I've also heard nothing but

1328
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:57,759
you know positive things about both your

1329
00:51:54,219 --> 00:51:59,619
products so I have to second Sam you

1330
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,150
know I would take it off long get your

1331
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:02,469
[ __ ] together and then come back and

1332
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:05,170
tell us how you've worked it out because

1333
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:07,119
you know as I've seen in chat you know

1334
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:09,130
you've definitely have people who are

1335
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,380
entrenched either way and both are

1336
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:14,200
calling you guys out either way

1337
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:16,450
because how you presented yourselves

1338
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:19,899
whether you wanted to or not that's just

1339
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:23,558
how people are so at this point I would

1340
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:25,568
you know say let's wrap this up to a bit

1341
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:27,849
because now you see an immediate

1342
00:52:25,568 --> 00:52:29,679
solution out of respect to you both

1343
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:31,960
because I respect what you're both

1344
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,308
trying to do and I respect the end

1345
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:37,119
products that your products have

1346
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:39,220
produced time and time again so work it

1347
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:43,269
out figure it out you know shake those

1348
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:46,239
trees make it important but but solve it

1349
00:52:43,268 --> 00:52:47,768
you know quell [ __ ] we don't need this

1350
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,689
stuff festering the community because

1351
00:52:47,768 --> 00:52:51,879
you know it's not about jockeying for

1352
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:54,579
position you have positions and products

1353
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,680
that are out there and if depending on

1354
00:52:54,579 --> 00:52:59,109
how you respond to this you know could

1355
00:52:56,679 --> 00:53:00,548
affect how your business goes not from

1356
00:52:59,108 --> 00:53:01,778
me I don't buy your products personally

1357
00:53:00,548 --> 00:53:04,509
because I don't grow personally right

1358
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:05,829
now however apparently from looking at

1359
00:53:04,509 --> 00:53:07,960
and if you've been watching chat there's

1360
00:53:05,829 --> 00:53:10,028
a lot of people who do and are so I

1361
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,710
wanna respect you both for what you what

1362
00:53:10,028 --> 00:53:14,650
you have what you've accomplished so

1363
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:15,338
work it out and then let's take it to

1364
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:17,289
the next step

1365
00:53:15,338 --> 00:53:18,909
yeah I would also offer if you know I

1366
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:20,619
don't know maybe I'm just being insane

1367
00:53:18,909 --> 00:53:24,338
but if you guys do need a moderator in

1368
00:53:20,619 --> 00:53:26,619
any way shape or form I'm I'm equally on

1369
00:53:24,338 --> 00:53:28,690
both of your sides I've had Peter on

1370
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:30,849
more but that doesn't mean that I'm on

1371
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:33,400
Peters side more than Jeremy's I really

1372
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:36,430
want to be a neutral sort of Switzerland

1373
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:39,490
for you guys if I can and if it's not

1374
00:53:36,429 --> 00:53:41,889
important then by all means don't don't

1375
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:43,989
worry about it I I can I still have lots

1376
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:47,078
to do in life we need a big fat

1377
00:53:43,989 --> 00:53:48,669
cleansing bong I haven't had a bong rip

1378
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:51,309
this whole thing and you know what

1379
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:54,009
welcome to Indra welcome to forest

1380
00:53:51,309 --> 00:53:55,809
welcome to Sam Sam's actually in his lab

1381
00:53:54,009 --> 00:53:58,179
today and he's gonna run us through I

1382
00:53:55,809 --> 00:54:00,460
think he's gonna run us through a BH OH

1383
00:53:58,179 --> 00:54:02,500
run while Indra tells him everything

1384
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:05,079
he's doing is wrong so I'm looking

1385

1390
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:16,838
wrong and he and and you know what he

that's a [ __ ] guy who wants to learn

1393
00:54:18,909 --> 00:54:24,548
who has put his own ego on the side of

1394
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:25,099
the chair and he's just like great tell

1395

1397
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:43,039
me nice well right off the bat right off

1398
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:45,170
the bat I love your buddy shirt he loves

1399
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:51,769
your shirt Corbin dude are you kidding

1400
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:53,269
me he could get on a microphone here

1401
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:55,730
we're in kind of like a loud area with a

1402
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:57,949
lot of air two three four five six seven

1403
00:54:55,730 --> 00:55:01,340
eight nine you could but we have 10

1404
00:54:57,949 --> 00:55:03,409
people in the chat room right now tight

1405
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:10,700
quarters well surrender to him and then

1406
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:13,309
if somebody drops out that's going on

1407
00:55:10,699 --> 00:55:16,699
kerbin getting the dry ice in there yeah

1408
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:24,500
so get a little closer here one of the

1409
00:55:16,699 --> 00:55:26,089
first things so we have a pump that we

1410
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:28,309
use to recover the butane out of our

1411
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:30,160
collection pot we have a coil here

1412
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:32,449
that's immersed in dry ice and alcohol

1413
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:34,579
so they just loading some ice in there

1414
00:55:32,449 --> 00:55:36,109
and then it will it exits at the bottom

1415
00:55:34,579 --> 00:55:39,349
and this is one big improvement we made

1416
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:42,230
is that it will grant via dravot II into

1417
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:43,670
our solvent so this is a closed-loop

1418
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:45,949
solvent extractor we use it's a

1419
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:56,450
precision px1 I made a few modifications

1420
00:55:45,949 --> 00:56:00,619
to it for the most part so we've got a

1421
00:55:56,449 --> 00:56:05,079
few accent pollen and see it's pretty

1422
00:56:00,619 --> 00:56:05,079
cold got some chillers in the next room

1423
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:12,440
we actually eliminated I take it that

1424
00:56:10,969 --> 00:56:15,139
pan is there just to catch the

1425
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,809
condensation from the ice exactly at the

1426
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:20,230
end yeah yeah the columns here drip a

1427
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:20,230
little bit

1428
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,789
so yeah we're running let's check our

1429
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:30,620
solvent time here before we get going

1430
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:34,130
too and I'll kick on the vacuum pump so

1431
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:36,319
we can pull it back here you may want to

1432
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:38,840
speak into your mic a little more sanim

1433
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,190
you're a little bit distant thanks for

1434
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,130
the heads up is that any better

1435
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:45,440
yes all right so this is our solvent

1436
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:46,910
chiller so we can here see how our

1437
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:51,530
solvent temperature in that tank is

1438
00:56:46,909 --> 00:56:54,969
about negative 24 degrees Fahrenheit and

1439
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:57,530
we've also got the heater here and this

1440
00:56:54,969 --> 00:57:00,919
keeps warm water in the jacket of the

1441
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:03,290
collection pot is how we boil off the

1442
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:06,710
gas to recover it and get it ready to

1443
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:12,079
pour out of the machine this here is the

1444
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:13,460
rest of our laboratory and corman do you

1445
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,900
want actually destroy this headset on

1446
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,900
and tell them a little bit about me

1447
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:35,389
looks like some sauces we seem to have

1448
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:38,989
lost their your audio Sam oh there you

1449

go oh he wasn't talking yet you're live

1450
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:45,289

1451
00:57:40,429 --> 00:57:48,889
rolling check out some of our finished

1452
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:52,820
product stuff that's for laboratory

1453
00:57:48,889 --> 00:57:56,000
testing like that one screen we've done

1454
00:57:52,820 --> 00:58:01,340
a lot with super Silver Haze everyone

1455
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:04,159
this is often fresh present material see

1456
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:06,079
and this is all be able to extractions

1457
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:12,710
correct yeah it's all hydrocarbon

1458
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:14,360
extracts we do butane propane blends but

1459
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:15,730
yeah you know something like this you

1460
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:18,800
know we're looks that we're still

1461
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:20,269
waiting on the residual solvents and

1462
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,640
terpene testing all that stuff but in

1463
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:23,509
our previous batches of this strain you

1464
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,059
know we've been putting in the high

1465
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:33,620
teens and last one was you know 18%

1466
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:35,090
terpenes homogenized mix stir it up and

1467
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:37,299
get all the terpenes count spread

1468
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:41,079
throughout it

1469
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:42,490
people were asking why was it so watery

1470
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:44,619
so that's the terpenes that are

1471
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:47,909
suspended around yep so yeah the

1472
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:52,000
terpenes will naturally separate

1473
00:58:47,909 --> 00:58:53,619
compound that's why I said package we're

1474
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,320
getting into it we have them kind of

1475
00:58:53,619 --> 00:59:00,639
emulsify that stuff so that every gram

1476
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:03,309
gets I have a question for you

1477
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:05,319
what percentage of the terpenes do you

1478
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:07,719
think you're actually capturing and what

1479
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:11,680
percentage are being lost to the process

1480
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:15,039
oh you know I'm not exactly sure I've

1481
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:20,199
never done any terpene testing prior to

1482
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:22,900
any of our purging process when you say

1483
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:26,439
fresh prawns and does that mean the

1484
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:28,750
material is actually like a fresh plant

1485
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:31,900
that's been frozen still have water

1486
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:34,179
probes and then with it yes correct and

1487
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:36,099
you can be a joke with water trapped in

1488
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:37,839
it like that yeah as long as the

1489
00:59:36,099 --> 00:59:40,289
temperatures remain cold and all that

1490
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,280
water freezes and I've never once

1491
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:43,960
finished a run and looked in the

1492
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:51,040
collection pod to see any moisture or

1493
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:54,929
water I know I was just asking the

1494
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:54,929
question that so a pretty ignorant guy

1495
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:11,019
yeah Sam Sam is so ignorant these are

1496
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:13,180
actually from the same exact extraction

1497
01:00:11,019 --> 01:00:15,550
just one that's been separated one who's

1498
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:17,529
at all the native terpenes left in it

1499
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:20,470
this is going to be a much higher

1500
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:23,380
testing in THC a so this is gonna be

1501
01:00:20,469 --> 01:00:25,029
their potent knockout kind of dab this

1502
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:32,530
is gonna be for those consumers they're

1503
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:35,140
just one flavor I mean here we've got

1504
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:37,170
some stuff that was round yesterday so

1505
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:39,609
this is kind of earlier in the process

1506
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:41,829
I'm not sure it's really pick it up on

1507
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:42,490
the camera but it's just starting to you

1508
01:00:41,829 --> 01:00:45,449
later

1509
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:45,449
looks purple

1510
01:00:52,909 --> 01:01:01,679
wowie and so you're going to purge that

1511
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:03,899
now correct yeah so this is just

1512
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:05,730
starting the purdue stages so it's real

1513
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:09,510
early on it so this is just attracted

1514
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:11,579
yesterday so this is kind of prior to

1515
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:14,789
any crystallization or something

1516
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:19,890
separate and the jars you said that they

1517
01:01:14,789 --> 01:01:24,028
were 18% terpenes and what percent THC

1518
01:01:19,889 --> 01:01:25,828
or TTA typically for our higher terpene

1519
01:01:24,028 --> 01:01:32,519
testing stuff we're seeing in the high

1520
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:35,539
50 to mid 70 percent range recent asked

1521
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:40,980
it was because if you cannabis is say

1522
01:01:35,539 --> 01:01:43,760
20% THC and your product there is 70

1523
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:47,849
it's three and a half times stronger so

1524
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:54,660
terpenes it doesn't seem like you lost

1525
01:01:47,849 --> 01:01:56,789
very many I mean I you know without

1526
01:01:54,659 --> 01:01:59,639
sacrificing quality and picking up

1527
01:01:56,789 --> 01:02:01,829
things that we don't want now those are

1528
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:03,509
pretty high numbers 18% why did the

1529
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:10,920
how's your parts per million in

1530
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:13,250
residuals on your tests typically we're

1531
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:16,170
under a hundred PPM's a lot of times

1532
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:18,329
undetected so like kids testers all for

1533
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:21,869
a Dutch treat live resident this one was

1534
01:02:18,329 --> 01:02:25,260
17% terpenes fifty-nine percent THC

1535
01:02:21,869 --> 01:02:36,119
total this laboratory only tests down to

1536
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:37,260
25 ppm that was a good wine this is one

1537
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:39,210
of our more recent ones this is our

1538
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:42,569
highest testing terpene total so far

1539
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:45,778
twenty one point four nine once again no

1540
01:02:42,568 --> 01:02:48,659
detective solids so typically the higher

1541
01:02:45,778 --> 01:02:51,059
terpene extract because that Turkey and

1542
01:02:48,659 --> 01:02:53,098
portion of it is so water like it's

1543
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:55,380
actually very easy to remove all those

1544
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:57,809
residual solvents argue things a lot of

1545
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:59,700
misconceptions about that are you

1546
01:02:57,809 --> 01:03:02,030
producing this material yourselves or

1547
01:02:59,699 --> 01:03:04,559
you're purchasing

1548
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:06,090
sorry say again this material that

1549
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:09,889
you're running is this stuff that you

1550
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:12,870
have grown from the beginning or is this

1551
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:14,519
we have a pretty small grow here so for

1552
01:03:12,869 --> 01:03:16,739
the demand of our concentrates we do

1553
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:22,519
purchase a lot of material so with my

1554
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:25,229
line stuff from are you guys how is the

1555
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:26,610
pesticides michael butanol systemic sort

1556
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:28,829
of pesticide issues other people are

1557
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:31,170
having are you guys running into that at

1558
01:03:28,829 --> 01:03:33,210
all posts Madi we're pretty careful with

1559
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:34,950
the farmers we work with and I've got

1560
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:37,320
quite a bit of trust instilled in them

1561
01:03:34,949 --> 01:03:39,419
and we've done random pesticide tests on

1562
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:42,090
starting material things like that just

1563
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,680
to check we've also you know the farm

1564
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:45,360
that we work with primarily we've

1565
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:56,909
encouraged that they may have actually

1566
01:03:45,360 --> 01:04:05,820
the Liquor Control Board are you testing

1567
01:03:56,909 --> 01:04:07,139
the final product though yeah I would I

1568
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:10,769
would definitely recommend it for

1569
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:13,500
certain farms I've seen a problem where

1570
01:04:10,769 --> 01:04:19,530
a lot of flowers test clean until we

1571
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:21,650
concentrated and all the sometimes if

1572
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:25,400
the farm is getting their clones from

1573
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:28,139
other sources that they think are clean

1574
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:30,500
yeah no absolutely it's definitely a big

1575
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:30,500
concern

1576
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:54,669
can't hear you there and when when your

1577
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:57,099
product is finished like that and it's

1578
01:04:54,670 --> 01:05:00,730
eighteen or twenty-one percent terpenes

1579
01:04:57,099 --> 01:05:04,449
or most of the monoterpenes still intact

1580
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:11,760
is it close to the original profile of

1581
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:11,759
the plant no we can't hear you

1582
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:31,630
you know profiles your results so do you

1583
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:34,989
see that recently published article

1584
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:38,200
about co2 extractions and how they have

1585
01:05:34,989 --> 01:05:39,309
a tendency to lose all the Manos you

1586
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:40,659
know I haven't had a chance to look

1587
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:43,650
through it but Sam just sent it to me

1588
01:05:40,659 --> 01:05:45,549
yesterday so that's on my list of things

1589
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:48,070
sounds pretty interesting

1590
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:50,080
I definitely always had a feeling that

1591
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:55,840
there was something about co2 extraction

1592
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:57,819
flavor in Turkey and why it wasn't

1593
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,960
saying that you lose all the mono as it

1594
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:01,870
was saying that there was chemistry

1595
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:05,769
going on somewhere

1596
01:06:01,869 --> 01:06:15,009
well a combination of loss and change

1597
01:06:05,769 --> 01:06:26,800
you're correct show you here as far as

1598
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:34,390
finished product very nice I have one

1599
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:38,440
question a limit to the size of beakers

1600
01:06:34,389 --> 01:06:42,159
that you can create these crystals of ta

1601
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:45,280
ta n in other words if you had a 10,000

1602
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:47,109
litre beaker would it still work we

1603
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,359
certainly don't have the oven space to

1604
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:52,780
try anything that large

1605
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:54,969
but from everything we've tried the the

1606
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:56,980
smaller surface area does seem to help

1607
01:06:54,969 --> 01:07:00,399
but when we're doing these really large

1608
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:02,889
runs just becomes many many jars that

1609
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:09,309
would have to get filled up John John

1610
01:07:02,889 --> 01:07:14,639
they're using ovens John I know what

1611
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:14,639
Indra has to say about using vac ovens

1612
01:07:18,809 --> 01:07:24,460
we lost you again we can't hear you

1613
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:26,108
Indra your your microphone now it's the

1614
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:27,250
opposite of what it was last week and we

1615
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:28,809
can barely hear you

1616
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:34,480
yeah now it sounds like it's in your ass

1617
01:07:28,809 --> 01:07:38,679
instead of your mouth sorry I just had

1618
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:40,269
to make everyone laugh I'm glad you're

1619
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:41,858
sticking around to Jeremy because I want

1620
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:44,108
well I want us to talk a little bit more

1621
01:07:41,858 --> 01:07:46,480
just about your company and about what's

1622
01:07:44,108 --> 01:07:48,069
going on same with you Peter we can

1623
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:52,900
still have conversations without getting

1624
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:57,490
into the into the actual back-and-forth

1625
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:59,530
that Sam and yet Tim have no time for we

1626
01:07:57,489 --> 01:08:02,409
have time for the resolution that when

1627
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:04,030
it will be announced yes the resolution

1628
01:08:02,409 --> 01:08:06,279
will be announced he shout out to

1629
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:09,369
pharmacy for the nice hat today is day

1630
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:12,490
one well I think to take home message

1631
01:08:09,369 --> 01:08:16,869
from today take-home message from today

1632
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:18,789
is that growing organically is a dirty

1633
01:08:16,869 --> 01:08:21,670
dirty dirty process and everybody should

1634
01:08:18,789 --> 01:08:26,500
be growing hydroponically exist yes

1635
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:29,710
basically you starting at you starting

1636
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:33,189
to take on Sam's humor I like dirt not

1637
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:37,210
if you want terpenes yeah terpenes true

1638
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:39,250
story true story try to deny that yeah

1639
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:41,529
well it'll reverse e subsides to back

1640
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:43,750
that up I guess yeah well I know that

1641
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:45,969
Tony who is doing a lot of protein

1642
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:48,369
extraction you know not many people are

1643
01:08:45,969 --> 01:08:50,170
actually extracting terpenes the way

1644
01:08:48,369 --> 01:08:51,849
Tony is so he has a very unique

1645
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:55,180
perspective I wish he was here today

1646
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:57,690
because he definitely sees a very high

1647
01:08:55,180 --> 01:09:01,480
percentage coming out of like greenhouse

1648
01:08:57,689 --> 01:09:02,379
but terpenes higher much higher than

1649
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:05,599
Indore

1650
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:08,930
yeah we're working now we were pretty

1651
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:11,210
much the first to be doing a quantified

1652
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:13,430
terpene method so I don't know I think I

1653
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:15,980
know a little bit about Terps for sure

1654
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:19,070
I'm just saying Tony processes like

1655
01:09:15,979 --> 01:09:20,989
hundreds thousands of pounds of cannabis

1656
01:09:19,069 --> 01:09:23,569
to produce terpenes he's produced more

1657
01:09:20,989 --> 01:09:26,920
terpenes than most people will ever see

1658
01:09:23,569 --> 01:09:26,920
in their life that's all I'm saying

1659
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:33,199
he knows what produces and what don't

1660
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:35,840
yeah that's exactly all I'm saying he's

1661
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:38,179
not like mr. terpene science guy but

1662
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:39,800
he's definitely like out of all the

1663
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:41,329
people I talked to cuz I'll often be

1664
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,980
like oh how you know how many thousands

1665
01:09:41,329 --> 01:09:46,269
of pounds have you run for terpenes and

1666
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:51,319
they'll be like what I like I thought so

1667
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:54,860
okay my two cents about your crystal

1668
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:56,750
phenomena are you here THC a it's not a

1669
01:09:54,859 --> 01:09:58,519
phenomenon to start with you guys are

1670
01:09:56,750 --> 01:10:03,109
leaving a certain amount of gas in your

1671
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:06,650
extract what the gas enjoin as the gas

1672
01:10:03,109 --> 01:10:09,649
machine you're like accurate as the gas

1673
01:10:06,649 --> 01:10:13,279
matriculates out of the solution while

1674
01:10:09,649 --> 01:10:15,319
you're letting it fit there the lighter

1675
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:21,649
stuff goes to the top and the heavier

1676
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:23,329
stuff falls to the bottom I'm not asking

1677
01:10:21,649 --> 01:10:24,019
for a great man I'm explaining something

1678
01:10:23,329 --> 01:10:26,989
to you

1679
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:29,030
the heavier stuff is the PATA crystals

1680
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:31,819
falling out on the bottom and the

1681
01:10:29,029 --> 01:10:34,759
lighter stuff is the higher fractions in

1682
01:10:31,819 --> 01:10:37,989
the terpene they're going out near the

1683
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:41,090
top and it's not a phenomenon because

1684
01:10:37,989 --> 01:10:44,479
we've got a 120 pound chamber if we

1685
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:47,569
extract 25 kilos at a whack and we see

1686
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:50,029
it happen in the chamber but that's

1687
01:10:47,569 --> 01:10:54,259
because our system doesn't work like

1688
01:10:50,029 --> 01:10:56,539
yours we freeze the top chamber as we're

1689
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:58,100
putting it in by the way we put the gas

1690
01:10:56,539 --> 01:11:00,439
in we put it through special kind of

1691
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:04,460
nozzle that freezes everything that

1692
01:11:00,439 --> 01:11:06,319
freezes all the plant lipids and wax

1693
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:09,020
right in the top chamber and we just

1694
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:13,739
shower down the good stuff and in the

1695
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:15,240
bottom we have very pure material

1696
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:16,800
and there's a lot of pictures on this

1697
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:18,239
again you can see what the material

1698
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,789
comes out the way we do it

1699
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:22,739
and but we don't have these extra

1700
01:11:20,789 --> 01:11:24,649
columns and stuff because we don't need

1701
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:27,689
them because the our system

1702
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:29,819
thermodynamically balanced and it's

1703
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:31,619
thermal that and make dynamically

1704
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:35,549
levered from one part of the extraction

1705
01:11:31,619 --> 01:11:38,279
to the next also at the bottom of ours

1706
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:41,940
we have zero parts per million

1707
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:44,699
we don't do four outs we don't advocate

1708
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:48,929
for Alex we don't we don't think it's a

1709
01:11:44,699 --> 01:11:51,149
safe process and our system recovers all

1710
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:54,360
of the gas certs although the gas back

1711
01:11:51,149 --> 01:11:56,009
in the storage tank and we don't use

1712
01:11:54,359 --> 01:12:00,599
vacuum oven so we don't need a vacuum

1713
01:11:56,010 --> 01:12:03,150
oven our bottom chamber is using the

1714
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:05,310
heat from the compressed gas in a jacket

1715
01:12:03,149 --> 01:12:08,039
around it to help

1716
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:10,590
and so if purges right in the equipment

1717
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:13,470
so all these other things that you guys

1718
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:15,569
have got going there the vacuum oven and

1719
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:19,409
all that stuff those are all things that

1720
01:12:15,569 --> 01:12:22,380
were done like a doctor sometimes treats

1721
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:25,319
things from the symptoms rather than

1722
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:28,170
what's really wrong and that's how those

1723
01:12:25,319 --> 01:12:30,119
systems came about that system that

1724
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:34,500
you're running there came about that way

1725
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:40,260
our system is just received state of

1726
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:42,630
California zone 2 certification so we're

1727
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:45,449
not a class one zone one system or class

1728
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:47,940
1 zone 2 don't need a bomb-proof room to

1729
01:12:45,449 --> 01:12:50,279
run ours in and that says a lot for the

1730
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:52,859
safety of it this because of the way we

1731
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:55,559
look at it and how we handle everything

1732
01:12:52,859 --> 01:12:58,319
the gas comes in the room goes into the

1733
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:02,190
chamber goes into the bottom chamber is

1734
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:04,199
recovered back out and very quickly is

1735
01:13:02,189 --> 01:13:08,519
that right back to a filter systems to

1736
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:11,250
the storage and so our department like

1737
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:15,660
that so well that they gave us class to

1738
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:17,430
eat it's a fantastic system and I've

1739
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:18,569
been following you closely since its

1740
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:21,450
first appearance on the how security

1741
01:13:18,569 --> 01:13:22,349
back on episode 96 and 98 and I'm not

1742
01:13:21,449 --> 01:13:24,359
sure if you're at all but I actually

1743
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:26,250
wrote you inquiring about your system to

1744
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:27,349
if I could purchase one for a previous

1745
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:30,960
company out there

1746
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:34,250
where'd you write to a fan of Jah I

1747
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:44,010
think it was John Davis at yahoo.com and

1748
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:46,198
no you missed it so we're running with

1749
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:48,119
what a lot of it just to run with the

1750
01:13:46,198 --> 01:13:49,769
system that works well for us I can't

1751
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:57,599
wait to see your system up and running

1752
01:13:49,770 --> 01:14:00,210
and to see how our system sits on the

1753
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,699
sled it's got everything there we've got

1754
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:06,448
a recovery system that we import it from

1755
01:14:02,698 --> 01:14:09,889
Germany that under ideal conditions can

1756
01:14:06,448 --> 01:14:13,849
recover twenty five gallons a minute and

1757
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:16,530
we is the heat from this compression

1758
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:19,770
help purge the gas back out of the

1759
01:14:16,529 --> 01:14:23,340
system but you know we do 120 pound

1760
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:25,410
loads every hour and so you put 120

1761
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:27,869
pounds in an hour later you got the 15

1762
01:14:25,409 --> 01:14:30,539
or 20 kilos of oil whatever it is you

1763
01:14:27,869 --> 01:14:32,579
were looking for and the bottom chamber

1764
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:35,488
the catch chamber is eighty five gallon

1765
01:14:32,579 --> 01:14:38,640
chamber so you can actually dump another

1766
01:14:35,488 --> 01:14:40,169
load in the top and extract a second and

1767
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,239
the third and the fourth one you can

1768
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:44,789
carry on all day long in an eight-hour

1769
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:46,679
shift the guy can extract a thousand

1770
01:14:44,789 --> 01:14:49,260
pounds without very much difficulty at

1771
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:52,140
all and if he's got two or three guys

1772
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:56,430
one guy preparing it by cryo grinding

1773
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:58,440
you can bump that up to nearly double so

1774
01:14:56,430 --> 01:15:03,210
the system is a real beauty it sits on a

1775
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:08,339
sled it weighs 2,000 pounds the top

1776
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:11,489
chamber is a 30-inch man way the bottom

1777
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:13,770
door is a 24-inch man way so you can

1778
01:15:11,488 --> 01:15:16,229
actually crawl in to these things

1779
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:18,750
they're made a holloway steel which is

1780
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:21,029
one of the finest stainless steel

1781
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:23,069
foundries in the world from holloway

1782
01:15:21,029 --> 01:15:26,909
they get shipped directly to universal

1783
01:15:23,069 --> 01:15:29,009
air gas who mounts the german recovery

1784
01:15:26,909 --> 01:15:31,529
pump system and the vacuum system and

1785
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:34,860
the control system and the computer all

1786
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:37,170
together on it test it gasses it up

1787
01:15:34,859 --> 01:15:40,889
bubble wraps it and then ships it to you

1788
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:43,770
ready to go so it's a really solid sis

1789
01:15:40,889 --> 01:15:47,010
err gas wouldn't be involved if it

1790
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:49,409
wasn't these guys are they're on oil

1791
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:51,840
platforms all over the world they

1792
01:15:49,408 --> 01:15:53,549
designed our recovery system for us and

1793
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,329
it really it's the hottest thing

1794
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:57,900
somewhere

1795
01:15:54,329 --> 01:16:00,059
since sunburn I am NOT arrogant I'm just

1796

1799
01:16:04,948 --> 01:16:12,210

swimmingly

1821

Holloway's got the stuff nearly done

1822
01:17:03,179 --> 01:17:07,980
it'll go to air gas and then what will

1823
01:17:05,939 --> 01:17:10,229
you do well what part of it will you

1824

shoot your mouth off about them now I

1825
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:13,709
want to see unit working and I want to

1826
01:17:12,029 --> 01:17:15,809
see the lab results before I put any

1827
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:23,609
money yet money down did that's not too

1828

1831
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:35,279
Church it's know this is part church

1832
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:37,050
someone was calling it court hash court

1833
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:38,579
no well let's just call it integrity

1834
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:40,289
Church I mean [ __ ] why don't you know

1835
01:17:38,579 --> 01:17:41,399
it's like what is this an ad like

1836
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:42,810
everybody gettin up here and just

1837
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:46,500
pumping their stuff are we gonna have

1838
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:47,760
some results well I will say this like

1839
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:51,569
I've said it before

1840
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:54,179
when I asked Indra to see results I said

1841
01:17:51,569 --> 01:17:54,689
I I pulled a you I was kind of like the

1842
01:17:54,179 --> 01:17:56,819
doubting to

1843
01:17:54,689 --> 01:17:59,789
who wanted to touch the ink Emporio body

1844
01:17:56,819 --> 01:18:01,948
of Christ I didn't believe it and so

1845
01:17:59,789 --> 01:18:04,019
what I did was I sent him material and I

1846
01:18:01,948 --> 01:18:05,849
said if you can just make the best resin

1847
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:08,270
then you should have no [ __ ] problem

1848
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:11,510
whatsoever and I was aggressive about it

1849
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:14,520
defatting this hemp seed yeah I know

1850
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:15,989
dude listen it's maybe a story but I'm

1851
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,760
telling you you know how involved I am

1852
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:19,379
in the hemp industry yeah but dude I

1853
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,940
mean I've heard it I've been there I've

1854
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:23,969
seen that and we're past that stage now

1855
01:18:20,939 --> 01:18:25,979
and it's like if if these magical units

1856
01:18:23,969 --> 01:18:28,050
exist then why can't I see one why can't

1857
01:18:25,979 --> 01:18:30,299
I go like you know run some material

1858
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:32,100
through it and get a lab result yeah I'm

1859
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:36,210
saying that's not that's not too much to

1860
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:38,070
ask right we can do a live I want to see

1861
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:47,090
that thing up and running spread my one

1862
01:18:38,069 --> 01:18:49,829
so I want to take your word for it right

1863
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:53,190
look we were tested in the flavor and

1864
01:18:49,829 --> 01:18:56,670
fragrance industry for 14 years by all

1865
01:18:53,189 --> 01:18:58,859
the real labs not marijuana labs we were

1866
01:18:56,670 --> 01:19:02,010
tested because we made stuff for her

1867
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:04,679
birthday for her Manish we extracted

1868
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:07,110
flavors and fragrances for 14 years and

1869
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:09,780
so the fact that we're just slipping

1870
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:12,960
over into the cannabis industry should

1871
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:15,569
be a heads up and everybody thinking

1872
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,689
well here comes expertise from around

1873
01:19:15,569 --> 01:19:21,269
the world from someone that's been

1874
01:19:17,689 --> 01:19:23,639
extracting everything not just anibus

1875
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:25,860
yeah but this fan is that when you get

1876
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,600
up and you start ton when it's the guy

1877
01:19:25,859 --> 01:19:29,099
that's selling the Machine that's

1878
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,320
telling everybody that they're the world

1879
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:33,930
expert with no data to back it up and

1880
01:19:31,319 --> 01:19:35,130
that's a real problem so and there's

1881
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:36,750
nothing that you can say that's gonna

1882
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:38,430
change my mind on that I don't care if

1883
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:41,250
you're solid bacteria you're selling

1884
01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:44,489
machines you're so I wait I pop mark

1885
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:46,920
bought one of the machines and is using

1886
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:49,319
it in Oakland what is it is it delivered

1887
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:50,850
yet I mean can I go down and see it run

1888
01:19:49,319 --> 01:19:54,149
and get a lab result and set it to the

1889
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:59,670
lab definitely you definitely cannot go

1890
01:19:54,149 --> 01:20:02,659
down and see it run well putting any

1891
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:09,099
money down it's as easy as that

1892
01:20:02,659 --> 01:20:11,538
people buy a BSA

1893
01:20:09,099 --> 01:20:13,369
well obviously when people buy these

1894
01:20:11,538 --> 01:20:15,948
machines though they have to see them

1895
01:20:13,368 --> 01:20:19,399
tested no one's buying this sight unseen

1896
01:20:15,948 --> 01:20:21,948
are they in drunk no we we make a test

1897
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:27,578
run for everybody everybody approves the

1898
01:20:21,948 --> 01:20:30,799
test run loves it all right so who has

1899
01:20:27,578 --> 01:20:33,469
who do we know who do we know in our

1900
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:41,599
community that has had a test run and

1901
01:20:33,469 --> 01:20:43,038
seen this done mark mark mark scale Doan

1902
01:20:41,599 --> 01:20:48,619
I thought you were joking I thought you

1903
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:57,889
were saying me last I heard it was being

1904
01:20:48,618 --> 01:21:00,348
installed nice again like I just find it

1905
01:20:57,889 --> 01:21:01,998
funny that there's always you know Todd

1906
01:21:00,349 --> 01:21:04,099
was in the same boat he was the doubting

1907
01:21:01,998 --> 01:21:06,380

1911
01:21:10,519 --> 01:21:14,479
he lived in Kansas and it was like less

1912
01:21:12,559 --> 01:21:16,760
than a week later I got this [ __ ] back I

1913
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:18,860
had to test it in multiple labs I mean I

1914
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:20,869
had it done have you contacted him at

1915
01:21:18,859 --> 01:21:22,429
all chimera in regards to this or did

1916
01:21:20,868 --> 01:21:24,288

Cup well I don't know I don't know so

1918
01:21:24,288 --> 01:21:27,559
I'm being just honest cuz I'm sure like

1919
01:21:26,118 --> 01:21:29,299
now you've defended him so he's gonna be

1920
01:21:27,559 --> 01:21:31,820
like you can't come here but I'm sure it

1921
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:33,439
would be as simple as I'm a you know if

1922
01:21:31,819 --> 01:21:35,058
I'm offending someone by asking

1923
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:37,579
questions about their product and their

1924
01:21:35,059 --> 01:21:39,320
process then that's ridiculous you know

1925
01:21:37,578 --> 01:21:42,139
what I mean like you can go in every

1926
01:21:39,319 --> 01:21:43,880
lift is your attitude dude that's what's

1927
01:21:42,139 --> 01:21:45,650
ridiculous yeah yeah it's just the vibes

1928
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:47,418
it's not the question at all don't get

1929
01:21:45,649 --> 01:21:48,978
me wrong I also don't have a horse in

1930
01:21:47,418 --> 01:21:50,179

1931
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:51,769

1932
01:21:50,179 --> 01:21:55,429

have really good vibes like me yeah man

1935
01:21:58,269 --> 01:22:03,320
no you don't have to have any vibes I'm

1936
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:07,788
just saying it wasn't asking the

1937
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:10,399
question it was that it was this that

1938
01:22:07,788 --> 01:22:12,559
was the vibe so it's like he was like

1939
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:17,299
the automatic human response to that

1940
01:22:12,559 --> 01:22:20,090
vibe Indre or not is and back and forth

1941
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:20,520
it goes like I thought that soil balance

1942
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:22,079
and Bill

1943
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:24,330
so I was doing much better in their

1944
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:26,100
disagreements but hey I'm not here to

1945
01:22:24,329 --> 01:22:28,319
judge I'd appreciate you when you said

1946
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:30,450
it I laughed and then when Indra said

1947
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:32,099
what he said I laughed then too and then

1948
01:22:30,449 --> 01:22:34,229
once again I see all the sheep in the

1949
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:35,730
chat room picking sides right away yeah

1950
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:37,529
interest faked yeah Oh

1951
01:22:35,729 --> 01:22:39,569
chimera does nobody's talking like I

1952
01:22:37,529 --> 01:22:41,340
just think it's all hilarious this is

1953
01:22:39,569 --> 01:22:44,099
like a human experiment please continue

1954
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:50,190
to all do what you're doing and nobody

1955
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:54,630
nobody's doing it wrong in between the

1956
01:22:50,189 --> 01:22:55,469
third week of January and the second

1957
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:59,810
week of February

1958
01:22:55,470 --> 01:23:04,890
five will be delivered and those five

1959
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:08,640
almost people took samples looked into

1960
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:15,119
it even had lawyers did due diligence

1961
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:17,010
looked at the eye and they bought into

1962
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:19,380
it and that's as simple as that those

1963
01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:21,810
are sold and now I'm getting ready to

1964
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:24,270
start on manufacturing cycle number two

1965
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:27,300
and I'm going to make pen in a second

1966
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:31,230
manufacturing cycle plus we are now have

1967
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:34,230
a build budget sheet coming for the five

1968
01:23:31,229 --> 01:23:38,159
liter model which is five gallons 10

1969
01:23:34,229 --> 01:23:41,209
gallons lower and yeah it's gonna be

1970
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:43,439
affordable and it's gonna be the people

1971
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:46,949
extractor for people who want a small

1972
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:49,529
small amount expect well now you know

1973
01:23:46,949 --> 01:23:51,479
what we'll do we'll put it on the bin

1974
01:23:49,529 --> 01:23:53,909
like we did with build a soil and soil

1975
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:55,919
balance and what you can do is just come

1976
01:23:53,909 --> 01:23:57,359
back with the solution when it's the

1977
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,829
unit and it's available and you're

1978
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:00,420
sitting there and you've invited Sam

1979
01:23:58,829 --> 01:24:02,760
over and you guys are gonna do a batch

1980
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:04,470
then that's the solution because it's

1981
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:06,420
you know then chimeras defense it's a

1982
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:08,909
lot of it's been a lot of talking about

1983
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:11,100
the unit some photos of it but not even

1984
01:24:08,909 --> 01:24:13,229
like a video or something - people

1985
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:15,690
definitely are way past due in seeing

1986
01:24:13,229 --> 01:24:19,259
this process work and wouldn't have

1987
01:24:15,689 --> 01:24:19,769
found mark it's it's very absolutely

1988
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:22,020
quiet

1989
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:24,150
it does all the process filling it

1990
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:25,830
emptying it opening the door likes you

1991
01:24:24,149 --> 01:24:28,079
know all those little things like I mean

1992
01:24:25,829 --> 01:24:30,630
it's definitely a big part of mark well

1993
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:33,119
product like well as soon as they're

1994
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:34,300
finished at the install site where we're

1995
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:37,599
putting the one in with

1996
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:39,969
elation hmm which they're not done with

1997

production for you because it's true

2004
01:24:51,118 --> 01:24:56,198

01:26:20,738 --> 01:26:23,888
things need to start kicking up so we're

2036
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:25,808
running around the clock right now with

2037

2041
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:41,529
now with like snow right on top of the

2042
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:43,690
mountains right there's yeah I saw some

2043
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:45,219
frozen things down at Benson Elvis's

2044
01:26:43,689 --> 01:26:48,009
place in Washington and some other

2045
01:26:45,219 --> 01:26:50,710
places that just like fields just fro

2046
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:52,030
on the stock I was like even the

2047
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:55,180
Southern Oregon and Northern California

2048
01:26:52,029 --> 01:27:00,789
got some pretty good Frost's on there so

2049
01:26:55,180 --> 01:27:02,619
it's okay it brings the frost well I'm

2050
01:27:00,789 --> 01:27:04,869
glad to have you guys here sharing the

2051
01:27:02,619 --> 01:27:06,130
good vibes we've we've had had an

2052
01:27:04,869 --> 01:27:08,979
interesting Hastert's

2053
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:11,470
that's a really that's a really loud

2054
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:13,269
sound Sam so you got to keep that mic

2055
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:15,820
muted unless you want to say something

2056
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:17,440
oh he kept it muted there we go

2057
01:27:15,819 --> 01:27:21,519
I've been like sometimes I get into

2058
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:23,619
these funny little like mute Wars go

2059
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,180
ahead Sam but I'm trying to jump in but

2060
01:27:23,619 --> 01:27:26,849
there's a lot of discussion happening we

2061
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:30,489
just wanted to get things going here and

2062
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:31,720
underway so we pulled the vacuum on

2063
01:27:30,488 --> 01:27:36,069
everything and about two cents of

2064
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:39,520
solvent and we're starting how much does

2065
01:27:36,069 --> 01:27:41,590
that chamber fin so the solvent tank

2066
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:44,050
here can hold about 20 pounds to solve

2067
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:47,440
it the material column as you saw we had

2068
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:48,850
these socks so a good analogy here is

2069
01:27:47,439 --> 01:27:50,889
kind of like you're making bubble hash

2070
01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:52,390
shoes in the work bag yeah using these

2071
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:54,970
columns foxes we can put our material

2072
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:55,810
inside and for fresh frozen which is

2073
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:58,750
what we're doing today

2074
01:27:55,810 --> 01:28:00,760
you can fit about five to six pounds now

2075
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:02,529
most of that weight is water you know

2076
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:04,119
which is frozen in height and then

2077
01:28:02,529 --> 01:28:05,409
during the extraction process we do our

2078
01:28:04,119 --> 01:28:07,439
best to keep everything as cold as

2079
01:28:05,409 --> 01:28:07,439
possible

2080
01:28:09,149 --> 01:28:14,019
cannabis is so incredible like I'm just

2081
01:28:11,738 --> 01:28:15,549
like a kind of like sift guy water hash

2082
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:17,980
guy but it's quite something that you

2083
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:20,079
can have these insane machines built and

2084
01:28:17,979 --> 01:28:22,869
be using co2 and all different

2085
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:26,319
hydrocarbons and can't forget Horatio's

2086
01:28:22,869 --> 01:28:29,529
old method of using the actual terpene d

2087
01:28:26,319 --> 01:28:31,719
limonene it's it's just unbelievable

2088
01:28:29,529 --> 01:28:34,119
that it produces its own hydrocarbons to

2089
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:39,190
do its own extraction like how kind of

2090
01:28:34,119 --> 01:28:40,659
insane is that that's like Inception is

2091
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:43,988
telling me that we were leaving a large

2092
01:28:40,659 --> 01:28:45,819
amount of solvent behind the terpenes in

2093
01:28:43,988 --> 01:28:48,129
cannabis are more effective solvent to

2094
01:28:45,819 --> 01:28:49,630
promote crystallization so we really

2095
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:52,150
would convert all this solvent we can

2096
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:53,380
out of the run and just let the turkey

2097
01:28:52,149 --> 01:28:55,389
let's do their work and it's more about

2098
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:57,579
the extraction process in the gas

2099
01:28:55,390 --> 01:29:01,110
I used to get a thorough extraction of

2100
01:28:57,579 --> 01:29:03,189
his penis they promised that Rico sauces

2101
01:29:01,109 --> 01:29:09,849
interesting chemistry the plant does a

2102
01:29:03,189 --> 01:29:12,009
lot for interesting well I don't think

2103
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:14,440
I'll be picking up the the method

2104
01:29:12,010 --> 01:29:17,250
tomorrow by any means I'm just such a

2105
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:21,039
fan of like the quick and easy just like

2106
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:30,909
you know produce that nice little oil

2107
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:36,670
right at home with just a press and holy

2108
01:29:30,909 --> 01:29:38,050
[ __ ] the rice if this is just a

2109
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:42,880
different kind of a product it's another

2110
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:45,550
option out there yeah like I said I sure

2111
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:47,949
wouldn't fight against any particular oh

2112
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:51,400
let me mute your mic again because it's

2113
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:53,349
really bad sound going inside the column

2114
01:29:51,399 --> 01:29:55,719
there as they fill it up I was gonna say

2115
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:58,360
I'm not really one to fight against

2116
01:29:55,720 --> 01:30:00,520
anyone as I get older I realize you know

2117
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:03,039
promote the one you love or the ones you

2118
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:05,380
love over fighting against the the ones

2119
01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:07,329
that you maybe don't think people should

2120
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:09,130
be doing or whatnot who cares about your

2121
01:30:07,329 --> 01:30:10,899
opinion on that like let people do what

2122
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:13,600
they want to do take it to the highest

2123
01:30:10,899 --> 01:30:16,299
level and for me I've just been you know

2124
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:18,220
more promotion promoting like the

2125
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:20,409
methods that I prefer which are solvent

2126
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:22,150
list methods I say solvent list which is

2127
01:30:20,409 --> 01:30:23,889
kind of impossible because the terpenes

2128
01:30:22,149 --> 01:30:25,629
are some of them are solvents and I

2129
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:27,250
guess in that sense you can't really

2130
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:29,130
ever have a solvent list product if it's

2131
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:31,359
a cannabis extract unless you're evil

2132
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:33,789
people have told us that water is

2133
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:35,889
solvent I thought water is a solvent

2134
01:30:33,789 --> 01:30:38,170
it's the universal solvent it's true

2135
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:41,020
it's it's a it's kind of a funny one

2136
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:44,680
it's kind of just like the most like

2137
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:47,080
ironic term for salt like I guess what I

2138
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:48,640
tell people when they say I say maybe if

2139
01:30:47,079 --> 01:30:52,659
you want to promote the fact that it's

2140
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:54,490
like non petrochemical solvents to make

2141
01:30:52,659 --> 01:30:59,590
this extract you could kind of get a

2142
01:30:54,489 --> 01:31:05,050
little more specific about it but by the

2143
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:06,060
way betaine is organic number one all

2144
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:10,110
right

2145
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:12,390
number two how you apply the butane to

2146
01:31:10,109 --> 01:31:15,889
the product makes a huge huge difference

2147
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:19,289
in the outcome of the product you know

2148
01:31:15,890 --> 01:31:23,730
the fact that they are flooding the

2149
01:31:19,289 --> 01:31:26,130
chamber is makes them have to go to the

2150
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:29,759
step number two of having a column

2151
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:31,829
that's very cold to remove the stuff

2152
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:34,260
that they got from flooding the chamber

2153
01:31:31,829 --> 01:31:36,720
rather than freezing the chamber itself

2154
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:41,310
and then just getting the essential oil

2155
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:43,440
wash down think about it I mean that

2156
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:46,440
column is frozen it's are genetically

2157
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:48,029
frozen we have a chiller that I know I'm

2158
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:51,449
saying they the reason you need that

2159
01:31:48,029 --> 01:31:54,779
column is because your extraction

2160
01:31:51,449 --> 01:31:57,449
chamber isn't up to snuff it isn't

2161
01:31:54,779 --> 01:32:00,029
designed right so you need that column

2162
01:31:57,449 --> 01:32:02,819
in order because you flood your chamber

2163
01:32:00,029 --> 01:32:05,429
and then you drain the flood off which

2164
01:32:02,819 --> 01:32:07,889
contains the lipids and the waxes and

2165
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:19,590
the oil and we don't go about it that

2166
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:35,550
way anyway enough zoom around will be if

2167
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:37,020
you're interested get in touch and well

2168
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:40,380
I'll tell you one thing I'm not a big

2169
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:44,130
fan of oil but Sam brought he had a tiny

2170
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:45,539
little piece of this sugar wax or

2171
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:47,250
whatever it wasn't it was smell

2172
01:32:45,539 --> 01:32:48,899
beautiful looked beautiful model I

2173
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:50,579
almost wanted to photograph it with my

2174
01:32:48,899 --> 01:32:55,409
macro lens cuz it was just like little

2175
01:32:50,579 --> 01:32:56,850
diamonds shining yeah I think he seems

2176
01:32:55,409 --> 01:32:59,039
to be a conscious guy he taught us about

2177
01:32:56,850 --> 01:33:00,750
vape pens and the insides of the vape

2178
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:03,119
pens and what was going on inside those

2179
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:04,619
pens before really any of us were

2180
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:06,659
thinking you know another guy kind of

2181
01:33:04,619 --> 01:33:09,000
like Jeremy asking asking the hard

2182
01:33:06,659 --> 01:33:10,829
questions like hey what's uh what's your

2183
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,090
vape pen made out of what's your element

2184
01:33:10,829 --> 01:33:13,739
made out of are there any things that

2185
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:15,420
the oil can coming what are all the

2186
01:33:13,739 --> 01:33:16,079
things made out of that the oil comes in

2187
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:18,090
contact

2188
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:19,189
you know what's the space between the

2189
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:21,560
elements and where

2190
01:33:19,189 --> 01:33:23,929
the air comes in to vaporize the oil

2191
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:28,010
like he was asking like questions that

2192
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:30,980
like let me tell you 99.8% of vape cart

2193
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:34,760
companies absolutely did not want to

2194
01:33:30,979 --> 01:33:39,468
answer the answer to Sam's questions so

2195
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:41,449
I have a good appreciation for his his

2196
01:33:39,469 --> 01:33:45,380
persistence in knowledge and learning

2197
01:33:41,448 --> 01:33:47,719
and his ability to execute so give

2198
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:56,329
thanks for coming out today Sam thank

2199
01:33:47,719 --> 01:33:59,000
you so much learn something that's all

2200
01:33:56,329 --> 01:34:01,309
I'm trying to bring today so we've got

2201
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:04,039
solvent coming back in to our solvent

2202
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:05,600
carrying passively recovering right now

2203
01:34:04,039 --> 01:34:08,448
because we've got a pretty large

2204
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:12,350
temperature differential a solvent ink

2205
01:34:08,448 --> 01:34:15,819
here is 25 psi and we're still at about

2206
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:17,780
45 psi here in the country pot and

2207
01:34:15,819 --> 01:34:18,799
they're never going to pick on this pump

2208
01:34:17,779 --> 01:34:20,119
and I'll try to meet my mic again

2209
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,560
because then it'll get really loud in

2210
01:34:20,119 --> 01:34:28,099
here the transferring to the other room

2211
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:30,110
to each other all right cool Leo what's

2212
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:33,020
going on in the world of forests how

2213
01:34:30,109 --> 01:34:35,448
Silas doing Oh doing good man good

2214
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:37,580
thanks for asking yeah we are I think

2215
01:34:35,448 --> 01:34:41,119
with the exception of the morning we

2216
01:34:37,579 --> 01:34:43,880
were evacuated for the fires we were 38

2217
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:47,000
days seizure-free at that point and that

2218
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:48,529
chaos kind of threw us through a loop he

2219
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,149
had some seizures at night but hasn't

2220
01:34:48,529 --> 01:34:53,779
had any major one since then so we're

2221
01:34:50,149 --> 01:34:56,149
somewhere around 50 50 days and one

2222
01:34:53,779 --> 01:35:02,000
seizure you know so for a kid who had

2223
01:34:56,149 --> 01:35:04,250
about 20 to 60 a day before this journey

2224
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,800
that's pretty damn successful so we're

2225
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:10,100
good this creates creates a landscape

2226
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:11,539
for healing doesn't it yeah yeah well

2227
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:13,280
it's hundred percent pharmaceutical free

2228
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:16,969
which is also important to be healthy

2229
01:35:13,279 --> 01:35:19,219
you know I'm not all anti pharmaceutical

2230
01:35:16,969 --> 01:35:20,210
but the reality of some of these drugs

2231
01:35:19,219 --> 01:35:23,239
is when you're tinkering its

2232
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:26,359
neurotransmitter regulation it can do as

2233
01:35:23,238 --> 01:35:27,349
much harm as it can good so yeah he's

2234
01:35:26,359 --> 01:35:32,189
he's doing great

2235
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:33,870
take that method and now we're working

2236
01:35:32,189 --> 01:35:36,809
get things out to all the other kids

2237
01:35:33,869 --> 01:35:38,640
that were helping and yeah trying to

2238
01:35:36,810 --> 01:35:40,320
catch up from the fires but pretty

2239
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:43,230
soaked so we got a rosin press together

2240
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:45,319
first rosin press for the network IC so

2241
01:35:43,229 --> 01:35:48,089
there was talking about machines I'm

2242
01:35:45,319 --> 01:35:50,159
looking at adding some other machines

2243
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:52,800
within the year and really stepping up

2244
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:56,279
what we're able to offer these families

2245
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:58,230
so if I just had two more Amida to work

2246
01:35:56,279 --> 01:36:01,979
for free full time I'd be a happy guy

2247
01:35:58,229 --> 01:36:04,379
but you'd be crushing it yeah we're good

2248
01:36:01,979 --> 01:36:06,629
man I found out I'm probably going to be

2249
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:09,900

2267
01:36:50,579 --> 01:36:55,050
year but it was like for this top-secret

2268
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:57,449
sort of MacGyver mission where we were

2269
01:36:55,050 --> 01:36:58,949
picking up a whole bunch of clones and

2270
01:36:57,449 --> 01:37:02,220
moms for the network that someone had

2271
01:36:58,949 --> 01:37:03,720
smuggled in there and for us and I

2272
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:05,579
didn't get a chance to really hang so

2273
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:07,500
this this year I'm really excited to be

2274
01:37:05,579 --> 01:37:09,960
able to participate and see everybody

2275
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:11,550
and spend some time there looking

2276
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:13,230
forward to hugging you Forest when you

2277
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:17,430
come down check out the teepee it comes

2278
01:37:13,229 --> 01:37:21,599
to us or we'll find you I'm pretty

2279
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:24,060
stoked the teepee how sweet is that how

2280
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,740
sweet is that come find us in the teepee

2281
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:28,200
it's a beautiful thing and we're right

2282
01:37:25,739 --> 01:37:30,510
next up forever flowering too so we kind

2283
01:37:28,199 --> 01:37:32,279
of have this like sweet lounge set up on

2284
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:35,909
both sides and it's just a really good

2285
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:37,859
oasis from the chaos that's out there we

2286
01:37:35,909 --> 01:37:39,930
just go into $5.00 couches all over

2287
01:37:37,859 --> 01:37:42,179
Santa Rosa and line the whole teepee

2288
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:44,220
with it and although this year we may

2289
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:45,640
not be able to find so many $5 couches

2290
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:49,270
so we might just use wood

2291
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:50,260
and stops yeah I'll tell ya why dude

2292
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:52,690
it's crazy down there

2293
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:55,390
yeah shout-out to everyone who suffered

2294
01:37:52,689 --> 01:37:57,399
from those fires it's what up what uh I

2295
01:37:55,390 --> 01:37:59,440
mean I've seen a bunch of different

2296
01:37:57,399 --> 01:38:01,389
media on it is definitely some of the

2297
01:37:59,439 --> 01:38:02,859
craziest photos I've ever seen like I

2298
01:38:01,390 --> 01:38:04,240
didn't know like houses and

2299
01:38:02,859 --> 01:38:06,399
neighborhoods could burn down without

2300
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:08,679
the trees burning down or even looking

2301
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:10,839
damaged like that looks like some weird

2302
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:13,210
[ __ ] I'm like I don't want to open up

2303
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:16,180
the conspiracy channel but does that not

2304
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:21,550
look like seriously strange or is that

2305
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:23,140
just something that happened yeah go

2306
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:25,119
ahead for us do you take I should say it

2307
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:26,710
depends I'm tired now hard to see some

2308
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:29,199
of the trees look like they're alive but

2309
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:31,180
they're in pretty poor shape and but

2310
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:33,670
some are like green leaves and like

2311
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:35,289
fully alive and I'm just like wow like

2312
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:38,940
that's the first time I've ever seen a

2313
01:38:35,289 --> 01:38:38,939
forest fire where the forest didn't burn

2314
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:46,449
for that they just survive the heat hey

2315
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:48,760
you're definitely more prepared for

2316
01:38:46,449 --> 01:38:52,420
fires than homes are that's for sure

2317
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:54,760
you know yeah lots lots of these pine

2318
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:57,399
trees and coniferous trees actually need

2319
01:38:54,760 --> 01:39:01,090
fire to be able to breed and be able to

2320
01:38:57,399 --> 01:39:04,659
seed so sometimes they'll go 15 20 years

2321
01:39:01,090 --> 01:39:08,199
without actually being able to seeds

2322
01:39:04,659 --> 01:39:09,909
that are you know viable so having a

2323
01:39:08,199 --> 01:39:11,710
fire coming through there and it has to

2324
01:39:09,909 --> 01:39:14,439
take that really super hot temperature

2325
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:17,260
to be able to melt that pitch to be able

2326
01:39:14,439 --> 01:39:19,259
to create a seed so another thing is the

2327
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:23,199
fireman we're talking about how there's

2328
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:25,480
wildfires and and and tree forest fires

2329
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:27,639
and then there's urban fires and there's

2330
01:39:25,479 --> 01:39:29,739
usually a way that they can stop the

2331
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:31,480
fire from going into the urban areas and

2332
01:39:29,739 --> 01:39:33,849
when it goes into the urban area is the

2333
01:39:31,479 --> 01:39:36,339
fire changes the energy of it changes

2334
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:38,079
and fires really are energy they start

2335
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:39,840
just gobbling up houses they're just

2336
01:39:38,079 --> 01:39:43,840
like wow this is fuel there's like

2337
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:45,400
propane and paint and gas or [ __ ]

2338
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,170
everywhere and it's just gobbling up

2339
01:39:45,399 --> 01:39:49,389
homes and it just it really turns into

2340
01:39:47,170 --> 01:39:51,159
like an animal different energy like

2341
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:54,700
what sub was saying with the 70 mile an

2342
01:39:51,159 --> 01:39:58,079
hour winds it just took it from crazy to

2343
01:39:54,699 --> 01:39:58,079
something more than crazy

2344
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:04,280
note to say that in British Columbia was

2345
01:40:01,639 --> 01:40:05,868
one of the worst fires in history on

2346
01:40:04,279 --> 01:40:08,538
British Columbia didn't take out in

2347
01:40:05,868 --> 01:40:11,299
towns in the same way that it did in

2348
01:40:08,538 --> 01:40:14,719
California so it's not to take away from

2349
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:18,469
that but three million acres burned in

2350
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:21,559
British Columbia this year three million

2351
01:40:18,469 --> 01:40:23,389
and or even all of the court

2352
01:40:21,559 --> 01:40:25,489
some of them view most beautiful hikes

2353
01:40:23,389 --> 01:40:27,199
outside of Portland and the gorge going

2354
01:40:25,488 --> 01:40:30,348
down the Columbia River all got burnt

2355
01:40:27,198 --> 01:40:32,178
and it's a crazy year really big we even

2356
01:40:30,349 --> 01:40:34,969
put him a lot of help out in support to

2357
01:40:32,179 --> 01:40:37,519
those people sure ya know it's crazy

2358
01:40:34,969 --> 01:40:39,618
they set up huge relief funds for it you

2359
01:40:37,519 --> 01:40:41,599
know it's crazy is they just indicted a

2360
01:40:39,618 --> 01:40:46,009
kid for throwing firecrackers that

2361
01:40:41,599 --> 01:40:48,710
started that fire 15 years old higher

2362
01:40:46,010 --> 01:40:52,429
works fine they were shooting fireworks

2363
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:56,269
off and there was no problem oh my god

2364
01:40:52,429 --> 01:40:59,510
they got in a little chase trying to get

2365
01:40:56,269 --> 01:41:01,940
away and then they got caught that's a

2366
01:40:59,510 --> 01:41:02,929
pretty sickening like to think about

2367
01:41:01,939 --> 01:41:05,328
holy [ __ ]

2368
01:41:02,929 --> 01:41:07,368
well I got seven people Psalm it wasn't

2369
01:41:05,328 --> 01:41:09,738
like they shot up one bottle rocket and

2370
01:41:07,368 --> 01:41:12,828
went off they shout out multiple and

2371
01:41:09,738 --> 01:41:14,779
people ran into town to get cops that's

2372
01:41:12,828 --> 01:41:16,779
how long they were on the trail for but

2373
01:41:14,779 --> 01:41:20,000
anyway that's you know whatever it's

2374
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:22,729
yeah it is what it is go figure humans

2375
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:26,000
were responsible yeah shocker you know I

2376
01:41:22,729 --> 01:41:30,500
got on my soapbox last night at social

2377
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:32,569
media but this um that's loud and

2378
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:36,649
obnoxious that's all you know they

2379
01:41:32,569 --> 01:41:39,078
cancelled the CGA in Hezekiah Allen's

2380
01:41:36,649 --> 01:41:41,179
group and some of our Nevada County

2381
01:41:39,078 --> 01:41:42,859
cannabis Alliance folks were putting

2382
01:41:41,179 --> 01:41:44,449
together fundraisers for the families

2383
01:41:42,859 --> 01:41:47,000
and had raced quite a bit of money but

2384
01:41:44,448 --> 01:41:48,558
it's cannabis farms and just last night

2385
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,800
I believe or might have been the night

2386
01:41:48,559 --> 01:41:54,099
before but the SAC be picked up that

2387
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:56,420
refunded everyone's donations because

2388
01:41:54,099 --> 01:41:58,340
because they were had to do with

2389
01:41:56,420 --> 01:42:03,319
cannabis and they wouldn't allow them to

2390
01:41:58,340 --> 01:42:05,059
use their platform so I got my donation

2391
01:42:03,319 --> 01:42:06,768
what the hell is going on with this and

2392
01:42:05,059 --> 01:42:09,829
then I saw the sack be picked it up and

2393
01:42:06,769 --> 01:42:11,119
it just it's absolutely infuriating to

2394
01:42:09,828 --> 01:42:12,439
me and I don't hear a lot of people

2395
01:42:11,118 --> 01:42:14,448
really

2396
01:42:12,439 --> 01:42:16,250
vote from what I married for us I think

2397
01:42:14,448 --> 01:42:18,169
they should from what I heard for us it

2398
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:20,659
was the processor it wasn't the site

2399
01:42:18,170 --> 01:42:22,880
that was doing it any of the money

2400
01:42:20,659 --> 01:42:24,079
processors once they start processing

2401
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,819
money and they started here it's

2402
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:28,510
cannabis it was pulled from the

2403
01:42:25,819 --> 01:42:30,559
processor so that's where it stops

2404
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:32,239
unfortunately it's still the money this

2405
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:34,130
problem we still have what we can't have

2406
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:37,759
hang so I've been kicked out of 36 of

2407
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:39,859
them unfortunately the fortunate reality

2408
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:41,860
right Bernard

2409
01:42:39,859 --> 01:42:44,359
they can't insure themselves properly

2410
01:42:41,859 --> 01:42:45,859
they can't participate in the community

2411
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:48,049
and prepare like any other responsible

2412
01:42:45,859 --> 01:42:50,238
business could and then when they lose

2413
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:52,489
everything including the cash they had

2414
01:42:50,238 --> 01:42:54,738
on-site their crops their homes with

2415
01:42:52,488 --> 01:42:56,179
their children then the community is not

2416
01:42:54,738 --> 01:42:58,519
allowed to come together and then

2417
01:42:56,180 --> 01:43:00,949
support them not to be home

2418
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:03,170
carrots absolutely that's why we

2419
01:43:00,948 --> 01:43:06,049
supported soil King because he's just an

2420
01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:07,699
individual who lives on earth in the

2421
01:43:06,050 --> 01:43:09,380
area and there's no one that can stop

2422
01:43:07,698 --> 01:43:13,879
him from taking money and giving it out

2423
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:15,710
to some masters to know the difference

2424
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:17,779
between these large-scale I mean if

2425
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:19,430
you're a nun document or a cannabis

2426
01:43:17,779 --> 01:43:22,099
farmer you're screwed right now yeah

2427
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:24,110
yeah that's exactly why I told people to

2428
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:25,820
go direct like I was telling people on

2429
01:43:24,109 --> 01:43:28,219
my chat look I'm not sure about any of

2430
01:43:25,819 --> 01:43:29,809
these go funds and stuff like I let me

2431
01:43:28,219 --> 01:43:31,850
find out where the best place you know

2432
01:43:29,810 --> 01:43:33,530
to go to is and then I'll direct you and

2433
01:43:31,850 --> 01:43:37,460
that it was soil King that I also told

2434
01:43:33,529 --> 01:43:39,109
people to go to yeah same same here you

2435
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:41,300
know kind of in line with that I mean um

2436
01:43:39,109 --> 01:43:42,948
slight slight astray but most talk

2437
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:45,890
minute Tim Blake just the other day and

2438
01:43:42,948 --> 01:43:47,899
and Eventbrite just kind of cold some

2439
01:43:45,890 --> 01:43:51,050
[ __ ] on them where I mean I guess

2440
01:43:47,899 --> 01:43:54,409
visa just you know international kind of

2441
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:56,840
I guess pretty cracked down really hard

2442
01:43:54,409 --> 01:43:58,969
on Eventbrite and just are doing a big

2443
01:43:56,840 --> 01:44:02,239
crackdown on anything cannabis related

2444
01:43:58,969 --> 01:44:04,130
right now and so from that Eventbrite

2445
01:44:02,238 --> 01:44:08,479
basically canceled the emerald cops

2446
01:44:04,130 --> 01:44:10,789
ability to you know basically hold you

2447
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:12,679
know or to sell tickets three Eventbrite

2448
01:44:10,789 --> 01:44:15,829
or to kind of do you know the

2449
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:18,949
competition type stuff of it but you

2450
01:44:15,829 --> 01:44:21,019
know Tim and the Emerald Cup team you

2451
01:44:18,948 --> 01:44:23,719
know this you know this year are kind of

2452
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:25,640
kind of you know working together with

2453
01:44:23,719 --> 01:44:26,029
red light management who kind of you

2454
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:28,940
know

2455
01:44:26,029 --> 01:44:30,679
hundreds of kind of you know major

2456
01:44:28,939 --> 01:44:32,719
events and festivals across the United

2457
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:35,150
States and so they were able to kind of

2458
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:37,460
reach out and basically try to Chaffey

2459
01:44:35,149 --> 01:44:39,049
that right and so Eventbrite they still

2460
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:42,500
kind of just allowed them from being

2461
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:44,180
able to you know run the contest aspect

2462
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:46,640
through them right because it was

2463
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:49,460
directly cannabis related but they were

2464
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:51,380
able to manage to you know salvage you

2465
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:53,449
know still being able to get tickets for

2466
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:55,340
the Emma Cup through it but it just it's

2467
01:44:53,449 --> 01:44:56,750
just mind-blowing how it kind of yeah

2468
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:58,850
just you know these these [ __ ]

2469
01:44:56,750 --> 01:45:01,069
merchant processors you know with their

2470
01:44:58,850 --> 01:45:02,690
whimsical decisions to kind of just you

2471
01:45:01,069 --> 01:45:05,000
know be these self-appointed guardians

2472
01:45:02,689 --> 01:45:06,500
of the status quo and how much effect

2473
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,960
they can have across the entire industry

2474
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:11,090
from banking to you know just you know

2475
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:13,850
in one fell swoop just chopping a whole

2476
01:45:11,090 --> 01:45:15,680
event or let alone more devastating kind

2477
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:17,150
of a whole community people that you

2478
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:18,829
know trying to come around a cause like

2479
01:45:17,149 --> 01:45:20,750
helping fight you know raise money for

2480
01:45:18,829 --> 01:45:23,119
fire relief and then just kind of

2481
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:24,859
chopping people off with amis from even

2482
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:27,279
being able to as a community together to

2483
01:45:24,859 --> 01:45:29,630
you know make any kind of a difference

2484
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:31,670
it's really interesting because we've

2485
01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:34,069
we've done a lot of disaster relief and

2486
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:36,500
gone into international areas and it's

2487
01:45:34,069 --> 01:45:38,299
big business let's just lay it down like

2488
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:40,039
that it's really big business it's big

2489
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:41,869
business for the Red Cross to come in

2490
01:45:40,039 --> 01:45:44,659
there that are making a crap ton of

2491
01:45:41,869 --> 01:45:46,699
money Red Cross creating more yeah Red

2492
01:45:44,659 --> 01:45:50,239
Cross has actually even going into areas

2493
01:45:46,699 --> 01:45:52,399
that have maybe a small shelter set up

2494
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:54,050
there or a church that decided that they

2495
01:45:52,399 --> 01:45:57,079
wanted to take in people and they're

2496
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:58,279
sending out there whatever people just

2497
01:45:57,079 --> 01:46:01,329
say hey we're gonna shut this down

2498
01:45:58,279 --> 01:46:03,859
because this is not a proper shelter so

2499
01:46:01,329 --> 01:46:06,710
you know it's really big business out

2500
01:46:03,859 --> 01:46:08,989
there the World Health Organization

2501
01:46:06,710 --> 01:46:11,300
Red Cross you know I work with all of

2502
01:46:08,989 --> 01:46:13,250
those people and you know money and

2503
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:15,170
business and corporation comes first

2504
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:17,239
before helping the people so that's why

2505
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:18,770
community efforts and energy that's why

2506
01:46:17,239 --> 01:46:20,779
you guys selling people on the ground

2507
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:22,370
that you love and support and even the

2508
01:46:20,779 --> 01:46:24,920
house that we went we that we went to

2509
01:46:22,369 --> 01:46:28,609
rent a house in Emerald cup and at Burt

2510
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:29,869
and then the people's house it was their

2511
01:46:28,609 --> 01:46:31,489
rental house anyway both their houses

2512
01:46:29,869 --> 01:46:32,960
burn so we're like oh [ __ ] well should

2513
01:46:31,489 --> 01:46:35,420
we just rent an RV or should we just

2514
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,069
pitch a tent what are we gonna do so we

2515
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:39,190
kept looking we found this house in the

2516
01:46:37,069 --> 01:46:40,659
middle of the nones fire

2517
01:46:39,189 --> 01:46:42,419
and the guy just said you know what

2518
01:46:40,659 --> 01:46:45,488
we're gonna give it to you at our cost

2519
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:47,170
which is like 1/10 of what it would have

2520
01:46:45,488 --> 01:46:49,269
cost the whole time and just give he was

2521
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:51,430
a fireman he's I just give the rest to

2522
01:46:49,270 --> 01:46:52,750
the fire agency down there so we're

2523
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:54,699
gonna give him twice the amount of what

2524
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:56,738
the rental cost and and really try to

2525
01:46:54,698 --> 01:46:58,210
fundraise we know how to give it directs

2526
01:46:56,738 --> 01:47:00,399
and anyone who's coming to stay at our

2527
01:46:58,210 --> 01:47:02,140
house they'll give some to and then I

2528
01:47:00,399 --> 01:47:04,779
have a so we're gonna be staying in a

2529
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:06,850
house in the middle of the fire and I

2530
01:47:04,779 --> 01:47:08,529
think now is the time for Californians

2531
01:47:06,850 --> 01:47:10,030
in that area to really look at land use

2532
01:47:08,529 --> 01:47:12,039
and how they're gonna deal with the

2533
01:47:10,029 --> 01:47:15,340
runoff when the rains come with the ash

2534
01:47:12,039 --> 01:47:17,619
I think now using all that burnt wood

2535
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:20,050
and all the wood that's around to lay it

2536
01:47:17,619 --> 01:47:23,488
laterally on the hillsides to stop water

2537
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:26,380
from flowing downhill is gonna be crew

2538
01:47:23,488 --> 01:47:29,439
anytime you can get the logs just go

2539
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:31,300
from this to this and just put as many

2540
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:33,609
places you can make a bed out of this

2541
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:37,719
whatever you've got a stuck the water

2542
01:47:33,609 --> 01:47:39,309
from washing the topsoil away and also

2543
01:47:37,719 --> 01:47:41,109
just a side note you know we can't look

2544
01:47:39,310 --> 01:47:43,210
towards these huge organizations like

2545
01:47:41,109 --> 01:47:45,279
Eventbrite like you know it's not great

2546
01:47:43,210 --> 01:47:47,770
that they told you know emerald

2547
01:47:45,279 --> 01:47:49,689
competent at the eleventh hour that they

2548
01:47:47,770 --> 01:47:51,460
can't use it but you know we don't

2549
01:47:49,689 --> 01:47:53,439
really want those kind of people we need

2550
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:55,750
to start bumping up those organizations

2551
01:47:53,439 --> 01:47:58,059
that are gonna help our community so we

2552
01:47:55,750 --> 01:48:00,159
can help ourselves as well so takes

2553
01:47:58,060 --> 01:48:01,239
education it takes hopefully well it's a

2554
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:02,738
gift in the end

2555
01:48:01,238 --> 01:48:04,179
yeah and that's what's really you know

2556
01:48:02,738 --> 01:48:06,849
interesting cuz it's like a lot of these

2557
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:09,070
johnny-come-lately mega corporations or

2558
01:48:06,850 --> 01:48:11,079
banking institutions that at the levant

2559
01:48:09,069 --> 01:48:13,899
our you know are still kind of

2560
01:48:11,079 --> 01:48:15,340
suppressing or repressing us but then

2561
01:48:13,899 --> 01:48:16,750
you know all of a sudden some point at

2562
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:18,400
some point they're gonna be like oh yeah

2563
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:20,500
well accept your money but it's like

2564
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:22,210
dude is I wish there was something more

2565
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:23,460
grassroots or community based where we

2566
01:48:22,210 --> 01:48:26,050
could be like yeah [ __ ] you were

2567
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:27,670
subverting you know even having any

2568
01:48:26,050 --> 01:48:29,980
desire as a community to work with you

2569
01:48:27,670 --> 01:48:31,659
you know because I look what you've done

2570
01:48:29,979 --> 01:48:35,019
to our community sense and it's like

2571
01:48:31,659 --> 01:48:36,969
this is not acceptable you know all the

2572
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:39,010
same in the cannabis industry as it

2573
01:48:36,969 --> 01:48:40,810
becomes recreational just becomes

2574
01:48:39,010 --> 01:48:42,670
corporate and crazy and it becomes a

2575
01:48:40,810 --> 01:48:45,130
thing we don't even recognize from where

2576
01:48:42,670 --> 01:48:47,199
it started you know the disaster is on

2577
01:48:45,130 --> 01:48:49,750
the ground it's grassroots your help and

2578
01:48:47,198 --> 01:48:51,339
soil King Patrick or anyone else you can

2579
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:53,189
and then I'll sudden you get into these

2580
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:55,079
crazy organizations and

2581
01:48:53,189 --> 01:48:57,179
really what it comes down to is we just

2582
01:48:55,079 --> 01:48:58,890
have to make a pact with the community

2583
01:48:57,180 --> 01:49:00,480
and each other and just be willing to

2584
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:02,160
support each other and we think that

2585
01:49:00,479 --> 01:49:05,549
money is the real commodity but the

2586
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:08,309
truth our own community is time as our

2587
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:10,020
real commodity if anybody even has like

2588
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:11,910
some shovels you know we've got a month

2589
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:13,560
in November and we're gonna come down

2590
01:49:11,909 --> 01:49:15,809
we're gonna go bring all of our tools

2591
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:17,430
and we have our skills so we're just

2592
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:19,710
gonna go down to farms and try to help

2593
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:21,390
build some shocks and you know that

2594
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:23,640
doesn't take a whole lot of money to do

2595
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:26,369
it just takes time so if we switch the

2596
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:28,469
idea of what our real commodity is here

2597
01:49:26,369 --> 01:49:30,448
in this community is giving each other

2598
01:49:28,469 --> 01:49:32,399
the time I'm packing up the trails what

2599
01:49:30,448 --> 01:49:33,960

2653
01:52:02,149 --> 01:52:15,299

2654
01:52:03,930 --> 01:52:17,880
blastin BHO in the background this

2655

episode brought to you by glob mods I'm

2656
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:21,930
just joking Brendan sent me these

2657
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:24,569
recently I've always just used q-tips

2658
01:52:21,930 --> 01:52:27,030
I'm not gonna lie I'm just I've always

2659
01:52:24,569 --> 01:52:29,460
just used q-tips but hey cannabis

2660
01:52:27,029 --> 01:52:31,649
industry everyone's constantly

2661
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:34,560
innovating make them point here make

2662
01:52:31,649 --> 01:52:42,599
them stronger those blobs are pretty

2663
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:44,820
awesome they're also like a little

2664
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:47,940
tighter cotton ed so I've been digging

2665
01:52:44,819 --> 01:52:50,429
on the glove box dude nice a few years

2666
01:52:47,939 --> 01:52:53,069
ago I bought what I thought were q-tips

2667
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:57,600
and I tried him and it turned out the

2668
01:52:53,069 --> 01:52:58,439
sticks were plastics and a bummer man a

2669
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:02,579
real bummer

2670
01:52:58,439 --> 01:53:04,500
all right wooden ones yes I know how you

2671
01:53:02,579 --> 01:53:08,729
like your wooden ones you used to have

2672
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:10,739
the wooden matches all the time that was

2673
01:53:08,729 --> 01:53:12,329
one of the ways you could tell skunk man

2674
01:53:10,739 --> 01:53:14,849
Sam was at the cannabis cup you could

2675
01:53:12,329 --> 01:53:17,340
look down and see little wooden matches

2676
01:53:14,850 --> 01:53:19,280
and brand-new stainless steel screens

2677
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:23,150
with like a single

2678
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:25,159
taken off of them and the craziest thing

2679
01:53:23,149 --> 01:53:27,589
was this is a crazy statement think of

2680
01:53:25,159 --> 01:53:30,079
how [ __ ] up this statement is if you

2681
01:53:27,590 --> 01:53:32,720
picked up those screens you would have

2682
01:53:30,079 --> 01:53:34,609
you basically found the best product

2683
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:38,060
that you could find in Amsterdam his

2684
01:53:34,609 --> 01:53:39,829
burnt screens with like leftover little

2685
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:41,510
bits of melt that maybe he didn't catch

2686
01:53:39,829 --> 01:53:43,010
with the match it kind of moved over to

2687
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:44,720
the side of the screen and he missed it

2688
01:53:43,010 --> 01:53:47,720
he was too busy just loading it up with

2689
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:48,920
a new one I'm telling you I will admit

2690
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:50,930
that I did pick up a few of those

2691
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:53,480
screens Wow

2692
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:57,320
how what a sad story for the rest of us

2693
01:53:53,479 --> 01:53:59,839
though that it's a I'm just I feel that

2694
01:53:57,319 --> 01:54:02,059
especially after especially after

2695

2700
01:54:22,850 --> 01:54:30,350
pleasure of touching in a long long time

2701

2712
01:54:56,539 --> 01:55:00,739
bike yeah dude I'm telling you after

2713
01:54:58,729 --> 01:55:02,779
breaking this butt up with my hands I

2714
01:55:00,739 --> 01:55:04,159
was literally just in shock at how

2715
01:55:02,779 --> 01:55:06,170
sticky it was through and through I

2716
01:55:04,159 --> 01:55:08,899
photographed it with my macro lens and I

2717
01:55:06,170 --> 01:55:11,149
was blown away at how much resin was

2718
01:55:08,899 --> 01:55:14,119
just everywhere and it really just made

2719
01:55:11,149 --> 01:55:16,309
me realize that a lot of people are

2720
01:55:14,119 --> 01:55:19,099
growing subpar cannabis out there I

2721
01:55:16,310 --> 01:55:21,770
think that we really owe it to I'm sorry

2722
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:23,180
it's the truth I know you're smiling and

2723
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:25,670
you're laughing but it's like we need to

2724
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:28,159
call listen if chimeras gonna call Indra

2725
01:55:25,670 --> 01:55:30,619
out and Jeremy's gonna call soil balance

2726
01:55:28,159 --> 01:55:39,710
out I'm calling [ __ ] everyone

2727
01:55:30,619 --> 01:55:41,180
out on their sub part of Jesus yeah we

2728
01:55:39,710 --> 01:55:43,100
that's Kieran still sticky is like

2729
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:46,400
magical and yeah it's like space week

2730
01:55:43,100 --> 01:55:48,680
and maybe see it's like well yeah sorry

2731
01:55:46,399 --> 01:55:49,869
sadly today it's you know few far

2732
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:52,400
between in my life

2733
01:55:49,869 --> 01:55:54,500
yeah I don't know I think I used to see

2734
01:55:52,399 --> 01:55:56,089
it way more in the nineties and I don't

2735
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:58,189
know what happened somewhere along the

2736
01:55:56,090 --> 01:56:00,829
line it's just mainly here in BC

2737
01:55:58,189 --> 01:56:03,259
although when I travel I find it even

2738
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:04,640
harder to find in Jamaica now whereas I

2739
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:07,190
used to be able to it was used to be

2740
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:09,320
hard but now it's like this filter of

2741
01:56:07,189 --> 01:56:12,079
this enormous amount of bunk weed that

2742
01:56:09,319 --> 01:56:13,849
you have to like sift through to get to

2743
01:56:12,079 --> 01:56:15,949
people who are actually and it's it's

2744
01:56:13,850 --> 01:56:18,050
it's pretty much the same every single

2745
01:56:15,949 --> 01:56:20,000
time when you finally meet the people

2746
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:22,430
who are producing the absolute flame

2747
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,350
they're super conscious they have this

2748
01:56:22,430 --> 01:56:27,230
whole idea of what's going on from

2749
01:56:24,350 --> 01:56:30,710
symbiotic relationships to like organic

2750
01:56:27,229 --> 01:56:32,679
to creating live soils to bacterias to

2751
01:56:30,710 --> 01:56:35,630
like the whole nine yards to actually

2752
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:37,670
processing the resin you know in in

2753
01:56:35,630 --> 01:56:39,350
specific ways and even from the

2754
01:56:37,670 --> 01:56:42,260
processing of the resin and curing the

2755
01:56:39,350 --> 01:56:45,980
resin even taking it as far as you know

2756
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:49,039
using that resin on a very specific I

2757
01:56:45,979 --> 01:56:50,750
guess type of heat source whether it's

2758
01:56:49,039 --> 01:56:52,789
convection or conduction whether it's

2759
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:55,810
titanium or quartz whether it's sapphire

2760
01:56:52,789 --> 01:56:59,180
or glass all of these different things

2761
01:56:55,810 --> 01:57:01,070
seem to preserve the terpene profile

2762
01:56:59,180 --> 01:57:02,930
differently you know some more than

2763
01:57:01,069 --> 01:57:05,689
others obviously if anyone's ever

2764
01:57:02,930 --> 01:57:08,570
blasted any type of dab onto a hot

2765
01:57:05,689 --> 01:57:10,579
titanium nail you know that the terpene

2766
01:57:08,569 --> 01:57:12,500
profile pretty much jumps out the window

2767
01:57:10,579 --> 01:57:15,409
and just turns into this crazy like

2768
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:16,789
throat burning like I don't even know

2769
01:57:15,409 --> 01:57:18,920
what it is but I'm sure the science

2770
01:57:16,789 --> 01:57:20,659
behind it is [ __ ] up like those

2771
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:22,310
terpenes are being changed that

2772
01:57:20,659 --> 01:57:25,670
everything's being changed and do a very

2773
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:29,060
different you know compared to a super

2774
01:57:25,670 --> 01:57:31,190
low temp like dab out of like say Bose

2775
01:57:29,060 --> 01:57:33,230
vape exhale which is like the convection

2776
01:57:31,189 --> 01:57:35,989
like it's it heats up differently with

2777
01:57:33,229 --> 01:57:37,789
the heat around the the the glass tube

2778
01:57:35,989 --> 01:57:39,859
with the quartz cylinder that's the

2779
01:57:37,789 --> 01:57:41,659
slides in them I'm gonna have one set up

2780
01:57:39,859 --> 01:57:44,479
next Sundays and I'll vape exhale the

2781
01:57:41,659 --> 01:57:44,899
whole episode because it's it's one of

2782
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:46,729
the only

2783
01:57:44,899 --> 01:57:48,679
units that I've been able to hit pure

2784
01:57:46,729 --> 01:57:50,359
terpenes off of because people are like

2785
01:57:48,679 --> 01:57:52,640
can you hit them pure and I'm like oh no

2786
01:57:50,359 --> 01:57:55,789
you can't but then I found that the the

2787
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:58,820
vape exhale like a tenth of a drop you

2788
01:57:55,789 --> 01:58:02,149
know a tenth of 0.25 ml put into the

2789
01:57:58,819 --> 01:58:05,349
chamber and at a nice low temperature it

2790
01:58:02,149 --> 01:58:08,420
is seriously one of the most beautiful

2791
01:58:05,350 --> 01:58:10,820
aroma therapeutic sort of ways of

2792
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:11,899
hitting canvas terpenes that I have ever

2793
01:58:10,819 --> 01:58:14,599
come across it

2794
01:58:11,899 --> 01:58:17,658
none of these dishes or courts compare

2795
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:20,989
go ahead I was just saying another

2796
01:58:17,658 --> 01:58:22,849
really amazing way to take in Terps and

2797
01:58:20,988 --> 01:58:25,669
get all of its medicinal compounds is to

2798
01:58:22,850 --> 01:58:29,270
put it into soda water so you just put

2799
01:58:25,670 --> 01:58:32,449
it onto soda water and like the bubbles

2800
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:34,790
from the co2 coming up in your face and

2801
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:36,559
drinking that soda water is a really

2802
01:58:34,789 --> 01:58:38,600
great way to get terpenes we've found

2803
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:40,580
out wow you can make a whole party giddy

2804
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:42,920
off of just giving out a bunch of

2805
01:58:40,579 --> 01:58:45,079
terpenes and soda water that's pretty

2806
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:46,819
obvious just bubbling in your face turn

2807
01:58:45,079 --> 01:58:53,988
bubbles when you're drinking in the

2808
01:58:46,819 --> 01:58:54,250
sweetest it's awesome nice the person

2809
01:58:53,988 --> 01:58:56,500
who

2810
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:58,659
called me out in chat saying let me read

2811
01:58:56,500 --> 01:59:00,729
his call out here it's a good one got a

2812
01:58:58,659 --> 01:59:02,079
got to give everyone their their five

2813
01:59:00,729 --> 01:59:03,339
minutes of fame here someone's calling

2814
01:59:02,079 --> 01:59:06,819
me out I got to let them call me out

2815
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:08,590
Chuck D wagon he says he says holy crap

2816
01:59:06,819 --> 01:59:10,929
subpar says the guy in Canada who

2817
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:12,220
doesn't even grow well currently I'm not

2818
01:59:10,930 --> 01:59:15,460
growing it's true but have I grown

2819
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:18,070
cannabis in the last 25 years many a

2820
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:20,409
many a pounds and when I have I haven't

2821
01:59:18,069 --> 01:59:22,719
license to produce federally cannabis

2822
01:59:20,409 --> 01:59:25,689
here in my country in Canada and the

2823
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:28,690
last time I grew I produced my crop into

2824
01:59:25,689 --> 01:59:31,299
five and six star resin I didn't

2825
01:59:28,689 --> 01:59:33,969
I don't grow huge but it's I don't find

2826
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:35,529
it impossible to learn there's a lot of

2827
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:37,240
people even on this panel for that

2828
01:59:35,529 --> 01:59:39,039
matter who are willing to share their

2829
01:59:37,239 --> 01:59:40,329
information there's social media there's

2830
01:59:39,039 --> 01:59:41,800
all these different web sites there's a

2831
01:59:40,329 --> 01:59:43,960
lot of ways to learn how to grow

2832
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:45,279
cannabis and I think it just takes a

2833
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:49,029
little bit of paying attention I don't

2834
01:59:45,279 --> 01:59:50,649
think it's as hard as maybe people think

2835
01:59:49,029 --> 01:59:52,449
now I think that maybe getting the right

2836
01:59:50,649 --> 01:59:54,099
genetics is difficult for some people

2837
01:59:52,449 --> 01:59:57,340
that they might end up wasting their

2838
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:59,289
time with a lot of wrong genetics and I

2839
01:59:57,340 --> 02:00:01,569
think that people don't fully understand

2840
01:59:59,289 --> 02:00:04,149
the relationships between the plants and

2841
02:00:01,569 --> 02:00:06,369
the soil and the food these are these

2842
02:00:04,149 --> 02:00:08,319
can be fairly complex for as simple as

2843
02:00:06,369 --> 02:00:10,329
it is it's simple yeah if you give if

2844
02:00:08,319 --> 02:00:12,969
the plant the right amount of what it

2845
02:00:10,329 --> 02:00:14,619
needs but people make it complex they

2846
02:00:12,970 --> 02:00:17,140
can [ __ ] it up I've seen people grow

2847
02:00:14,619 --> 02:00:21,609
beautiful herb and then destroy it in

2848
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:22,119
the cure so we've been here in BC for 25

2849
02:00:21,609 --> 02:00:24,069
years

2850
02:00:22,119 --> 02:00:26,739
we've been growing the whole time we'll

2851
02:00:24,069 --> 02:00:29,679
back you up 100% Marcus unfortunately it

2852
02:00:26,739 --> 02:00:32,170
is really hard for us to go outside of

2853
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:34,390
just a few people that we know and find

2854
02:00:32,170 --> 02:00:37,300
something that we feel like makes us

2855
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:38,860
feel good so it's important and also you

2856
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:40,750
know you can have a lot of techniques

2857
02:00:38,859 --> 02:00:43,119
and you can have your practices and you

2858
02:00:40,750 --> 02:00:45,100
can put in certain nutrients and

2859
02:00:43,119 --> 02:00:47,680
whatever products that you want to do

2860
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:50,050
but you know this plant is a sentient

2861
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:53,070
being and it feels our energy and when

2862
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:56,560
you have an energy about the plant they

2863
02:00:53,069 --> 02:00:58,389
you're you're a-lying with this plant

2864
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:00,970
and it's a medicine for you it does grow

2865
02:00:58,390 --> 02:01:02,860
better it is a fact so sometimes people

2866
02:01:00,970 --> 02:01:06,390
just having a little bit more intention

2867
02:01:02,859 --> 02:01:06,389
towards their groves helps tremendously

2868
02:01:06,539 --> 02:01:10,679
absolutely

2869
02:01:07,649 --> 02:01:13,079
I I can remember on my first grow very

2870
02:01:10,679 --> 02:01:15,420
small little grow a couple for hundreds

2871
02:01:13,079 --> 02:01:17,279
me and my buddy got these seeds from a

2872
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:18,989
friend and we had a little hidden

2873
02:01:17,279 --> 02:01:20,609
compartment we would go sit in this

2874
02:01:18,988 --> 02:01:23,789
little grow room and just hang out with

2875
02:01:20,609 --> 02:01:26,130
these seeds on a plate with the with the

2876
02:01:23,789 --> 02:01:28,229
moist paper towel as we did it back back

2877
02:01:26,130 --> 02:01:29,880
then am I getting the feedback from all

2878
02:01:28,229 --> 02:01:32,189
that might be Indra I might have to mute

2879
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:33,960
your mic buddy yes lots of feedback

2880
02:01:32,189 --> 02:01:35,849
coming in there but just hanging out in

2881
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:38,670
the room with seedlings and having that

2882
02:01:35,850 --> 02:01:40,530
kind of passion and for me it was you

2883
02:01:38,670 --> 02:01:43,469
know my passion was always stemmed in

2884
02:01:40,529 --> 02:01:46,079
trying to grow incredible quality and I

2885
02:01:43,469 --> 02:01:48,060
saw a lot of my friends who went into it

2886
02:01:46,079 --> 02:01:50,729
also kind of wanting to grow incredible

2887
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:52,620
quality but more the focus was I'd like

2888
02:01:50,729 --> 02:01:54,119
to make a bunch of money and not that

2889
02:01:52,619 --> 02:01:56,369
that was a bad thing no one was looking

2890
02:01:54,119 --> 02:01:58,619
down upon them it just definitely brings

2891
02:01:56,369 --> 02:02:00,779
you to a different result if your result

2892
02:01:58,619 --> 02:02:02,939
is to you know really just make a bunch

2893
02:02:00,779 --> 02:02:04,769
of money you might find yourself in a

2894
02:02:02,939 --> 02:02:06,960
different place if your result was to

2895
02:02:04,770 --> 02:02:08,909
just grow the best possible herb that

2896
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:11,640
you could that you could produce you

2897
02:02:08,908 --> 02:02:14,759
know the perfect expression that those

2898
02:02:11,640 --> 02:02:16,590
genetics are able to you know the the

2899
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:18,900
highest level of expression from

2900
02:02:16,590 --> 02:02:20,369
cannabinoid and terpene profiles that's

2901
02:02:18,899 --> 02:02:21,869
that's what I'm looking for when I grow

2902
02:02:20,369 --> 02:02:23,960
cannabis and I never did it overly

2903
02:02:21,869 --> 02:02:27,809
complex I always tried to keep it

2904
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:31,279
organic and the more I was learning

2905
02:02:27,810 --> 02:02:33,539
about soil the more you know the more

2906
02:02:31,279 --> 02:02:35,488
intrigued I was by it and that's not

2907
02:02:33,539 --> 02:02:37,920
something I know a ton about that's why

2908
02:02:35,488 --> 02:02:39,869
I love having soil guys on on the show

2909
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:43,350
people that want to talk about soil as

2910
02:02:39,869 --> 02:02:46,920
soil women as well not just soil guys

2911
02:02:43,350 --> 02:02:51,120
soil women sorry for that little

2912
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:56,940
division there oh I gotta get rid of so

2913
02:02:51,119 --> 02:03:00,840
all people also people yeah human beings

2914
02:02:56,939 --> 02:03:02,658
yeah true enough let me just oh yeah

2915
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:05,279
there you go

2916
02:03:02,658 --> 02:03:07,799
we grew some of our best weed this year

2917
02:03:05,279 --> 02:03:11,250
because of natural systems and even

2918
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:14,340
though we have products you know grow

2919
02:03:11,250 --> 02:03:16,679
our grow based off products we grow our

2920
02:03:14,340 --> 02:03:19,889
we make our growth based off major and

2921
02:03:16,679 --> 02:03:20,850
we I mean if you go into the forest and

2922
02:03:19,889 --> 02:03:22,770
pick up

2923
02:03:20,850 --> 02:03:25,079
a handful of soil there's billions of

2924
02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:27,690
microbes in there there's no product

2925
02:03:25,079 --> 02:03:30,090
that comes close to billions so you can

2926
02:03:27,689 --> 02:03:31,919
get products and you can do indoors and

2927
02:03:30,090 --> 02:03:33,810
you can mimic and biomimic and do

2928
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:36,779
everything and that's a great thing to

2929
02:03:33,810 --> 02:03:41,060
do but nothing compares to just being

2930
02:03:36,779 --> 02:03:44,189
able to procreate this crazy environment

2931
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:46,470
but it's all this biomass and everything

2932
02:03:44,189 --> 02:03:47,729
just feeding organisms and getting or

2933
02:03:46,470 --> 02:03:50,070
business from all over the place we've

2934
02:03:47,729 --> 02:03:53,869
had the best time this year really using

2935
02:03:50,069 --> 02:03:56,489
hay dirt and weed water that's a

2936
02:03:53,869 --> 02:03:59,010
phenomenal amazing growth oh and a lot

2937
02:03:56,489 --> 02:04:01,050
of love and attention and observation I

2938
02:03:59,010 --> 02:04:03,000
mean it's not like we just plant it and

2939
02:04:01,050 --> 02:04:05,909
go to bed and wake up and harvest to be

2940
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:09,180
like check it out it's amazing it's it's

2941
02:04:05,909 --> 02:04:11,069
a process you know we use washes and

2942
02:04:09,180 --> 02:04:13,289
predator mites the you know to make sure

2943
02:04:11,069 --> 02:04:16,289
that our everything stays clean and we

2944
02:04:13,289 --> 02:04:17,939
don't have to mess with invasive oils or

2945
02:04:16,289 --> 02:04:19,769
different things that make it you know

2946
02:04:17,939 --> 02:04:23,339
stop it from growing and we're always in

2947
02:04:19,770 --> 02:04:25,620
this really beautiful immune-boosting

2948
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:27,210
style growth which we're just getting

2949
02:04:25,619 --> 02:04:29,039
amazing results out of and it's just so

2950
02:04:27,210 --> 02:04:31,079
fun to do it all so you were talking

2951
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:33,779
about money you know and when we're

2952
02:04:31,079 --> 02:04:35,970
growing a plant for money a lot of times

2953
02:04:33,779 --> 02:04:38,340
it's the knee-jerk reaction that gets us

2954
02:04:35,970 --> 02:04:40,800
into trouble because people that have a

2955
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:42,869
lot of money on the line and something

2956
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:45,840
goes wrong with their crop then they

2957
02:04:42,869 --> 02:04:47,819
have to come up with a solution ASAP so

2958
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:49,949
their solutions sometimes is not a

2959
02:04:47,819 --> 02:04:51,899
holistic solution it's a very allopathic

2960
02:04:49,949 --> 02:04:54,510
solution because it goes right to the

2961
02:04:51,899 --> 02:04:56,219
problem it takes like oh boy we've got a

2962
02:04:54,510 --> 02:04:57,750
mite issue let's get rid of the mites

2963
02:04:56,220 --> 02:05:00,390
rather than looking at it as a real

2964
02:04:57,750 --> 02:05:01,890
holistic way because they might not be

2965
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:04,500
able to have the time or the resources

2966
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:07,200
to be able to look at it in a more

2967
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:09,869
holistic view and I really implore

2968
02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:11,429
people out there you know that do have

2969
02:05:09,869 --> 02:05:13,739
money on the line you're gonna spend a

2970
02:05:11,430 --> 02:05:16,230
lot more money when you're looking at it

2971
02:05:13,739 --> 02:05:17,880
as an allopathic you know solution if

2972
02:05:16,229 --> 02:05:20,069
you're feeling like one thing is gonna

2973
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:23,460
take care of it it's gonna cost you more

2974
02:05:20,069 --> 02:05:25,199
money in the long run being in a

2975
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:27,680
reactive position instead of a proactive

2976
02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:27,679
one

2977
02:05:27,979 --> 02:05:32,208
yeah there's day I've seen it too many

2978
02:05:29,868 --> 02:05:34,308
times people being in desperate

2979
02:05:32,208 --> 02:05:37,099
situations to save their crops and it's

2980
02:05:34,309 --> 02:05:40,340
just like definitely the situations the

2981
02:05:37,099 --> 02:05:42,229
choices that they make even some fairly

2982
02:05:40,340 --> 02:05:44,360
conscious individuals I've known in the

2983
02:05:42,229 --> 02:05:47,239
past have made some fairly unconscious

2984
02:05:44,359 --> 02:05:49,518
decisions to keep that crop you know to

2985
02:05:47,238 --> 02:05:51,589
get that crop to a level where it's

2986
02:05:49,519 --> 02:05:55,699
still a sellable product and I'm just

2987
02:05:51,590 --> 02:05:59,690
like wolf knots might actually be

2988
02:05:55,698 --> 02:06:02,089
fallible or does it just sell well yeah

2989
02:05:59,689 --> 02:06:03,948
coz selling once again is there it's a

2990
02:06:02,090 --> 02:06:05,840
form of manipulative assumption right

2991
02:06:03,948 --> 02:06:07,189
like you you know that's why the person

2992
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:08,510
selling you the bud wants to say look at

2993
02:06:07,189 --> 02:06:09,589
the crystals look how crystal leave that

2994
02:06:08,510 --> 02:06:11,059
[ __ ] is can you feel that look at how

2995
02:06:09,590 --> 02:06:13,010
nice those buds are it's like you know

2996
02:06:11,059 --> 02:06:15,650
what you go away and I just want to look

2997
02:06:13,010 --> 02:06:18,498
at this herb I don't need to be sold to

2998
02:06:15,649 --> 02:06:20,268
the herb you know ya know that's what

2999
02:06:18,498 --> 02:06:21,408
it's been so fascinating kind of up this

3000
02:06:20,269 --> 02:06:23,479
point it has been such a like

3001
02:06:21,408 --> 02:06:25,339
showmanship salesmanship kind of thing

3002
02:06:23,479 --> 02:06:27,708
and you know up to this point you know

3003
02:06:25,340 --> 02:06:29,748
we're you know I mean even though so

3004
02:06:27,708 --> 02:06:32,029
much of what has been out there and

3005
02:06:29,748 --> 02:06:33,679
being household isn't as an organic and

3006
02:06:32,029 --> 02:06:35,630
what hasn't been cleaned but you know

3007
02:06:33,679 --> 02:06:37,729
being able to talk the lingo and kind of

3008
02:06:35,630 --> 02:06:40,729
you know you know stand in front of like

3009
02:06:37,729 --> 02:06:43,820
a procurement specialist at a dispensary

3010
02:06:40,729 --> 02:06:45,739
you can you know eloquently like you

3011
02:06:43,819 --> 02:06:49,099
know baffled people [ __ ] about you

3012
02:06:45,738 --> 02:06:50,839
know compost teas and I think you know

3013
02:06:49,099 --> 02:06:51,979
all the stuff that you use you know up

3014
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:54,139
to this point you've been able to kind

3015
02:06:51,979 --> 02:06:55,849
of you know get by and almost fake the

3016
02:06:54,139 --> 02:06:58,029
funk and you know kind of get whatever

3017
02:06:55,849 --> 02:07:00,610
Christ but you know I mean just as as

3018
02:06:58,029 --> 02:07:03,408
everything's shifting more more in the

3019
02:07:00,609 --> 02:07:05,808
consumer marketplace and you know the

3020
02:07:03,408 --> 02:07:07,819
kind of b2b marketplace has become more

3021
02:07:05,809 --> 02:07:09,199
I guess educated and and there's these

3022
02:07:07,819 --> 02:07:11,090
different analytical tools to

3023
02:07:09,198 --> 02:07:13,908
substantiate quality you know it's

3024
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:15,828
becoming less easy to fake the funk you

3025
02:07:13,908 --> 02:07:17,238
know and and fascinating because you

3026
02:07:15,828 --> 02:07:18,469
know at this point just since there's

3027
02:07:17,238 --> 02:07:20,538
such a flood of cannabis like

3028
02:07:18,469 --> 02:07:23,958
particularly in California you know it's

3029
02:07:20,538 --> 02:07:25,309
like if it's not 8 plus plus and yeah

3030
02:07:23,958 --> 02:07:25,819
because anything I feel like that's like

3031
02:07:25,309 --> 02:07:28,309
that

3032
02:07:25,819 --> 02:07:29,779
cured and still sticky reality you know

3033
02:07:28,309 --> 02:07:31,248
it's always gone you know when people

3034
02:07:29,779 --> 02:07:35,359
see it you know without even having to

3035
02:07:31,248 --> 02:07:38,359
sell it or poster bud exactly but but if

3036
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:39,738
it's anything less than that I mean I've

3037
02:07:38,359 --> 02:07:43,488
market is drying up more and more

3038
02:07:39,738 --> 02:07:46,339
quicker and quicker you know yeah I have

3039
02:07:43,488 --> 02:07:48,979
a question for you Alex what is the

3040
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:52,969
highest percentage of turkeys you found

3041
02:07:48,979 --> 02:07:55,488
in herbal cannabis uh you know what's

3042
02:07:52,969 --> 02:07:57,170
interesting is um typically we see kind

3043
02:07:55,488 --> 02:08:00,229
of on average you know the highest is

3044
02:07:57,170 --> 02:08:02,600
kind of around you know I mean like on

3045
02:08:00,229 --> 02:08:05,029
average what we see is you know two and

3046
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:07,699
a half to three three and a half percent

3047
02:08:05,029 --> 02:08:09,319
kind of you know has always been the you

3048
02:08:07,698 --> 02:08:11,439
know kind of you know where it Peaks out

3049
02:08:09,319 --> 02:08:14,500
but what's really interesting is certain

3050
02:08:11,439 --> 02:08:17,000
genetics you know um like we've seen

3051
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:19,760
continuously kind of you know able to

3052
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:21,829
come back at like five plus percent you

3053
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:23,989
know I mean and what's really what's

3054
02:08:21,829 --> 02:08:25,969
really trippy about that is like we have

3055
02:08:23,988 --> 02:08:28,638
these certain genetics you know that

3056
02:08:25,969 --> 02:08:30,770
that we see like whenever somebody will

3057
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:33,170
send it incest will have to kind of go

3058
02:08:30,770 --> 02:08:35,900
through like you know two to three

3059
02:08:33,170 --> 02:08:37,340
different reap reps on the bud to kind

3060
02:08:35,899 --> 02:08:40,189
of you know confirm the result because

3061
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:41,989
if anything kind of tests above our you

3062
02:08:40,189 --> 02:08:44,118
know we have these like high marks where

3063
02:08:41,988 --> 02:08:46,189
you know or the you know these outlier I

3064
02:08:44,118 --> 02:08:47,929
guess marks where if it's above that you

3065
02:08:46,189 --> 02:08:49,969
know then then it almost immediately

3066
02:08:47,929 --> 02:08:51,649
part of our quality system it

3067
02:08:49,969 --> 02:08:53,750
immediately kind of triggers us to reap

3068
02:08:51,649 --> 02:08:55,879
rep and reanalyze it and have more you

3069
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:58,100
know eyes on those results well the

3070
02:08:55,880 --> 02:09:00,920
numbers you're stalking totally makes

3071
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:03,889
sense to me we did terpene analysis for

3072
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:06,109
years and we got quite similar numbers

3073
02:09:03,889 --> 02:09:07,520
oh nice oh that's awesome that's really

3074
02:09:06,109 --> 02:09:09,618
good to hear actually because yeah I

3075
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:11,659
mean it's like it's puzzling to see most

3076
02:09:09,618 --> 02:09:14,539
all herb you know when it's cured

3077
02:09:11,658 --> 02:09:15,979
perfectly and dried perfectly and you

3078
02:09:14,539 --> 02:09:18,260
know kind of comes around three

3079
02:09:15,979 --> 02:09:19,698
you know three-ish percent plus - you

3080
02:09:18,260 --> 02:09:21,320
know but then certain strange is bound

3081
02:09:19,698 --> 02:09:23,029
this wacky that you know five plus

3082
02:09:21,319 --> 02:09:26,210
percent six percent so it's like wow

3083
02:09:23,029 --> 02:09:27,948
that's insane you know but um yeah I

3084
02:09:26,210 --> 02:09:29,510
mean it's that's that's definitely it's

3085
02:09:27,948 --> 02:09:31,969
definitely fascinating you know and with

3086
02:09:29,510 --> 02:09:34,039
with this terpene classification system

3087
02:09:31,969 --> 02:09:38,239
that we've we've been creating you know

3088
02:09:34,039 --> 02:09:39,829
we you know part of it you know we you

3089
02:09:38,238 --> 02:09:42,948
know we we created this like outlier

3090
02:09:39,829 --> 02:09:44,359
trigger where you know if some if any

3091
02:09:42,948 --> 02:09:46,638
strain that we passed through this

3092
02:09:44,359 --> 02:09:49,488
algorithm kind of has you know some

3093
02:09:46,639 --> 02:09:50,929
anomalously high terpenes or certain

3094
02:09:49,488 --> 02:09:51,500
terpenes that never really express

3095
02:09:50,929 --> 02:09:54,619
themselves

3096
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:57,500
you know in in you know 98% of the data

3097
02:09:54,619 --> 02:10:00,529
set you know kind of they flagged as an

3098
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:02,180
outlier for secondary review and I'm

3099
02:10:00,529 --> 02:10:04,489
really excited about outlier flag

3100
02:10:02,180 --> 02:10:07,460
because it kind of you know educates us

3101
02:10:04,489 --> 02:10:09,349
on like when there's true novelty but

3102
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:11,180
also when you know certain things happen

3103
02:10:09,350 --> 02:10:13,430
where there might be some possible

3104
02:10:11,180 --> 02:10:16,039
internal lab error by you know an

3105
02:10:13,430 --> 02:10:19,159
analyst that might be you know kind of

3106
02:10:16,039 --> 02:10:22,250
you know miss identifying a co eluding

3107
02:10:19,159 --> 02:10:24,470
peak or something but but what's

3108
02:10:22,250 --> 02:10:26,119
interesting is what we noticed whenever

3109
02:10:24,470 --> 02:10:27,560
you know we were going through and doing

3110
02:10:26,119 --> 02:10:30,739
you know kind of a lot of analysis

3111
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:33,230
around the outliers you know we really

3112
02:10:30,739 --> 02:10:35,179
we saw that you know a tremendous amount

3113
02:10:33,229 --> 02:10:37,369
of them were kind of you know swagging

3114
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:39,619
and so so we kind of created what we're

3115
02:10:37,369 --> 02:10:42,229
calling like a swag flag you know and

3116
02:10:39,619 --> 02:10:43,579
and so a swag flag basically is you know

3117
02:10:42,229 --> 02:10:46,250
what we see is like you know if it has

3118
02:10:43,579 --> 02:10:49,659
less than 0.75 percent total terpene

3119
02:10:46,250 --> 02:10:53,149
concentration and it's got you know

3120
02:10:49,659 --> 02:10:55,550
certain higher boiling point terpenes as

3121
02:10:53,149 --> 02:10:57,349
the dominant primary terpenes you know

3122
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:59,570
cuz is you know typically what we see is

3123
02:10:57,350 --> 02:11:01,490
you know primary terpenes will you know

3124
02:10:59,569 --> 02:11:05,929
you know are all wait if akwimos turks

3125
02:11:01,489 --> 02:11:07,670
you know they're like fresh um will

3126
02:11:05,930 --> 02:11:09,530
oftentimes you know oftentimes they'll

3127
02:11:07,670 --> 02:11:11,779
either be fresh leaf you know work fight

3128
02:11:09,529 --> 02:11:14,199
all will be like a dominant terpene but

3129
02:11:11,779 --> 02:11:17,389
but in in the times where there's like

3130
02:11:14,199 --> 02:11:20,989
what we're calling schwag flag it'll be

3131
02:11:17,390 --> 02:11:22,579
basically below 0.75% and it'll have a

3132
02:11:20,989 --> 02:11:24,109
combination you know so and it won't

3133
02:11:22,579 --> 02:11:26,449
have pretty much any of the primary

3134
02:11:24,109 --> 02:11:28,609
terpenes or any or any of the you know

3135
02:11:26,449 --> 02:11:31,460
primary mono Terps like you know piney

3136
02:11:28,609 --> 02:11:33,229
inter pendulum limonene near scene and

3137
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:35,329
then it'll also not really have a whole

3138
02:11:33,229 --> 02:11:37,429
lot of the sesqui chirps which we see

3139
02:11:35,329 --> 02:11:40,069
very common which are basically human

3140
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:42,890
lean and so so you know what we see is

3141
02:11:40,069 --> 02:11:45,139
in the hue it seems like about like five

3142
02:11:42,890 --> 02:11:46,490
percent of our total data set oh no I'm

3143
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:48,740
sorry about ten percent of our total

3144
02:11:46,489 --> 02:11:50,989
data set you know when passed through

3145
02:11:48,739 --> 02:11:52,550
this algorithm kind of hit you know

3146
02:11:50,989 --> 02:11:55,309
basically what we're calling schwag flag

3147
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:57,860
and so that'll be basically less than

3148
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:59,750
0.75 percent and it'll have the

3149
02:11:57,859 --> 02:12:02,869
following terpenes and other primary

3150
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:06,439
terpenes in it and that'll be basically

3151
02:12:02,869 --> 02:12:09,109
guai all neural idle is

3152
02:12:06,439 --> 02:12:11,779
and I carry off lien oxide and so it'll

3153
02:12:09,109 --> 02:12:13,819
be these all's Oh L as the last Terps

3154
02:12:11,779 --> 02:12:16,868
I'm sorry my dogs are freaking out I

3155
02:12:13,819 --> 02:12:16,868
gotta run give me one second

3156
02:12:17,979 --> 02:12:23,959
the dogs were like no we can't let this

3157
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:26,029
Terp knowledge drop go down we're just

3158
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:28,219
gonna have to hold back for a second I

3159
02:12:26,029 --> 02:12:30,738
think that I think that it's interesting

3160
02:12:28,219 --> 02:12:33,500
that you know in the wine world which is

3161
02:12:30,738 --> 02:12:35,238
a very old industry you know it's been

3162
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:38,060
happening for a very long time with

3163
02:12:35,238 --> 02:12:40,759
legality and acceptance by community you

3164
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:42,770
know we're not really talking about the

3165
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:47,449
percentage of alcohol we're not talking

3166
02:12:42,770 --> 02:12:49,099
about the percentage of you know sugars

3167
02:12:47,448 --> 02:12:51,049
that are in it or all of the different

3168
02:12:49,099 --> 02:12:53,389
terpenes that are in it you know it's

3169
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:55,310
really come down to maybe because it's a

3170
02:12:53,389 --> 02:12:57,199
more mature industry I'm not sure but

3171
02:12:55,310 --> 02:12:59,210
it's come down to how does it make you

3172
02:12:57,198 --> 02:13:01,098
feel how does it taste

3173
02:12:59,210 --> 02:13:02,689
and how does it smell and it's just

3174
02:13:01,099 --> 02:13:04,730
really interesting that we've gone on

3175
02:13:02,689 --> 02:13:08,118
all different kinds of gamuts with

3176
02:13:04,729 --> 02:13:10,729
cannabis industry people buy the

3177
02:13:08,118 --> 02:13:15,198
varieties that they like a chardonnays

3178
02:13:10,729 --> 02:13:19,848
or a red wine or whatever and that's all

3179
02:13:15,198 --> 02:13:21,289
based on the terpenes etc it's just

3180
02:13:19,849 --> 02:13:23,060
interesting that we don't test them

3181
02:13:21,289 --> 02:13:30,948
scientifically you know it's something

3182
02:13:23,060 --> 02:13:33,080
that people know from experience now we

3183
02:13:30,948 --> 02:13:34,609
need the cannabis sommelier kit with all

3184
02:13:33,079 --> 02:13:36,260
the different totall you're saying

3185
02:13:34,609 --> 02:13:38,929
that's what we're talking about that'll

3186
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:39,679
be nice to invigorate that more with it

3187
02:13:38,929 --> 02:13:42,949
okay

3188
02:13:39,679 --> 02:13:44,810
it's like hard to do but it's important

3189
02:13:42,948 --> 02:13:47,509
the labs can't tell you how it makes you

3190
02:13:44,810 --> 02:13:49,610
feel you know we can we can take guesses

3191
02:13:47,510 --> 02:13:51,770
on what those terpenes are supposed to

3192
02:13:49,609 --> 02:13:54,229
make you feel but consumers either buy

3193
02:13:51,770 --> 02:13:56,080
based off numbers know people that you

3194
02:13:54,229 --> 02:13:59,448
know we all have really different

3195
02:13:56,079 --> 02:14:03,500
cannabinoid receptor systems well it's

3196
02:13:59,448 --> 02:14:06,079
actually the same with wine but if you

3197
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:08,060
drink the Chardonnay you're gonna expect

3198
02:14:06,079 --> 02:14:12,170
it to be similar to the other Chardonnay

3199
02:14:08,060 --> 02:14:14,659
and so it's just experience when people

3200
02:14:12,170 --> 02:14:18,920
have enough experience with knowing what

3201
02:14:14,658 --> 02:14:21,589
particular you know if it's say 20% tea

3202
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:23,779
see in a particular terpene profile it

3203
02:14:21,590 --> 02:14:25,909
will cause these effects with the

3204
02:14:23,779 --> 02:14:30,229
different terpene profile it will cause

3205
02:14:25,909 --> 02:14:33,079
those effects and terroir

3206
02:14:30,229 --> 02:14:34,579
so that Chardonnay terroir in France is

3207
02:14:33,079 --> 02:14:36,800
gonna be different than the one in

3208
02:14:34,579 --> 02:14:38,929
Oregon and people know that and that's a

3209
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:41,929
more mature industry in that sense where

3210
02:14:38,929 --> 02:14:44,179
we can be like oh of course we know that

3211
02:14:41,929 --> 02:14:46,190
the dirt in that area and what its gonna

3212
02:14:44,179 --> 02:14:49,219
affect on those winter beans are gonna

3213
02:14:46,189 --> 02:14:51,349
be affected by the soil you know terroir

3214
02:14:49,219 --> 02:14:54,140
it's a bit funny with cannabis because

3215
02:14:51,350 --> 02:14:57,710
so much of it is grown in man-made soil

3216
02:14:54,140 --> 02:15:01,789
it's not really terroir if it's man-made

3217
02:14:57,710 --> 02:15:03,439
soil is on hot yeah and and I'm sorry if

3218
02:15:01,789 --> 02:15:05,630
I may jump into it I apologize I just

3219
02:15:03,439 --> 02:15:07,099
have scoot off my dogs barking um but

3220
02:15:05,630 --> 02:15:08,359
you just wanted to finish the point you

3221
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:10,820
know because it wasn't just to make the

3222
02:15:08,359 --> 02:15:11,750
point about swag flag um that that was a

3223
02:15:10,819 --> 02:15:13,789
pretty you know that was a really

3224
02:15:11,750 --> 02:15:16,609
interesting finding because we saw in

3225
02:15:13,789 --> 02:15:18,529
schwag in these certain subsets of

3226
02:15:16,609 --> 02:15:20,509
samples you know it allowed less than X

3227
02:15:18,529 --> 02:15:22,639
percent when it you know about 0.75

3228
02:15:20,510 --> 02:15:24,380
percent total terpenes and most of the

3229
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:26,239
mono and sesqui turkeys that are the

3230
02:15:24,380 --> 02:15:29,900
primary terpenes that distinguished most

3231
02:15:26,238 --> 02:15:31,609
smell of you know the primary and

3232
02:15:29,899 --> 02:15:33,500
secondary terpenes that virtually any

3233
02:15:31,609 --> 02:15:35,899
strain that we've tested in california

3234
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:37,760
has you know it'll then concentrate the

3235
02:15:35,899 --> 02:15:40,039
certain other supposedly you know I

3236
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:42,289
guess non desirable or more highly or

3237
02:15:40,039 --> 02:15:45,619
boiling-point terpenes that that are

3238
02:15:42,289 --> 02:15:47,899
more I guess distinguishing of you know

3239
02:15:45,619 --> 02:15:49,369
schwag I guess in that sense because you

3240
02:15:47,899 --> 02:15:50,448
know pretty much you know things that

3241
02:15:49,369 --> 02:15:53,630
you know things like I was saying like

3242
02:15:50,448 --> 02:15:56,750
you know Carroll monoxide fight all nura

3243
02:15:53,630 --> 02:15:58,940
lied all alpha visible all those what we

3244
02:15:56,750 --> 02:16:00,770
see in to a really high degree is you

3245
02:15:58,939 --> 02:16:02,210
know when those concentrations terpenes

3246
02:16:00,770 --> 02:16:04,280
and spills point seven five percent and

3247
02:16:02,210 --> 02:16:05,960
you verify kind of on the pictures and

3248
02:16:04,279 --> 02:16:07,670
everything like that it's typically like

3249
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:09,469
yeah really old kind of degraded

3250
02:16:07,670 --> 02:16:11,929
material probably sat around for a

3251
02:16:09,469 --> 02:16:15,050
really long time you know but but once

3252
02:16:11,929 --> 02:16:17,029
we kind of you know in this outlier kind

3253
02:16:15,050 --> 02:16:18,770
of grouping when we when we you know

3254
02:16:17,029 --> 02:16:20,238
started to differentiate and see that

3255
02:16:18,770 --> 02:16:22,760
there are you know there's the need for

3256
02:16:20,238 --> 02:16:24,678
the strike flag we also identify and you

3257
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:26,300
know the need for like what's you know I

3258
02:16:24,679 --> 02:16:28,190
mean it's not the name of it but what

3259
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:30,230
we're tentatively calling like a Fuego

3260
02:16:28,189 --> 02:16:31,869
flag and so that's when something's like

3261
02:16:30,229 --> 02:16:34,779
incredibly above average

3262
02:16:31,869 --> 02:16:36,340
in total turkey concentration and and so

3263
02:16:34,780 --> 02:16:38,140
what we see with that is you know kind

3264
02:16:36,340 --> 02:16:39,969
of you know about five percent of our

3265
02:16:38,139 --> 02:16:41,949
total data set you know will basically

3266
02:16:39,969 --> 02:16:44,819
be above three and a half percent

3267
02:16:41,950 --> 02:16:46,659
terpenes and then you know the primary

3268
02:16:44,819 --> 02:16:48,459
monoterpenes that are present and that

3269
02:16:46,659 --> 02:16:51,010
will just be soaring you know things

3270
02:16:48,459 --> 02:16:55,059
again like alphap I mean Turpin leaned

3271
02:16:51,010 --> 02:16:56,530
near seen limonene and you know in

3272
02:16:55,059 --> 02:16:58,779
strains that are like you know cookies

3273
02:16:56,530 --> 02:16:59,680
and server and stuff that'll be caroling

3274
02:16:58,780 --> 02:17:01,989
dominant which is more like

3275
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:03,729
sesquiterpene level but but you know a

3276
02:17:01,989 --> 02:17:06,010
very small subset of these samples will

3277
02:17:03,729 --> 02:17:08,619
be will be in that above three and a

3278
02:17:06,010 --> 02:17:11,290
half percent and so you know in that we

3279
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:12,910
see up to five six plus percent total

3280
02:17:11,290 --> 02:17:15,250
concentration for these very specific

3281
02:17:12,909 --> 02:17:16,959
strains which kind of correlate kind of

3282
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:18,790
yeah I mean there's the component to how

3283
02:17:16,959 --> 02:17:20,259
it was growing environmentally you know

3284
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:22,660
and and of course how it was kind of

3285
02:17:20,260 --> 02:17:25,090
dried and cured and post harvested but

3286
02:17:22,659 --> 02:17:27,190
but but certain strains you know when

3287
02:17:25,090 --> 02:17:29,770
grown and harvested you know whether

3288
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:31,780
indoor/outdoor seemed genetically how to

3289
02:17:29,770 --> 02:17:33,909
have a propensity to overall test higher

3290
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:35,710
in total concentration than others that

3291
02:17:33,909 --> 02:17:36,819
might just cap out at a certain percent

3292
02:17:35,709 --> 02:17:39,429
even when they're dried and cured

3293
02:17:36,819 --> 02:17:41,050
perfectly but but yeah it's pretty

3294
02:17:39,430 --> 02:17:43,149
interesting because with you know kind

3295
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:45,430
of just you know we I guess some some of

3296
02:17:43,149 --> 02:17:47,709
you were asking you know it's a it's

3297
02:17:45,430 --> 02:17:49,120
it's it's interesting how how certain

3298
02:17:47,709 --> 02:17:51,399
genetics will basically have that

3299
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:53,051
ability but then but then you know it's

3300
02:17:51,399 --> 02:17:55,270
it's also really interesting to us how

3301
02:17:53,050 --> 02:17:57,879
you know we test you know 30 I think

3302
02:17:55,270 --> 02:17:59,801
it's like 33 or 34 12 terpenes at this

3303
02:17:57,879 --> 02:18:01,509
point you know we in the future

3304
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:03,579
eventually will be kind of testing for

3305
02:18:01,510 --> 02:18:06,280
different alcohol esters and flavonoids

3306
02:18:03,579 --> 02:18:07,930
but but of the 33 terpenes that we test

3307
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:09,940
for you know pretty much there's about

3308
02:18:07,930 --> 02:18:12,610
five to nine that ever show up in any

3309
02:18:09,940 --> 02:18:14,560
real significant concentration and and

3310
02:18:12,610 --> 02:18:17,350
the primary terpenes that distinguish

3311
02:18:14,559 --> 02:18:19,750
most smell and how well it comes out in

3312
02:18:17,350 --> 02:18:21,899
virtually all strains we test you know

3313
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:24,850
really are these you know four or five

3314
02:18:21,899 --> 02:18:29,020
monoterpenes that's that's pretty much

3315
02:18:24,850 --> 02:18:31,120
what we found but we would test for we

3316
02:18:29,020 --> 02:18:34,390
had about a hundred standards at the

3317
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:37,450
maximum and we used to find a little

3318
02:18:34,389 --> 02:18:40,449
over 50 Kirkenes and measurable amounts

3319
02:18:37,450 --> 02:18:43,060
in the average cannabis variety we test

3320
02:18:40,450 --> 02:18:45,250
right and but but but as far as like and

3321
02:18:43,059 --> 02:18:45,639
you know the either 75 to 80 percent of

3322
02:18:45,250 --> 02:18:47,739
the cost

3323
02:18:45,639 --> 02:18:51,130
raishin did you - did you see more than

3324
02:18:47,739 --> 02:18:53,979
you know those five or five nine members

3325
02:18:51,130 --> 02:18:56,710
there's maybe nine or ten or eleven that

3326
02:18:53,979 --> 02:19:00,309
were common like you say you know the

3327
02:18:56,710 --> 02:19:03,219
rest of them are seldom found and seldom

3328
02:19:00,309 --> 02:19:04,540
in large amounts right yeah and that's

3329
02:19:03,219 --> 02:19:06,010
really interesting what we see but

3330
02:19:04,540 --> 02:19:07,449
what's really kind of cool about all

3331
02:19:06,010 --> 02:19:10,300
that is in so many ways I think that

3332
02:19:07,450 --> 02:19:13,030
really provides a road map to help you

3333
02:19:10,300 --> 02:19:15,399
know identify terpenes as the number one

3334
02:19:13,030 --> 02:19:17,051
metric to determine quality and how well

3335
02:19:15,399 --> 02:19:18,639
something was driving care and how well

3336
02:19:17,050 --> 02:19:20,769
the terroir was brought out in the

3337
02:19:18,639 --> 02:19:23,739
strain in the environment you know and

3338
02:19:20,770 --> 02:19:26,440
just being able to use as part of but

3339
02:19:23,739 --> 02:19:29,290
you don't want just you want the right

3340
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:32,319
terpenes of course everybody has an

3341
02:19:29,290 --> 02:19:35,769
opinion what those right terpenes are

3342
02:19:32,319 --> 02:19:37,059
yeah this is a great point as far as all

3343
02:19:35,770 --> 02:19:38,291
the statistics they were being thrown

3344
02:19:37,059 --> 02:19:39,760
out on and I just wanted to point this

3345
02:19:38,290 --> 02:19:41,500
back to Peter and let him know that

3346
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:44,380
that's why I called out his terpene

3347
02:19:41,501 --> 02:19:46,030
analysis as far as advertise the small

3348
02:19:44,380 --> 02:19:48,189
balance Pro because the numbers he was

3349
02:19:46,030 --> 02:19:51,011
being as average for the industry were

3350
02:19:48,190 --> 02:19:52,780
far below schwag in my opinion and then

3351
02:19:51,011 --> 02:19:54,581
the numbers brought up were still below

3352
02:19:52,780 --> 02:19:55,931
that level and so these are the types of

3353
02:19:54,581 --> 02:19:58,001
data that if you share with your

3354
02:19:55,931 --> 02:19:59,171
customers and correlate it to the

3355
02:19:58,001 --> 02:20:00,940
product I think would be much more

3356
02:19:59,171 --> 02:20:03,461
received when I saw the terpene test

3357
02:20:00,940 --> 02:20:05,440
whatever it was way off from this

3358
02:20:03,460 --> 02:20:20,290
conversation that's more accurate to me

3359
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:22,751
so I just wanted to relay that and say

3360
02:20:20,290 --> 02:20:25,779
for everyone who's listening and here

3361
02:20:22,751 --> 02:20:31,601
came roots we pride ourselves on being

3362
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:32,681
an honest conscious incorporation I know

3363
02:20:31,601 --> 02:20:35,319
that they're probably still some

3364
02:20:32,681 --> 02:20:36,971
questions out there and so for anyone

3365
02:20:35,319 --> 02:20:38,470
who's watching or who sees this later

3366
02:20:36,970 --> 02:20:39,251
like we welcome you send us your

3367
02:20:38,470 --> 02:20:41,890
questions

3368
02:20:39,251 --> 02:20:44,050
I'll check us on their website it's soil

3369
02:20:41,890 --> 02:20:47,501
balance procom there's a contact form

3370
02:20:44,050 --> 02:20:48,850
there and we'll make sure it answer all

3371
02:20:47,501 --> 02:20:50,950
of your questions we want to be as

3372
02:20:48,851 --> 02:20:53,051
transparent as possible and we're here

3373
02:20:50,950 --> 02:20:54,971
to make this industry better that's

3374
02:20:53,050 --> 02:20:57,889
really what we're here for

3375
02:20:54,970 --> 02:20:59,869
Jeremy thank you for making sure that

3376
02:20:57,889 --> 02:21:02,059
we're tightening up our ship I'm super

3377
02:20:59,870 --> 02:21:03,890
excited to be working with you I hope

3378
02:21:02,059 --> 02:21:06,920
that you'll even consider mentoring us

3379
02:21:03,889 --> 02:21:09,019
we want to work with you and and be

3380
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:11,719
partners and together in this industry

3381
02:21:09,020 --> 02:21:14,529
and so again thank you for for making

3382
02:21:11,719 --> 02:21:17,959
sure that we've got our [ __ ] together

3383
02:21:14,529 --> 02:21:20,689
man yeah and and I'm all dressed the

3384
02:21:17,959 --> 02:21:25,039
turkey question just really quick so so

3385
02:21:20,689 --> 02:21:28,639
the grower who got 0.4 terpene that was

3386
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:31,040
their lab right so so the lab here in

3387
02:21:28,639 --> 02:21:34,398
Arizona when they tested it his turkeys

3388
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:36,770
were 0.4% and so after use our product

3389
02:21:34,398 --> 02:21:38,238
he went up to 1.5 percent total turkeys

3390
02:21:36,770 --> 02:21:41,479
and there were eight different types and

3391
02:21:38,238 --> 02:21:43,279
so I was really proud of that you know I

3392
02:21:41,478 --> 02:21:45,228
know some guys are hitting three four

3393
02:21:43,279 --> 02:21:49,880
and six and eight percent which is epic

3394
02:21:45,228 --> 02:21:52,250
man their biology must be incredible so

3395
02:21:49,879 --> 02:21:54,139
so you know hands off to those guys man

3396
02:21:52,250 --> 02:21:56,148
this gentleman wasn't one of those guys

3397
02:21:54,139 --> 02:21:57,889
he was just like a regular grower and

3398
02:21:56,148 --> 02:21:59,930
you know he'd been growing kind of in

3399
02:21:57,889 --> 02:22:02,289
his home and he was like blown away by

3400
02:21:59,930 --> 02:22:04,939
the increase to get close to 2% you know

3401
02:22:02,290 --> 02:22:06,830
we were proud of that and so that's kind

3402
02:22:04,939 --> 02:22:10,818
of where we came but what was cool about

3403
02:22:06,829 --> 02:22:12,318
the tests is that there was like six or

3404
02:22:10,818 --> 02:22:14,329
seven different types of terpenes

3405
02:22:12,318 --> 02:22:16,579
instead of just like the three spikes

3406
02:22:14,329 --> 02:22:18,620
that you normally see so we thought it

3407
02:22:16,579 --> 02:22:20,719
was pretty unique as well and that's why

3408
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:23,390
we showed the data but but one thing

3409
02:22:20,719 --> 02:22:24,858
because we we both kind of have to get

3410
02:22:23,389 --> 02:22:29,448
going and one thing I did want to talk

3411
02:22:24,859 --> 02:22:32,960
to Gary about is like I feel like our

3412
02:22:29,449 --> 02:22:34,279
microbes really benefit your amendments

3413
02:22:32,959 --> 02:22:37,009
I feel like your amendments would

3414
02:22:34,279 --> 02:22:39,079
benefit us as well and the glowers that

3415
02:22:37,010 --> 02:22:41,210
were working with I know you're putting

3416
02:22:39,079 --> 02:22:43,520
out some great stuff I've heard you know

3417
02:22:41,209 --> 02:22:45,309
great things about your product and so I

3418
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:48,649
hope that we can kind of shake hands man

3419
02:22:45,309 --> 02:22:50,658
maybe try and work together in this

3420
02:22:48,648 --> 02:22:52,789
industry because it's kind of like

3421
02:22:50,658 --> 02:22:55,728
dragonfly was talking about like it's a

3422
02:22:52,790 --> 02:22:58,580
it's a synergy our product also you know

3423
02:22:55,728 --> 02:23:00,920
if the microbes come together and work

3424
02:22:58,579 --> 02:23:02,840
as a team they're much more effective in

3425
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:04,818
helping this world and that's what we're

3426
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:07,340
all here to do we got we got to take our

3427
02:23:04,818 --> 02:23:09,170
nature man our [ __ ] planet is dying

3428
02:23:07,340 --> 02:23:11,780
and it's time for us to come together

3429
02:23:09,170 --> 02:23:13,610
man and and and like you know

3430
02:23:11,780 --> 02:23:15,351
I settle our differences which I would

3431
02:23:13,610 --> 02:23:17,810
really like to do and explain everything

3432
02:23:15,351 --> 02:23:20,391
so if anybody has questions come to the

3433
02:23:17,810 --> 02:23:22,159
site but it is time for balance in our

3434
02:23:20,390 --> 02:23:24,681
soil man it's time like like like

3435
02:23:22,159 --> 02:23:27,950
dragonfly was talking about that biology

3436
02:23:24,681 --> 02:23:29,780
that that synergy that what they're

3437
02:23:27,950 --> 02:23:31,340
working with that life is how why

3438
02:23:29,780 --> 02:23:33,500
they're helping the people the fire

3439
02:23:31,340 --> 02:23:35,149
victims are giving their giving

3440
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:37,851
organisms and that's what we want to be

3441
02:23:35,149 --> 02:23:41,750
so so we'd love to support you Jeremy

3442
02:23:37,851 --> 02:23:43,730
and appreciate you from from many

3443
02:23:41,750 --> 02:23:45,970
different levels I'm humbled by your

3444
02:23:43,729 --> 02:23:48,500
work for it for the last three years

3445
02:23:45,970 --> 02:23:49,479
helping organic farmers men I'm

3446
02:23:48,500 --> 02:23:53,649
impressed by you

3447
02:23:49,479 --> 02:23:56,359
everyone seriously so I will say that oh

3448
02:23:53,649 --> 02:23:59,799
I know I know I get gardener there build

3449
02:23:56,360 --> 02:24:01,670
a soil you currently growing cannabis

3450
02:23:59,799 --> 02:24:05,539
all day every day

3451
02:24:01,670 --> 02:24:07,879
yeah nice our retail store where you can

3452
02:24:05,540 --> 02:24:10,670
actually see and we practice what we

3453
02:24:07,879 --> 02:24:12,890
preach we do side by side demonstrations

3454
02:24:10,670 --> 02:24:14,390
right there on the retail floor nice

3455
02:24:12,890 --> 02:24:15,890
we also demonstrate some of our

3456
02:24:14,390 --> 02:24:18,199
customers as well as our own personal

3457
02:24:15,890 --> 02:24:21,799
governments and we're very transparent

3458
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:23,811
in that and I'm always interested in the

3459
02:24:21,799 --> 02:24:25,399
base root of transparency of products

3460
02:24:23,810 --> 02:24:27,739
that I can share the results with other

3461
02:24:25,399 --> 02:24:30,199
people and when I'm looking at the

3462
02:24:27,739 --> 02:24:33,709
microorganisms they're used on the lip

3463
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:35,360
line I find more affordable sources for

3464
02:24:33,709 --> 02:24:36,680
similar microbes and I think that a lot

3465
02:24:35,360 --> 02:24:38,690
of what it might be able to provide is

3466
02:24:36,681 --> 02:24:41,239
is proprietary at this point so for me

3467
02:24:38,690 --> 02:24:43,909
to work board with any products I need a

3468
02:24:41,239 --> 02:24:45,289
little more transparency and I think I'd

3469
02:24:43,909 --> 02:24:46,761
be a lot more likely to work with

3470
02:24:45,290 --> 02:24:49,250
dragonfly's products based on their

3471
02:24:46,761 --> 02:24:50,899
transparency then I would be with this

3472
02:24:49,250 --> 02:24:52,190
well balanced but that doesn't mean it's

3473
02:24:50,899 --> 02:24:53,899
going to permanently be that way if

3474
02:24:52,190 --> 02:24:56,569
there was more transparency and all the

3475
02:24:53,899 --> 02:24:57,799
specialty ingredients I could balance

3476
02:24:56,569 --> 02:24:59,360
that against my budget in the

3477
02:24:57,799 --> 02:25:00,379
marketplace with other products that may

3478
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:02,511
or may not have those same ingredients

3479
02:25:00,379 --> 02:25:04,339
you know that's kind of how I operate I

3480
02:25:02,511 --> 02:25:06,649
don't expect everyone to operate that

3481
02:25:04,340 --> 02:25:08,720
way no not everyone goes down to the

3482
02:25:06,649 --> 02:25:11,299
individual level there's what they may

3483
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:13,069
or not be able to do locally producers

3484
02:25:11,299 --> 02:25:15,529
so I get that I think there's got

3485
02:25:13,069 --> 02:25:18,440
definitely place for maybe a longer or a

3486
02:25:15,530 --> 02:25:19,940
drawn-out conversation for this but at

3487
02:25:18,440 --> 02:25:21,409
the same time I think that we've seen a

3488
02:25:19,940 --> 02:25:24,050
lot of change on there and already so

3489
02:25:21,409 --> 02:25:25,369
it's important to know hmm hey where are

3490
02:25:24,049 --> 02:25:28,429
you located Jeremy

3491
02:25:25,370 --> 02:25:32,329
by Colorado I'm in Montreux on the

3492
02:25:28,430 --> 02:25:35,090
western slope okay cool I wasn't even

3493
02:25:32,329 --> 02:25:37,489
sure kind of cool they asked for this

3494
02:25:35,090 --> 02:25:39,351
three times and and it's and I haven't

3495
02:25:37,489 --> 02:25:42,110
gotten a response to it I'd love to have

3496
02:25:39,351 --> 02:25:44,000
some third-party independent lab you

3497
02:25:42,110 --> 02:25:48,010
know test test some of the build of soil

3498
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:50,840
microbes against our microbes or

3499
02:25:48,010 --> 02:25:54,710
products or because as as far as

3500
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:57,889
transparency every organic material out

3501
02:25:54,709 --> 02:26:00,409
there like especially soil is gonna have

3502
02:25:57,889 --> 02:26:04,819
over a thousand different strains of

3503
02:26:00,409 --> 02:26:06,079
bacteria so maybe it'd be it'd be

3504
02:26:04,819 --> 02:26:07,520
interesting to see what and they're

3505
02:26:06,079 --> 02:26:09,889
formulated in the lab they usually

3506
02:26:07,521 --> 02:26:12,950
individually formulated and then mixed

3507
02:26:09,889 --> 02:26:15,170
and so I just want you to be actually

3508
02:26:12,950 --> 02:26:16,430
the products I research yeah give me

3509
02:26:15,170 --> 02:26:18,620
that info but it's a challenge with

3510
02:26:16,430 --> 02:26:19,550
labeling been one of my favorite older

3511
02:26:18,620 --> 02:26:22,640
products em1

3512
02:26:19,549 --> 02:26:26,539
you know what's really in there so I get

3513
02:26:22,639 --> 02:26:30,260
that hey uh does SC labs do testing like

3514
02:26:26,540 --> 02:26:32,870
that alikum you guys ever tested for um

3515
02:26:30,260 --> 02:26:36,050
we don't do kind of like a soil

3516
02:26:32,870 --> 02:26:39,650
microbiology kind of microbe microbial

3517
02:26:36,049 --> 02:26:42,139
now that comes up I know one in Southern

3518
02:26:39,649 --> 02:26:44,869
Oregon like the one that kind of there's

3519
02:26:42,139 --> 02:26:47,209
a lot of soil food web stuff you know

3520
02:26:44,870 --> 02:26:49,610
for kind of the Elaine Ingham kind of

3521
02:26:47,209 --> 02:26:51,169
team um I can't think of any good to

3522
02:26:49,610 --> 02:26:52,970
tell my mind but I do know of a couple

3523
02:26:51,170 --> 02:26:58,460
different labs I can post on the thread

3524
02:26:52,969 --> 02:27:01,039
um yeah cool nonetheless the offers

3525
02:26:58,459 --> 02:27:03,409
there Jeremy if you'd ever like to work

3526
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:05,990
with that we respect what you do so

3527
02:27:03,409 --> 02:27:07,489
thank you and thank you guys for the

3528
02:27:05,989 --> 02:27:08,149
space Marcus thanks for coming out of

3529
02:27:07,489 --> 02:27:13,549
retirement

3530
02:27:08,149 --> 02:27:16,399
this dude yes thank you awesome guys

3531
02:27:13,549 --> 02:27:19,340
thanks for coming in for sure was well

3532
02:27:16,399 --> 02:27:22,539
it's almost 11:30 we had what is salmon

3533
02:27:19,340 --> 02:27:25,010
an LED grow room now

3534
02:27:22,540 --> 02:27:26,440
yeah locations into one of the grow

3535
02:27:25,010 --> 02:27:28,760
rooms here at ECC

3536
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:30,620
you guys were talking about subpar

3537
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:32,710
cannabis being grown like half an hour

3538
02:27:30,620 --> 02:27:32,710
ago

3539
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:39,220
it's looking pretty stacked bro dude I

3540
02:27:36,760 --> 02:27:41,620
think these are just in like week before

3541
02:27:39,219 --> 02:27:43,539
so they're not looking super huge yet

3542
02:27:41,620 --> 02:27:44,950
but growing under these LED lights

3543
02:27:43,540 --> 02:27:46,420
really seems to help with their true

3544
02:27:44,950 --> 02:27:48,280
peen synthesis and comparing them to

3545
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:49,450
like adidas is a few other lights you

3546
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:50,620
seem like two and a half times the

3547
02:27:49,450 --> 02:27:53,290
turkey and development out of these

3548
02:27:50,620 --> 02:27:54,820
because there's some kind LEDs there was

3549
02:27:53,290 --> 02:27:56,710
look pretty stacked for week four man

3550
02:27:54,819 --> 02:27:58,869
that's awesome and yeah LEDs it's pretty

3551
02:27:56,709 --> 02:28:01,029
cool like I mean I worked in the

3552
02:27:58,870 --> 02:28:02,680
hydroponic industry for you know a few

3553
02:28:01,030 --> 02:28:04,659
years before we opened up a see labs and

3554
02:28:02,680 --> 02:28:07,870
you know everybody was almost thing so

3555
02:28:04,659 --> 02:28:09,879
much about LED technology and whatever

3556
02:28:07,870 --> 02:28:13,150
then it was always like an unfounded

3557
02:28:09,879 --> 02:28:15,670
claim but just some of the new kind of

3558
02:28:13,149 --> 02:28:16,959
LED kind of setups like these days it

3559
02:28:15,670 --> 02:28:19,899
seems like it's actually starting to

3560
02:28:16,959 --> 02:28:22,270
Rictor kind of and you know comparable

3561
02:28:19,899 --> 02:28:23,760
kind of you know to a lot of the HD

3562
02:28:22,271 --> 02:28:25,510
double end involved like reality

3563
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:27,040
definitely seems like it's getting

3564
02:28:25,510 --> 02:28:29,200
better I worked at a previous facility

3565
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:31,210
that didn't have nearly this quality of

3566
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:33,130
LEDs and I think I think our yield is

3567
02:28:31,209 --> 02:28:34,959
almost double here the yield is still

3568
02:28:33,129 --> 02:28:36,850
not quite look like the goodness can put

3569
02:28:34,959 --> 02:28:38,500
out though we might be looking to do

3570
02:28:36,851 --> 02:28:40,710
like a mixture of different kinds of

3571
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:40,709
lighting

3572
02:28:45,209 --> 02:28:48,850
thanks again for bringing me aboard well

3573
02:28:47,260 --> 02:28:51,610
man I'm gonna have to take off to the

3574
02:28:48,851 --> 02:28:53,021
other run done and I think Andrew just

3575
02:28:51,610 --> 02:28:55,000
dipped out but I wanted to thank him for

3576
02:28:53,021 --> 02:28:57,101
the discussion today and hopefully we

3577
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:58,629
can have some more of that sorry for the

3578
02:28:57,101 --> 02:29:00,880
poor quality tools I have but I'm just

3579
02:28:58,629 --> 02:29:04,329
working with what every other extract

3580
02:29:00,879 --> 02:29:06,520
technician making oil you know I

3581
02:29:04,329 --> 02:29:08,500
appreciate I appreciate you sharing it I

3582
02:29:06,521 --> 02:29:10,180
mean that you know it's not my my

3583
02:29:08,500 --> 02:29:13,719
preferred method but hey I would you

3584
02:29:10,180 --> 02:29:15,489
offered to share and I thought that why

3585
02:29:13,719 --> 02:29:18,459
not it seems like a nice thing to share

3586
02:29:15,489 --> 02:29:20,351
we appreciate the grow room say hi bye

3587
02:29:18,459 --> 02:29:22,299
to your partner for us and I'm sure

3588
02:29:20,351 --> 02:29:23,950
we'll see you again soon thanks for

3589
02:29:22,299 --> 02:29:27,549
having us beam in see you guys soon

3590
02:29:23,950 --> 02:29:29,920
right on Sam oh well it was a very

3591
02:29:27,549 --> 02:29:32,139
eclectic Church today all sorts of

3592
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:34,690
different things going on we lost

3593
02:29:32,139 --> 02:29:36,219
chimera fairly early on he said the

3594
02:29:34,690 --> 02:29:38,409
funniest thing when he laughed he said

3595
02:29:36,219 --> 02:29:44,889
something like well I guess it's all

3596
02:29:38,409 --> 02:29:47,500
rainbows and unicorns everyone he was

3597
02:29:44,889 --> 02:29:48,029
just funny it was raining he came in

3598
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:51,030
super

3599
02:29:48,030 --> 02:29:52,710
you know Indiana's defense yes I get

3600
02:29:51,030 --> 02:29:54,181
lots of people have been like yeah when

3601
02:29:52,709 --> 02:29:55,500
are we gonna see this unit that injures

3602
02:29:54,181 --> 02:29:59,280
been talking about for two years on

3603
02:29:55,500 --> 02:30:00,989
hashed Church so I guess probably sooner

3604
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:02,489
than later yeah a chemo diesel oh come

3605
02:30:00,989 --> 02:30:04,739
on dude it's just a sales thing are we

3606
02:30:02,489 --> 02:30:06,989
gonna see the like he was just like you

3607
02:30:04,739 --> 02:30:11,119
see he's chimera right and I'm for it

3608
02:30:06,989 --> 02:30:14,039
yeah III I dig all the different vibes

3609
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:16,351
exciting to see is the science which I

3610
02:30:14,040 --> 02:30:18,960
completely back and I think all of us

3611
02:30:16,351 --> 02:30:21,690
will completely back all I want to see

3612
02:30:18,959 --> 02:30:23,699
the science talk is talk [ __ ] is

3613
02:30:21,690 --> 02:30:26,101
[ __ ] we see more [ __ ] in this

3614
02:30:23,700 --> 02:30:28,650
industry and have for decades so that's

3615
02:30:26,101 --> 02:30:31,920
why we look for science now to separate

3616
02:30:28,649 --> 02:30:33,119
the wheat from the chaff so I mean you

3617
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:34,799
know I look forward to seeing the

3618
02:30:33,120 --> 02:30:37,650
science because from the talk the

3619
02:30:34,799 --> 02:30:39,840
science apparently is there and science

3620
02:30:37,649 --> 02:30:42,239
should actually back it up right now I

3621
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:43,979
just do oh go ahead I'm just gonna say

3622
02:30:42,239 --> 02:30:47,039
to and on that note you know I mean just

3623
02:30:43,979 --> 02:30:49,229
kind of hearing kind of I guess I'm a

3624
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:51,240
little kind of new to you know some of

3625
02:30:49,229 --> 02:30:53,310
some of the you know kind of back and

3626
02:30:51,239 --> 02:30:55,021
forth about the soil balance and kind of

3627
02:30:53,310 --> 02:30:57,449
you know that whole conversation and and

3628
02:30:55,021 --> 02:30:58,891
you know but but I mean that's that's

3629
02:30:57,450 --> 02:31:01,170
the thing you know the science on its

3630
02:30:58,890 --> 02:31:03,181
own you know has to step up

3631
02:31:01,170 --> 02:31:05,190
significantly also it's like there's a

3632
02:31:03,181 --> 02:31:07,380
lot of you know quote science and

3633
02:31:05,190 --> 02:31:08,700
analytical labs doing testing but

3634
02:31:07,379 --> 02:31:11,459
there's also a lot of kind of

3635
02:31:08,700 --> 02:31:13,829
inconsistency and inability to compare

3636
02:31:11,459 --> 02:31:15,959
apples to apples from with an analytical

3637
02:31:13,829 --> 02:31:17,340
lab community you know and so for what

3638
02:31:15,959 --> 02:31:19,500
it's worth we're you know we're really

3639
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:21,659
excited kind of here in California and

3640
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:23,459
how kind of California following Oregon

3641
02:31:21,659 --> 02:31:24,810
and how Oregon kind of you know really

3642
02:31:23,459 --> 02:31:26,939
set the standard in a bit of a way

3643
02:31:24,810 --> 02:31:29,459
because you know unlike Colorado in

3644
02:31:26,940 --> 02:31:31,620
Washington you know who kind of you know

3645
02:31:29,459 --> 02:31:33,750
kind of set the path in regulation and

3646
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:35,550
how kind of lab testing and all that is

3647
02:31:33,750 --> 02:31:37,610
part of a regulated market you know in

3648
02:31:35,549 --> 02:31:39,810
Oregon you know what they did is they

3649
02:31:37,610 --> 02:31:41,489
realize that you know it's almost like

3650
02:31:39,810 --> 02:31:42,720
the chickens guarding the henhouse in a

3651
02:31:41,489 --> 02:31:45,479
bit of a way because it's like if if

3652
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:48,060
you're gonna have robust regulations on

3653
02:31:45,479 --> 02:31:50,279
people that are producing cannabis from

3654
02:31:48,060 --> 02:31:51,989
the farm level to producing extracts to

3655
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:53,730
making infused products you know you

3656
02:31:51,989 --> 02:31:55,799
almost have to have even stricter kind

3657
02:31:53,729 --> 02:31:57,629
of regulations on the labs and so kind

3658
02:31:55,799 --> 02:31:59,670
of you know in Oregon they basically

3659
02:31:57,629 --> 02:32:01,920
required labs you know that are doing

3660
02:31:59,670 --> 02:32:05,370
testing to not only you know to be

3661
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:07,530
Scalia of full ISO 17025 accreditation

3662
02:32:05,370 --> 02:32:09,630
on every single assay that they offered

3663
02:32:07,530 --> 02:32:12,659
the public but then off but then further

3664
02:32:09,629 --> 02:32:14,759
each lab has to go through routine kind

3665
02:32:12,659 --> 02:32:16,289
of proficiency testing on the state

3666
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:18,569
level to demonstrate that they're able

3667
02:32:16,290 --> 02:32:20,790
to do this you know repeatable and

3668
02:32:18,569 --> 02:32:23,010
accurate precise testing because you

3669
02:32:20,790 --> 02:32:24,900
know it's like if one lab if you know

3670
02:32:23,010 --> 02:32:26,430
they're kind of you know kind of testing

3671
02:32:24,899 --> 02:32:27,930
and showing you know they're they

3672
02:32:26,430 --> 02:32:29,639
haven't fully gone through method formal

3673
02:32:27,930 --> 02:32:32,189
method validation on the terpene run and

3674
02:32:29,639 --> 02:32:33,989
and you know they're they're not fully

3675
02:32:32,189 --> 02:32:36,329
code you know kind of resolving the

3676
02:32:33,989 --> 02:32:37,889
their peaks and having colu ting

3677
02:32:36,329 --> 02:32:40,170
terpenes or you know kind of miss

3678
02:32:37,889 --> 02:32:42,389
identifying compounds you know the data

3679
02:32:40,170 --> 02:32:44,489
kind of isn't able to be held up like I

3680
02:32:42,389 --> 02:32:46,978
was you know strong and comparable to

3681
02:32:44,489 --> 02:32:49,110
you know lab data in one area or another

3682
02:32:46,978 --> 02:32:51,119
area and so you know I think it's I

3683
02:32:49,110 --> 02:32:53,520
think progress within the industry is

3684
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:55,560
you know kind of really great and I

3685
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:57,420
think regulations you know kind of in

3686
02:32:55,559 --> 02:32:59,279
each state and the way each state's been

3687
02:32:57,420 --> 02:33:00,329
building off the last you know are gonna

3688
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:02,310
just if anything they're gonna

3689
02:33:00,329 --> 02:33:04,170
strengthen kind of the science and

3690
02:33:02,309 --> 02:33:06,149
analytics that people can use and trust

3691
02:33:04,170 --> 02:33:07,978
and kind of further dial and develop

3692
02:33:06,149 --> 02:33:11,219
what they're doing and you know the the

3693
02:33:07,978 --> 02:33:12,929
you know the strong shall persevere and

3694
02:33:11,219 --> 02:33:15,119
those that aren't able to kind of meet

3695
02:33:12,930 --> 02:33:17,340
the must or are gonna be not able to

3696
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:19,140
even sell their testing and so I think

3697
02:33:17,340 --> 02:33:21,389
it's gonna really step up the game for

3698
02:33:19,139 --> 02:33:23,250
everybody and it's going to you know

3699
02:33:21,389 --> 02:33:25,379
create strong kind of analytics that

3700
02:33:23,250 --> 02:33:27,540
then you know will be comparable from

3701
02:33:25,379 --> 02:33:29,399
you know state to state or lab to lab

3702
02:33:27,540 --> 02:33:31,170
you know and and I think I think

3703
02:33:29,399 --> 02:33:32,699
everybody welcome Zach and I think that

3704
02:33:31,170 --> 02:33:35,489
might be one of the biggest frustrations

3705
02:33:32,700 --> 02:33:37,260
across the entire community is like okay

3706
02:33:35,489 --> 02:33:38,879
this labs shows these numbers and that

3707
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:41,159
lab shows these numbers which labs full

3708
02:33:38,879 --> 02:33:42,899
of [ __ ] which labs right and if anything

3709
02:33:41,159 --> 02:33:45,149
it kind of creates some that massive

3710
02:33:42,899 --> 02:33:47,369
distrust from within the from across the

3711
02:33:45,149 --> 02:33:49,170
industry because nobody really knows you

3712
02:33:47,370 --> 02:33:50,670
know and and then you know there's a lot

3713
02:33:49,170 --> 02:33:52,829
of here saying you know everybody's got

3714
02:33:50,670 --> 02:33:54,478
you know team this lab or team that lab

3715
02:33:52,829 --> 02:33:56,700
you know and there's these loyalties but

3716
02:33:54,478 --> 02:33:59,129
it's like you know I think I think it'll

3717
02:33:56,700 --> 02:34:01,590
all kind of you know lay out accordingly

3718
02:33:59,129 --> 02:34:03,750
with testing rigs and and whenever that

3719
02:34:01,590 --> 02:34:06,059
happens you know Big Ups to any lab

3720
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:08,340
that's able to meet those those

3721
02:34:06,059 --> 02:34:10,019
requirements because you know no labs I

3722
02:34:08,340 --> 02:34:12,899
mean just like kind of cannabis industry

3723
02:34:10,020 --> 02:34:14,620
you know no crop has ever been regulated

3724
02:34:12,899 --> 02:34:16,930
as much as cannabis is about

3725
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:18,070
be in any agricultural sector in the

3726
02:34:16,930 --> 02:34:20,079
United States and I think it's gonna be

3727
02:34:18,069 --> 02:34:22,060
really fascinating what comes from it

3728
02:34:20,079 --> 02:34:24,489
but but also in the lab level you know

3729
02:34:22,060 --> 02:34:26,469
no lab has ever been regulated to where

3730
02:34:24,489 --> 02:34:28,810
they have to have such wide

3731
02:34:26,469 --> 02:34:30,729
accreditation on every aspect of their

3732
02:34:28,810 --> 02:34:32,799
service and then further proficiency

3733
02:34:30,729 --> 02:34:34,600
testing and so you know I think you know

3734
02:34:32,799 --> 02:34:37,090
those that you know well not only

3735
02:34:34,601 --> 02:34:39,819
further proficient or have to deal with

3736
02:34:37,090 --> 02:34:41,649
bulk testing on top of that because it's

3737
02:34:39,819 --> 02:34:44,170
no longer gonna be just a few of us

3738
02:34:41,649 --> 02:34:47,139
testing everyone's testing which means

3739
02:34:44,170 --> 02:34:49,540
your load is also and everybody's load

3740
02:34:47,139 --> 02:34:52,329
is gonna grow exponentially you know so

3741
02:34:49,540 --> 02:34:54,370
it's going to be a growth spurt all the

3742
02:34:52,329 --> 02:34:58,389
way around which is going to be entering

3743
02:34:54,370 --> 02:35:00,550
interestingly to see absolutely also you

3744
02:34:58,389 --> 02:35:02,739
know talking about labs as far as

3745
02:35:00,549 --> 02:35:05,829
testing of cannabinoids and turkeys and

3746
02:35:02,739 --> 02:35:07,569
all of that you know testing soil is is

3747
02:35:05,829 --> 02:35:09,851
incredible you know we're testing

3748
02:35:07,569 --> 02:35:11,979
biology of soil but are we testing the

3749
02:35:09,851 --> 02:35:14,260
Sociology at the soil are we testing

3750
02:35:11,979 --> 02:35:15,639
what happens you know when you put it

3751
02:35:14,260 --> 02:35:16,989
into different environments as soon as

3752
02:35:15,639 --> 02:35:18,909
you take a soil out of one environment

3753
02:35:16,989 --> 02:35:21,489
and put it into a different environment

3754
02:35:18,909 --> 02:35:23,500
it changes and also you know just to add

3755
02:35:21,489 --> 02:35:26,920
we're dealing with an adaptogenic plant

3756
02:35:23,500 --> 02:35:29,459
so she's gonna outsmart us every single

3757
02:35:26,920 --> 02:35:31,810
time you know you can find different um

3758
02:35:29,459 --> 02:35:34,149
tests results on different parts of the

3759
02:35:31,810 --> 02:35:36,101
plant right like top to bottom inside

3760
02:35:34,149 --> 02:35:38,289
outside what what have you found on that

3761
02:35:36,101 --> 02:35:39,670
Alec so much of that I mean from what we

3762
02:35:38,290 --> 02:35:41,380
see so much of that has to do with like

3763
02:35:39,670 --> 02:35:42,940
cultivation method with the way the

3764
02:35:41,379 --> 02:35:45,069
plants are pruned you know if you got

3765
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:46,780
like a 14 foot tall outdoor plant that's

3766
02:35:45,069 --> 02:35:49,119
never been pruned and it's just

3767
02:35:46,780 --> 02:35:51,190
completely shading any light from you

3768
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:53,320
know exposing within the canopy you know

3769
02:35:51,190 --> 02:35:55,480
yeah we can we can see from one part of

3770
02:35:53,319 --> 02:35:58,690
the bud or one part you know the plant

3771
02:35:55,479 --> 02:36:00,909
to you know top buds you know say 10 12

3772
02:35:58,690 --> 02:36:04,120
percent variance from bud bud but

3773
02:36:00,909 --> 02:36:06,430
whenever we see you know very effective

3774
02:36:04,120 --> 02:36:08,950
kind of you know kind of you know

3775
02:36:06,430 --> 02:36:11,260
management of kind of canopy and you

3776
02:36:08,950 --> 02:36:12,820
know kind of pruning you know and you

3777
02:36:11,260 --> 02:36:14,469
know helping to expose light to all

3778
02:36:12,819 --> 02:36:16,420
areas of the plant you know all of a

3779
02:36:14,469 --> 02:36:18,189
sudden gets the point where you know we

3780
02:36:16,420 --> 02:36:20,139
see tremendously less variance you know

3781
02:36:18,190 --> 02:36:23,200
let you know kind of you know with a

3782
02:36:20,139 --> 02:36:25,420
couple percent plus or minus you know at

3783
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:27,190
the most and and you know and so much of

3784
02:36:25,420 --> 02:36:28,568
that also depends on whether or not it's

3785
02:36:27,190 --> 02:36:30,550
grown indoor or outdoor

3786
02:36:28,568 --> 02:36:32,769
there's no mimicking the Sun you know

3787
02:36:30,549 --> 02:36:34,658
and so distance traveled from the Sun to

3788
02:36:32,770 --> 02:36:36,369
get to the bud whether its top or middle

3789
02:36:34,658 --> 02:36:38,288
bottom you know it's very little

3790
02:36:36,369 --> 02:36:40,088
difference you know so then it's so much

3791
02:36:38,289 --> 02:36:42,520
of it is about how you're pruning and

3792
02:36:40,088 --> 02:36:45,100
growing your plants as opposed to indoor

3793
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:47,050
you know where every foot below the bulb

3794
02:36:45,100 --> 02:36:49,270
is such an exponential loss in lumens

3795
02:36:47,049 --> 02:36:51,698
that you know kind of you know it

3796
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:53,828
compounds you know especially then on

3797
02:36:51,699 --> 02:36:56,319
how well the canopy is kind of grown out

3798
02:36:53,828 --> 02:36:58,510
or you know or completely forested you

3799
02:36:56,318 --> 02:37:00,939
know then you know we see much higher

3800
02:36:58,510 --> 02:37:03,189
variance I guess in those cases whenever

3801
02:37:00,939 --> 02:37:05,498
something's indoor and and you know

3802
02:37:03,189 --> 02:37:08,078
grown under HID lighting and and then

3803
02:37:05,498 --> 02:37:09,488
not pruned well so but but but but on

3804
02:37:08,078 --> 02:37:10,719
the you know just wrapping the point you

3805
02:37:09,488 --> 02:37:12,549
know but then like same thing with

3806
02:37:10,719 --> 02:37:14,318
indoor whenever people are using like

3807
02:37:12,549 --> 02:37:16,118
double and involve technology and or

3808
02:37:14,318 --> 02:37:18,368
have a really effective kind of pruning

3809
02:37:16,119 --> 02:37:19,810
and you know keeping of their plants and

3810
02:37:18,369 --> 02:37:22,239
how they haircut and do all the things

3811
02:37:19,809 --> 02:37:24,100
you know then like we see like almost no

3812
02:37:22,238 --> 02:37:26,828
variance from you know small to middle

3813
02:37:24,100 --> 02:37:28,180
to bottom or you know to talk but but so

3814
02:37:26,828 --> 02:37:29,918
much that's how you know people are

3815
02:37:28,180 --> 02:37:31,779
growing their plants and you know kind

3816
02:37:29,918 --> 02:37:33,998
of ongoing week you know and actively

3817
02:37:31,779 --> 02:37:35,918
taking care of pruning and such now

3818
02:37:33,998 --> 02:37:38,529
going back to the lab thing in regards

3819
02:37:35,918 --> 02:37:40,568
to you know a lab makes a mistake or has

3820
02:37:38,529 --> 02:37:42,908
it has an error occur and it's like it's

3821
02:37:40,568 --> 02:37:44,528
true people really like it's not like

3822
02:37:42,908 --> 02:37:46,828
being a weatherman where you can be

3823
02:37:44,529 --> 02:37:49,449
wrong half the time like it's like

3824
02:37:46,828 --> 02:37:52,449
having that those little differences

3825
02:37:49,449 --> 02:37:54,970
really causes this sort of like doubt in

3826
02:37:52,449 --> 02:37:56,709
the community distrust and it's you're

3827
02:37:54,969 --> 02:37:59,978
right you see them picking sides and

3828
02:37:56,709 --> 02:38:02,168
welcome back to chimera lets you chimera

3829
02:37:59,978 --> 02:38:04,748
yeah why I mean I had to come back to

3830
02:38:02,168 --> 02:38:15,459
clear my name from being super Sam did

3831
02:38:04,748 --> 02:38:17,049
we smell what did we say yeah I mean I

3832
02:38:15,459 --> 02:38:19,270
just don't I don't think I would being

3833
02:38:17,049 --> 02:38:20,108
aggressive I think I'm just I like to

3834
02:38:19,270 --> 02:38:23,319
call it like it is

3835
02:38:20,109 --> 02:38:25,300
oh dude listen everyone in the chat if I

3836
02:38:23,318 --> 02:38:27,338
didn't see one person going [ __ ] chimera

3837
02:38:25,299 --> 02:38:29,168
I think one purpose person might have

3838
02:38:27,338 --> 02:38:31,988
said that it was a bit pompous but you

3839
02:38:29,168 --> 02:38:34,510
had most people behind you so well yeah

3840
02:38:31,988 --> 02:38:37,288
it's not it's not about popular opinion

3841
02:38:34,510 --> 02:38:39,908
I'm just like I gotta say my piece

3842
02:38:37,289 --> 02:38:41,569
whether it's popular or not so I

3843
02:38:39,908 --> 02:38:44,449
appreciate it but

3844
02:38:41,568 --> 02:38:50,709
if you know what's his name speaks for

3845
02:38:44,449 --> 02:38:50,710
the trees you speak for the science yeah

3846
02:38:51,430 --> 02:38:56,180
country you get to speak for the science

3847
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:59,840
I take that as a huge compliment and you

3848
02:38:56,180 --> 02:39:01,760
know I really again it's it's nothing

3849
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:03,469
against Indra I don't I don't have a

3850
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:05,840
thing for Indra I don't have a hay dog

3851
02:39:03,469 --> 02:39:08,299
for him in any way it's just at a

3852
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:10,130
certain point I mean it's like it could

3853
02:39:08,299 --> 02:39:12,228
be a car it could be a grow light it

3854
02:39:10,129 --> 02:39:14,209
could be anything you know when the guy

3855
02:39:12,228 --> 02:39:16,608
that's pushing the technology and he's

3856
02:39:14,209 --> 02:39:19,278
got a vested interest in him is the one

3857
02:39:16,609 --> 02:39:21,800
that saying trust me you got to take my

3858
02:39:19,279 --> 02:39:23,600
word for it no you can't see any results

3859
02:39:21,799 --> 02:39:26,438
and no you can't have any seen the

3860
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:28,939
process I mean it's a little bit too

3861
02:39:26,439 --> 02:39:31,670
Wizard of Oz for me you know and it made

3862
02:39:28,939 --> 02:39:34,670
it a little bit too Barnum &amp; Bailey yeah

3863
02:39:31,670 --> 02:39:36,648
and the honest there's no sort shortage

3864
02:39:34,670 --> 02:39:38,539
of Vardhaman Bailey's in this business

3865
02:39:36,648 --> 02:39:42,379
right then we're at the point now where

3866
02:39:38,539 --> 02:39:47,680
we're a transition from stoner lore and

3867
02:39:42,379 --> 02:39:49,908
claims to science-based evidence right I

3868
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:52,818
think we got to move into that world and

3869
02:39:49,908 --> 02:39:55,100
embrace that world and not take it as an

3870
02:39:52,818 --> 02:39:57,799
insult or criticism when someone says

3871
02:39:55,100 --> 02:40:00,140
hey justify your claims hey show us how

3872
02:39:57,799 --> 02:40:01,728
you're doing it or you know even if it's

3873
02:40:00,139 --> 02:40:04,849
a patented machine or whatever like I

3874
02:40:01,728 --> 02:40:05,478
don't care replicatable sign stands on

3875
02:40:04,850 --> 02:40:07,908
its own

3876
02:40:05,478 --> 02:40:10,368
it's not enough to just sit over here

3877
02:40:07,908 --> 02:40:13,068
it's not it's not enough to say take my

3878
02:40:10,369 --> 02:40:15,229
word for it and buy my [ __ ] right at

3879
02:40:13,068 --> 02:40:15,799
least it's not enough for me wait a

3880
02:40:15,228 --> 02:40:20,148
minute

3881
02:40:15,799 --> 02:40:22,340
I copyrighted bro science tell me it's a

3882
02:40:20,148 --> 02:40:28,010
waste of time enough to say take my word

3883
02:40:22,340 --> 02:40:30,350
for it yeah well that's why we love you

3884
02:40:28,010 --> 02:40:32,568
chimera because you just say it how it

3885
02:40:30,350 --> 02:40:34,970
is I've always appreciated it I've known

3886
02:40:32,568 --> 02:40:37,248
you friggin God it's gotta be twenty

3887
02:40:34,969 --> 02:40:40,698
years which is or 18 or 19 years that's

3888
02:40:37,248 --> 02:40:43,158
a long time where does one get rainbows

3889

3891
02:40:45,109 --> 02:40:52,270
laughed my head off what did you say

3892
02:40:47,350 --> 02:40:52,270

wholesale rainbows it's kind of today

3898
02:41:06,189 --> 02:41:10,120
what the whole episode was really to be

3904
02:41:17,978 --> 02:41:21,818
you're in a room full of people who tend

3905
02:41:19,750 --> 02:41:23,680
to know their [ __ ] to us to it to a

3906
02:41:21,818 --> 02:41:24,309
certain level I have someone at my door

3907
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:28,120

3908
02:41:24,309 --> 02:41:32,459
all continue I will be back anyway

3909
02:41:28,120 --> 02:41:34,450
Vader's watching you know I like I like

3910
02:41:32,459 --> 02:41:36,219
like I like the things that he's done

3911
02:41:34,450 --> 02:41:39,159
and I want to believe in his technology

3912
02:41:36,219 --> 02:41:40,659
and if he's got it and he's doing it

3913
02:41:39,159 --> 02:41:43,270
then that's awesome you know I encourage

3914
02:41:40,659 --> 02:41:46,809
them to do that but at a certain point

3915
02:41:43,270 --> 02:41:48,100
I'm you know we all got to stand up and

3916
02:41:46,809 --> 02:41:49,778
show we're doing it we want people to

3917
02:41:48,100 --> 02:41:51,880
buy in and we're not talking about small

3918
02:41:49,779 --> 02:41:56,020
buy-ins here I mean these are like 50

3919
02:41:51,879 --> 02:41:57,369
hundred thousand dollar machines so when

3920
02:41:56,020 --> 02:41:57,670
people are gonna lay down that kind of

3921
02:41:57,370 --> 02:42:00,069
money

3922
02:41:57,670 --> 02:42:01,210
that's okay they ask questions and you

3923
02:42:00,068 --> 02:42:07,180
know you don't just have to take

3924
02:42:01,209 --> 02:42:08,469
somebody else's word for it anyhow hey

3925
02:42:07,180 --> 02:42:13,500
come here will you be at the emerald-cut

3926
02:42:08,469 --> 02:42:13,500
I hope so I hope I'll be down there man

3927
02:42:16,290 --> 02:42:20,410
come on

3928
02:42:17,469 --> 02:42:23,260
not yet no not yet but you know I'm

3929
02:42:20,409 --> 02:42:24,728
around I thought for sure that yeah we

3930
02:42:23,260 --> 02:42:25,659
had you're on a panel let me double

3931
02:42:24,728 --> 02:42:29,409
check that I'll get back to you this

3932
02:42:25,659 --> 02:42:31,809
afternoon yeah I was just down there

3933
02:42:29,409 --> 02:42:35,680
actually was just down in San Diego and

3934
02:42:31,809 --> 02:42:37,148
La checking out these this new fluence

3935
02:42:35,680 --> 02:42:38,260
lighting technology I don't know if you

3936
02:42:37,148 --> 02:42:39,728
guys have heard of these things

3937
02:42:38,260 --> 02:42:42,579
yeah you know that so we were just

3938
02:42:39,728 --> 02:42:44,619
checking out and I was I was just kind

3939
02:42:42,579 --> 02:42:47,620
of speaking to some of the LED stuff an

3940
02:42:44,620 --> 02:42:49,630
owl where it was an office of it where

3941
02:42:47,620 --> 02:42:53,590
it's come and you know fluence is

3942
02:42:49,629 --> 02:42:55,778
actually on the on the tear of some of

3943
02:42:53,590 --> 02:42:58,870
the lighting I've seen and I know people

3944
02:42:55,779 --> 02:43:01,600
that have been utilizing that are kind

3945
02:42:58,870 --> 02:43:03,040
of actually going to be pretty

3946
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:04,840
comparative to you know some of the

3947
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:06,640
highest and hid

3948
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:08,500
lighting you know and so I mean I

3949
02:43:06,639 --> 02:43:10,299
haven't seen it personally through kind

3950
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:12,549
of you know running a girl on my own

3951
02:43:10,299 --> 02:43:14,170
with it and so I'm you know just I've

3952
02:43:12,549 --> 02:43:16,750
just I've historically been very

3953
02:43:14,170 --> 02:43:19,148
skeptical about LED because I've seen

3954
02:43:16,750 --> 02:43:21,430
kind of where it started you know and

3955
02:43:19,148 --> 02:43:23,170
and how much promise there was with it

3956
02:43:21,430 --> 02:43:25,180
and whenever there was a lot of you know

3957
02:43:23,170 --> 02:43:27,790
over promise and under delivering I

3958
02:43:25,180 --> 02:43:29,260
guess but but yeah I mean from people I

3959
02:43:27,790 --> 02:43:32,500
know that are actively riding fluence

3960
02:43:29,260 --> 02:43:34,960
they're stoked and and apparently yeah

3961
02:43:32,500 --> 02:43:37,120
it's crushing yeah the flowers listen I

3962
02:43:34,959 --> 02:43:40,569
went to a facility these med man guys

3963
02:43:37,120 --> 02:43:42,130
I'm you know this med men crew down no

3964
02:43:40,569 --> 02:43:46,569
it wouldn't checked out their show in

3965
02:43:42,129 --> 02:43:48,009
Burbank and or Sun Valley or whatever it

3966
02:43:46,569 --> 02:43:49,779
is but it was I mean it was it was

3967
02:43:48,010 --> 02:43:52,648
pretty cool they got they got these

3968
02:43:49,780 --> 02:43:55,329
stacked systems they're doing with like

3969
02:43:52,648 --> 02:43:57,159
these these racks essentially like it's

3970
02:43:55,329 --> 02:43:58,959
vertical farming style with a couple of

3971
02:43:57,159 --> 02:44:02,500
couple of layers of flat gardens under

3972
02:43:58,959 --> 02:44:05,398
LEDs and more kind of CM green type yeah

3973
02:44:02,500 --> 02:44:07,569
it's all see green stacked and packed

3974
02:44:05,398 --> 02:44:10,869
really beautiful bedroom really

3975
02:44:07,569 --> 02:44:12,159
beautiful you know moms and I really

3976
02:44:10,870 --> 02:44:13,720
like the production setup and they're

3977
02:44:12,159 --> 02:44:15,700
the flowering rooms they were you know

3978
02:44:13,719 --> 02:44:17,409
they were they're not bad they were

3979
02:44:15,700 --> 02:44:18,490
listen they're producing beautiful

3980
02:44:17,409 --> 02:44:21,189
flowers don't get me wrong

3981
02:44:18,489 --> 02:44:24,879
yeah but I happen to go to Denver after

3982
02:44:21,189 --> 02:44:27,970
it and saw some old friends down there

3983
02:44:24,879 --> 02:44:29,920
and they're really killing it using

3984
02:44:27,969 --> 02:44:31,510
these you know the doubly old double

3985
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:34,120
ended technology which because it's not

3986
02:44:31,510 --> 02:44:36,010
at all but the kavita double Enders way

3987
02:44:34,120 --> 02:44:37,540
up high in the ceilings amazing like the

3988
02:44:36,010 --> 02:44:39,630
size of the flowers was just no

3989
02:44:37,540 --> 02:44:42,729
comparison

3990
02:44:39,629 --> 02:44:44,949
right so when it came on the market it

3991
02:44:42,728 --> 02:44:46,478
was like wow it just does day kind of

3992
02:44:44,950 --> 02:44:48,430
really changed the game on its own and

3993
02:44:46,478 --> 02:44:50,349
lighting I feel like one of her it came

3994
02:44:48,430 --> 02:44:51,970
online and so just you know thinking

3995
02:44:50,350 --> 02:44:53,680
about something that can compare I mean

3996
02:44:51,969 --> 02:44:55,329
it's cool if LED can but I mean I just

3997
02:44:53,680 --> 02:44:57,370
haven't seen anything comparative like

3998
02:44:55,329 --> 02:44:58,689
what double-under can do yeah well it's

3999
02:44:57,370 --> 02:44:59,859
one day they'll be a new lighting

4000
02:44:58,689 --> 02:45:01,720
technology and you know we're always

4001
02:44:59,859 --> 02:45:02,470
gonna be skeptic because that's what

4002
02:45:01,719 --> 02:45:03,569
happens when you got an

4003
02:45:02,469 --> 02:45:06,819
industry-standard

4004
02:45:03,569 --> 02:45:08,680
someone comes in with a new technology

4005
02:45:06,819 --> 02:45:12,459
whether it's disruptive or it's just

4006
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:13,840
it's just a new thing you know and but

4007
02:45:12,459 --> 02:45:16,779
you know it's so much of it to you know

4008
02:45:13,840 --> 02:45:18,130
because I really appreciate kinda led to

4009
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:19,840
just because the temperature

4010
02:45:18,129 --> 02:45:21,699
control but you know so much of you know

4011
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:23,260
I mean 80% of so much success you know

4012
02:45:21,700 --> 02:45:25,060
in cultivation is gonna be in the

4013
02:45:23,260 --> 02:45:28,120
environment created you know less than

4014
02:45:25,059 --> 02:45:29,590
one single factor or another well that's

4015
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:31,540
the thing right it's like you when you

4016
02:45:29,590 --> 02:45:33,489
go into these new these rooms that it's

4017
02:45:31,540 --> 02:45:35,620
like the growers doing it one way and

4018
02:45:33,489 --> 02:45:38,319
that you gotta be able to how can you

4019
02:45:35,620 --> 02:45:39,880
tease apart the effect of the light

4020
02:45:38,319 --> 02:45:42,520
versus the effect of the cultivation

4021
02:45:39,879 --> 02:45:45,129
environment when you can do it every day

4022
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:47,050
it's hard for you to be able to say this

4023
02:45:45,129 --> 02:45:49,929
but just do the light this much is do

4024
02:45:47,049 --> 02:45:51,159
the soil as much as due to you know the

4025
02:45:49,930 --> 02:45:54,130
environment and all that kind of stuff

4026
02:45:51,159 --> 02:45:56,950
so it's it's a it's not an easy thing to

4027
02:45:54,129 --> 02:45:58,389
to that and try to figure out if you're

4028
02:45:56,950 --> 02:46:00,820
gonna switch so really what you got to

4029
02:45:58,389 --> 02:46:02,859
do is take take some lights set up your

4030
02:46:00,819 --> 02:46:04,569
own experiment on a side-by-side and

4031
02:46:02,860 --> 02:46:06,520
then you know you can control the

4032
02:46:04,569 --> 02:46:09,909
variables the control and vary the

4033
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:11,920
lights and then standing and make slow

4034
02:46:09,909 --> 02:46:13,898
changes yeah doing stuff at my sides

4035
02:46:11,920 --> 02:46:15,159
within not just a bunch of radical

4036
02:46:13,898 --> 02:46:16,869
changes you know because then it's

4037
02:46:15,159 --> 02:46:19,180
really hard to exactly to kind of

4038
02:46:16,870 --> 02:46:21,640
discern which individual thing is making

4039
02:46:19,180 --> 02:46:22,720
the huge difference and well that's you

4040
02:46:21,639 --> 02:46:24,879
know that's one of the reasons I got so

4041
02:46:22,719 --> 02:46:26,949
much love for SC is it's like to me it's

4042
02:46:24,879 --> 02:46:29,079
all about the lab right what are the

4043
02:46:26,950 --> 02:46:31,120
numbers coming out on the conservation

4044
02:46:29,079 --> 02:46:32,559
at the end like I don't I don't just

4045
02:46:31,120 --> 02:46:34,649
want to see the grow I want to take the

4046
02:46:32,559 --> 02:46:39,100
flowers to SC and have them test it

4047
02:46:34,648 --> 02:46:40,389
right you have to you otherwise you're

4048
02:46:39,100 --> 02:46:42,270
not getting the data right you're not

4049
02:46:40,389 --> 02:46:45,159
really understanding what's happening

4050
02:46:42,270 --> 02:46:47,110
cuz flat you know biomass is one measure

4051
02:46:45,159 --> 02:46:49,600
right but if you're pumping out a bunch

4052
02:46:47,110 --> 02:46:51,579
of flower that's not that's not high oil

4053
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:54,450
it's not high can happen it's it's got

4054
02:46:51,579 --> 02:46:56,530
no flavor I mean that's not what I want

4055
02:46:54,450 --> 02:46:58,720
you know we want them y'all want the

4056
02:46:56,530 --> 02:47:05,290
goods everybody wants the diddly dankes

4057
02:46:58,719 --> 02:47:07,389
so thank you for bringing up that point

4058
02:47:05,290 --> 02:47:08,860
right there with you man I just want to

4059
02:47:07,389 --> 02:47:10,389
see some proof want to see some more I'm

4060
02:47:08,860 --> 02:47:11,229
trying to make a career out of this and

4061
02:47:10,389 --> 02:47:14,139
I want to use the best equipment

4062
02:47:11,228 --> 02:47:15,728
possible and just hear about it and see

4063
02:47:14,139 --> 02:47:17,319
the same two pictures for the last year

4064
02:47:15,728 --> 02:47:19,559
and a half and it's been kind of

4065
02:47:17,319 --> 02:47:21,670
frustrating especially if it is a

4066
02:47:19,559 --> 02:47:23,949
game-changing revolutionary new piece of

4067
02:47:21,670 --> 02:47:25,180
equipment I'd want access to it and I'd

4068
02:47:23,950 --> 02:47:26,920
want to know more about how it works

4069
02:47:25,180 --> 02:47:28,840
before investing the money and buying

4070
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:31,120
that equipment yeah and yeah I mean

4071
02:47:28,840 --> 02:47:31,729
you're sitting there live on TV showing

4072
02:47:31,120 --> 02:47:34,730
everybody

4073
02:47:31,729 --> 02:47:36,529
actually what you're doing right there's

4074
02:47:34,729 --> 02:47:43,460
no magic boxes at this point in time

4075
02:47:36,530 --> 02:47:47,271
right it's like an Avengers in a place

4076
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:48,800
we can share this stuff people it's just

4077
02:47:47,271 --> 02:47:50,870
been a long time to not have that stuff

4078
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:52,880
shared yeah I think what happened really

4079
02:47:50,870 --> 02:47:54,500
to be perfectly honest isn't he you know

4080
02:47:52,880 --> 02:47:56,359
you know I was like are you listening he

4081
02:47:54,500 --> 02:47:58,190
did all the work and I'm sure he built

4082
02:47:56,360 --> 02:48:00,681
one of these things like Marcus said was

4083
02:47:58,190 --> 02:48:02,961
able to run the oil the the hempseed for

4084
02:48:00,681 --> 02:48:04,461
oil and and all that kind of stuff and

4085
02:48:02,960 --> 02:48:06,380
that's great and you know he built the

4086
02:48:04,460 --> 02:48:08,510
technology and they went got the patents

4087
02:48:06,380 --> 02:48:09,829
and secured that all and that's that's

4088
02:48:08,511 --> 02:48:11,890
awesome if that's you know it's

4089
02:48:09,829 --> 02:48:14,960
fantastic if that's that's the way it is

4090
02:48:11,890 --> 02:48:16,460
but um at a certain point in time when

4091
02:48:14,960 --> 02:48:17,720
he when it comes onto the market and

4092
02:48:16,460 --> 02:48:19,699
it's time when you're asking people to

4093
02:48:17,720 --> 02:48:22,011
drop fifty sixty a hundred thousand

4094
02:48:19,700 --> 02:48:23,961
dollars on a piece of equipment I mean

4095
02:48:22,011 --> 02:48:26,860
it's okay to be up for someone to be a

4096
02:48:23,960 --> 02:48:28,609
skeptic and say hey I want to know I

4097
02:48:26,860 --> 02:48:30,591
want to be able to look at you

4098
02:48:28,610 --> 02:48:33,021
technology and see that it's doing this

4099
02:48:30,591 --> 02:48:34,399
thing that you're say it's doing I mean

4100
02:48:33,021 --> 02:48:36,860
it's not enough for me to show up with a

4101
02:48:34,399 --> 02:48:38,690
couple of pounds and somebody you know

4102
02:48:36,860 --> 02:48:46,250
disappears behind the Wizards curtain

4103
02:48:38,690 --> 02:48:47,989
comes back with the what's taking place

4104
02:48:46,250 --> 02:48:49,880
behind it we know what injury says is

4105
02:48:47,989 --> 02:48:51,021
taking place a lot of the things are

4106
02:48:49,880 --> 02:48:52,880
saying about the thermodynamic

4107
02:48:51,021 --> 02:48:54,980
efficiency of machine if it does operate

4108
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:56,210
in that way make sense to me is somebody

4109
02:48:54,979 --> 02:48:59,930
with a little background in engineering

4110
02:48:56,210 --> 02:49:02,090
but there's still no like actual proof

4111
02:48:59,931 --> 02:49:04,671
of it so that's been very excited to see

4112
02:49:02,091 --> 02:49:09,200
happen hopefully soon yeah me too and so

4113
02:49:04,671 --> 02:49:10,970
I hope I hope the shell down it Sheldon

4114
02:49:09,200 --> 02:49:12,200
as a client down in California that

4115
02:49:10,970 --> 02:49:14,329
that's apparently bought one of these

4116
02:49:12,200 --> 02:49:17,540
things and the last word I had was that

4117
02:49:14,329 --> 02:49:20,329
it was in delivery or to be delivered

4118
02:49:17,540 --> 02:49:22,160
and in process of being set up and when

4119
02:49:20,329 --> 02:49:23,450
that happens then you know maybe we'll

4120
02:49:22,159 --> 02:49:25,610
be able to go and have a look at machine

4121
02:49:23,450 --> 02:49:27,110
to see it in action and you know what

4122
02:49:25,610 --> 02:49:30,891
are the same thing from dr. scale down

4123
02:49:27,110 --> 02:49:32,810
and see or Tostig are gone yeah we're

4124
02:49:30,890 --> 02:49:34,550
all anxious to see I mean everybody

4125
02:49:32,810 --> 02:49:36,500
wants to see the new technology and if

4126
02:49:34,550 --> 02:49:37,310
it's the [ __ ] then I'll back it a

4127
02:49:36,500 --> 02:49:39,110
hundred percent

4128
02:49:37,310 --> 02:49:44,479
like I again I got yeah there's nothing

4129
02:49:39,110 --> 02:49:45,351
personal against exactly and that's

4130
02:49:44,479 --> 02:49:51,921
alright

4131
02:49:45,351 --> 02:49:53,780
wait for it to have no solvent for a run

4132
02:49:51,921 --> 02:49:55,011
there and to get back down to stereo

4133
02:49:53,780 --> 02:49:57,200
would be awesome would save a lot of

4134
02:49:55,011 --> 02:50:00,970
money and not having to recover and do

4135
02:49:57,200 --> 02:50:00,971
distillation at the time it takes to add

4136
02:50:01,450 --> 02:50:06,200
yeah well there's efficiencies that come

4137
02:50:03,860 --> 02:50:09,261
when you're doing a batch process of

4138
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:11,240
that size right like I mean you know it

4139
02:50:09,261 --> 02:50:12,370
listened if it works I'm gonna be right

4140
02:50:11,239 --> 02:50:15,261
there behind am I really I'm not

4141
02:50:12,370 --> 02:50:20,780
absolutely nothing against Indra it's

4142
02:50:15,261 --> 02:50:23,060
just it always want to just always makes

4143
02:50:20,780 --> 02:50:25,280
me nervous man when it's like bicycle or

4144
02:50:23,060 --> 02:50:27,380
a car or running shoes or whatever when

4145
02:50:25,280 --> 02:50:29,620
someone says just take my word for it

4146
02:50:27,380 --> 02:50:32,300
and hand me over a big stack I mean I

4147
02:50:29,620 --> 02:50:35,721
don't think that's I don't think that's

4148
02:50:32,300 --> 02:50:37,760
unreasonable so anyway whatever I wish

4149
02:50:35,720 --> 02:50:39,229
him the best and I hope you I hope he

4150
02:50:37,761 --> 02:50:41,211
brings these machines to market and

4151
02:50:39,229 --> 02:50:44,421
kills it because if they're as good as

4152
02:50:41,210 --> 02:50:46,100
he says they are then no that's a big

4153
02:50:44,421 --> 02:50:50,530
win for a lot of people including him

4154
02:50:46,101 --> 02:50:50,530
and including the community so what's

4155
02:50:52,149 --> 02:50:57,171
this about again I really it's one of

4156
02:50:55,251 --> 02:50:59,300
the things I really like about Indra and

4157
02:50:57,171 --> 02:51:03,351
his machine is that he's thought about

4158
02:50:59,300 --> 02:51:04,790
all these safety issues right you know

4159
02:51:03,351 --> 02:51:06,081
what right back to when he first came on

4160
02:51:04,790 --> 02:51:07,550
the show and he was talking about the

4161
02:51:06,081 --> 02:51:09,409
rails with nitrogen I'm everybody

4162
02:51:07,550 --> 02:51:11,810
working in the with the separate oxygen

4163
02:51:09,409 --> 02:51:14,210
supply and you know I thought that

4164
02:51:11,810 --> 02:51:17,001
nitrogen thing in the room was a little

4165
02:51:14,210 --> 02:51:18,770
bit of brilliance like to stop the you

4166
02:51:17,001 --> 02:51:20,421
know to displace the oxygen so that if

4167
02:51:18,771 --> 02:51:21,650
you have a if you have a Fault in the

4168
02:51:20,421 --> 02:51:25,370
system that you're not going to have a

4169
02:51:21,649 --> 02:51:29,659
catastrophic failure and same with his

4170
02:51:25,370 --> 02:51:31,251
tuning fork his tuning forks which again

4171
02:51:29,659 --> 02:51:34,630
I thought that was a really beautiful

4172
02:51:31,251 --> 02:51:37,220
solution to to a complicated problem so

4173
02:51:34,630 --> 02:51:38,630
you know let's not make it like I'm

4174
02:51:37,220 --> 02:51:40,069
cutting down in tune or trying to be

4175
02:51:38,630 --> 02:51:43,251
aggressive with them I'm not I'm just

4176
02:51:40,069 --> 02:51:45,921
you know I I think that we did meet we

4177
02:51:43,251 --> 02:51:48,110
all need to move into a world where when

4178
02:51:45,921 --> 02:51:51,291
you're when you're putting up claims and

4179
02:51:48,110 --> 02:51:53,569
let's be honest these claims have health

4180
02:51:51,290 --> 02:51:55,850
implications for implications on

4181
02:51:53,569 --> 02:51:57,119
people's health right with residual

4182
02:51:55,851 --> 02:52:00,029
solvents and

4183
02:51:57,119 --> 02:52:02,248
you know all the chemistry that's going

4184
02:52:00,029 --> 02:52:04,529
on inside the process like Sam was

4185
02:52:02,248 --> 02:52:08,369
saying Michelle Sexton just released a

4186
02:52:04,529 --> 02:52:10,078
paper on on co2 extraction and how you

4187
02:52:08,369 --> 02:52:11,969
know as Mark Sheldon has been saying for

4188
02:52:10,078 --> 02:52:14,728
a long time that there's chemistry that

4189
02:52:11,968 --> 02:52:17,818
happens with cannabinoids and chirpings

4190
02:52:14,728 --> 02:52:19,259
and they undergo changes so that the the

4191
02:52:17,818 --> 02:52:22,078
profiles that come out of the

4192
02:52:19,259 --> 02:52:25,738
concentrates are different than the

4193
02:52:22,078 --> 02:52:26,998
profiles of the flower right and so when

4194
02:52:25,738 --> 02:52:28,708
people are taking this stuff and

4195
02:52:26,998 --> 02:52:31,378
throwing it on a nail or inhaling it

4196
02:52:28,709 --> 02:52:33,929
into their lungs I mean it's it's it's

4197
02:52:31,379 --> 02:52:37,499
only right that we ask those questions

4198
02:52:33,929 --> 02:52:40,078
and we're able to see the results you

4199
02:52:37,498 --> 02:52:41,998
know through services like SC labs I

4200
02:52:40,078 --> 02:52:45,478
mean that's what this community has

4201
02:52:41,998 --> 02:52:47,158
become right it's it's were worried you

4202
02:52:45,478 --> 02:52:49,708
know as D'Angelo says we're out of the

4203
02:52:47,158 --> 02:52:51,868
shadows and into the light and sometimes

4204
02:52:49,709 --> 02:52:54,088
we're under the the microscope like you

4205
02:52:51,869 --> 02:52:57,179
know and that's okay yeah you know in

4206
02:52:54,088 --> 02:52:58,529
that kind of note to just with reference

4207
02:52:57,179 --> 02:52:59,998
to like Michelle sexton's paper you know

4208
02:52:58,529 --> 02:53:01,619
it's really fascinating because I mean

4209
02:52:59,998 --> 02:53:04,168
at this point I would kind of wish like

4210
02:53:01,619 --> 02:53:05,909
Mark scaled-down was on because I'm sure

4211
02:53:04,168 --> 02:53:08,968
he has some pretty good information on

4212
02:53:05,908 --> 02:53:10,588
this but you know a lot of you know we

4213
02:53:08,968 --> 02:53:12,418
see more and more you know people are

4214
02:53:10,588 --> 02:53:16,588
testing distillates you know and these

4215
02:53:12,418 --> 02:53:18,748
clear concentrates and so often you know

4216
02:53:16,588 --> 02:53:20,369
we'll see somebody send them in and then

4217
02:53:18,748 --> 02:53:23,279
this goes back to like the very

4218
02:53:20,369 --> 02:53:25,078
beginning first kind of clear type you

4219
02:53:23,279 --> 02:53:26,998
know kind of post processed extracts

4220
02:53:25,078 --> 02:53:29,429
that we tested that in the day with like

4221
02:53:26,998 --> 02:53:32,309
dr. gold you know if anybody remembers

4222
02:53:29,429 --> 02:53:34,619
that product you know kind of uh you

4223
02:53:32,309 --> 02:53:36,809
know these these clear extracts you know

4224
02:53:34,619 --> 02:53:39,659
oftentimes that are like super refined

4225
02:53:36,809 --> 02:53:42,708
that can test up to you know high you

4226
02:53:39,658 --> 02:53:45,988
know mid mid to high 90s in kind of

4227
02:53:42,709 --> 02:53:47,699
decarboxylated Delta 9 THC and those you

4228
02:53:45,988 --> 02:53:49,498
know there's very little to no terpenes

4229
02:53:47,699 --> 02:53:52,259
left because of the heat processing etc

4230
02:53:49,498 --> 02:53:55,289
etc but the very often times you know

4231
02:53:52,259 --> 02:53:57,748
with I mean it tremendously often we see

4232
02:53:55,289 --> 02:54:01,168
people sending in distillates that have

4233
02:53:57,748 --> 02:54:04,559
basically a lot of the delta-9 degraded

4234
02:54:01,168 --> 02:54:06,270
into delta 8 THC you know it'll kind of

4235
02:54:04,559 --> 02:54:08,968
go into you know there'll be significant

4236
02:54:06,270 --> 02:54:10,640
amounts of cbn but very often times -

4237
02:54:08,968 --> 02:54:12,680
you know it'll be you know the

4238
02:54:10,640 --> 02:54:15,109
kind of the cannabinoids work

4239
02:54:12,681 --> 02:54:16,880
quantifying you know which include Delta

4240
02:54:15,110 --> 02:54:19,641
eight you know there'll be like thirty

4241
02:54:16,879 --> 02:54:21,529
forty percent total cannabinoids but

4242
02:54:19,640 --> 02:54:23,869
then they'll be on a chromatogram all

4243
02:54:21,530 --> 02:54:25,761
kinds of these you know Peaks in all

4244
02:54:23,870 --> 02:54:27,200
these places that aren't kind of

4245
02:54:25,761 --> 02:54:29,301
cannabinoids were testing for and

4246
02:54:27,200 --> 02:54:32,061
they're kind of like breakdown products

4247
02:54:29,300 --> 02:54:34,039
ice tumors there's all these things

4248
02:54:32,060 --> 02:54:36,140
happening whenever people are using you

4249
02:54:34,040 --> 02:54:38,360
know kind of you know high heat in their

4250
02:54:36,140 --> 02:54:40,819
distillation process and also whenever

4251
02:54:38,360 --> 02:54:42,980
there's like shifts and pH in the

4252
02:54:40,819 --> 02:54:45,649
recirculating recycling solvent they're

4253
02:54:42,979 --> 02:54:48,109
using again so we noticed kind of these

4254
02:54:45,649 --> 02:54:49,970
kind of you know and and so then so then

4255
02:54:48,110 --> 02:54:52,880
we get a lot of [ __ ] from people they're

4256
02:54:49,970 --> 02:54:55,939
like this is impossible it tests twenty

4257
02:54:52,879 --> 02:54:57,979
to 40 percent cannabinoids and you guys

4258
02:54:55,940 --> 02:54:59,601
are clearly [ __ ] up you know but it's

4259
02:54:57,979 --> 02:55:01,430
like there's way too high of a

4260
02:54:59,601 --> 02:55:03,950
statistical kind of reality of what we

4261
02:55:01,431 --> 02:55:05,181
see in the data for it to be you know I

4262
02:55:03,950 --> 02:55:06,471
mean we're you know it's like you know

4263
02:55:05,181 --> 02:55:08,060
it's it's it's clear in the

4264
02:55:06,470 --> 02:55:10,100
chromatograph you know I mean we're not

4265
02:55:08,060 --> 02:55:11,119
quantifying these other compounds we

4266
02:55:10,101 --> 02:55:12,950
don't even necessarily know what these

4267
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:14,271
other compounds are but they're there

4268
02:55:12,950 --> 02:55:17,240
and they're being created as a byproduct

4269
02:55:14,271 --> 02:55:19,579
of a lot of high heat post-processing

4270
02:55:17,239 --> 02:55:21,409
all these kind of quote you know post

4271
02:55:19,579 --> 02:55:23,420
processes that are you know steps that

4272
02:55:21,409 --> 02:55:24,829
are being done to kind of either filter

4273
02:55:23,420 --> 02:55:27,379
you know attempts to filter out

4274
02:55:24,829 --> 02:55:29,209
pesticides or to kind of further clean

4275
02:55:27,379 --> 02:55:31,579
up and you know and make the product

4276
02:55:29,209 --> 02:55:33,890
more clear but but one thing you know

4277
02:55:31,579 --> 02:55:35,690
for sure is like there's the you know I

4278
02:55:33,890 --> 02:55:38,119
mean you know in in completely and

4279
02:55:35,690 --> 02:55:39,801
continued retesting and retesting of

4280
02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:41,990
these products it's like you know it's

4281
02:55:39,800 --> 02:55:44,420
the data stands you know and it's like

4282
02:55:41,989 --> 02:55:46,909
you know a lot of the a lot of the total

4283
02:55:44,420 --> 02:55:49,040
potential Delta 9 THC that could be

4284
02:55:46,909 --> 02:55:50,511
distilled in the process end up kind of

4285
02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:52,160
creating these other byproducts and so

4286
02:55:50,511 --> 02:55:54,710
what those byproducts are what the

4287
02:55:52,159 --> 02:55:56,450
medical efficacy this products are you

4288
02:55:54,709 --> 02:55:58,129
know is unknown but you know I'm very

4289
02:55:56,450 --> 02:56:00,920
curious about it because it's one of the

4290
02:55:58,129 --> 02:56:03,260
most kind of controversial topics that

4291
02:56:00,920 --> 02:56:05,360
we see kind of in those that we serve

4292
02:56:03,261 --> 02:56:06,829
you know that you know because more and

4293
02:56:05,360 --> 02:56:08,210
more people are getting you know

4294
02:56:06,829 --> 02:56:10,280
sometimes you know they're getting into

4295
02:56:08,209 --> 02:56:12,229
thin film or molecular distillation or

4296
02:56:10,280 --> 02:56:14,210
white film distillation you know they

4297
02:56:12,229 --> 02:56:16,011
don't of people have a lot of

4298
02:56:14,209 --> 02:56:17,899
substantial science kind of background

4299
02:56:16,011 --> 02:56:19,790
that are you know applying these these

4300
02:56:17,899 --> 02:56:22,100
tools to make distilling concentrates

4301
02:56:19,790 --> 02:56:24,210
but a lot of them don't and and it's

4302
02:56:22,101 --> 02:56:26,310
fascinating because stoner ingenuity and

4303
02:56:24,209 --> 02:56:27,929
and and you know it was very often kind

4304
02:56:26,309 --> 02:56:29,489
of stumbling into kind of you know

4305
02:56:27,930 --> 02:56:31,290
creating these very interesting

4306
02:56:29,489 --> 02:56:32,549
compounds and you know for a really long

4307
02:56:31,290 --> 02:56:34,170
time Delta a twist

4308
02:56:32,549 --> 02:56:36,329
neo considered not to have medicinal

4309
02:56:34,170 --> 02:56:38,100
benefits but you know more and more is

4310
02:56:36,329 --> 02:56:40,799
showing that there are all kinds of

4311
02:56:38,100 --> 02:56:42,840
different medicinal benefits and so it's

4312
02:56:40,799 --> 02:56:45,750
like well what are these other isomer

4313
02:56:42,840 --> 02:56:47,850
products being created and you know are

4314
02:56:45,750 --> 02:56:49,799
their benefit to them or you know is

4315
02:56:47,850 --> 02:56:51,540
there some potential detriment to them

4316
02:56:49,799 --> 02:56:54,929
you know I think a lot of that's unknown

4317
02:56:51,540 --> 02:56:57,060
it's totally unknown and it's you know I

4318
02:56:54,930 --> 02:56:58,860
think they got a you know we got to keep

4319
02:56:57,059 --> 02:57:02,609
in the context to is that they're paying

4320
02:56:58,860 --> 02:57:04,470
you guys a set fee for one task right

4321
02:57:02,610 --> 02:57:06,300
and sure you've got a margin built into

4322
02:57:04,469 --> 02:57:09,420
that fee which is normal for any

4323
02:57:06,299 --> 02:57:11,549
business but that doesn't mean that you

4324
02:57:09,420 --> 02:57:15,090
have to go it that you're expected to go

4325
02:57:11,549 --> 02:57:16,920
in and identify every single molecule

4326
02:57:15,090 --> 02:57:19,590
that's in their mixture I mean that's a

4327
02:57:16,920 --> 02:57:21,680
series of different tasks right and that

4328
02:57:19,590 --> 02:57:24,719
cost should be borne by the producer and

4329
02:57:21,680 --> 02:57:26,340
especially when it's a producer that's

4330
02:57:24,719 --> 02:57:28,559
putting something on the market for a

4331
02:57:26,340 --> 02:57:30,120
commercial purpose right right not to

4332
02:57:28,559 --> 02:57:31,709
know what's in your product right you

4333
02:57:30,120 --> 02:57:34,829
can't especially when you're doing all

4334
02:57:31,709 --> 02:57:36,239
this chemistry yet you have to know

4335
02:57:34,829 --> 02:57:40,260
what's in the final product that you're

4336
02:57:36,239 --> 02:57:41,639
putting it into people's hands and and I

4337
02:57:40,260 --> 02:57:43,409
think that's really missing in our

4338
02:57:41,639 --> 02:57:45,629
community a lot because everybody's used

4339
02:57:43,409 --> 02:57:47,369
to this situation where you grow it you

4340
02:57:45,629 --> 02:57:49,829
extract it you sell it you go on

4341
02:57:47,370 --> 02:57:52,829
vacation right then you know you think

4342
02:57:49,829 --> 02:57:55,049
you don't have to people aren't used to

4343
02:57:52,829 --> 02:57:58,049
being held accountable like every other

4344
02:57:55,049 --> 02:58:00,329
business in the world is right like you

4345
02:57:58,049 --> 02:58:02,189
have to be and and I don't think it's a

4346
02:58:00,329 --> 02:58:03,930
good point to because like now that you

4347
02:58:02,190 --> 02:58:05,520
know transparency and accountability is

4348
02:58:03,930 --> 02:58:08,130
kind of being demanded by the

4349
02:58:05,520 --> 02:58:10,170
marketplace and being somewhat forced by

4350
02:58:08,129 --> 02:58:12,089
regulation you know it's really kind of

4351
02:58:10,170 --> 02:58:13,649
it's not one of those things is like

4352
02:58:12,090 --> 02:58:15,870
what what you pay attention to you

4353
02:58:13,649 --> 02:58:17,850
become conscious of because you know for

4354
02:58:15,870 --> 02:58:20,490
the last decade you know a lot of really

4355
02:58:17,850 --> 02:58:22,710
well-intentioned extract artists and

4356
02:58:20,489 --> 02:58:25,020
people making extract have been so many

4357
02:58:22,709 --> 02:58:26,939
ways been peddling pesticides and tons

4358
02:58:25,020 --> 02:58:28,470
of contaminants and their extracts cuz

4359
02:58:26,940 --> 02:58:30,750
they're running these closed-loop

4360
02:58:28,469 --> 02:58:33,209
processes they're just running you know

4361
02:58:30,750 --> 02:58:35,430
material from any farmer or any broker

4362
02:58:33,209 --> 02:58:37,469
bringing them any material you know and

4363
02:58:35,430 --> 02:58:39,779
like you know one dudes bad habits or

4364
02:58:37,469 --> 02:58:41,849
you know choices and Mike you know

4365
02:58:39,779 --> 02:58:44,159
justifying and spraying systemic

4366
02:58:41,850 --> 02:58:45,779
pesticides and fungicides you know then

4367
02:58:44,159 --> 02:58:47,850
getting in the extraction process then

4368
02:58:45,779 --> 02:58:49,229
stay in the process and then without

4369
02:58:47,850 --> 02:58:51,779
your knowledge that you're kind of

4370
02:58:49,228 --> 02:58:53,909
putting out this fuego to the market you

4371
02:58:51,779 --> 02:58:56,970
know kind of justifying this super high

4372
02:58:53,909 --> 02:58:58,680
prices and getting them but but now I

4373
02:58:56,969 --> 02:59:00,358
think that you know people are demanding

4374
02:58:58,680 --> 02:59:01,889
testing and people are demanding

4375
02:59:00,359 --> 02:59:03,510
transparency and accountability it's

4376
02:59:01,889 --> 02:59:04,858
really it's really putting in on

4377
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:06,478
people's minds where it's like now that

4378
02:59:04,859 --> 02:59:08,790
you know what are you gonna do about it

4379
02:59:06,478 --> 02:59:10,379
you know it's like you know to you have

4380
02:59:08,790 --> 02:59:12,330
to kind of evolve your process but you

4381
02:59:10,379 --> 02:59:14,698
have to kind of you know do the due

4382
02:59:12,329 --> 02:59:16,439
diligence to you know ensure that while

4383
02:59:14,699 --> 02:59:18,750
you work you are putting on the market

4384
02:59:16,439 --> 02:59:20,520
is in fact kind of you know free clear

4385
02:59:18,750 --> 02:59:22,559
of a lot of these kind of harmful you

4386
02:59:20,520 --> 02:59:24,120
know pesticide considerations but but

4387
02:59:22,559 --> 02:59:25,559
yeah also kind of you know and I don't

4388
02:59:24,120 --> 02:59:27,899
necessarily know the answers to the

4389
02:59:25,559 --> 02:59:30,180
Delta a or the distillation kind of

4390
02:59:27,898 --> 02:59:32,608
isomerization type realities or what's

4391
02:59:30,180 --> 02:59:35,189
happening because you know I mean yeah

4392
02:59:32,609 --> 02:59:37,020
we're not set up you know like we're

4393
02:59:35,189 --> 02:59:39,510
we're set up as a you know throughput

4394
02:59:37,020 --> 02:59:41,279
analytical testing lab with the services

4395
02:59:39,510 --> 02:59:42,898
that we offer testing for the certain

4396
02:59:41,279 --> 02:59:44,819
compounds we're testing for it's like

4397
02:59:42,898 --> 02:59:46,738
are we missing compounds yeah I mean

4398
02:59:44,818 --> 02:59:48,448
there there are tons of more terpenes

4399
02:59:46,738 --> 02:59:50,068
that we can be testing for there are you

4400
02:59:48,449 --> 02:59:51,090
know like a lot of people are like why

4401
02:59:50,068 --> 02:59:53,430
don't you guys does stand for these

4402
02:59:51,090 --> 02:59:56,609
alcohol esters and flavonoids you know

4403
02:59:53,430 --> 02:59:59,340
or or you know how can you tell us more

4404
02:59:56,609 --> 03:00:00,870
about these these you know random Peaks

4405
02:59:59,340 --> 03:00:03,180
that are kind of being created as a

4406
03:00:00,870 --> 03:00:06,300
byproduct of you know heat process

4407
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:07,620
distillation or kind of shifts in pH you

4408
03:00:06,299 --> 03:00:10,259
know in this like well I mean we're not

4409
03:00:07,620 --> 03:00:12,390
dining that's that's not a sound like a

4410
03:00:10,260 --> 03:00:14,760
ten years ago when people were like all

4411
03:00:12,389 --> 03:00:17,579
right so you got THC so where's your

4412
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:21,090
pesticide testing so you know as we know

4413
03:00:17,579 --> 03:00:23,189
it's a step-by-step process and and what

4414
03:00:21,090 --> 03:00:25,020
I have to help with you know decade of

4415
03:00:23,189 --> 03:00:27,270
frustration of you know being a pioneer

4416
03:00:25,020 --> 03:00:30,420
in testing it's been nothing but a

4417
03:00:27,270 --> 03:00:32,279
challenge and the repeated reality is

4418
03:00:30,420 --> 03:00:34,139
you know people were like okay well okay

4419
03:00:32,279 --> 03:00:35,939
well now you've got this many pesticides

4420
03:00:34,139 --> 03:00:39,778
well do you have the full spectrum okay

4421
03:00:35,939 --> 03:00:43,109
really now you got 39 so do you have all

4422
03:00:39,779 --> 03:00:44,939
of them now yes oh no no one is ever

4423
03:00:43,109 --> 03:00:46,380
going to be satisfied and that's good

4424
03:00:44,939 --> 03:00:48,930
that's what we want that's the great

4425
03:00:46,379 --> 03:00:52,409
thing about where we are in this this

4426
03:00:48,930 --> 03:00:54,029
shot in time it's past us you know we

4427
03:00:52,409 --> 03:00:56,189
all wanted to see cannabis grow up and

4428
03:00:54,029 --> 03:00:57,270
be legal well now it is and now

4429
03:00:56,189 --> 03:01:00,449
everybody's bitching and complaining

4430
03:00:57,270 --> 03:01:02,939
about what's going on now that we're

4431
03:01:00,449 --> 03:01:04,890
here oh [ __ ] now it's being taxed well I

4432
03:01:02,939 --> 03:01:06,090
remember people saying Isaiah as long as

4433
03:01:04,889 --> 03:01:09,059
you're taxed it I don't care what

4434
03:01:06,090 --> 03:01:11,189
happens well now that it's being taxed

4435
03:01:09,059 --> 03:01:13,590
it's gonna be taxed and keeping the

4436
03:01:11,189 --> 03:01:15,479
benefits from it on top of that you have

4437
03:01:13,590 --> 03:01:18,000
to have testing because we have to be

4438
03:01:15,478 --> 03:01:20,579
considered like any other product on the

4439
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:22,680
market I am so thankful nowadays that I

4440
03:01:20,579 --> 03:01:25,109
will not be the only one bearing that

4441
03:01:22,680 --> 03:01:27,449
burden anymore that the entire state

4442
03:01:25,109 --> 03:01:30,840
will so that not only will they be

4443
03:01:27,449 --> 03:01:32,550
testing for the THC CBD etc they're also

4444
03:01:30,840 --> 03:01:35,549
gonna be testing for all the pesticides

4445
03:01:32,549 --> 03:01:38,188
and stuff like that which I'm watch I've

4446
03:01:35,549 --> 03:01:39,988
watched countless of vendors go all

4447
03:01:38,189 --> 03:01:42,870
around me and sell to my competition

4448
03:01:39,988 --> 03:01:45,840
because they don't actually test as hard

4449
03:01:42,870 --> 03:01:48,329
or as strict as we do so I can't go out

4450
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:50,728
there and yell and scream I can only sit

4451
03:01:48,329 --> 03:01:53,129
back and literally watch in frustration

4452
03:01:50,728 --> 03:01:54,988
as I watch the market have to absorb

4453
03:01:53,129 --> 03:02:00,688
that type of [ __ ] but well you know

4454
03:01:54,988 --> 03:02:02,549
and you know and honestly to live estate

4455
03:02:00,689 --> 03:02:03,090
that's reality it'll go out it'll go

4456
03:02:02,549 --> 03:02:04,559
elsewhere

4457
03:02:03,090 --> 03:02:06,719
I mean remember these studies have

4458
03:02:04,559 --> 03:02:09,420
stated that a third of grows are gonna

4459
03:02:06,719 --> 03:02:12,448
stay illegal regardless of legality and

4460
03:02:09,420 --> 03:02:14,189
whatever labor markets so a third think

4461
03:02:12,449 --> 03:02:18,149
of that that's that's significant that's

4462
03:02:14,189 --> 03:02:21,540
not a you know a significant drop per se

4463
03:02:18,148 --> 03:02:22,680
what is its going to be but the really a

4464
03:02:21,540 --> 03:02:24,569
lot of people who are going to be

4465
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:27,510
reaping the benefits by doing it right

4466
03:02:24,568 --> 03:02:29,100
you know can I just say one more thing

4467
03:02:27,510 --> 03:02:31,529
to Alec I mean you know you're talking

4468
03:02:29,100 --> 03:02:33,180
about these transformations chemical

4469
03:02:31,529 --> 03:02:35,729
alterations that are going on in the

4470
03:02:33,180 --> 03:02:37,229
molecules and you know I think there is

4471
03:02:35,728 --> 03:02:39,059
a little bit of finger I mean I hear it

4472
03:02:37,228 --> 03:02:40,379
all the time equal finger pointing at

4473
03:02:39,059 --> 03:02:44,100
the lab and say well you didn't do this

4474
03:02:40,379 --> 03:02:46,170
this it's like listen Kevin chemistry

4475
03:02:44,100 --> 03:02:47,699
analytics it's cost money right like

4476
03:02:46,170 --> 03:02:49,829
there has to be some personal

4477
03:02:47,699 --> 03:02:51,479
responsibility on the top on the on the

4478
03:02:49,829 --> 03:02:53,159
behalf of the producers and whether

4479
03:02:51,478 --> 03:02:55,019
that's manufacturers equipment or

4480
03:02:53,159 --> 03:02:58,318
manufacturers of flowers that it's like

4481
03:02:55,020 --> 03:02:59,979
it's your product right like you're the

4482
03:02:58,318 --> 03:03:01,630
one that has to ensure that your

4483
03:02:59,979 --> 03:03:03,579
stuff is safe right you don't get to

4484
03:03:01,630 --> 03:03:05,560
just stand back and point at the lab and

4485
03:03:03,579 --> 03:03:07,360
say well they made a peak that they

4486
03:03:05,560 --> 03:03:09,250
can't identify it's like yeah they

4487
03:03:07,360 --> 03:03:12,310
identified that there's a peak for you

4488
03:03:09,250 --> 03:03:14,860
and that's the beginning of a road to to

4489
03:03:12,310 --> 03:03:16,149
a journey of knowledge right like when

4490
03:03:14,860 --> 03:03:18,579
you get like that's how science works

4491
03:03:16,149 --> 03:03:20,770
it's like you don't get every answer you

4492
03:03:18,579 --> 03:03:22,720
get you get a series of answers then you

4493
03:03:20,771 --> 03:03:24,579
also get a series of questions and the

4494
03:03:22,720 --> 03:03:26,500
next step is taking those questions and

4495
03:03:24,579 --> 03:03:29,921
following up on them no it's awesome

4496
03:03:26,500 --> 03:03:31,329
right so yeah we I don't know it's like

4497
03:03:29,921 --> 03:03:32,921
it's part of the maturation of the

4498
03:03:31,329 --> 03:03:35,200
industry you know and it's actually when

4499
03:03:32,921 --> 03:03:36,610
we talk regulations and I know you were

4500
03:03:35,200 --> 03:03:40,511
saying it's up to the market to

4501
03:03:36,610 --> 03:03:41,950
determine that let's a very how do I say

4502
03:03:40,511 --> 03:03:43,601
this look being politically incorrect

4503
03:03:41,950 --> 03:03:45,461
it's a very American way of looking at

4504
03:03:43,601 --> 03:03:48,489
things because it's so it is such a free

4505
03:03:45,460 --> 03:03:49,869
market driven society where you know

4506
03:03:48,489 --> 03:03:51,579
this is one thing we got now in Canada

4507
03:03:49,870 --> 03:03:54,761
with these regulations and everybody

4508
03:03:51,579 --> 03:03:56,800
says are so harsh and so hard to get

4509
03:03:54,761 --> 03:03:58,030
through and expensive and blah blah blah

4510
03:03:56,800 --> 03:04:00,671
but it's like you know what I'm actually

4511
03:03:58,030 --> 03:04:04,239
really proud of our regulations like I'm

4512
03:04:00,671 --> 03:04:05,921
proud that people are having to step up

4513
03:04:04,239 --> 03:04:08,319
their game and there's a set of rules

4514
03:04:05,921 --> 03:04:09,729
right but like essentially someone's

4515
03:04:08,319 --> 03:04:12,101
come in and the government's come in and

4516
03:04:09,729 --> 03:04:14,140
set a bar and we can argue whether the

4517
03:04:12,101 --> 03:04:15,730
bar set at the right level but

4518
03:04:14,140 --> 03:04:17,529
essentially it says no if you're gonna

4519
03:04:15,729 --> 03:04:21,011
do this you have to bring it up to this

4520
03:04:17,530 --> 03:04:22,870
level right and amaras said hi that's

4521
03:04:21,011 --> 03:04:24,610
for sure I like it to anyone that's ever

4522
03:04:22,870 --> 03:04:26,860
been in a like one of the well built

4523
03:04:24,610 --> 03:04:30,040
Canadian licensed production facilities

4524
03:04:26,860 --> 03:04:32,021
you can't help but go wow now they're

4525
03:04:30,040 --> 03:04:35,740
doing it right man and even the stuff

4526
03:04:32,021 --> 03:04:37,690
that that's the that's not as good as it

4527
03:04:35,739 --> 03:04:39,489
could be I mean every iteration gets

4528
03:04:37,690 --> 03:04:40,750
better right again it's like iris we

4529
03:04:39,489 --> 03:04:42,789
were saying before about the science

4530
03:04:40,750 --> 03:04:44,290
it's like you get answers to a bunch of

4531
03:04:42,790 --> 03:04:46,120
stuff and then you get questions what a

4532
03:04:44,290 --> 03:04:47,801
bunch of stuff and you you figure those

4533
03:04:46,120 --> 03:04:49,841
questions out and you give answers to

4534
03:04:47,800 --> 03:04:52,149
them too right it's like it's part of

4535
03:04:49,841 --> 03:04:53,681
our evolution as an industry right but

4536
03:04:52,149 --> 03:04:54,671
the science is starting to show I mean

4537
03:04:53,681 --> 03:04:56,230
there's all the science that's coming

4538
03:04:54,671 --> 03:04:58,181
out of these grows and chemical

4539
03:04:56,229 --> 03:05:00,671
analytics I was at the ICRS this year

4540
03:04:58,181 --> 03:05:05,230
and you know there was someone presented

4541
03:05:00,671 --> 03:05:07,120
a poster and she showed that but they

4542
03:05:05,229 --> 03:05:08,859
were going again like shell dough has

4543
03:05:07,120 --> 03:05:10,271
been saying with the Terps that also

4544
03:05:08,860 --> 03:05:12,730
with the cannabinoids are going through

4545
03:05:10,271 --> 03:05:16,090
these transformations right there's

4546
03:05:12,729 --> 03:05:18,129
Clemence Cree going on in the process on

4547
03:05:16,090 --> 03:05:20,860
there creating things like sesqui CBG

4548
03:05:18,129 --> 03:05:23,469
from CVG some stuffs going down some

4549
03:05:20,860 --> 03:05:26,079
stuffs going up and you know we have to

4550
03:05:23,469 --> 03:05:30,989
do these tasks it's it's better than

4551
03:05:26,079 --> 03:05:33,789
it's better dealing then it is just like

4552
03:05:30,989 --> 03:05:35,920
you know cross our fingers and kind of

4553
03:05:33,790 --> 03:05:37,870
blindly jump off the cliff right this

4554
03:05:35,920 --> 03:05:40,271
can't you can't it's not okay to just be

4555
03:05:37,870 --> 03:05:42,641
taking products and making extracts

4556
03:05:40,271 --> 03:05:44,141
given chemistry and then putting those

4557
03:05:42,640 --> 03:05:45,459
products on the market into other

4558
03:05:44,140 --> 03:05:47,140
people's hands when you don't even know

4559
03:05:45,459 --> 03:05:48,759
what's in it I don't know what the

4560
03:05:47,140 --> 03:05:51,159
safety profiles are the things are in it

4561
03:05:48,760 --> 03:05:53,050
like that's to me that's not okay no

4562
03:05:51,159 --> 03:05:54,851
exactly and and you know and for for so

4563
03:05:53,049 --> 03:05:56,920
long you know ignorance is bliss has

4564
03:05:54,851 --> 03:05:58,601
been able to kind of be a scapegoat to

4565
03:05:56,920 --> 03:06:00,640
you know do whatever it takes you know

4566
03:05:58,601 --> 03:06:03,370
and and you know in so many ways thanks

4567
03:06:00,640 --> 03:06:05,829
to you know pioneering groups like at

4568
03:06:03,370 --> 03:06:07,690
the end BPG and so many of the clients

4569
03:06:05,829 --> 03:06:10,450
that we work with you know people taken

4570
03:06:07,690 --> 03:06:15,040
such personal expense on whenever it

4571
03:06:10,450 --> 03:06:17,620
wasn't required to show and prove where

4572
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:20,410
they're at to substantiate quality and

4573
03:06:17,620 --> 03:06:23,079
to you know at for the most level look

4574
03:06:20,409 --> 03:06:25,479
out for patient consumer safety you know

4575
03:06:23,079 --> 03:06:27,399
and and you know whenever it wasn't cool

4576
03:06:25,479 --> 03:06:29,319
and it was it was just an added expense

4577
03:06:27,399 --> 03:06:29,770
that's gonna take away from your bottom

4578
03:06:29,319 --> 03:06:31,779
line

4579
03:06:29,771 --> 03:06:33,489
you know people that shouldn't even

4580
03:06:31,780 --> 03:06:35,530
necessarily have the burden to do the

4581
03:06:33,489 --> 03:06:37,899
testing like a dispensary have been the

4582
03:06:35,530 --> 03:06:40,470
ones that are doing it actively to you

4583
03:06:37,899 --> 03:06:44,049
know try to under owned you know

4584
03:06:40,469 --> 03:06:47,920
microcosm level be able to up yeah we

4585
03:06:44,049 --> 03:06:50,379
can afford to yeah true it was hella

4586
03:06:47,920 --> 03:06:52,210
expensive out the get-go I had to do

4587
03:06:50,379 --> 03:06:53,739
like I said I did 1,500 tests with the

4588
03:06:52,209 --> 03:06:56,079
laboratory that isn't even doing this

4589
03:06:53,739 --> 03:06:57,729
anymore okay so I know what it's like to

4590
03:06:56,079 --> 03:07:00,370
throw hundreds of thousands of dollars

4591
03:06:57,729 --> 03:07:02,799
you know at something that we hope to

4592
03:07:00,370 --> 03:07:05,620
become science and it became science and

4593
03:07:02,799 --> 03:07:09,189
become replicated science that is now we

4594
03:07:05,620 --> 03:07:12,040
can all benefit from but yeah I mean you

4595
03:07:09,190 --> 03:07:13,659
had to I mean if you if we were giving

4596
03:07:12,040 --> 03:07:15,160
this stuff to patients we had to make

4597
03:07:13,659 --> 03:07:16,149
sure that we weren't killing them so we

4598
03:07:15,159 --> 03:07:18,399
wanted to make sure we're doing

4599
03:07:16,149 --> 03:07:21,310
microbials early on as well because I

4600
03:07:18,399 --> 03:07:22,569
had gotten an Debbie my business partner

4601
03:07:21,310 --> 03:07:24,640
she had gotten a respiratory infection

4602
03:07:22,569 --> 03:07:26,560
from a cannabis that we bought that we

4603
03:07:24,640 --> 03:07:28,540
had looked through our microscopes

4604
03:07:26,560 --> 03:07:30,069
everything in our organoleptic testing

4605
03:07:28,540 --> 03:07:33,399
showed us it was clear and good to go

4606
03:07:30,069 --> 03:07:35,591
but it failed along the way and we both

4607
03:07:33,399 --> 03:07:38,079
got sick from it we both lost day's work

4608
03:07:35,591 --> 03:07:39,970
and from that frustration of you know

4609
03:07:38,079 --> 03:07:42,790
losing both people who were running the

4610
03:07:39,970 --> 03:07:44,470
company it was it's not an easy thing to

4611
03:07:42,790 --> 03:07:46,540
do as we all know as we all run our

4612
03:07:44,470 --> 03:07:48,671
companies you know when you you you lose

4613
03:07:46,540 --> 03:07:51,970
major players that can really set things

4614
03:07:48,671 --> 03:07:54,220
back and for be very frustrating so out

4615
03:07:51,970 --> 03:07:55,960
of that it led to just the idea we need

4616
03:07:54,220 --> 03:07:58,689
to know what's what's going and growing

4617
03:07:55,960 --> 03:08:01,569
and then it's debarked into THC testing

4618
03:07:58,690 --> 03:08:04,421
and getting the actual percentages of

4619
03:08:01,569 --> 03:08:06,880
THC and then that started off to be an

4620
03:08:04,421 --> 03:08:08,800
initial [ __ ] is we didn't release

4621
03:08:06,880 --> 03:08:11,069
the data other people had released the

4622
03:08:08,800 --> 03:08:13,930
data and then it caused a huge ripple

4623
03:08:11,069 --> 03:08:17,380
amongst consumers as well as amongst

4624
03:08:13,931 --> 03:08:18,851
growers because people didn't understand

4625
03:08:17,380 --> 03:08:21,760
what these numbers meant and we knew

4626
03:08:18,851 --> 03:08:24,851
that the THC numbers rectified somewhere

4627
03:08:21,761 --> 03:08:26,591
with CBD and the other numbers but for

4628
03:08:24,851 --> 03:08:29,261
some reason everybody was looking at the

4629
03:08:26,591 --> 03:08:32,291
THC numbers all of a sudden like it was

4630
03:08:29,261 --> 03:08:34,301
ever clear in alcohol high high alcohol

4631
03:08:32,290 --> 03:08:36,010
that you know you've got the you know

4632
03:08:34,300 --> 03:08:38,560
that you got your beer and then you go

4633
03:08:36,011 --> 03:08:41,370
straight into your 90 proof your 110 or

4634
03:08:38,560 --> 03:08:43,989
up to your 190 you know and people

4635
03:08:41,370 --> 03:08:47,700
everybody all of a sudden wanted to vie

4636
03:08:43,989 --> 03:08:51,069
for the higher number so it was a an

4637
03:08:47,700 --> 03:08:52,480
immediate quasi conundrum for a lot of

4638
03:08:51,069 --> 03:08:55,630
us because we wanted the data out there

4639
03:08:52,479 --> 03:08:58,180
however we weren't properly conveying

4640
03:08:55,630 --> 03:09:00,040
what this data was to the consumer and

4641
03:08:58,181 --> 03:09:02,471
so the consumer was just running with it

4642
03:09:00,040 --> 03:09:04,270
like it did for any other type of

4643
03:09:02,470 --> 03:09:06,341
consumer product that oh the higher

4644
03:09:04,271 --> 03:09:08,230
number must be better and as we know

4645
03:09:06,341 --> 03:09:09,909
that's not necessarily the case no

4646
03:09:08,229 --> 03:09:12,130
exactly that's a bit of the disease also

4647
03:09:09,909 --> 03:09:13,989
and we're susceptible to that early on

4648
03:09:12,130 --> 03:09:15,850
wholly no and that's a bit of the

4649
03:09:13,989 --> 03:09:17,591
disservice I think that the labs as a

4650
03:09:15,851 --> 03:09:20,079
whole have brought to the industry is I

4651
03:09:17,591 --> 03:09:21,310
mean and I mean exact like you spelled

4652
03:09:20,079 --> 03:09:23,200
out though it's been this evolving

4653
03:09:21,310 --> 03:09:25,239
process you know when there wasn't a

4654
03:09:23,200 --> 03:09:28,061
demand for testing there started to be

4655
03:09:25,239 --> 03:09:29,829
the slow kind of demand because people

4656
03:09:28,060 --> 03:09:32,079
like yourself were kind of you know

4657
03:09:29,829 --> 03:09:34,630
instituting into your process you know

4658
03:09:32,079 --> 03:09:37,271
and and and so slowly over time the

4659
03:09:34,630 --> 03:09:38,590
demand for the different array of tests

4660
03:09:37,271 --> 03:09:40,239
kind of has expanded and then

4661
03:09:38,591 --> 03:09:42,579
regulations is slowly

4662
03:09:40,239 --> 03:09:44,560
find things you know but but you know up

4663
03:09:42,579 --> 03:09:46,539
to this point kind of you know yeah and

4664
03:09:44,560 --> 03:09:47,890
you know before terpene testing you know

4665
03:09:46,540 --> 03:09:50,141
and before labs are all doing turkey

4666
03:09:47,890 --> 03:09:52,090
testing it in a bit of a way kind of you

4667
03:09:50,140 --> 03:09:53,770
know the you know just testing for

4668
03:09:52,090 --> 03:09:55,840
cannabinoids and THC being the one

4669
03:09:53,771 --> 03:09:57,909
analyte people are focusing on it really

4670
03:09:55,840 --> 03:10:00,101
kind of almost misinformed and

4671
03:09:57,909 --> 03:10:02,319
conditioned so much of the market pay

4672
03:10:00,101 --> 03:10:04,090
place in this really wrong way you know

4673
03:10:02,319 --> 03:10:06,101
an almost somewhat dangerous way for a

4674
03:10:04,090 --> 03:10:08,470
lot of people because then you have like

4675
03:10:06,101 --> 03:10:10,480
you know bud tenders that you know or

4676
03:10:08,470 --> 03:10:13,060
young don't necessarily know any better

4677
03:10:10,479 --> 03:10:16,299
that are kind of you know like using

4678
03:10:13,060 --> 03:10:19,779
kind of THC as the metric for quality

4679
03:10:16,299 --> 03:10:21,970
well but both testing THC strains to new

4680
03:10:19,780 --> 03:10:23,739
time vets and old patients with

4681
03:10:21,970 --> 03:10:25,180
post-traumatic stress or cancer that

4682
03:10:23,739 --> 03:10:27,159
I've never used cannabis before and and

4683
03:10:25,181 --> 03:10:28,690
so you know I mean in so many ways it's

4684
03:10:27,159 --> 03:10:31,271
been this continuing evoluted

4685
03:10:28,690 --> 03:10:33,399
evolutionary evolutionary process of

4686
03:10:31,271 --> 03:10:34,931
kind of demanding more from the labs

4687
03:10:33,399 --> 03:10:37,209
demanding more from those that are

4688
03:10:34,931 --> 03:10:39,250
making the products but you know being

4689
03:10:37,209 --> 03:10:41,979
you know taking on the expense before

4690
03:10:39,250 --> 03:10:44,200
you know it was a thing I think is

4691
03:10:41,979 --> 03:10:46,180
definitely like repeatedly worth

4692
03:10:44,200 --> 03:10:48,311
mentioning because you know I mean it

4693
03:10:46,181 --> 03:10:50,170
was a you know I mean paying seventy two

4694
03:10:48,310 --> 03:10:51,851
hundred back in the day for pounds of

4695
03:10:50,170 --> 03:10:54,010
herb you know and then like doing

4696
03:10:51,851 --> 03:10:56,170
testing on top of that just so that you

4697
03:10:54,010 --> 03:10:57,579
can show these things you know kind of

4698
03:10:56,170 --> 03:10:59,379
was just an added expense when most

4699
03:10:57,579 --> 03:11:01,420
people weren't taking it you know now

4700
03:10:59,379 --> 03:11:03,909
that kind of that shifting and you know

4701
03:11:01,420 --> 03:11:05,739
the the marketplace is demanding kind of

4702
03:11:03,909 --> 03:11:07,659
transparency it's it's really like you

4703
03:11:05,739 --> 03:11:09,789
know before giving a kid it's also gonna

4704
03:11:07,659 --> 03:11:11,140
be demanding that you accept that's the

4705
03:11:09,790 --> 03:11:13,690
farmer you accept that as a

4706
03:11:11,140 --> 03:11:15,699
responsibility if you're growing is also

4707
03:11:13,690 --> 03:11:18,851
accepting responsibility of that testing

4708
03:11:15,700 --> 03:11:20,380
so you know that's it's a shared burden

4709
03:11:18,851 --> 03:11:22,271
by all I know I'm gonna pay more for

4710
03:11:20,379 --> 03:11:23,560
that in the end because of it so that's

4711
03:11:22,271 --> 03:11:26,471
how it's done but that's just how the

4712
03:11:23,560 --> 03:11:28,569
marketplace is mmm-hmm yeah and you know

4713
03:11:26,470 --> 03:11:31,629
and and but then rightfully so kind of

4714
03:11:28,569 --> 03:11:33,310
you know the the testing and the burden

4715
03:11:31,629 --> 03:11:35,020
of proof is on the people making the

4716
03:11:33,310 --> 03:11:36,940
products and so I think that's a good

4717
03:11:35,021 --> 03:11:38,650
thing about you know the regulated kind

4718
03:11:36,940 --> 03:11:41,530
of market because you know it's it's

4719
03:11:38,649 --> 03:11:42,879
helping to essentially I mean if you're

4720
03:11:41,530 --> 03:11:44,320
growing products and you're trying to

4721
03:11:42,879 --> 03:11:46,180
get them out in the market it's like you

4722
03:11:44,319 --> 03:11:48,760
have to kind of prove in a bit of a way

4723
03:11:46,181 --> 03:11:50,409
you know what what's up you know and and

4724
03:11:48,760 --> 03:11:52,390
you know ignorance is bliss is no longer

4725
03:11:50,409 --> 03:11:53,590
a thing you know and ignorance is if

4726
03:11:52,390 --> 03:11:54,010
anything you're gonna get you quickly

4727
03:11:53,590 --> 03:11:55,329
cat

4728
03:11:54,010 --> 03:11:57,520
pulled it out of the industry you know

4729
03:11:55,329 --> 03:12:00,609
the the landline field in front of us

4730
03:11:57,520 --> 03:12:02,200
you know of pesticides and you know kind

4731
03:12:00,609 --> 03:12:04,329
of all these aspects of like you know

4732
03:12:02,200 --> 03:12:06,939
sloppy production or you know not

4733
03:12:04,329 --> 03:12:09,010
conscious understanding of supply chain

4734
03:12:06,939 --> 03:12:10,090
management where you know you can

4735
03:12:09,010 --> 03:12:11,770
introduce these certain contaminants

4736
03:12:10,090 --> 03:12:12,818
into your process you know those things

4737
03:12:11,770 --> 03:12:14,140
are the things that are gonna get you

4738
03:12:12,818 --> 03:12:15,639
ejected real quick you know and so I

4739
03:12:14,139 --> 03:12:17,978
think I think those that have been

4740
03:12:15,639 --> 03:12:20,108
working through these the you know the

4741
03:12:17,978 --> 03:12:22,778
minefields for you know up to this point

4742
03:12:20,109 --> 03:12:25,059
and have have done testing to you know

4743
03:12:22,779 --> 03:12:26,859
kind of learn the lessons and to to

4744
03:12:25,059 --> 03:12:29,228
learn the hard lessons oftentimes equate

4745
03:12:26,859 --> 03:12:31,750
to having to destroy product you know

4746
03:12:29,228 --> 03:12:33,639
you know are kind of the things that now

4747
03:12:31,750 --> 03:12:35,799
are going to make you most succeed in

4748
03:12:33,639 --> 03:12:37,329
the coming you know in the coming years

4749
03:12:35,799 --> 03:12:39,639
you know because a lot of people that

4750
03:12:37,329 --> 03:12:41,379
are new and just coming in you know with

4751
03:12:39,639 --> 03:12:43,239
really high projections about how much

4752
03:12:41,379 --> 03:12:44,889
money they're gonna make you know there

4753
03:12:43,239 --> 03:12:47,079
you have such a like body of knowledge

4754
03:12:44,889 --> 03:12:48,789
that they have yet to acquire or have

4755
03:12:47,079 --> 03:12:50,620
yet to fall on their face to learn and

4756
03:12:48,790 --> 03:12:52,090
so you know I think I think it's it's

4757
03:12:50,620 --> 03:12:54,370
really gonna serve those that you know

4758
03:12:52,090 --> 03:12:57,398
took the initiative to figure it out and

4759
03:12:54,370 --> 03:12:58,840
so you know again big ox thank you and

4760
03:12:57,398 --> 03:13:00,309
speaking of just want to give a shout

03:13:39,670 --> 03:13:42,609
strong fight against five year fight

4773
03:13:41,260 --> 03:13:48,250
against government to make it a reality

4774

4775
03:13:48,250 --> 03:13:53,590
years ago yeah here in BC like out my

4776
03:13:51,670 --> 03:13:55,600
house in Lions Bay like a couple of

4777
03:13:53,590 --> 03:13:58,989
doors over from where I am right now in

4778

under staying that was going on there so

4785
03:14:09,459 --> 03:14:12,669
it was an international effort after

4786
03:14:11,318 --> 03:14:15,100
seeing things that went on in the

4787
03:14:12,670 --> 03:14:16,719
Netherlands and saying things unionizing

4788
03:14:15,100 --> 03:14:18,279

bit of fun ride just de needless to say

4793
03:14:25,090 --> 03:14:33,460
because Oaksterdam is also coming up on

4794
03:14:27,700 --> 03:14:35,529
its its birthday too and yeah

4795
03:14:33,459 --> 03:14:37,568
big ups there cuz that was a major

4796
03:14:35,529 --> 03:14:41,170
spread that started you know that was

4797
03:14:37,568 --> 03:14:43,778
our failed initiative here in California

4798
03:14:41,170 --> 03:14:45,689
that led to the successes in Oregon and

4799
03:14:43,779 --> 03:14:48,520
Washington and Colorado and other states

4800
03:14:45,689 --> 03:14:50,409
once we failed we showed it was possible

4801
03:14:48,520 --> 03:14:53,109
so everybody else decide well what we

4802
03:14:50,409 --> 03:14:57,340
can do it too and you know Colorado

4803
03:14:53,109 --> 03:14:59,470
became the first lesson and now we're

4804
03:14:57,340 --> 03:15:00,609
gonna see what happens in 2018 there

4805
03:14:59,469 --> 03:15:04,090
should be more

4806
03:15:00,609 --> 03:15:05,739
we anticipate hopefully you know more

4807
03:15:04,090 --> 03:15:07,989
states are coming online here real soon

4808
03:15:05,739 --> 03:15:09,728
which will you know it's just like the

4809
03:15:07,989 --> 03:15:13,119
medical cannabis we started off with one

4810
03:15:09,728 --> 03:15:15,099
now it's over 28 so we're over 50% now

4811
03:15:13,120 --> 03:15:17,920
in the United States we just have to

4812
03:15:15,100 --> 03:15:20,770
push a little further and here very soon

4813
03:15:17,920 --> 03:15:23,200
with with legalized cannabis you know

4814
03:15:20,770 --> 03:15:25,750
New York State's very jealous of DC and

4815
03:15:23,200 --> 03:15:28,630
you know the Florida isn't you know

4816
03:15:25,750 --> 03:15:30,489
happy with just its medical so it's been

4817
03:15:28,629 --> 03:15:34,478
interesting to see what happens here in

4818
03:15:30,489 --> 03:15:36,489
2018 and 2020 hmm

4819
03:15:34,478 --> 03:15:39,429
what year would that have been that they

4820
03:15:36,489 --> 03:15:43,180
came out here to Vancouver was that 97

4821
03:15:39,430 --> 03:15:45,010
99 99 cuz they opened up in the latter

4822
03:15:43,180 --> 03:15:46,689
part of 99 I believe they went on a

4823
03:15:45,010 --> 03:15:50,559
spring tour or something like that with

4824
03:15:46,689 --> 03:15:52,000
a group that just Debbie of course we

4825
03:15:50,559 --> 03:15:54,250
had the cannabis Action Network is such

4826
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:58,239
back then and that was my original way

4827
03:15:54,250 --> 03:15:59,739
to Canada back in 93 doing a rally there

4828
03:15:58,239 --> 03:16:01,779
in Vancouver but we got kicked out

4829
03:15:59,739 --> 03:16:04,180
because of Elvis medical marijuana so we

4830
03:16:01,779 --> 03:16:09,250
were never allowed to actually do that

4831
03:16:04,180 --> 03:16:12,130
so that was just frustration but yeah

4832
03:16:09,250 --> 03:16:13,629
it's it's it's been a ride and we've

4833
03:16:12,129 --> 03:16:15,250
still got a long ways to go as you can

4834
03:16:13,629 --> 03:16:16,778
see by just our discussion of science

4835
03:16:15,250 --> 03:16:18,818
and everything else I mean we're just

4836
03:16:16,779 --> 03:16:20,370
getting on line here with regulations

4837
03:16:18,818 --> 03:16:21,629
here in California and

4838
03:16:20,370 --> 03:16:26,130
you know with machinery and technology

4839
03:16:21,629 --> 03:16:28,379
and all that it's it's you know I've

4840
03:16:26,129 --> 03:16:31,079
only seen a small blip of it but it all

4841
03:16:28,379 --> 03:16:32,759
goes back to that man sitting there it's

4842
03:16:31,079 --> 03:16:35,219
a little plush sitting there and a seat

4843
03:16:32,760 --> 03:16:36,840
fair by the name of silk van Sam that

4844
03:16:35,219 --> 03:16:40,529
made a lot of what we have today

4845
03:16:36,840 --> 03:16:43,620
possible through genetics so Big Ups to

4846
03:16:40,530 --> 03:16:48,620
you sir it's never forgotten no problem

4847
03:16:43,620 --> 03:16:48,620
I was happy to do it at the time my wife

4848
03:16:48,739 --> 03:16:54,810
no doubt I bet you were happy to do it

4849
03:16:52,379 --> 03:16:58,859
Sam we took with the CBG varieties you

4850
03:16:54,810 --> 03:17:03,360
got any of those we developed it almost

4851
03:16:58,860 --> 03:17:06,989
appears CBG variety correct and is that

4852
03:17:03,360 --> 03:17:10,021
is that is is the is the pathway towards

4853
03:17:06,989 --> 03:17:11,940
a CBG dominant varietal kind of because

4854
03:17:10,021 --> 03:17:13,920
of some type of genetic you know

4855
03:17:11,940 --> 03:17:15,989
mutation or something in the synthase

4856
03:17:13,920 --> 03:17:18,271
genes or is that just a natural process

4857
03:17:15,989 --> 03:17:22,909
that strains can go through because

4858
03:17:18,271 --> 03:17:27,601
oftentimes it's a particular group of

4859
03:17:22,909 --> 03:17:30,479
synthesis you can read the paper if you

4860
03:17:27,601 --> 03:17:34,130
don't have it send me an email and I'll

4861
03:17:30,479 --> 03:17:37,260
send it to you or contact me thank you

4862
03:17:34,129 --> 03:17:39,029
yes it's I think it's actually a little

4863
03:17:37,260 --> 03:17:40,440
more complicated than the paper suggests

4864
03:17:39,030 --> 03:17:43,050
you've done some work in that element

4865
03:17:40,440 --> 03:17:45,329
that's a good place to start

4866
03:17:43,049 --> 03:17:48,859
understanding it yeah it is it's

4867
03:17:45,329 --> 03:17:48,860
essentially what it is there's

4868
03:17:48,870 --> 03:17:53,400
we you know we got we got versions of

4869
03:17:50,969 --> 03:17:55,020
CBD acid synthase and THC acid synthase

4870
03:17:53,399 --> 03:17:56,789
and there's there's versions on both

4871
03:17:55,021 --> 03:18:00,811
that don't work or they call them

4872
03:17:56,790 --> 03:18:02,670
minimally functional so you know this

4873
03:18:00,810 --> 03:18:05,129
anybody that knows the biochemistry C at

4874
03:18:02,670 --> 03:18:08,010
CVG acid is the precursor to both C to D

4875
03:18:05,129 --> 03:18:11,310
and THC so if you have broken machinery

4876
03:18:08,010 --> 03:18:13,771
that turns up you know that turns CPG

4877
03:18:11,310 --> 03:18:15,930
acid in the THC or CBD acid in the CBD

4878
03:18:13,771 --> 03:18:17,521
and those enzymes aren't working

4879
03:18:15,930 --> 03:18:21,690
properly then what happens is you have a

4880
03:18:17,521 --> 03:18:23,101
backup of C D G yeah cuz you know

4881
03:18:21,690 --> 03:18:25,409
because they're like we don't I mean

4882
03:18:23,101 --> 03:18:25,851
most of the samples we've ever tested

4883
03:18:25,409 --> 03:18:29,369
you know

4884
03:18:25,851 --> 03:18:31,829
CBG a we'll see you know maybe two and a

4885
03:18:29,370 --> 03:18:34,359
half three percent most in certain

4886
03:18:31,829 --> 03:18:37,748
varietals you know actually three

4887
03:18:34,359 --> 03:18:39,818
scent is quite high artists only maybe

4888
03:18:37,748 --> 03:18:41,619
triple that or a little bit more

4889
03:18:39,818 --> 03:18:43,840
well because yeah I mean but typically

4890
03:18:41,619 --> 03:18:46,090
if every time we ever see that it'll

4891
03:18:43,840 --> 03:18:49,840
either be in a turpentine

4892
03:18:46,090 --> 03:18:52,510
OS and mean variety of th a THC dominant

4893
03:18:49,840 --> 03:18:55,029
turpin Lino's I mean variety with maybe

4894
03:18:52,510 --> 03:18:59,260
two and a half percent C VGA or it'll be

4895
03:18:55,029 --> 03:19:01,600
a mere scene assuming THC variety where

4896
03:18:59,260 --> 03:19:03,550
same thing it'll be mostly THC a but

4897
03:19:01,600 --> 03:19:06,189
then two and a half three percent C VGA

4898
03:19:03,549 --> 03:19:08,590
and so you know just I mean having no

4899
03:19:06,189 --> 03:19:10,959
idea what's up there just seeing kind of

4900
03:19:08,590 --> 03:19:13,379
the common thing across those as you

4901
03:19:10,959 --> 03:19:15,999
know that mean anything to you Ryan

4902
03:19:13,379 --> 03:19:17,739
yeah well this I mean they're not the

4903
03:19:15,998 --> 03:19:21,398
terpene lean one but I think I know

4904
03:19:17,738 --> 03:19:25,809
where those are coming from but the CBG

4905
03:19:21,398 --> 03:19:27,849
acid in the mir scene Ossa mean profile

4906
03:19:25,809 --> 03:19:29,969
I'm assuming you're seeing but we're

4907
03:19:27,850 --> 03:19:32,949
seeing two to one over Oh Smee

4908
03:19:29,969 --> 03:19:35,139
right yeah or more you know typically

4909
03:19:32,949 --> 03:19:36,760
it'll be you know primary mirror scene

4910
03:19:35,139 --> 03:19:38,769
but yeah then two to one or three to one

4911
03:19:36,760 --> 03:19:41,318
kind of mirror see knows me yeah some

4912
03:19:38,770 --> 03:19:44,890
that Mir see no sameen's smell is what I

4913
03:19:41,318 --> 03:19:47,859
call sweet hemp I don't think it's very

4914
03:19:44,889 --> 03:19:48,969
a very pleasant smell myself it's you

4915
03:19:47,859 --> 03:19:51,699
know a lot of people are calling like

4916
03:19:48,969 --> 03:19:53,738
mangoes or papayas or green crack dream

4917
03:19:51,699 --> 03:19:56,800
Queen you know kind of all that stuff

4918
03:19:53,738 --> 03:19:58,748
what we've seen you know are in that

4919
03:19:56,799 --> 03:20:01,028
kind of group but you know we very

4920
03:19:58,748 --> 03:20:03,189
rarely see some awesome Ian or also mean

4921
03:20:01,029 --> 03:20:05,168
as the primary terpene but whenever it

4922
03:20:03,189 --> 03:20:08,139
shows up as you know kind of a secondary

4923
03:20:05,168 --> 03:20:10,510
terpene it seems to be either tracking

4924
03:20:08,139 --> 03:20:12,068
with the mere seen grouping or with the

4925
03:20:10,510 --> 03:20:14,369
tour pending grouping on the other side

4926
03:20:12,068 --> 03:20:16,930
of it yeah you see it kind of with other

4927
03:20:14,369 --> 03:20:18,970
travel I think there's a suit there's a

4928
03:20:16,930 --> 03:20:20,770
mere scene synthase that produces both

4929
03:20:18,969 --> 03:20:24,778
mere scene and oh so mean at about a 2

4930
03:20:20,770 --> 03:20:28,229
to 1 3 to 1 ratio and it varies between

4931
03:20:24,779 --> 03:20:30,100
allele alleles of that particular type

4932
03:20:28,228 --> 03:20:32,198
it is interesting though because we've

4933
03:20:30,100 --> 03:20:34,029
seen a you know kind of a couple

4934
03:20:32,199 --> 03:20:35,590
different you know like in the pines in

4935
03:20:34,029 --> 03:20:36,789
the pines has been this awesome yeah

4936
03:20:35,590 --> 03:20:39,728
pineapple too but you know this tropical

4937
03:20:36,789 --> 03:20:41,918
fruit smell I guess like Maya mango

4938
03:20:39,728 --> 03:20:43,840
papaya pineapple oftentimes will be

4939
03:20:41,918 --> 03:20:47,199
really high mere seen and then a little

4940
03:20:43,840 --> 03:20:48,351
bit of opening but but you know we we

4941
03:20:47,199 --> 03:20:50,181
have seen from a couple

4942
03:20:48,351 --> 03:20:52,310
groups that sprouted a bunch of like in

4943
03:20:50,181 --> 03:20:53,301
the pine seeds which is you know this

4944
03:20:52,310 --> 03:20:55,431
pretty awesome

4945
03:20:53,300 --> 03:20:57,831
pineapple type smell from up in Mentos

4946
03:20:55,431 --> 03:21:00,171
the ml triangle that has been you know

4947
03:20:57,831 --> 03:21:03,380
historically kind of in the top ten that

4948
03:21:00,171 --> 03:21:04,489
the Emerald cup for many years but but

4949
03:21:03,380 --> 03:21:06,501
when they when people sprouted some

4950
03:21:04,489 --> 03:21:08,659
seeds you know we started to see you

4951
03:21:06,501 --> 03:21:10,851
know a couple those Pinos be either one

4952
03:21:08,659 --> 03:21:13,101
to one like balance of Mir seen and

4953
03:21:10,851 --> 03:21:14,900
notice I mean or in certain certain

4954
03:21:13,101 --> 03:21:16,730
cases we've seen a couple of these that

4955
03:21:14,899 --> 03:21:19,159
are awesome e dominant yeah but those

4956
03:21:16,729 --> 03:21:20,511
are those are all in type one plants so

4957
03:21:19,159 --> 03:21:22,130
I was trying to go back to what you were

4958
03:21:20,511 --> 03:21:24,261
talking about with the type four plants

4959
03:21:22,130 --> 03:21:24,501
which are the CBD plants okay yeah

4960
03:21:24,261 --> 03:21:26,751
please

4961
03:21:24,501 --> 03:21:29,351
so if you go back and you look at those

4962
03:21:26,751 --> 03:21:32,001
you see that Mir seen you know sameen

4963
03:21:29,351 --> 03:21:34,400
usually like Sam was saying the total

4964
03:21:32,001 --> 03:21:37,550
cannabinoid level is actually quite low

4965
03:21:34,399 --> 03:21:39,171
and in in most of the CPG varieties not

4966
03:21:37,550 --> 03:21:41,331
all of them but most of the ones that

4967
03:21:39,171 --> 03:21:44,630
you see on the market they were derived

4968
03:21:41,331 --> 03:21:46,729
from hemp populations okay so your your

4969
03:21:44,630 --> 03:21:49,939
total cannabinoid volume of switch is

4970
03:21:46,729 --> 03:21:52,369
actually turned down quite low hmm

4971
03:21:49,940 --> 03:21:54,591
so in the process of turning that up by

4972
03:21:52,370 --> 03:21:56,061
hybridizing it with drug cultivars over

4973
03:21:54,591 --> 03:21:59,331
and over again and then selecting for

4974
03:21:56,060 --> 03:22:01,220
the CBG mutation you start to change the

4975
03:21:59,331 --> 03:22:04,970
terpene profile away from that like

4976
03:22:01,220 --> 03:22:07,609
happy sweet kind of hemp pee smell into

4977
03:22:04,970 --> 03:22:09,529
something a little more dank right so

4978
03:22:07,610 --> 03:22:12,081
there are varieties now I was just in

4979
03:22:09,530 --> 03:22:14,030
Spain when three weeks ago visiting with

4980
03:22:12,081 --> 03:22:15,501
the a good friend of mine over there

4981
03:22:14,030 --> 03:22:17,900
they had a license they were the only

4982
03:22:15,501 --> 03:22:21,319
licensed in Spain's produced THC plants

4983
03:22:17,899 --> 03:22:25,779
and I went down on their their research

4984
03:22:21,319 --> 03:22:29,751
facility in in in the southwestern Spain

4985
03:22:25,780 --> 03:22:31,551
actually with dr. RIS and we saw her

4986
03:22:29,751 --> 03:22:35,239
once you have different CBG varieties

4987
03:22:31,550 --> 03:22:36,649
and CBD CBD V varieties and some CBD

4988
03:22:35,239 --> 03:22:40,220
varieties they're working on with a

4989
03:22:36,649 --> 03:22:42,609
molecule called canna preen so there are

4990
03:22:40,220 --> 03:22:45,770
people that are breeding those lines up

4991
03:22:42,610 --> 03:22:47,841
it's not very dank CPG stuff it's like

4992
03:22:45,771 --> 03:22:50,120
it's it's funny but one of the things

4993
03:22:47,841 --> 03:22:53,030
about CBG when you see these CBG plants

4994
03:22:50,120 --> 03:22:55,101
the trichomes are white okay they're not

4995
03:22:53,030 --> 03:22:58,041
sticky and and they're kind of dry

4996
03:22:55,101 --> 03:22:59,870
feeling kind of like grainy sandy

4997
03:22:58,040 --> 03:23:02,239
feeling when the trichomes are white and

4998
03:22:59,870 --> 03:23:04,730
it's because the CBG

4999
03:23:02,239 --> 03:23:08,601
it doesn't dissolve into the oleoresin

5000
03:23:04,729 --> 03:23:10,010
like CBD or THC acid would so they

5001
03:23:08,601 --> 03:23:12,319
actually have a different texture on the

5002
03:23:10,010 --> 03:23:14,931
flowers it's not oily it's not sticky

5003
03:23:12,319 --> 03:23:17,810
and there's there's nothing fun about it

5004
03:23:14,931 --> 03:23:19,579
you know Wow you know there's I mean

5005
03:23:17,810 --> 03:23:22,640
what's really fascinating to me about

5006
03:23:19,579 --> 03:23:24,860
the kind of CPG and stuff is uh there's

5007
03:23:22,640 --> 03:23:27,979
this there's this paper I oftentimes

5008
03:23:24,860 --> 03:23:30,790
reference about the anti anti

5009
03:23:27,979 --> 03:23:33,109
inflammation effects of cannabis and

5010
03:23:30,790 --> 03:23:35,800
I'll find the paper and post it up but

5011
03:23:33,110 --> 03:23:38,721
it's about the potential cyclooxygenase

5012
03:23:35,799 --> 03:23:41,180
inhibition of six primary cannabinoids

5013
03:23:38,720 --> 03:23:44,060
and and it basically you know there's

5014
03:23:41,181 --> 03:23:47,870
this chart that all kind of throw up on

5015
03:23:44,060 --> 03:23:50,360
the chat but it's a it shows you know

5016
03:23:47,870 --> 03:23:52,610
the percent inhibition of cox-1 and

5017
03:23:50,360 --> 03:23:54,650
cox-2 cox-1 and cox-2 which are the

5018
03:23:52,610 --> 03:23:57,110
enzymes in their body responsible for

5019
03:23:54,649 --> 03:23:59,869
producing inflammation yeah cox-2 just

5020
03:23:57,110 --> 03:24:02,721
so people can get the idea or some kind

5021
03:23:59,870 --> 03:24:05,000
of context on cox-2 ibuprofen there's a

5022
03:24:02,720 --> 03:24:07,399
cox-2 inhibitor right yeah yeah exactly

5023
03:24:05,000 --> 03:24:08,690
and so and you know in and indeed

5024
03:24:07,399 --> 03:24:10,190
correct me if I'm wrong but from what I

5025
03:24:08,690 --> 03:24:12,560
knew yet pretty much all the

5026
03:24:10,190 --> 03:24:14,360
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

5027
03:24:12,560 --> 03:24:16,909
like ibuprofen motrin and stuff pretty

5028
03:24:14,360 --> 03:24:24,530
much act on one or either or both is

5029
03:24:16,909 --> 03:24:26,030
that right or wrong say yeah but but

5030
03:24:24,530 --> 03:24:27,950
regardless you know kind of it's this

5031
03:24:26,030 --> 03:24:30,500
this chart shows both inhibition of

5032
03:24:27,950 --> 03:24:32,450
cox-1 and inhibition of cox-2 and when

5033
03:24:30,500 --> 03:24:34,940
you look at the six primary cannabinoids

5034
03:24:32,450 --> 03:24:36,980
that this paper is talking about CBD and

5035
03:24:34,940 --> 03:24:39,440
THC actually kind of have almost

5036
03:24:36,979 --> 03:24:41,270
negative inhibition I think CBD has you

5037
03:24:39,440 --> 03:24:43,130
know certain like you know 25 30 percent

5038
03:24:41,271 --> 03:24:46,221
inhibition of one of the enzymes but

5039
03:24:43,129 --> 03:24:48,890
when you look at CBG and CBG a you know

5040
03:24:46,220 --> 03:24:50,299
they both have their there on there they

5041
03:24:48,890 --> 03:24:51,949
Rictor kind of like all the other

5042
03:24:50,299 --> 03:24:54,049
cannabinoids potential to inhibit those

5043
03:24:51,950 --> 03:24:56,870
enzymes and have almost up to 100%

5044
03:24:54,049 --> 03:24:58,699
inhibition on those two enzymes and so

5045
03:24:56,870 --> 03:25:00,410
it's really fascinating to kind of you

5046
03:24:58,700 --> 03:25:03,050
know think about and postulate you know

5047
03:25:00,409 --> 03:25:05,060
you know anti-inflammation I guess in

5048
03:25:03,049 --> 03:25:07,069
treating illness you know because most

5049
03:25:05,060 --> 03:25:08,690
disease and disorder and one way or

5050
03:25:07,069 --> 03:25:11,239
another is rooted in some type of

5051
03:25:08,690 --> 03:25:13,340
systemic inflammation you know and so

5052
03:25:11,239 --> 03:25:15,088
you know just kind of understanding how

5053
03:25:13,340 --> 03:25:17,309
many people across

5054
03:25:15,088 --> 03:25:20,219
in the world you know are taking horse

5055
03:25:17,309 --> 03:25:22,408
pills of these non-steroidal anti and

5056
03:25:20,219 --> 03:25:24,599
anti inflammatory drugs and then you

5057
03:25:22,408 --> 03:25:26,878
know long-term how much those drugs do

5058
03:25:24,600 --> 03:25:29,189
damage you know to your kidneys and

5059
03:25:26,879 --> 03:25:30,479
liver and such is like yeah well you

5060
03:25:29,189 --> 03:25:32,699
know there's also some of these other

5061
03:25:30,478 --> 03:25:34,498
NSAIDs a bunch of years ago and it

5062
03:25:32,699 --> 03:25:36,390
wasn't that long ago maybe five eight

5063
03:25:34,498 --> 03:25:38,189
years ago but they started realizing

5064
03:25:36,389 --> 03:25:40,559
with some of these cox-2 inhibitor drugs

5065
03:25:38,189 --> 03:25:42,029
these NSAIDs they're giving people heart

5066
03:25:40,559 --> 03:25:43,889
attacks right like they were there on

5067
03:25:42,029 --> 03:25:45,209
the market and then they realize that

5068
03:25:43,889 --> 03:25:48,260
like a whole bunch of people that have

5069
03:25:45,209 --> 03:25:50,579
way higher incidence of heart problems

5070
03:25:48,260 --> 03:25:53,549
yeah you know and so it's like for these

5071
03:25:50,578 --> 03:25:56,010
non-psychoactive kind of CPG components

5072
03:25:53,549 --> 03:25:57,930
of cannabis to be able to completely you

5073
03:25:56,010 --> 03:26:00,389
know knock that out and inhibit those

5074
03:25:57,930 --> 03:26:02,369
enzymes it's like that's so much way it

5075
03:26:00,389 --> 03:26:04,978
seems like the path forward to creating

5076
03:26:02,369 --> 03:26:06,838
like the miracle anti-inflammation drugs

5077
03:26:04,978 --> 03:26:08,338
or the future but it's like where do

5078
03:26:06,838 --> 03:26:10,350
those where those compounds you know

5079
03:26:08,338 --> 03:26:11,699
it's like I don't mean here's the next

5080
03:26:10,350 --> 03:26:13,949
question I mean we're gonna be smoking

5081
03:26:11,699 --> 03:26:15,569
those things are they gonna become you

5082
03:26:13,949 --> 03:26:18,168
know they can become formulations and

5083
03:26:15,568 --> 03:26:20,609
other and other products right it's uh

5084
03:26:18,168 --> 03:26:23,969
it's it's it's part of that transition

5085
03:26:20,609 --> 03:26:25,588
that the medical marijuana industry is

5086
03:26:23,969 --> 03:26:27,148
gonna go through is that at some point

5087
03:26:25,588 --> 03:26:28,529
in time a lot of these things are gonna

5088
03:26:27,148 --> 03:26:30,599
be its connect listen it's gonna be like

5089
03:26:28,529 --> 03:26:32,069
up a dialect right like somebody's gonna

5090
03:26:30,600 --> 03:26:34,408
take CPG and they're gonna put it

5091
03:26:32,068 --> 03:26:35,908
through the FDA process and then the FDA

5092
03:26:34,408 --> 03:26:37,648
is gonna start sending out a bunch of

5093
03:26:35,908 --> 03:26:39,628
letters to everybody that's making CVG a

5094
03:26:37,648 --> 03:26:41,309
or C BG products on the market right

5095
03:26:39,629 --> 03:26:42,600
like we've already been through this

5096
03:26:41,309 --> 03:26:44,278
once this whole thing is gonna happen

5097
03:26:42,600 --> 03:26:49,078
over and over again with every one of

5098
03:26:44,279 --> 03:26:51,209
these compounds right so yeah it's rinse

5099
03:26:49,078 --> 03:26:52,439
lather repeat pretty much it is rich

5100
03:26:51,209 --> 03:26:54,029
rather but it's like this and this is

5101
03:26:52,439 --> 03:26:56,729
what happens when we bring cannabis into

5102
03:26:54,029 --> 03:26:59,399
the real world right like we're gonna

5103
03:26:56,728 --> 03:27:03,719
start trying to exploit these compounds

5104
03:26:59,398 --> 03:27:06,328
for fun we we start entering the world

5105
03:27:03,719 --> 03:27:11,398
that's you know it's a different world

5106
03:27:06,328 --> 03:27:12,988
than to the dispensary world right and I

5107
03:27:11,398 --> 03:27:14,398
think we should I think with good reason

5108
03:27:12,988 --> 03:27:17,338
you know I think we should be wary of

5109
03:27:14,398 --> 03:27:19,769
people saying I've got this you know

5110
03:27:17,338 --> 03:27:24,359
Green crack variety for example with 2%

5111
03:27:19,770 --> 03:27:27,539
CPG a I mean 2% CBG a by weight of a

5112
03:27:24,359 --> 03:27:28,449
gram I mean really like is that the way

5113
03:27:27,539 --> 03:27:31,569
that you're gonna beat a

5114
03:27:28,449 --> 03:27:34,449
that is smoked it up a joint of like a

5115
03:27:31,568 --> 03:27:36,578
2% CBG a variety yeah and then whenever

5116
03:27:34,449 --> 03:27:38,408
you burn it it combusts like half to

5117
03:27:36,578 --> 03:27:42,818
more of what's there so it's like the

5118
03:27:38,408 --> 03:27:44,109
potential 20 laughs yeah there's

5119
03:27:42,818 --> 03:27:45,548
something that's really been helping me

5120
03:27:44,109 --> 03:27:47,289
of speaking inflammation I've been

5121
03:27:45,549 --> 03:27:48,489
dealing with some inflammatory pain and

5122
03:27:47,289 --> 03:27:50,289
like repetitive motion injuries just

5123
03:27:48,488 --> 03:27:52,208
from my job there and carpal tunnel

5124
03:27:50,289 --> 03:27:54,279
issues and and Washington stare

5125
03:27:52,209 --> 03:27:55,509
dispensaries got taken away from us and

5126
03:27:54,279 --> 03:27:58,029
our medical marijuana program was

5127
03:27:55,509 --> 03:27:59,828
decimated so now pills like this to

5128
03:27:58,029 --> 03:28:01,509
contain high amounts of CBG without any

5129
03:27:59,828 --> 03:28:03,128
THC and them are illegal in Washington

5130
03:28:01,509 --> 03:28:04,449
State I can't purchase these so I have

5131
03:28:03,129 --> 03:28:06,129
to go back to the black-market

5132
03:28:04,449 --> 03:28:07,930
to obtain medicines that actually

5133
03:28:06,129 --> 03:28:09,969
provide like cannabinoid therapy for me

5134
03:28:07,930 --> 03:28:12,789
so what's the what's the source of that

5135
03:28:09,968 --> 03:28:13,868
sleepy in those pills then that's a

5136
03:28:12,789 --> 03:28:15,699
super good question I don't have an

5137
03:28:13,869 --> 03:28:17,649
answer to it I don't know I don't have a

5138
03:28:15,699 --> 03:28:19,119
verified lab report to know the details

5139
03:28:17,648 --> 03:28:20,918
of what it is because our marketplace

5140
03:28:19,119 --> 03:28:24,338
has taken those products off the shelves

5141
03:28:20,918 --> 03:28:27,068
re so have you had those pills analyzed

5142
03:28:24,338 --> 03:28:28,689
no I haven't I only got ten of them to

5143
03:28:27,068 --> 03:28:31,628
try out and I didn't have the money to

5144
03:28:28,689 --> 03:28:33,430
go send them to a lab yeah well that's

5145
03:28:31,629 --> 03:28:35,020
this again it's the regime it's the

5146
03:28:33,430 --> 03:28:36,668
system right every time we want to know

5147
03:28:35,020 --> 03:28:39,009
what's in our medicine we got to go and

5148
03:28:36,668 --> 03:28:40,029
pay for a lab test right but we could

5149
03:28:39,009 --> 03:28:42,248
have a marketplace that allows

5150
03:28:40,029 --> 03:28:44,020
cannabinoid medicines to be produced in

5151
03:28:42,248 --> 03:28:45,818
502 and then go to these same testing

5152
03:28:44,020 --> 03:28:47,049
labs that we send all our other products

5153
03:28:45,818 --> 03:28:48,519
to and put on the shelf for people to

5154
03:28:47,049 --> 03:28:50,649
use as medicines but for whatever reason

5155
03:28:48,520 --> 03:28:52,359
Washington State decided their products

5156
03:28:50,648 --> 03:28:54,578
that are sold at retail stores have to

5157
03:28:52,359 --> 03:28:56,890
contain THC and so that knocked out a

5158
03:28:54,578 --> 03:28:58,208
really big variety of actual medicines

5159
03:28:56,889 --> 03:29:00,099
that really helped a lot of people like

5160
03:28:58,209 --> 03:29:01,539
me and patients I used to make medicines

5161
03:29:00,100 --> 03:29:03,609
for and work with back in the mid days

5162
03:29:01,539 --> 03:29:05,319
here yeah one let's don't get me wrong

5163
03:29:03,609 --> 03:29:06,789
again I'm not trying to come off sending

5164
03:29:05,318 --> 03:29:09,458
all farmer that way everything's got to

5165
03:29:06,789 --> 03:29:11,529
be FDA approved but what I'm not okay

5166
03:29:09,459 --> 03:29:13,899
with is people putting products in

5167
03:29:11,529 --> 03:29:17,859
markets and say they are CBD and then

5168
03:29:13,898 --> 03:29:19,628
they're not absolutely spent money on a

5169
03:29:17,859 --> 03:29:22,209
CBG product they're helping me want to

5170
03:29:19,629 --> 03:29:26,020
actually help that's extracted from a

5171
03:29:22,209 --> 03:29:29,409
plant source and at CBG a [ __ ] anything

5172
03:29:26,020 --> 03:29:31,509
there's some THC a or THC in it yeah I

5173
03:29:29,408 --> 03:29:35,199
was told at each of these fills as 110

5174
03:29:31,509 --> 03:29:38,468
milligrams of CBG 35 milligrams of THC a

5175
03:29:35,199 --> 03:29:41,329
and about 10 milligrams of THC v and it

5176
03:29:38,468 --> 03:29:45,119
was created from an old toby varietal

5177
03:29:41,329 --> 03:29:46,799
my might be right on fault I know right

5178
03:29:45,120 --> 03:29:48,030
and I have no reason to doubt it but I

5179
03:29:46,799 --> 03:29:49,739
also don't have any reason to trust you

5180
03:29:48,030 --> 03:29:51,360
because I don't have a lab report for us

5181
03:29:49,739 --> 03:29:53,190
right well that's the thing right so

5182
03:29:51,360 --> 03:29:54,810
it's like you could work on the stuck in

5183
03:29:53,190 --> 03:29:57,060
a tough situation where when you don't

5184
03:29:54,809 --> 03:29:58,649
have anything any reason to doubt it but

5185
03:29:57,059 --> 03:30:00,750
that doesn't mean that you also have any

5186
03:29:58,649 --> 03:30:03,149
reason to believe it I mean we're still

5187
03:30:00,750 --> 03:30:04,920
stuck in the middle with my own bioassay

5188
03:30:03,149 --> 03:30:07,260
where I was not able to get a night's

5189
03:30:04,920 --> 03:30:09,000
sleep I'd wake up at 3:00 4:00 a.m. and

5190
03:30:07,260 --> 03:30:11,159
my arms would be either asleep or

5191
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:12,600
burning and now after a week of taking

5192
03:30:11,159 --> 03:30:14,039
these pills I sleep all the way through

5193
03:30:12,600 --> 03:30:17,489
the night I wake up my arms are on fire

5194
03:30:14,040 --> 03:30:19,530
with all those compounds in it and it

5195
03:30:17,489 --> 03:30:21,719
being a mixture I mean it's probably got

5196
03:30:19,530 --> 03:30:23,970
Terps in there too it's like how do you

5197
03:30:21,719 --> 03:30:25,770
pinpoint what the active in which if it

5198
03:30:23,969 --> 03:30:27,389
was even once they see the compound or

5199
03:30:25,771 --> 03:30:29,010
if it's the variety of course the

5200
03:30:27,389 --> 03:30:30,599
synergies between all of them I mean we

5201
03:30:29,010 --> 03:30:32,430
don't know that and that's like that's

5202
03:30:30,600 --> 03:30:34,649
really what we're missing in this world

5203
03:30:32,430 --> 03:30:37,139
is the science right then pack all this

5204
03:30:34,649 --> 03:30:39,930
stuff up does everything work on

5205
03:30:37,139 --> 03:30:41,549
products like this and your labs and get

5206
03:30:39,930 --> 03:30:43,500
tested you know exactly what's in them

5207
03:30:41,549 --> 03:30:47,279
and then deliver those to patients and

5208
03:30:43,500 --> 03:30:48,540
consumers in them yeah well works you

5209
03:30:47,280 --> 03:30:49,980
feel like someone works and all of a

5210
03:30:48,540 --> 03:30:52,110
sudden it's done it's pulled off the

5211
03:30:49,979 --> 03:30:54,180
market right it's like the whole

5212
03:30:52,110 --> 03:30:57,650
situation is really kind of silly right

5213
03:30:54,180 --> 03:30:59,790
now I mean it's it's it is a very tough

5214
03:30:57,649 --> 03:31:01,649
question to answer because there's all

5215
03:30:59,790 --> 03:31:04,920
these compounds in them in the plants

5216
03:31:01,649 --> 03:31:06,930
and you know maybe not in one given

5217
03:31:04,920 --> 03:31:08,579
plant but in the in the species and in

5218
03:31:06,930 --> 03:31:11,550
the selection of plants that we all work

5219
03:31:08,579 --> 03:31:13,500
with you know there's you know whether

5220
03:31:11,549 --> 03:31:14,789
it be different terpene types or

5221
03:31:13,500 --> 03:31:18,120
different cannabinoid types

5222
03:31:14,790 --> 03:31:21,420
it's a massive poly factorial doesn't

5223
03:31:18,120 --> 03:31:24,090
like experiment with hundreds of

5224
03:31:21,420 --> 03:31:25,590
thousands of people at least and they're

5225
03:31:24,090 --> 03:31:27,329
all taking different amounts and they're

5226
03:31:25,590 --> 03:31:28,860
all taking different things and some

5227
03:31:27,329 --> 03:31:31,110
people are having success and some

5228
03:31:28,860 --> 03:31:34,890
people aren't having success and that's

5229
03:31:31,110 --> 03:31:36,390
a really hard nut to crack from a it's

5230
03:31:34,889 --> 03:31:37,739
really hard not to crack from a research

5231
03:31:36,389 --> 03:31:39,479
point of view to start figuring these

5232
03:31:37,739 --> 03:31:41,760
things out especially when the people

5233
03:31:39,479 --> 03:31:43,409
aren't having success don't know for

5234
03:31:41,760 --> 03:31:45,090
sure what they're taking and whether

5235
03:31:43,409 --> 03:31:48,569
they should be having success with it or

5236
03:31:45,090 --> 03:31:50,370
not yeah hey I like what do you got

5237
03:31:48,569 --> 03:31:53,190
going on there maybe Marcus can click

5238
03:31:50,370 --> 03:31:53,850
your camera and we can yeah yeah no I

5239
03:31:53,190 --> 03:31:54,899
was uh

5240
03:31:53,850 --> 03:31:56,610
this is that

5241
03:31:54,899 --> 03:31:58,529
I was talking about you know from this

5242
03:31:56,610 --> 03:32:01,110
paper it's called evaluation of the

5243
03:31:58,530 --> 03:32:02,700
cyclooxygenase inhibiting effects of six

5244
03:32:01,110 --> 03:32:04,860
major cannabinoids isolated from

5245
03:32:02,700 --> 03:32:08,641
cannabis sativa and you know the black

5246
03:32:04,860 --> 03:32:10,801
bar is co Cox one and then the gray bar

5247
03:32:08,640 --> 03:32:13,229
is cox-2 so it shows the you know

5248
03:32:10,800 --> 03:32:15,479
percent inhibition of each one of these

5249
03:32:13,229 --> 03:32:17,029
cannabinoids and and it is a trip

5250
03:32:15,479 --> 03:32:19,109
because like if you look at THC and CBD

5251
03:32:17,030 --> 03:32:20,341
and have almost out of this your

5252
03:32:19,110 --> 03:32:22,560
negative in addition which I don't even

5253
03:32:20,341 --> 03:32:24,420
really know that means but then when you

5254
03:32:22,560 --> 03:32:27,720
look at the acidic cannabinoids you know

5255
03:32:24,420 --> 03:32:31,110
as THC a CBD a and then even more see

5256
03:32:27,720 --> 03:32:34,220
and see eg a it's crazy how much CBG and

5257
03:32:31,110 --> 03:32:36,960
CBG a have for both cox-1 and cox-2

5258
03:32:34,220 --> 03:32:39,449
inhibitor inhibiting you know both these

5259
03:32:36,959 --> 03:32:41,489
kind of enzymes up to you know almost a

5260
03:32:39,450 --> 03:32:43,230
hundred percent well look at the other

5261
03:32:41,489 --> 03:32:45,720
thing that's really interesting to me at

5262
03:32:43,229 --> 03:32:47,489
least on that graph is that the acidic

5263
03:32:45,720 --> 03:32:48,989
forms which are the ones that are

5264
03:32:47,489 --> 03:32:52,409
natural in the plant that you find when

5265
03:32:48,989 --> 03:32:55,409
you don't decarboxylate through you know

5266
03:32:52,409 --> 03:32:57,630
chemistry or you don't smoke it I mean

5267
03:32:55,409 --> 03:33:00,420
those those compounds are it looks like

5268
03:32:57,630 --> 03:33:02,279
you know THC a CB da and CB GA are more

5269
03:33:00,420 --> 03:33:03,060
effective than any of the other the

5270
03:33:02,280 --> 03:33:04,591
neutral forms

5271
03:33:03,060 --> 03:33:05,640
ya know exactly and that's been such a

5272
03:33:04,591 --> 03:33:07,440
trip too because you know it's it's

5273
03:33:05,640 --> 03:33:09,810
fascinating with them you can someone is

5274
03:33:07,440 --> 03:33:11,221
so so often and this is a bit aside but

5275
03:33:09,810 --> 03:33:12,750
I mean I think it ties in a little bit

5276
03:33:11,220 --> 03:33:14,579
to the point but you know so many times

5277
03:33:12,750 --> 03:33:16,380
like people that are making infused

5278
03:33:14,579 --> 03:33:18,810
products you know they're taking like

5279
03:33:16,380 --> 03:33:21,390
some type of extract right from like a

5280
03:33:18,810 --> 03:33:23,101
quote sativa or quotes indica strain

5281
03:33:21,390 --> 03:33:25,920
right with certain terpenes dominant in

5282
03:33:23,101 --> 03:33:28,051
the each and they decarboxylate that oil

5283
03:33:25,920 --> 03:33:29,550
so pretty much they boil off any and

5284
03:33:28,050 --> 03:33:31,229
Alden remaining terpenes that are there

5285
03:33:29,550 --> 03:33:34,229
so they create is like a fully

5286
03:33:31,229 --> 03:33:36,600
decarboxylated you know kind of Delta 9

5287
03:33:34,229 --> 03:33:38,819
THC extract that then they're infusing

5288
03:33:36,601 --> 03:33:40,739
into an edible or infused product and

5289
03:33:38,819 --> 03:33:42,659
they're heating further to make the

5290
03:33:40,739 --> 03:33:44,579
edible or if these product and but then

5291
03:33:42,659 --> 03:33:46,890
they're labeling these products like you

5292
03:33:44,579 --> 03:33:48,329
know an indica edible or a sativa edible

5293
03:33:46,890 --> 03:33:50,520
you know and it's funny because I feel

5294
03:33:48,329 --> 03:33:53,130
like there's so much you know it's

5295
03:33:50,521 --> 03:33:54,841
almost like suggestive selling and and

5296
03:33:53,130 --> 03:33:56,520
like trying to push people's placebo

5297
03:33:54,841 --> 03:33:58,069
effects because you know most of these

5298
03:33:56,521 --> 03:34:00,271
products where people will take a strain

5299
03:33:58,069 --> 03:34:02,851
decarboxylate oil put it in call it a

5300
03:34:00,271 --> 03:34:04,771
sativa indica sativa or indica edible

5301
03:34:02,851 --> 03:34:07,319
you know they're kind of really what it

5302
03:34:04,771 --> 03:34:08,460
is is just high THC and I think you know

5303
03:34:07,319 --> 03:34:10,649
so much of like why

5304
03:34:08,459 --> 03:34:13,319
affects somebody one way or another more

5305
03:34:10,649 --> 03:34:14,489
has to do with dose and then yeah the

5306
03:34:13,319 --> 03:34:16,289
time of day they're taking it whether

5307
03:34:14,489 --> 03:34:17,670
they're taking on an empty stomach or a

5308
03:34:16,290 --> 03:34:20,670
full stomach whether or not they have a

5309
03:34:17,670 --> 03:34:22,440
hyperactive or under active metabolism

5310
03:34:20,670 --> 03:34:24,000
whether or not they're like sedentary

5311
03:34:22,440 --> 03:34:25,530
and you know playing video games all day

5312
03:34:24,000 --> 03:34:27,000
long or whether or not they have a you

5313
03:34:25,530 --> 03:34:28,409
know an active lifestyle where they're

5314
03:34:27,000 --> 03:34:29,489
running all the time because all those

5315
03:34:28,409 --> 03:34:30,420
things are gonna express your

5316
03:34:29,489 --> 03:34:33,329
endocannabinoids

5317
03:34:30,420 --> 03:34:35,399
in one way or another and how active or

5318
03:34:33,329 --> 03:34:37,620
underactive it is but but but whenever

5319
03:34:35,399 --> 03:34:39,750
you kind of you know but for whenever

5320
03:34:37,620 --> 03:34:42,930
people are taking like these you know

5321
03:34:39,750 --> 03:34:44,760
acidic cannabinoids you know like in

5322
03:34:42,930 --> 03:34:47,159
these high concentrations or what have

5323
03:34:44,760 --> 03:34:48,630
you you know not only does it seem like

5324
03:34:47,159 --> 03:34:50,250
it you know from this chart it shows

5325
03:34:48,629 --> 03:34:52,439
that you know they're inhibiting and you

5326
03:34:50,250 --> 03:34:54,540
know these these enzymes but you know

5327
03:34:52,440 --> 03:34:57,000
also in whatever people are juicing or

5328
03:34:54,540 --> 03:34:59,460
or you know doing like unheated kind of

5329
03:34:57,000 --> 03:35:01,799
extracts put in to kind of infused

5330
03:34:59,459 --> 03:35:04,409
product so that it's all in the THC or

5331
03:35:01,799 --> 03:35:06,389
CBD a form they're also then actually

5332
03:35:04,409 --> 03:35:08,399
getting whatever concentrations of

5333
03:35:06,389 --> 03:35:09,959
terpenes are in there into the infused

5334
03:35:08,399 --> 03:35:12,180
product that people are then ingesting

5335
03:35:09,959 --> 03:35:14,849
and so it's it's interesting to think

5336
03:35:12,180 --> 03:35:17,700
about you know what a true kind of you

5337
03:35:14,850 --> 03:35:20,130
know plant derived terpene infused

5338
03:35:17,700 --> 03:35:22,710
product what that would do if it does

5339
03:35:20,129 --> 03:35:25,109
you know stimulate a stimulating effect

5340
03:35:22,709 --> 03:35:27,149
or a sedating effect but then how much

5341
03:35:25,110 --> 03:35:29,729
those terpenes also play a role maybe

5342
03:35:27,149 --> 03:35:32,069
and you know what's happening here with

5343
03:35:29,728 --> 03:35:40,049
these kind of inhibition of these you

5344
03:35:32,069 --> 03:35:41,039
know inflammatory enzymes but ya know i

5345
03:35:40,049 --> 03:35:43,019
just find it really funny though because

5346
03:35:41,040 --> 03:35:45,479
pee a lot of people kind of always say

5347
03:35:43,020 --> 03:35:47,790
indica sativa in their edibles whenever

5348
03:35:45,478 --> 03:35:50,250
it's pretty much just THC you know but

5349
03:35:47,790 --> 03:35:51,510
you know i and and and you know often

5350
03:35:50,250 --> 03:35:54,090
times when i'm doing kind of a lot of

5351
03:35:51,510 --> 03:35:55,680
education seminars for like dispensaries

5352
03:35:54,090 --> 03:35:57,899
and bud tenders you know i'm trying to

5353
03:35:55,680 --> 03:35:59,670
kind of really always show this slide

5354
03:35:57,899 --> 03:36:00,899
cuz i'm like you know this is the you

5355
03:35:59,670 --> 03:36:03,239
know the acidic cannabinoids are the

5356
03:36:00,899 --> 03:36:05,129
most if you counted all the kind of

5357
03:36:03,239 --> 03:36:08,069
cumulative cannabinoids that are held in

5358
03:36:05,129 --> 03:36:10,769
your shop you know it's all THC a or CBD

5359
03:36:08,069 --> 03:36:12,600
a primarily THC a but nobody's ever

5360
03:36:10,770 --> 03:36:14,670
guiding people towards taking those

5361
03:36:12,600 --> 03:36:16,770
whether it's you know juicing fresh

5362
03:36:14,670 --> 03:36:19,020
butter leaf whether it's grinding up

5363
03:36:16,770 --> 03:36:21,000
fresh bud putting it like in a smoothie

5364
03:36:19,020 --> 03:36:21,710
or something or or whether that's eating

5365
03:36:21,000 --> 03:36:24,500
little mound

5366
03:36:21,709 --> 03:36:26,899
of you know on heat processed kind of

5367
03:36:24,500 --> 03:36:28,760
extracts that are more high in acidic

5368
03:36:26,899 --> 03:36:31,039
cannabinoids but in either way it seems

5369
03:36:28,760 --> 03:36:33,110
like we all could benefit so much more

5370
03:36:31,040 --> 03:36:34,490
from acidic cannabinoids you know

5371
03:36:33,110 --> 03:36:36,440
especially you know with the

5372
03:36:34,489 --> 03:36:38,539
anti-inflammation effects you know

5373
03:36:36,440 --> 03:36:40,040
particularly because of you know how

5374
03:36:38,540 --> 03:36:41,840
most disease in disorder

5375
03:36:40,040 --> 03:36:43,640
you know rooted in systemic inflammation

5376
03:36:41,840 --> 03:36:45,530
and that's typically because the [ __ ]

5377
03:36:43,639 --> 03:36:48,170
food choices we put into our bodies and

5378
03:36:45,530 --> 03:36:49,760
the toxic environment we live in and you

5379
03:36:48,170 --> 03:36:51,829
know the [ __ ] chemicals that we

5380
03:36:49,760 --> 03:36:53,600
expose ourselves to because you know the

5381
03:36:51,829 --> 03:36:55,789
pesticides and [ __ ] diphosphate

5382
03:36:53,600 --> 03:36:57,409
better and everything but you know it

5383
03:36:55,790 --> 03:36:59,360
seems like they say the cannabinoids

5384
03:36:57,409 --> 03:37:01,399
provide a roadmap for us to help you

5385
03:36:59,360 --> 03:37:04,760
know dr. Courtney who is he gave me my

5386
03:37:01,399 --> 03:37:08,659
first or I got my first recommendation

5387
03:37:04,760 --> 03:37:10,280
from dr. William Courtenay was kind of

5388
03:37:08,659 --> 03:37:12,379
this like black sheep medical doctor you

5389
03:37:10,280 --> 03:37:15,260
know that ruins really like how many

5390
03:37:12,379 --> 03:37:16,369
ways like the you know the I mean is it

5391
03:37:15,260 --> 03:37:17,840
so funny because he wouldn't be

5392
03:37:16,370 --> 03:37:19,910
presenting and obviously cute Andrew so

5393
03:37:17,840 --> 03:37:21,889
like blocking at him liking in crowds

5394
03:37:19,909 --> 03:37:23,090
where he was presenting but you know he

5395
03:37:21,889 --> 03:37:24,709
was way ahead of his time you know and

5396
03:37:23,090 --> 03:37:26,780
he turned me on to acidic cannabinoids

5397
03:37:24,709 --> 03:37:28,069
you turn me on the CBD you know whenever

5398
03:37:26,780 --> 03:37:29,930
I was living up in mindo and really

5399
03:37:28,069 --> 03:37:31,399
sparked passion in my life about it and

5400
03:37:29,930 --> 03:37:33,590
so since then I've just been really

5401
03:37:31,399 --> 03:37:36,289
pushing people to like you know look at

5402
03:37:33,590 --> 03:37:37,579
the the diverse profile of cannabinoids

5403
03:37:36,290 --> 03:37:39,290
that you could be taking because most

5404
03:37:37,579 --> 03:37:43,069
people are you know puffing it getting

5405
03:37:39,290 --> 03:37:45,430
high THC is I mean but like we need more

5406
03:37:43,069 --> 03:37:47,959
of these like what he would call dietary

5407
03:37:45,430 --> 03:37:49,520
essential cannabinoids in her life you

5408
03:37:47,959 --> 03:37:51,769
know and he believes that you know one

5409
03:37:49,520 --> 03:37:53,780
day society will view the acidic

5410
03:37:51,770 --> 03:37:55,340
cannabinoids as much of a dietary

5411
03:37:53,780 --> 03:37:57,380
essential as you know we're currently

5412
03:37:55,340 --> 03:38:00,110
considering the Omega acids you know

5413
03:37:57,379 --> 03:38:02,329
that being kind of you know keeping our

5414
03:38:00,110 --> 03:38:05,900
life you know in the preventative kind

5415
03:38:02,329 --> 03:38:09,289
of state of not being too inflamed well

5416
03:38:05,899 --> 03:38:11,270
if I I mean I'm all over what you're

5417
03:38:09,290 --> 03:38:14,390
saying I just I want to just say one

5418
03:38:11,270 --> 03:38:17,300
thing about the inflammation being the

5419
03:38:14,389 --> 03:38:19,399
genesis of all the all the disease that

5420
03:38:17,299 --> 03:38:21,199
may or may not be true right it's tough

5421
03:38:19,399 --> 03:38:25,100
to say whether the inflammation is the

5422
03:38:21,200 --> 03:38:26,479
cause or like a byproduct of so Ryan

5423
03:38:25,100 --> 03:38:27,829
correlations not causing I would

5424
03:38:26,478 --> 03:38:30,619
definitely just be careful when you're

5425
03:38:27,829 --> 03:38:32,389
saying that um at dispensaries cuz I

5426
03:38:30,620 --> 03:38:34,120
don't know we know that to be true yet

5427
03:38:32,389 --> 03:38:36,340
or not but

5428
03:38:34,120 --> 03:38:39,579
I do agree with with almost everything

5429
03:38:36,340 --> 03:38:42,430
you said nice and you know what Courtney

5430
03:38:39,579 --> 03:38:45,159
you know history will be the history

5431
03:38:42,430 --> 03:38:47,710
will be the the teller of what happens

5432
03:38:45,159 --> 03:38:51,399
over time you know whether he's a kook

5433
03:38:47,709 --> 03:38:53,169
or a visionary and Emily and I know I

5434
03:38:51,399 --> 03:38:55,239
know that some people see him that way

5435
03:38:53,170 --> 03:38:57,700
and you know he does say some kind of

5436
03:38:55,239 --> 03:39:01,869
kooky things at times as well but I

5437
03:38:57,700 --> 03:39:03,430
think he also has a lot of he's got a

5438
03:39:01,870 --> 03:39:05,110
lot of good information and he stumbled

5439
03:39:03,430 --> 03:39:06,790
on something that I think a lot of

5440
03:39:05,110 --> 03:39:08,829
people probably weren't looking at

5441
03:39:06,790 --> 03:39:11,830
because again we've been so focused on

5442
03:39:08,829 --> 03:39:13,389
on the neutral forms for the

5443
03:39:11,829 --> 03:39:15,579
cannabinoids I mean even in the way we

5444
03:39:13,389 --> 03:39:17,979
used to do everything by GC right like

5445
03:39:15,579 --> 03:39:19,750
you know back then you'd look at a GC

5446
03:39:17,979 --> 03:39:22,600
trace and you'd say you'd think yourself

5447
03:39:19,750 --> 03:39:24,940
ah well the Catholic plant produces THC

5448
03:39:22,601 --> 03:39:27,610
well it doesn't produce it produces THC

5449
03:39:24,940 --> 03:39:29,980
acid it's what the analytical method

5450
03:39:27,610 --> 03:39:32,200
that they were using you know makes it

5451
03:39:29,979 --> 03:39:36,520
seem that way but you know again we got

5452
03:39:32,200 --> 03:39:38,740
to apply the right tasks to the you know

5453
03:39:36,521 --> 03:39:40,780
to be able to pull the answer at the

5454
03:39:38,739 --> 03:39:42,459
true answer and so it's not just like

5455
03:39:40,780 --> 03:39:45,340
throwing some science at it we're gonna

5456
03:39:42,459 --> 03:39:46,779
get the answer right there's you

5457
03:39:45,340 --> 03:39:48,819
remember science is like anything it

5458
03:39:46,780 --> 03:39:51,220
needs to be validated it needs to be it

5459
03:39:48,819 --> 03:39:53,110
needs to be shown over time by multiple

5460
03:39:51,219 --> 03:39:55,170
sources it's not just one paper that

5461
03:39:53,110 --> 03:39:57,579
says something and it's the truth right

5462
03:39:55,170 --> 03:40:02,351
it's a discovery that we go through over

5463
03:39:57,579 --> 03:40:04,659
time third so great info Alec thanks for

5464
03:40:02,351 --> 03:40:06,909
sharing that man oh yeah very very good

5465
03:40:04,659 --> 03:40:09,399
information good conversation last hour

5466
03:40:06,909 --> 03:40:11,619
of hash Church just blasting it out I

5467
03:40:09,399 --> 03:40:14,379
love it hey Marc I found that paper and

5468
03:40:11,620 --> 03:40:15,490
put it in the our little or hangouts

5469
03:40:14,379 --> 03:40:17,259
chat I don't know if you can post that

5470
03:40:15,489 --> 03:40:20,110
on the other in the in the YouTube chat

5471
03:40:17,260 --> 03:40:22,960
so people can find the paper they don't

5472
03:40:20,110 --> 03:40:25,989
have the resources or access to looking

5473
03:40:22,959 --> 03:40:31,599
those things up absolutely I'll post it

5474
03:40:25,989 --> 03:40:34,430
I will post it right now

5475
03:40:31,600 --> 03:40:37,670
okay came on Alec you always spur a

5476
03:40:34,430 --> 03:40:39,979
really good conversation that's glad you

5477
03:40:37,670 --> 03:40:41,930
stopped dead no thank you and yeah no

5478
03:40:39,978 --> 03:40:43,159
super appreciate appreciate everything

5479
03:40:41,930 --> 03:40:45,590
always appreciate being on and

5480
03:40:43,159 --> 03:40:47,750
appreciate being checked man like you

5481
03:40:45,590 --> 03:40:49,309
know it's like do and yeah Ryan that's

5482
03:40:47,750 --> 03:40:51,290
what's so awesome man is like you're

5483
03:40:49,309 --> 03:40:53,059
you're super indiscriminate with like

5484
03:40:51,290 --> 03:40:55,430
science being the way forward and and

5485
03:40:53,059 --> 03:40:58,309
the way you word things you know and so

5486
03:40:55,430 --> 03:40:59,988
so I appreciate that because yeah I mean

5487
03:40:58,309 --> 03:41:02,659
there's a lot of contributing factors to

5488
03:40:59,988 --> 03:41:05,000
why disease and disorders exist

5489
03:41:02,659 --> 03:41:07,818
exclamations part but main one may not

5490
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:09,889
be the main proponent so thank you on

5491
03:41:07,818 --> 03:41:11,148
that yeah well as much as we know we got

5492
03:41:09,889 --> 03:41:12,829
to remember that we really don't know

5493
03:41:11,148 --> 03:41:14,449
anything and it with how the human body

5494
03:41:12,829 --> 03:41:16,129
works and how the brain works I mean

5495
03:41:14,450 --> 03:41:17,899
we've got a few things figured out and

5496
03:41:16,129 --> 03:41:19,459
but really when we're throwing these

5497
03:41:17,898 --> 03:41:21,349
compounds and we're just like flipping

5498
03:41:19,459 --> 03:41:23,148
levers and pressing buttons you know oh

5499
03:41:21,350 --> 03:41:24,710
look what happens here and we don't

5500
03:41:23,148 --> 03:41:27,019
really understand all the mechanisms

5501
03:41:24,709 --> 03:41:29,478
involved and I think that that's also

5502
03:41:27,020 --> 03:41:31,880
important to keep in mind I'm you know

5503
03:41:29,478 --> 03:41:34,068
it's like everywhere you see all this

5504
03:41:31,879 --> 03:41:35,778
stuff and the in the in the average

5505
03:41:34,068 --> 03:41:38,478
median out the scientific literature but

5506
03:41:35,779 --> 03:41:40,399
it's just in the media but even you know

5507
03:41:38,478 --> 03:41:42,409
cannabis kills cancer and it's like well

5508
03:41:40,398 --> 03:41:44,449
there might be some compounds that have

5509
03:41:42,409 --> 03:41:46,398
certain anti-cancer properties against

5510
03:41:44,450 --> 03:41:48,500
certain types of cancer but to say that

5511
03:41:46,398 --> 03:41:52,219
you know cannabis kills cancer it's just

5512
03:41:48,500 --> 03:41:54,109
not true and it does it does the plant

5513
03:41:52,219 --> 03:41:57,379
at the service when we when we try to

5514
03:41:54,109 --> 03:41:59,300
over generalize and I find that we're

5515
03:41:57,379 --> 03:42:01,670
like you know that at that point in time

5516
03:41:59,299 --> 03:42:03,709
we're no better than the DEA saying that

5517
03:42:01,670 --> 03:42:07,460
there's no value right because the truth

5518
03:42:03,709 --> 03:42:11,719
is somewhere in the middle and I think

5519
03:42:07,459 --> 03:42:15,169
less like trying to reach too far it

5520
03:42:11,719 --> 03:42:16,760
really does the the truth but it does

5521
03:42:15,170 --> 03:42:18,318
the truth a disservice for one but it

5522
03:42:16,760 --> 03:42:22,728
also does the planted the service

5523
03:42:18,318 --> 03:42:24,260
because it really can do some things and

5524
03:42:22,728 --> 03:42:26,299
if we start claiming that it can do all

5525
03:42:24,260 --> 03:42:27,529
these other things that it can't do then

5526
03:42:26,299 --> 03:42:30,519
people are gonna they're not gonna

5527
03:42:27,529 --> 03:42:34,010
believe the things that it can do right

5528
03:42:30,520 --> 03:42:35,210
didn't explain that very well but you

5529
03:42:34,010 --> 03:42:36,738
know no you're right I mean by

5530
03:42:35,209 --> 03:42:38,629
overstating you know and be too

5531
03:42:36,738 --> 03:42:41,119
fanatical about what we're trying to

5532
03:42:38,629 --> 03:42:43,309
express you know definitely is food or

5533
03:42:41,120 --> 03:42:45,859
like you know whatever food for

5534
03:42:43,309 --> 03:42:50,510
for like the opposition to kind of

5535
03:42:45,859 --> 03:43:03,920
discredit argument yeah we have a moral

5536
03:42:50,510 --> 03:43:06,350
responsibility I want to thank everyone
