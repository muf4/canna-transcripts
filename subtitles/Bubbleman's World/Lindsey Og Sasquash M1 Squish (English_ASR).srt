00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:12,388
hey welcome everybody to bubble man's

3
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:15,029
world I am here today just for a short

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,429
little video got the m1 all turned on

5
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:19,140
and up and I'm gonna press a little Ross

6
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,698
and have him pressed a little rosin for

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,230
a bit figured I would share a little

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:28,618
video of doing that and 19 to 20 grams

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,449
of some I guess I would call it between

10
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,759
a three and a four star there's a melt

11
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,520
to it it's Lindsay oh gee it's very

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,619
potent and it should squished rather

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,469
well the growers well-known and he

14
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:43,558
generally produces a lovely variety of

15
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:46,020
resin heads now he does mix a lot of his

16
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,058
hash so this hash isn't one micron it's

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,520
probably gonna be 45 all the way up to

18
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,409
120 and generally if you look close

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,800
enough you can usually see that there's

20
00:00:52,409 --> 00:01:00,538
there's some variety in there but too

21
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:02,069
sure if you guys can see that but I have

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,109
a feeling like that we should maybe

23
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,700
press it up what do you guys say shall

24
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:09,478
we weigh it out on the scale here real

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:15,770
quick and get it pressed I grabbed a

26
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:19,049
business card got the business card

27
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:22,969
alright I find this just the easiest way

28
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,409
when loading the resin into your screen

29
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:29,879
it's a simple thing like that gives you

30
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:35,299
the ability to to pouch up to kind of

31
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:38,489
dig right in and drop it right down I

32
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:41,280
suspect we're gonna get a good I don't

33
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:43,709
know maybe 10 grams of this pressed in

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,960
one shot so we'll see what happens the

35
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:48,750
largest amount I've ever pressed a

36
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:53,250
bubble for those interested was a 40

37
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,959
gram chunk that I did some time ago d

38
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,228
for 20 K might have been there it's hard

39
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,000
for me to remember exactly but it was a

40
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:03,509
big Prats I actually did it in the

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,340
original D nail press as well and got a

42
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:05,718
decent return

43
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,549
you know with these presses I hear

44
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:09,859
people constantly saying Oh get this one

45
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:12,019
get this one get that one you know get

46
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,239
one that you feel is you know for me

47
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:16,099
it's a whole it's a whole thing I love

48
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,620
the customer service that I get from the

49
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:21,469
Sasquatch people that's a big part of

50
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,959
where I'm gonna use mice mice my where

51
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:25,818
I'm gonna put my money I like the fact

52
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,110
that the unit is really well made and

53
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:29,389
works really well

54
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,940
now I constantly hear from people who

55
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:33,619
tell me oh you know you should get this

56
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:36,019
one you should get this one and I asked

57
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,509
them well what does it do that's better

58
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:40,879
is it getting a bigger extraction is it

59
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:42,979
preserving the flavors and the terpenes

60
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,840
is it doing it faster because those

61
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:47,238
three things let's be honest would be

62
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,670
the only three things that could

63
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,789
potentially well that is one smidge

64
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:57,399
under ten grams so we're gonna do a ten

65
00:02:52,789 --> 00:03:03,109
grammar get that little bit in there oh

66
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:14,000
yeah ten point Oh ten point Ellen we're

67
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:18,700
gonna show you all right so we got ten

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,810
point Oh on the screen very well

69
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:24,078
generally what we'll do now is we'll

70
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:27,289
figure out getting the hash into all of

71
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:34,419
the corners you don't want to let those

72
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:37,310
corners in any way shape or form get to

73
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:40,669
have hollow little holes you want them

74
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,469
to be full full full so and then a

75
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:49,189
little bit of a pre-press is never a bad

76
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:52,310
idea at all all right okie dokie well I

77
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:54,829
got my little packet here Maebh tiny

78
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,598
little bit of air in the in the corner

79
00:03:54,829 --> 00:04:02,230
there that's I could probably do a

80
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:04,668
little better with but there we go

81
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:07,068
pretty excited about this little squish

82
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:11,019
I'm not gonna lie we've got everything

83
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:11,018
pretty much set up on the unit here

84
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:28,689
all right I'm gonna have this put up

85
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:32,389
here yes down here this could be serious

86
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:35,329
get a serious squish going on here I'm

87
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:37,939
using the hand pump which is the SPX

88
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:41,258
power team right here you can see how

89
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:44,180
effective it is as a lowering or down

90
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:46,009
and then I guess what I'd like to do as

91
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,470
well as maybe just push that in a tiny

92
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:49,810
bit all right so I got the temperature

93
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,850
turned up a little bit

94
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:56,120
220 sometimes they do a 180 a 190 or 200

95
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,820
this is fairly warm for hash but we're

96
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:04,509
gonna get a full full extraction from it

97
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:06,978
so without further ado why don't we so

98
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:11,839
you know that the first little sort of

99
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:13,339
pre-press trying to see that I actually

100
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,519
gonna put you guys into a better

101
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:19,269
position here so you can really see

102
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,269
what's going on

103
00:05:37,550 --> 00:06:03,710
all right we're bubbling up a storm here

104
00:05:41,360 --> 00:06:06,860
people all right beautiful the hash

105
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:08,899
feels completely empty I can't even tell

106
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,569
you what this bag feels it feels like

107
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:13,569
there's just nothing left in it

108
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:28,769
all right so I've got a nice return here

109
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:32,409
clearly we've got a beautiful squish

110
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:34,599
looks great always happy to squish hash

111
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,360
you can see the way it just squishes out

112
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,250
that was the warmest I've squished in a

113
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,710
while it'll be interesting to see what

114
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:47,040
kind of flavor profile we get off this

115
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:52,439
and I guess what we need to do now is

116
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,439
grab a dabber and start collecting

117
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:08,949
sitting back so there we go that's what

118
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:12,519
we got right there a little bit of rosin

119
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:15,599
so let's put it on the parchment let's

120
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:24,669
find out what we got here

121
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:30,210
any takers for grams we got four grams

122
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:34,509
out of the first press not bad at all I

123
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:37,419
doubt there's much left but for the sake

124
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:41,289
of testing why don't we just take this

125
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:44,140
little guy and flip them in upside you

126
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:47,530
know give one of these a little bit

127
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:52,439
sticky little bit of schtick we'll just

128
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:52,439
give it another another little press

129
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:02,000
[Music]

130
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:12,520
right away which is always a good sign

131
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,069
yes starting to squeeze out a little bit

132
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:17,919
more I suspect we're gonna get that gram

133
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:23,370
plus that's gonna bump us over the 50%

134
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,370
range we'll see what happens

135
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:40,019
always good to do a second run for this

136
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:43,040
very reason alone you never know what

137
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,039
you're gonna get out of it

138
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,929
and I keep them separate obviously my

139
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:51,929
first and my second press always get

140
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:54,199
kept secret separately oh it's coming

141
00:08:51,929 --> 00:09:05,489
out the sides of the press as well so

142
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:14,460
it's a good press right a quick short

143
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:19,440
press for that what I think and what

144
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:24,240
have we got here I guess it wasn't MP I

145
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:27,750
guess it wasn't empty holy [ __ ] that's a

146
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,590
real nice press right there so without

147
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:36,299
further ado let's collect it all right

148
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:39,810
so we got another little rock of rosin

149
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:43,139
from that so we shall throw that on the

150
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:44,399
scale let's see what kind of return

151
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,199
we're getting I'm feeling pretty good

152
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:57,120
that we're well about 50% I'll tell you

153
00:09:46,200 --> 00:10:00,680
that much all right you see the lovely

154
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,480
color too when you get it thin enough

155
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:07,259
darker when it fit when it gets into one

156
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:12,389
chunk but it's dark ash as well so all

157
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:18,569
right so we got one point six for the

158
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:21,569
first one three point nine five point

159
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,850
five we got fifty five percent returns

160
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,640
oh she wrote I guess I could put this in

161
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,810
a little let me get this disc top for

162
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,809
you I think it's worth it

163
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,019
that's crazy

164
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:42,610
look at that there's your color right

165
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:44,899
there oh snap

166
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,879
time to put that bat away in the freezer

167
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:50,860
and get it sorted all right so we

168
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:54,259
managed to get that Lynsey og disk

169
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:56,450
pressed out it's got that amber hashey

170
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:58,129
kind of color it's it's you know it's

171
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:01,310
obviously been heated up a little bit

172
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:03,860
more but man I'll tell you the Terps are

173
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:05,359
on point no burnt popcorn smell it's

174
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,430
incredible how warm you can actually

175
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,080
press some of this stuff and I you know

176
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:10,909
generally when I do a first press and

177
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,060
I've got a lot of something I'll press

178
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:15,919
it pretty hot like a 210 220 and that

179
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:18,469
will let me know exactly what my yield

180
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,179
is what's actually there to get and from

181
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,769
there I can go back down and decide okay

182
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:25,039
right now we're gonna do a press

183
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:27,439
actually and we're gonna press at 205

184
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,299
and you know I'll keep going down to 195

185
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,120
to 180 once I have all the different

186
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:34,189
varieties of hash truly only then will I

187
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,139
be able to decide which one I prefer for

188
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,300
that particular cultivar because believe

189
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:42,710
it or not there are some cultivars that

190
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:44,569
are so terpene rich that the excess heat

191
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,340
it just changes it up a little bit it

192
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,860
activates a little bit of the THC it

193
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,389
keeps some of it not active and once

194
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,730
again it just produces another wonderful

195
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:55,279
thing for our quiver so when you're out

196
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:59,420
there trying to lock yourself into a one

197
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,220
or another mentality remember that it's

198
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:03,949
a quiver and you can do as many

199
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,680
different options as you like so don't

200
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:10,220
forget that that's our second chunk of

201
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:13,759
rosin but got another little batch here

202
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:17,149
to press this one is a seven gram or so

203
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:20,330
chunk and it's pretty pretty solid I've

204
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:21,980
been pressing it in my fingers here to

205
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,259
get it going but I think we're gonna

206
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,600
just have to wait for this timer so once

207
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:28,100
the timer's done we'll go we'll go for

208
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,080
it you know I figured while we were

209
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,259
waiting I could hit a little bit of this

210
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:42,370
second give me an idea what this is all

211
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:44,929
about this Lim's EOG focus there we go

212
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:48,940
there we go it's focusing on the wrong

213
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:53,689
thing it's all good let's check out this

214
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:56,030
you can see as we get it into strings

215
00:12:53,690 --> 00:13:01,100
it's a much nicer color almost that

216
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:02,360
really golden you know trippy I don't

217
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,519
know if you guys have seen this with

218
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:14,600
rosin but it does this really kind of

219
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:17,600
cool well that was kind of fun I got my

220
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,440
dab on the lens man I got that dab on

221
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,740
the lens

222
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:25,100
all right well listen the temperature is

223
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:28,940
almost down I figure it's about that

224
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:32,680
time for us to take any little rip in

225
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,680
the ball let's check it out it is

226
00:13:49,769 --> 00:14:18,370
Lindsay Wow I will tell you it's like a

227
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:21,270
champ we will put this in here and get

228
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:39,459
you guys a little bit of a better view

229
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:41,079
was that better yeah Pachi yeah pretty

230
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:47,139
close to the edge hopefully we don't get

231
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:54,610
any push out we will see let's get into

232
00:14:47,139 --> 00:15:00,370
it it's wanting to push it out I can

233
00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:01,810
tell I think we're gonna maintain now as

234
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,940
long as we don't blow out we'll be

235
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:05,919
laughing of course the worry of a

236
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:10,420
blowout is putting the pouch too close

237
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:16,689
and then what happens is it gets pinched

238
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:18,579
between the edges of the press so always

239
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:22,560
a good idea to be careful and wary of

240
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:28,440
that as you're applying more pressure

241
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:28,439
nice and gently great color on this

242
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,509
seven grand press so it's gonna be a

243
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,509
little bit less than last time obviously

244
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:43,459
my fat head out of the way and maybe

245
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:46,639
we'll get a nice a nice view of this

246
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:50,328
press it's coming out all around that's

247
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:59,899
for sure at the minute and thirty second

248
00:15:50,328 --> 00:16:03,109
point just let it let it come out this

249
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:05,750
is a substantially cooler 15 degrees

250
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,269
cooler than the last press and you can

251
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:13,458
see a little bit of it in the color for

252
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:17,948
sure that's swirly beautiful mess clear

253
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:17,948
domes missus Bob went out

254
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,798
[Music]

255
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:09,569
although so you can see they're a nice

256
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:11,190
fat press rosin hair there but yeah nice

257
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:13,429
fat press let's pick it up and see what

258
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,430
we got

259
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:45,500
very nice once again picked up quite

260
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,500
lovely

261
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:57,160
that's rosin where

262
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:12,150
really nice it's pretty sweet roses 3

263
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:15,389
grams so once again just under 50% on

264
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:29,460
the first press what happens when we

265
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:33,930
take it and we press it again it should

266
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:37,049
squeeze nice for us oh look at that

267
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:39,590
she's flowing just a matter of looking

268
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:42,359
away for a little bit

269
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:54,539
laying around with a nice gold cube of

270
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:57,329
rosin oh yeah damn here push that up

271
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:58,950
against the screen - you know what I got

272
00:18:57,329 --> 00:19:02,909
them - down with this one - this one

273
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:04,710
just looks absolutely delicious let's

274
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:13,519
just do a little dab of that one show it

275
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:13,519
just a little one all right

276
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:57,029
all right feels a little bit dryer ever

277
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,349
getting another little bit off of our

278
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,639
second press not quite as much as we

279
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:01,859
thought up that second press in the

280
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,680
first batch but you know definitely

281
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:08,279
worth collecting nonetheless pretty

282
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:13,460
stoked got jeez must have gotten like

283
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:18,059
five and a half eight about nine grams

284
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:20,880
and we pressed out about maybe 17 grams

285
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:23,819
so definitely stoked on that I think my

286
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,420
friends gonna be pretty happy and thanks

287
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:26,419
for watching everybody
