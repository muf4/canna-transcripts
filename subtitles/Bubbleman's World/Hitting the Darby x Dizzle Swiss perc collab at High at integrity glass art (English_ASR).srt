00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,199
I'm sitting here from with Martin from

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,679
rure and we're over at high integrity

5
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,279
glass Arts which uh you have to admit

6
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:31,159
some of the pieces we've seen up to date

7
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:33,600
have

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,000
been the best I ever seen yeah

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,679
completely Beyond stellar and right at

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,359
the end he's like oh did I show you my

11
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,679
wife's new piece and he pulls this out

12
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:44,878
and I'm like I don't know why I am so

13
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,519
impressed with this but man this is one

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,359
of my favorites that he show me and so

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,320
this is uh a Darby Nate Dizzle uh

16
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:57,280
collaboration uh this is uh the cactus

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,719
dcro that uh that um Darby is uh known

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,719
for smallest twiss perk I've ever seen

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,320
uh Dizzle Swiss Park I don't know what

20
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,040
the the red color is called and then of

21
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:11,118
course uh Rose slapped on an elite

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,640
Bucket from Mothership so it just fits

23
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,799
so beautifully I think uh I think I'm

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,478
going to maybe uh have a little

25
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:22,159
dab Let's see we got the torch right

26
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:24,158
here I really have this affinity for the

27
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,400
smaller piece I appreciate the smaller

28
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,880
and smaller pieces you know I know the

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,680
uh well the cups we were looking at

30
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,879
those are small pieces they're by no

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,680
means what I would call a large piece

32
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:39,118
but it's interesting to

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,240
see all right there we go kind what do

34
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,239
you got going on with this torch

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:50,280
here no more guas maybe out of gas it's

36
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:51,718
possible that's okay is this the only

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,960
other one right

38
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:56,359
here gas technical difficulties here

39
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,239
we're going to be getting some gas right

40
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:01,759
away I could move the phone and take

41
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,519
that other torch I'm balancing my phone

42
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,840
up against the other torch right now

43
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,439
which is quite ridiculous so here oh

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,239
look at this you've got torches man high

45
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:16,479
integrity glass doesn't mess around

46
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:19,400
so yep that's the

47
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,919
one all right we'll get that dab

48
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,280
prepared and we'll have the whole thing

49
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,878
uh all sorted out dab being held off

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,759
camera there you want to pass that dab

51
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,039
over

52
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,280

56
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,598
guy someone was uh criticizing me today

57
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:46,359
on uh YouTube saying that I I was

58
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:48,679
hitting the hash too fast and that I

59
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,000
would get a better taste if I waited and

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,519
I don't think he understood that I was

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,759
hitting hash instead of oil but here we

62
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:54,760
go
