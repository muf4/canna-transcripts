5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,189

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,480
if more people are coming into the room

7
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:19,100
I'm not sure who's in the room because

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,660
they don't actually see any talking yet

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,570

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,310

35
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,519
private beach behind the tennis court

36
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,439
over here some beautiful epic trees what

37
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,879
I thought we would do was we could have

38
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,438
a little session you guys want to get

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,959
your pipes u-joints whatever it is

40
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:34,798
you're puffing on and we could have a

41
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,688
little session together yeah you know

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,610
this banger is actually a banger that

43
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:41,008
goes with the product for mr. hot box

44
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:42,750
that sits on the beam it sits like on

45
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,859
top of it and then the beam heats it up

46
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,840
there's a little piece of metal that

47
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,359
goes under here so I've never actually

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,320
used this banger with a torch so I may

49
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,780
get a hot dab

50
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,789

64
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:33,589
our generally friends of mine unless I

65
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:36,078
specifically say that it's mine this is

66
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,519
the Jamaican dude with the wind blower

67
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:39,349
he was just wind lowing for about an

68
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,658
hour and a half straight I finally had

69
00:02:39,348 --> 00:02:43,939
to ask him when are you gonna stop wind

70
00:02:41,658 --> 00:02:45,769
blowing leaf blowing and so he told me a

71
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:48,139
little bit ago within five minutes he

72
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:49,969
quit but I think he's now already

73
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:52,729
forgotten and he's coming back around

74
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:54,919
the side of the building to to do some

75
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:56,750
more blowing so we'll just deal with it

76
00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:01,759
it's jamaica style I'm gonna hit the

77
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:03,229

we're wondering if you don't mind I

90
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,019
don't really know you know I've got

91
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,609
pieces that are old that could be worth

92
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,919
25 or 30 thousand dollars

93
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:46,340
he definitely grows ganja he offered me

94
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:49,819
some ganja earlier and he definitely is

95
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,348
oh nice nice toaster girl here well I

96
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:57,339
better hit this so I'm gonna have to do

97
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:59,719
a little bit um I got this today from

98
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,169
from uncle stoner I'm not sure if you

99
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:04,818
guys are familiar with uncle stoner but

100
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:08,919
he lent me this torch today I went to

101
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:08,918
saw him he was just leaving back for us

102
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,009
just bang on clean give it 20 seconds or

103
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:18,009
so

104
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,160
we're gonna trot in there that's smoke

105
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:26,300
it out I like to keep it nice and clean

106
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,250
sometimes when I'm puffing in Jamaica

107
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,720
it's a little bit hard with lack of BC

108
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,509
glass cleaner I do have a whole thing of

109
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,370
q-tips but what I'm feeding hits out to

110
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:37,189
a lot of people I find that it

111
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:40,579
definitely becomes difficult to keep it

112
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:44,449
as clean as I would like to just with

113
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:49,098
myself all right we'll get that off now

114
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:51,889
we'll go forty to fifty to two so yeah

115
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:54,668
about fifty seven forty and I will hit

116
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:59,538
this at and I guess I better get a dab

117
00:04:54,668 --> 00:05:02,240
little cookies and cream you know I love

118
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:03,709
the tech temp USA check them out if you

119
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,960
haven't already I think that's the way

120
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:09,799
to go personally their little unit is a

121
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:11,388
laser thermometer it sits right

122
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,310
underneath your banger you roll your

123
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:14,960
banger over it or you roll it under your

124
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,389
banger and I'm telling you it is the

125
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,719
most accurate rip I've gotten from a

126
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:26,478
torch there's no comparing even

127
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:28,370
absolutely no comparing it's hard to say

128
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,079
you know I can't tell if this bangers

129
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,908
gonna hold heat or release heat so I'm

130
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,550
even gonna get probably because I'll

131
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:36,379
wait longer than I then then I would you

132
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,060
know I'm not gonna go too quick I'll

133
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:41,509
probably get a low temp tab before I get

134
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,530
a real hot one so let's check it out

135
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:44,530
here I think we're good to go

136
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:07,369
damn you're perfect no Chaz still a

137
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:09,860
liquid in the bottom I use vape pen see

138
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,680
how they're convenient I'd rather hit

139
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:16,300
this every day of every minute but if I

140
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,300
got whoo you know I'll hit a vape pen

141
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:24,230
that was perfect absolutely perfect I'm

142
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,500
excited because I'm about to walk you

143
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,270
guys around this property now I figured

144
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,740
that's what I do for a live video I'm

145
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:33,289
gonna try and film some videos with the

146
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,340
4k camera and the GoPro and you know

147
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,510
give you guys a little bit of a show

148
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:37,849
that way but I thought you know what

149
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:39,829
sometimes I never get around to editing

150
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,439
and sometimes it just takes so long and

151
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:44,209
I know how much people appreciate seeing

152
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:47,120
things in the moment when they're

153
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:50,359
happening proof is that we have 175

154
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:55,810

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:11,689

163
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:19,579
you know what let's be honest it ain't

164
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,689
happening there are some beautiful trees

165
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:22,370
over there but this is all the better

166
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:24,379
reason for us to just have a couple of

167
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,410
puffs and have a conversation and I can

168
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:29,930
film this place with my 4k GoPro and

169
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,450
camera you know maybe go do some some

170
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,478
fully checking out the property and then

171
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:37,699
you'll be able to check it out on on

172
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,560
YouTube that way because right now this

173
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,509
is not the best way to share I guess I'm

174
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,800
yeah I found the sweet spot exactly so

175
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:46,788
I'm gonna stay in the sweet spot so we

176
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,728
don't go paused again all right we lost

177
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:51,379
almost half of our viewers when it went

178
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:54,620
down like that a lot of people just have

179
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:58,939
no understanding of how tenacious and

180
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,360
committed I am to to pumping it that's

181
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:02,660
right

182
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,069
organics for life so I'm sure a lot of

183
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,450
you guys have seen the conversation

184
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:07,250
that's out and about about Philo's

185
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:08,688
Biosciences and a lot of things that

186
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,119
genomics

187
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:12,769
this one's you know omics are saying we

188
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:15,979
all released something from the de m

189
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:17,348
Peter family today I'm not sure to check

190
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:19,758
that out on histogram a lot of

191
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:22,428
statements were made but I don't think

192
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,788
it was really strong and we need to

193
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:27,948
promote you know conscious no-till

194
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:30,318
organic regenerative farming because

195
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:32,990
these are the expressions that we want

196
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,199
our hashes and our extraction processes

197
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:38,269
so yeah I think the statement was there

198
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:40,038
there is some confusion in regards to

199
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:42,589
what actually happened some people are

200
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:47,028
thinking that Center that Mowgli and his

201
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:48,800
team basically know took samples from

202
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:50,750
everyone and then tissue cultured those

203
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,698
samples and are growing those genetics

204
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,139
that that did not happen that's that's

205
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,458
not something that's happening so people

206
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:56,750
are able to pissed off about that even

207
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:59,378
though it didn't happen but the thing

208
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:02,539
that did happen is they did request

209
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:06,800
genetic sampling DNA sampling from all

210
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:10,188
these 4,000 Plus you know samples that

211
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,359
everyone gave and then they announced

212
00:09:10,188 --> 00:09:13,490
just a little while ago the different

213
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,720
being as though they're claiming that

214
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,459
the breeding have anything to do with

215
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,110
the genetics they collected but the

216
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,578
community feels as though that's not the

217
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,579
truth and a lot of people feel a little

218
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:28,458
a little bummed out about that I'm not

219
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:31,188
sure if we're still online here are we

220
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:32,958
still online I think it's turning I

221
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:34,490
don't really think that we're online

222
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:39,278
we'll check it out I'll be patient I'll

223
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,278
wait otherwise I'll make another cheers

224
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:47,210
140 people

225
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,860
you're live ok cool cuz right now it's

226
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,629
doing this in the middle of my screen so

227
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,000
it seems like it's not live but I'll

228
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:53,840
just keep going with it

229
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,399
so that's kind of one of the

230
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,750
conversations I want to do a hash Church

231
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,100
where we can get a bunch of the people

232
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,250
who really have an idea what they're

233
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,560
talking about when it comes to this and

234
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,850
and have an open conversation about it

235
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:08,449
on hash Church because I think hash

236
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:10,670
church is really a great platform for us

237
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:13,100
to get to get together and that there's

238
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:15,169
no there's no team hash Church is not a

239
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,460
team it's a it's a combination of all

240
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:18,709
the people from the community and we're

241
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,620
not for or against it's just a matter of

242
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,870
having the conversation I think that one

243
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,669
of the problems with the society today

244
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,980
is that when we have when we make

245
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:32,419
mistakes when we do things that are

246
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:34,070
looked down upon society people want to

247
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:34,879
hold those people in that energy forever

248
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,379
they don't even want to have

249
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,730
conversations about it there's certain

250
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:39,320
things nowadays you can't even have a

251
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,360
conversation about that's why so many

252
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,950
comedians are not touring colleges

253
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,419
because that's really where this whole

254
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,400
thing started they started in

255
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:49,219
universities and colleges they compel

256
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,639
speech they pass laws and then they get

257
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,620
to define what is hate and what is you

258
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,539
know okay to talk about and what is not

259
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,340
okay to talk about I'm a firm believer

260
00:10:56,539 --> 00:11:00,889
that everything should be talked about

261
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,389
if possible not a really big deal I

262
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:04,129
think that even if you disagree with

263
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:05,809
someone greatly that you should still be

264
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:08,029
able to sit across a table from them

265
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:12,229
without slinging insults and talking

266
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:14,419
down to them and getting into into war

267
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,879
basically that which is what people do

268
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:20,299
it's I've fallen into it myself I'm not

269
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:22,429
saying I'm void of it but yeah don't

270
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:22,879
move it it's so good I'm not moving it

271
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:25,459
bro

272
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:27,080
yeah Church must survive I agree you

273
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,730
know it's not something I can do every

274
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:33,520
Sunday especially when I'm in countries

275
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:37,009
like Jamaica but it's still pretty cool

276
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,980
yeah I saw the Adam Dunn show had it the

277
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:41,840
past two weeks and I did enjoy it you're

278
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,539
right actually that's that's true I just

279
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,490
think that the hash Church like I think

280
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:48,889
I watched the Adam Dunn and it seemed

281
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,950
very one-sided it didn't seem like too

282
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:54,439
many people were representing Philo's I

283
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,759
think mildly called in one time and lots

284
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,350
of other people called in and it was

285
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,700
cool and I like that idea

286
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,800
cuz that's something hashed Church can't

287
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,509
do so shout out to Adam Dunn for being

288
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,829
able to put that together and I was on I

289
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:08,450
was in the chat room I almost I almost

290
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:10,400
called in as well but just inviting kind

291
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,890
of the key component people that are

292
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,649
involved in passing this information

293
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:17,389
whether positive or negative yeah like

294
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,360
I'd like to talk to I'd like to have

295
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:22,220
Kevin Jodrey I'd like to have Kevin

296
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,710
mckernon MOG Lee Holmes

297
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,230
you know maybe chimera maybe Dave Watson

298
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,150
maybe Rob Clark you know like I think

299
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,590
that would be a pretty incredible panel

300
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,539
and then maybe a few other people that I

301
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,430
don't quite know about yet and I learned

302
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:37,789
also have a deep knowledge of this and

303
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:39,469
have a deep understanding has Church

304
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:42,349
really feels I can't

305
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,970
I missed you sorry feels it more of a

306
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,350
think tank with the educated people in

307
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,759
the right area with no [ __ ] yeah

308
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,980
it's kind of like a think tank but at

309
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:50,809
the same time you guys are all a part of

310
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,909
it you know like I read the chatroom

311
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:56,269
throughout all of hashed shirts I have

312
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:58,819
for everyone and I engage and I bring up

313
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:00,470
your conversations if you ever notice

314
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,970
I'll say something that I read in the

315
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,850
chat room and I then I'll say you know

316
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:08,960
James MIT McDonough said how's Indra

317
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:11,420
these days do because that can just

318
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,860
Brian like you know promote cuz you guys

319
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:15,319
come up with that you're a part of the

320
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,550
discussion and I think it's what is one

321
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,350
of the hardest things about me doing

322
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:19,729
Hatcher's because I'm moderating I'm

323
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,590
interacting with all the people that are

324
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,269
in the room and I'm directing and kind

personal I message people hit me up on

331
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,539
Instagram like endlessly trying to

332
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,610
engage and I always say like listen come

333
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:42,500
into the YouTube chat room if you say

334
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:46,279
something good I'll repeat it and it can

335
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,710
it can help direct the conversation is

336
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:51,009
what a yearly family trip for me kid

337
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,009
Karl

338
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:57,579
157 we gotta get back up to 200 yeah I

339
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,190
learned about growing with soil good

340
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,350
call Kelvin Kevin yeah you should check

341
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,760
out well that's powerful to check out

342
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:09,370
but Dutch blooms is a good one to start

343
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:10,960
with Jesus Yeshua must be saved Mohammed

344
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,909
don't die from you and all others I

345
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,800
don't know about that I mean I'll leave

346
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:16,179
you be for now but if you keep spamming

347
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,120
the room with that I'll bounce you

348
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:21,129
pretty fast I mean I'm all about people

349
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,450
I think it's better to engage with the

350
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:24,340
conversation like if you want to save

351
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,350
Jesus and Muhammad and everyone like

352
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,360
just engage in the conversation at hand

353
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,590
and and somehow it'll be directed to

354
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,560
what you want to talk about but don't

355
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:36,100
just like go off top I can throw a big

00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:41,110

361
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,850
years hello Jim Bernardo from

369
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:12,310
didn't mean to send reading my indoor

370
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,870
gardening guide but thanks brother hello

371
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:16,679
from Asheville North Carolina that's

372
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:19,360
cool spot peat moss homemade compost

373
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,849
what are the actual general pros and

374
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,730
cons of indoor versus outdoor both are

375
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,470
done to perfection well right off the

376
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:29,379
bat you're never gonna grow cannabinoids

377
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,509
as cheaply in a field as you can in an

378
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:33,009
indoor grow so if you look at most

379
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:34,990
people don't think of the excessive

380
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:36,789
waste that it takes to grow cannabis for

381
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,460
water and electricity and all the

382
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:41,379
products and all that just packaging and

383
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,600
shipping it's just like it's a we gotta

384
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:45,220
do better than what we're doing and I

385
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,769
think I think that's what the Dragonfly

386
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,779
earth Madison Crew is you know being

387
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:51,340
conscious listening to the soil trying

388
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:53,220
to do the right things just it's really

389
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,960
simple you know you go back to the root

390
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,910
unintended and just take care of them

391
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,950
create these living soils these living

392
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:02,169
biomes that used to just be you know

393
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,910
nature until we destroyed and killed it

394
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,949
go back to protecting the

395
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:08,139
simple things allow these plants to

396
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:10,570
express themselves and maybe lower the

397
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:14,139
footprint on the environmental costs to

398
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,790
growing cannabis too much packaging in

399
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,590
the interest in industry absolutely I

400
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:20,019
mean in California how much how much

401
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:22,120
like those guys go through water like

402
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:23,649
crazy I'm sure for cannabis I mean they

403
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,629
probably some of the largest growers in

404
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,639
the world can only imagine how much

405
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:30,659
water they consume for growing cannabis

406
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,559
and Sun is absolutely where it's at and

407
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:36,129
packaging is a good idea

408
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:38,769
oh thanks London Ontario Trent Taylor go

409

417
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,329
I have been there California oil

418
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:05,589
extractor representing excellent welcome

419
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:07,779
I was wondering about mark the weed guys

420
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:10,419
he's still around you know mark the weed

421
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:13,389
guy disappeared I have no idea what

422
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:16,029
happened to mark the weed guy I he was

423
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,800
around constantly and all the time and

424
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:19,180
Benny kind of had like I had a

425
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:21,159
falling-out with him a little one I'm

426
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,630
not bad like if I saw him I wouldn't be

427
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,259
upset but he had a big falling out with

428
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,700
his his friends Remo and some other

429
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:29,619
people and then I don't know he I

430
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,230
believe he's married to a woman in China

431
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:33,909
so he's probably in China but he had a

432
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,710
strong social media following I'm

433
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,750
surprised you know he also was a cancer

434
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,549
survivor he's a pretty intense guy I met

435
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,680
him years ago when he was I think he'd

436
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:46,569
just finished slike putting his canter

437
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:48,610
into remission with cannabis oh there

438
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:50,679
will be rare 710 but nothing I can talk

439
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:54,569
about just yet but you know this second

440
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:57,250
I can I'll be dropping it like beats

441
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:59,169
their have basically printing filament

442
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,900
I'm not too sure about that especial

443
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,450
health risk in a distant in those in

444
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,610
those cartridges mostly around the coil

445
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,740
so the coil ends up being an alloy

446
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:10,329
instead of like a grade of titanium like

447
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,289
a grade 2 which would be like a pure

448
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:13,389
titanium

449
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:15,369
you've end up with an alloy and then the

450
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,740
alloy has these metals in it and those

451
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:19,479
those leech heavy metals as it gets hot

452
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,029
and cold hot and cold and absorbs oil

453
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,589
and releases eventually the oils pull

454
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:25,930
out these toxic heavy metals you can

455
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:28,119
look there's been an article or a paper

456
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:30,580
done at the John Hopkins University and

457
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:33,879
they did it I think on like the top 57

458
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:37,769
or 67 vaporizers and they found heavy

459
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,770
metal contaminants in most of the oil I

460
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:43,899
don't think the great gardener ever had

461
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,730
a YouTube channel to be honest but he

462
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,590
does work a big legal company now I

463
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:50,740
think he's a consultant for canopy

464
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:52,329
I thought suffered with depression in my

465
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,009
life I've been pretty lucky I've gotten

466
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:55,750
a little bit of anxiety when my father

467
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:58,058
was killed in a motorcycle accident with

468
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,130
his wife quite suddenly that caused me

469
00:18:58,058 --> 00:19:03,029
anxiety for some years and I kind of

470
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,830
understood what like anxiety was

471
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:07,690
definitely just tapping into that for a

472
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:11,699
very short period of time I could

473
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,700
understand the absolute and utter hell
