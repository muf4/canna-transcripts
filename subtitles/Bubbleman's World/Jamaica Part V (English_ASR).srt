2
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,679
which are chemical compounds now they

3
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:28,358
express that for a reason the plants

4
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:32,640
themselves are threatened either by a

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:35,440
disease or by sometimes by a predator or

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,280
for whatever environmental reason these

7
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:41,238
plants Express secondary metabolites

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,399
secondary metabolites are nothing but

9
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:44,799
chemical

10
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,359
compounds if you actually isolate them

11
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:50,839
and take them out they are as chemical

12
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,439
as much as a drunk can be a

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,680
chemical so we need to understand that

14
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:59,640
even though their origin and their

15
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,558
source is natural they are expressing

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,239
chemic

17
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,478
inside them and those chemical compounds

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,560
are the ones that we are actually

19
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,799
benefiting from when we're using it as a

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,320
neutraceutical so for whatever reason

21
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,560
that they've been there by Nature that

22
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:21,839
is really what we are trying to

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,400
capture and I said to you before that

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,439
for a neutraceutical for this um added

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,159
nutritional added health benefit that

26
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,319
knowledge is key where do we get get

27
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,600
that Knowledge from there are two

28
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,839
sources that we can get that Knowledge

29
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:40,959
from one is what I have described as

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,680
ethnomedicine and that is knowledge that

31
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,959
has come down from

32
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,960
Millennium and there are ethnomedical

33
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,759
practitioners or traditional medicine

34
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,559
practices from around the world there is

35
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,079
um AA and Nani type of traditional

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,039
medicines in India there are are African

37
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:00,959
medicines there are European medical um

38
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,280
systems there's traditional Chinese

39
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,319
medicines that's coming from

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,919
Millennia knowledge that particular herb

41
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,519
or plant is very good for a particular

42
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,159
ailment or as a

43
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,040
tonic that's not the only source of

44
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,959
knowledge there is the scientific way of

45
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:23,120
actually going and looking for plants

46
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,439
that may not necessarily have had that

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,120
history so there are many natural

48
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:32,439
sources that we don't use as medicinal

49
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,039
or neutraceutical does that mean that

50
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:37,878
they don't have that value no they have

51
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:39,598
they they also Express that same

52
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,439
secondary metabolites which might be of

53
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:45,079
benefit to human

54
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:50,280
health Marine sources are a perfect

55
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:54,720
example Jamaica has um our Waters of

56
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:58,840
marine Al algae and um various other

57
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:03,000
sponges and so on have not been yet

58
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:06,719
tapped we have our own plants 23% of our

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
endemic plants um are only found in

60
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,400
Jamaica not all of them are actually

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,680
used as

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,200
neutral if you don't eat it does that

63
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,120
mean that they don't have a benefit well

64
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,000
actually they might and that's where

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:25,280
science comes in we can actually test

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,280
them and see if they have um medicinal

67
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:31,359
value so whichever the two sources

68
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,878
that's one has captured whether you're

69
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,080
using traditional knowledge or whether

70
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,598
you're using a scientific route and have

71
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,959
discovered that there is a value in a

72
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:46,158
particular uh plant or or a a source of

73
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:48,799
um water or whatever then can we just

74
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,878
bottle it can we Market it can we take

75
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,280
it and put it into the market and call

76
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,318
it a

77
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,000
neutral that's really the question that

78
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,679
we're trying to answer in launching a

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,438
neutraceutical industry well my answer

80
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,840
to that is

81
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:05,639
no one should not do that if you are

82
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,280
talking about launching an industry that

83
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,359
is to last a long time and it's of

84
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,878
global

85
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,959
standards those products ought to have

86
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:20,399
two very very important facets to them

87
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,959
and that is safety proof of safety for

88
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,079
human

89
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:28,918
consumption and if possible proof of

90
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,719
efficacy um for whatever that product is

91
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,959
is it effic is for the claim that you're

92
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,560
making it to

93
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:39,120
be and what are some of those things

94
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,160
that you must have and how does it tie

95
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,439
in with

96
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,439
science so if a product is to have is to

97
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,918
be known as safe then it must let's

98
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,160
let's take a Agricultural

99
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:54,478
Product then we must know we must be

100
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,000
able to have good agricultural practices

101
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,199
associated with it we must have good

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,879
manufacturing processes associated with

103
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,000
it we must must be able to standardize

104
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,680
it and we must also show that it is safe

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,918
for human consumption and then of course

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,680
efficacy is to be able to

107
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:16,519
link whatever you're taking to show that

108
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,519
it has that added benefit to

109
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,918
it this Pro process here which I think

110
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,160
most of you might see is actually takes

111
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:29,000
you through a small process step it

112
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,800
actually shows you the value addition in

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,600
partnering with science so if you are

114
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,000
simply taking taking a plant that is

115
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:41,240
grown then you need to be able to

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,478
understand how agricultural processes

117
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,560
impact what's what the plant is

118
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:47,879
producing and remember we had discussed

119
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,120
about secondary metabolites these

120
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:53,680
secondary metabolites how are they

121
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,160
expressed as you change Seasons how are

122
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,199
they express how they varied as you

123
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,520
change the growing conditions and what

124
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,560
about if if you use organic versus

125
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,799
non-organic how are these secondary

126
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,120
metabolites

127
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,840
expressed and therefore we must have a

128
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,639
good understanding of those conditions

129
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:15,000
in order to have an industry that is

130
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,400
based purely on being able to reproduce

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,240
every time we need be to be able to

132
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,120
understand those

133
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,879
quantities the other thing that we must

134
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,759
be able to have is

135
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,759
sustainability for for that same

136
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,879
industry to be able to grow we need to

137
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,520
have all of these factors fully

138
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:36,038
understood

139
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:38,399
okay um and then the second step is

140
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:40,598
being able to take those plants if you

141
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:44,198
want to make an extract then being able

142
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:47,399
to take the extract using sence as much

143
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,720
as possible to to take those met ensure

144
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,918
that those secondary metabolites are

145
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,199
coming with you as you extract them and

146
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:56,000
being able to every single time being

147
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,240
able to link back and say what the

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,360
quantities are so those standardizations

149
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,759
are extremely important it's also

150
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,439
important to be able to have

151
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,720
traceability to be able to say what what

152
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,199
what your batch being able to trace to

153
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,160
where it came

154
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,319
from and then after that for proof of

155
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,120
efficacy to to go into the lab if you're

156
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,919
saying that a particular plant is is

157
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,319
very good as an antioxidant then you

158
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:24,359
need to prove it and then last of all to

159
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,360
be able to take it to the clinic now

160
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,639
clinical um evaluations are not

161
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,120
necessarily not necessary for all all

162
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,840
neutral products but if you go down that

163
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,240
route then we add value to your

164
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:39,918
product so where can we get all of this

165
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,120
done here in Jamaica at a laboratory

166
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:47,878
scale level there's UWI that engages in

167
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,000
both safety and efficacy um as well as

168
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,879
chemistry Department that does

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,759
quantifications biotechnology Center has

170
00:07:52,879 --> 00:08:00,080
engaged in both production at a invitro

171
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,199
level as well as product development um

172
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,519
and there's Utch and ncu there's your

173
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,560
tertiary institutes that engage in this

174
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:09,038
kind of res that you can partner with

175
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,560
and then once you develop at the lab

176
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,079
scale of course we need to be able to

177
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,199
take it to the pilot scale and that's

178
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,318
where SRC comes

179
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,240
in last of all I'm going to leave you

180
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,520
with three types of products there could

181
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,280
be three types of nutriceutical

182
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:25,560
one sort of a product that doesn't

183
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,878
necessarily claim a

184
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,680
nutritional or that doesn't claim a

185
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,839
medicinal value and you can put that out

186
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,719
without necessarily claiming in your

187
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,000
label that it isn't that has that added

188
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,320
value and then of course you can have

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,320
the second type which claims a medicinal

190
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,120
value and the third time which claims a

191
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,760
full um health benefit and medicinal

192
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,200
claim that has gone through the clinical

193
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,919
route and that brings us to the

194
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,160
regulations that Jamaica needs to to

195
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,479
undertake and our panelists hopefully

196
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,600
will also touch on some of those

197
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,839
regulations I know Ministry of Health is

198
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,320
here and they are are working on

199
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,680
amending some of the laws to to fit the

200
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,879
neutraceutical industry so I'm going to

201
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:11,319
leave you thank you for your

202
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:13,278
patience thank you very much we'll hold

203
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,000
all questions until later I'm also going

204
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,559
to ask our panelists to try and stick

205
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,639
within the 5 minute time frame as we

206
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:24,039
must commence official closing opening

207
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,319
ceremony at 2:30 Rupa alluded to the SED

208
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:27,759
research Council serving a primary

209
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,560
function in moving your products from

210
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,919
the lab stage with that of the

211
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,958
Industrial Level or to the Shelf we at

212
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:36,919
the S research Council has a long

213
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,518
history in developing interical related

214
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:42,399
products we formulated a number of te's

215
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,639
and number of other um products with and

216
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,000
know well established therapeutic

217
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,639
benefits and so forth I advise you to

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,278
just take a look at the S research

219
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,559
council's booth and get a clear idea in

220
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:57,120
terms of some of the stuff we are doing

221
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:59,518
also for most of the practitioners here

222
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,560
you'll find a line of products of to 10

223
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,480
major practitioners there in products on

224
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,799
display were actually developed by the

225
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,000
scien research Council so we have the

226
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:10,319
capacity we have the Know It All We Have

227
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,360
the technical expertise to move your

228
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,519
products from the exporter level to

229
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,680
actual products on the market with the

230
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,240
hope of it eliciting that part benefit

231
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,359
that you have planned at the onset so I

232
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,799
encourage you have a chat with your SRC

233
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,919
team and have a have some discussions

234
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,759
with our practitioners and exhibitors so

235
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,278
you be more aware of our capabilities

236
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:32,159
and competence

237
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,679
I am now going to move to a very

238
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,480
critical component and it has been a

239
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:38,439
vexed issue in Jamaica for years as

240
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,440
relates to protecting the intellectual

241
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:45,360
property at this point I'd like to

242
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:48,360
invite Mrs Bam to just give us

243
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,519
a m b to give you an overview in terms

244
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,039
of the services offered by Ja and how

245
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,159
they can assist you in protecting your

246
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,879
Innovations thank you so much Mr

247
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:59,439

presentation I have 5 minutes and I'm

252

info I nfo at

266
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:52,839
j.g. JM this is an area that we have

267
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:57,600
been doing work in at the international

268
00:11:52,839 --> 00:12:00,399
and the local level we actually um we

269
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,480
have we're far advanced in our work in

270
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,240
the Caribbean and in Jamaica in the area

271
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,320
of finding protection for our

272
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,240
traditional knowledge traditional

273
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,680
cultural expressions and our genetic

274
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,079
resources which deals with our subject

275
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:16,000
area today we actually have a draft

276
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,679
Regional treaty which is to be

277
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,198
considered by the heads with

278
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,000
responsibility for intellectual property

279
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:25,120
and then to be transferred to the heads

280
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,198
of government for them to give their

281
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,278
sign off on it which would mean that we

282
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:33,078
would be able to put local legislation

283
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:34,639
in place that looks at protecting from

284
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:36,799
the point of view of intellectual

285
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,320
property your rights associated with

286
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,198
traditional knowledge traditional

287
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,920
cultural expressions and genetic

288
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:46,359
resources this is a new area in terms of

289
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,879
intellectual property rights because

290
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,919
traditionally this area was looked at as

291
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,759
the common Heritage of

292
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:56,519
mankind but there has been a Thrust

293
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,519
internationally from local communities

294
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,879
and we have our local community that is

295
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:04,759
represented here today and we are all

296
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,720
aware of the recent passage of of the

297
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,639
amendment of the dangerous drugs act

298
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,120
which deals with one of our critical

299
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,159
genetic resources in Jamaica which is

300
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,120
one that can be protected under this

301
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,000
piece of legislation that will come into

302
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,720
be there are the other usual areas of

303
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,320
industrial property and intellectual

304
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,040
property which is trademarks patents

305
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,959
designs and copyright and related rights

306
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,679
which most persons in Jamaica are aware

307
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:32,599
of which deals with all forms of

308
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,399
literary works but in a nutshell that's

309
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,360
what intellectual property is about but

310
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,839

00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:43,719
jamro to be a part of the launch of this

337
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,839
really exciting

338
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:50,000
industry essentially jamro is all about

339
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,680
business what are we here for is how do

340
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,679
we develop this industry into an export

341
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:58,278
industry a sustainable industry as you

342
00:14:54,679 --> 00:15:01,599
heard from Dr Delora essentially the

343
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:06,198
global neutri ceuticals Market is valued

344
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,159
at over 207 billion US by 2016 that's

345
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:10,519
where it's supposed to grow to so it's a

346
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,240
huge Market I don't need to stress that

347
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:15,759
point the market is being driven by

348
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,399
Rising health care costs in Metropolitan

349
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,199
countries aging population growing

350
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,120
interest in Healthy Lifestyles and

351
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:25,519
natural products Beauty the whole beauty

352
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,318
industry and the desire to be younger

353
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,399
and healthier and live longer so that's

354
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:32,919
essentially what driving this industry

355
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,559
and I think Jamaica has a really

356
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:38,078
exciting opportunity here um

357
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:40,599
particularly in the R&amp;D that we have

358
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:43,198
behind the industry in The Innovation

359
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,199
and intellectual property as we've just

360
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,838
heard but most importantly I think in

361
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:51,039
establishing a total value chain from

362
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,279
field to Consumer which is the

363
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,480
opportunity that we really have here if

364
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,078
we seize it properly and if we develop

365
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,079
the proper Frameworks and legislative

366
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,719
structures that will allow us to grow

367
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,919
this industry internationally we think

368
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,120
there's opportunity for creation of new

369
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,439
Jamaican brands in healthcare and

370
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,360
branding is hugely important I think

371
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,720
because this is a heavily branded

372
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,000
industry this is an industry that big

373
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,920
farma has not really taken on big

374
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,278
pharmaceutical companies haven't really

375
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:24,599
taken on big time but there there are

376
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:27,799
very structured distribution change and

377
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,720
there's a very professional industry

378
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:32,198
internationally that we we need to tap

379
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,759
into particularly new channels like

380
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:36,278
health food

381
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,639
stores um we think there are growing

382
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:42,078
synergies by creating our own Jamaican

383
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,959
branded synergies with health and

384
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,838
wellness tourism which is an area that

385
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:49,599
we are developing at jamro so what can

386
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:52,120
jamro do for you essentially well as I

387
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,159
said jamro is all about business helping

388
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,600
businesses to grow and to thrive so

389
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:59,639
we're involved in capacity building for

390
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,560
exporters explaining to supporters how

391
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,880
to access International markets actually

392
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,240
finding those markets and finding those

393
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,600
proper roots to Market because we need

394
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,000
to go down Niche routes to Market that

395
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,838
can give us opportunities for value

396
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,558
added products that's what we're all

397
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:21,438
about it's also about advising exporters

398
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:24,038
on packaging on labeling on how to

399
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,519
comply with International agreements

400
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:29,919
trade agreements on Market access um Dr

401
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,079
Del go spoke about quality standards and

402
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,280
traceability I think this is absolutely

403
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:37,359
CR critical to the development of this

404
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:40,319
industry because if we don't Implement

405
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,279
Hass ISO and good manufacturing

406
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:46,399
practices we cannot access the

407
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:49,160
international market so yes um we we are

408
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,400
very involved jamro in developing the

409
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,558
regulatory framework that has to govern

410
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,360
this industry if we are to achieve

411
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:59,079
world-class standards so exciting

412
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:01,879
business exciting opportunity but we've

413
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:04,960
got to focus on developing the proper

414
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:08,720
Frameworks for us to develop so jambro

415
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,600
is here to help you we have a website

416

[Music]

436
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:09,240
thank you Cliff um good evening everyone

437
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:13,759
um like to recognize um The Diplomatic

438
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:16,880
core here as well as the mayor and um

439
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,279
the mayor is talked in her little corner

440
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:24,720
she's so so important without her we

441
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:26,399
can't stop this thing but um I'd like to

442
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,960
just say when you look at the health and

443
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,640
wellness industry

444
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,079
and when you look at

445
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,280
neutraceutical our Healing Waters and

446
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:39,079
our mineral B they're very important and

447
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:43,119
um they are part of the whole question

448
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:45,599
of wellness and neutral industry and our

449
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:48,839
Healing Waters the most famous three

450
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:53,879
there are mil River Rock for mineral

451
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:56,798
bath and um St Thomas bath um mineral

452
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,559
spa and it's very important to recognize

453
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:03,879
them because um from from a scientific

454
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:07,639
point of view um they are really healing

455
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:12,280
and a lot of people under remember um

456
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:15,559
the history that both him St Thomas and

457
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:18,319
and mil were being discovered because

458
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:22,359
slaves were beaten and then they went to

459
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:24,759
these um Waters and they got healed and

460
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:27,599
therefore their bosses took it up from

461
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:31,200
there but importantly what is it that

462
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:37,558
they carry Milk River bath um has

463
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:41,759
ionizing radiation and it has about 16

464
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:44,319
CES million parts per liter and it's one

465
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:48,038
of the most um has the most

466
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:52,000
concentration of ionizing radiation um

467
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:54,960
in the world it is 54 times that of

468
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,440
France and Switzerland and about 16

469
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,279
times out of bath in England in terms of

470
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,880
ionizing radiation

471
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,519
and what it does to us is important

472
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,640
because ionizing radiation is

473
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:08,679
anti-inflammatory so what you find is

474
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,679
that for example people who have been to

475
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:16,360
Milk River have been noted to have their

476
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:20,278
um arthritis and their back pains and

477
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:23,599
their swellings and in in infections

478
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:25,960
healed because um the the ionizing

479
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:29,480
radiation is anti-inflammatory but it's

480
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:33,640
also anti-cancer ant cancerous it helps

481
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:36,360
pain and apart from that it is

482
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,799
antimicrobial so those people with

483
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:45,079
infections and so on when they go to for

484
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:48,960
example um bath which has a high Sol for

485
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:52,639
Content you find that um they their

486
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,960
infection would have been subsided or or

487
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,960
heal and so you find that Healing Waters

488
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,798
are very important another aspect of

489
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,200
Healing Waters is that and they have

490
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:09,480
they they have nutrients they have minor

491
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,880
minerals like cadmium um potassium

492
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,720
chloride and so on that are very

493
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:19,640
important for the body and so they

494
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,880
always argue that when you go to um St

495
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,480
Thomas if you drink the water and get

496
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,559
the hot bath at the same time and at

497
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,679
massage it helps and so it's very

498
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:33,319
important so so we don't know exactly

499
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:38,600
what we have and how we can Market this

500
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:42,038
industry and become part of that $2.5

501
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:46,119
billion um and and recognize that mil

502
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:48,599
River and B and Thomas are so important

503
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:51,000
from a scientific point of view as well

504
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,959
we have to look at partnering with the

505
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,240
scientific research Council the

506
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,480
University of the West Indies University

507
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,278
of Technology ncu and other academic in

508
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,278
institution as well as Ministry of

509
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:06,759
Health and so on because for example the

510
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:11,038
sulfur in the

511
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:13,119
centas um fountain at bath Fountain can

512
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:17,000
be very important because suppose you

513
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:19,959
are allergic to sulfur then it it may be

514
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,038
important that if you go there and you

515
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,159
have some little bumps on your body and

516
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:29,200
so on allergic reactions it may be that

517
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:33,080
so we have to look at in terms of the

518
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,919
contents and con constituents of our

519
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:38,639
Healing Waters and recognize the

520
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,480
benefits as well as sometimes the little

521
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,278
dangers and I must say that even though

522
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,960
Milk River has such ionizing radiation

523
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:50,759
Rock for too has some minerals that are

524
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,360
very important and um they don't Rec

525
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:56,599
they don't recommend that you stay in

526
00:23:53,359 --> 00:24:00,918
these bath more than 15 to 45 minutes at

527
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:02,678
a time but and they are not as bad as

528
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:04,880
the cautions that are there but the

529
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,798
precautions must be important and

530
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:12,278
therefore it's so important that we

531
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:16,038
recognize the values the healing values

532
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:19,240
and the neutral and nutritional values

533
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:20,278
of our Healing Waters here in Jamaica

534
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,278

00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,440
healing plant healing water in Jamaica

538
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,960
we have quite a bit of research a number

539
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,880
of research entities in Jamaica which

540
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,120
have been doing extensive work in

541
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,840
developing products determine the

542
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,639
scientific um principles online their

543
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,839
therapeutic properties of our natural

544
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,799
plants some of our invertebrates as well

545
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:50,759
as our Waters however of key importance

546
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:52,879
to us also is how do we start up these

547
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,359
businesses where do we seek the

548
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,360
financing and how do we ensure that we

549
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,479
do it in a sustainable way at this point

550

Market

591
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,359
requirements we also have a technical

592
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:52,278
arm which I'm a part of and that is

593
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,879
about the product development and the

594
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:56,480
packaging and branding side you have

595
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,039
heard jro mention the importance of

596
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,038
building your brand and pack packaging

597
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,839
and for us that's very important it is

598
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:07,679
about how do you package your product to

599
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:10,639
meet International standards to meet

600
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,480
consumer needs right how do you make

601
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,679
your packaging attractive um but to do

602
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,480
it in a way which calls up on available

603
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,519
resources um look at constraints that we

604
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,159
may have on how we can come for the best

605
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:25,558
and most creative packaging solution

606
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,200
that we have so we have a team of

607
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:31,480
graphic designers for example who work

608
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:34,399
on creating the most suitable and

609
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,240
attractive packaging solution um for you

610
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:39,278
and it is about understanding now what

611
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,120
the industry is about tapping into the

612
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:44,119
whole natural Vibe of the industry and

613
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:47,319
give your packaging solution we're also

614
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:49,558
about bridging and um crossing over into

615
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:52,079
other Industries for example we work

616
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:55,119
quite a bit with the natural cyber

617
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:58,319
industry and how can natural fibers be a

618
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:00,239
part of this um a lot of neutral product

619
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,319
are generated from Plants what are the

620
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,679
other spin-off products that can be

621
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,519
created from other parts of the plant

622
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,399
which may contribute to the packaging it

623
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,960
may contribute to a new product and um

624
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,558
so it's about doing that all other the

625
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,440
other side that we're heavily involved

626
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:20,480
in is on the marketing where um through

627
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,919
our in Jamaican stores we actually get

628
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,519
it into the hands of the consumer and it

629
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,399
is about pitching brand Jamaica

630
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,880
authentic Jamaican products quality

631
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:31,759
products and we use that to get the

632
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,240
productss out into the market of course

633
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:39,359
we also have our engineering team

634
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:42,240
where conversion the Valu aspect of it

635
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,798
how do we convert that raw material into

636
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,240
natural product in a very efficient way

637

always has had some challenges over the

706
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:55,038
year one of the big challenges that

707
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:58,119
smmes have is presenting financial

708
00:31:55,038 --> 00:32:00,359

good afternoon

793
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:36,480
everybody thank you very much for

794
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,240
turning out today I'm going to be

795
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,679
talking a little bit this afternoon

796
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:43,078
about some of the extraordinary changes

797
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:46,559
that we've been living

798
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:48,960
through as um I'm know this is a truism

799
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,920
but we live through we're living in a

800
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,039
time of unprecedented social economic

801
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,920
demographic and technological

802
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:59,920
change and some of these changes do

803
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,039
present challenges es and threats to the

804
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,519
economies of the Caribbean but there are

805
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:07,000
far more opportunities than threats so

806
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,280
let's just look at a couple of them and

807
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,318
see what they mean for us and for the

808
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,319
development of this potential new

809
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:19,440
industry today there are about 7 billion

810
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:22,119
people living in the world that number

811
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,519
is going to increase a lot over the

812
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:26,838
course of the century by the time we get

813
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:29,000
to the end of this Century the world's

814
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:31,719
population will somewhere in the range 9

815
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,679
and 1/2 to 12 1/2 billion

816
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:37,919
people so they're going to be 2 and 1/2

817
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:39,000
to 5 1/2 billion more people than there

818
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,358
are

819
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,159
today and the distribution is going to

820
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:45,559
change dramatically as well by the time

821
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,078
we get halfway through this Century

822
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:48,279
about half of the population of the

823
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,240
planet will be

824
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,800
Asian and about a quarter will be

825
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:58,239
African and all of the other nations of

826
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,920
the world will only add up to qu of the

827
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:03,759
world's population so the distribution

828
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,159
of the world's population will change

829
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,319
really

830
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:12,039
markedly but an even more significant

831
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:14,400
change is going to be the age

832
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:16,880
distribution by the time we get the the

833
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,800
median age in the world today is about

834
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,680
29 but the time we get to 2050 the

835
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,640
median age will be

836
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:28,039
41 and about by the time we get halfway

837
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:30,679
through the century about a third of

838
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:32,239
humanity will be over the age of 60

839
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:34,279
there will be at least three billion

840
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:37,598
people in the world over the age of 60

841
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:41,560
can you just imagine today if half of

842
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:44,039
all of the people in the world were

843
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,920
retirees that's the number we're talking

844
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:49,239
about we're talking about half of

845
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,400
today's global population as retirees by

846
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:53,959
the time we get to

847
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,358
2050 so by the time we get halfway

848
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,838
through the century if you look at

849
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:00,239
Europe for example there will be two

850
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:01,880
people over the age of 60 for every

851
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,679
child for every child under the age of

852
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,400
15 the population of places like Europe

853
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:11,159
will be predominantly elderly Japan will

854
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:13,200
be an even more extreme case and China

855
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:15,279
is about to undergo the world's most

856
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:20,118
rapid transition into becoming an

857
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:22,079
elderly population of of uh in history

858
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:23,240
and it's going to start in just a 2 3

859
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,680
years from

860
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:27,959
now so by the time we get partway

861
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,519
through the century there's going to be

862
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,679
a lot more people than there are now

863
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:35,280
most of them will live in Asia and

864
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:37,719
Africa and they'll be a lot older on

865
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,040
average than they are

866
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:44,919
now we're already seeing dramatic

867
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:46,639
changes in the world causes of death and

868
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,920
we're going to see even more dramatic

869
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:49,719
changes as we go through this

870
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,838
demographic

871
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:54,199
transition as I'm sure everybody

872
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:58,519
remembers there was a lot of upset a lot

873
00:38:54,199 --> 00:39:02,439
of concern about ebola and chicken

874
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:04,960
virus so it's important to remember that

875
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,159
in fact these are not typical of what's

876
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,559
Happening

877
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:11,719
Now over the course of the last 15 years

878
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:13,400
the global burden of disease and we

879
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:18,239
measure this in terms of numbers of

880
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:20,160
lives lost has been falling dramatically

881
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:22,199
over the last 15 years the number of

882
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,279
lives lost due to disease has fallen by

883
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:25,879
about

884
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,280
1/3 and we think that even further

885
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,039
reductions lie ahead this is because

886
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,079
people are richer they're eating better

887
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:36,440
diets we've got better sanitation and

888
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,720
we've got better Medical Care and people

889
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,760
are living much longer over the course

890
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:44,639
of the last 100 years World average life

891
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,480
expectancy has doubled the rate of

892
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,960
increase is continuing and by the time

893
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,119
we get halfway through the century

894
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,960
people will be living on average at

895
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,920
least 10 years longer than they're doing

896
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,199
now it used to be the case within living

897
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,720
memory that most people died of

898
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:07,279
infectious disease that is no longer

899
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:10,480
true the leading causes of death now are

900
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,079
the age related degenerative and

901
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,119
non-communicable diseases including for

902
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:17,680
example cardiovascular disease and some

903
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,640
of the major kinds of cancer just to

904
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:24,159
give you one indicator in the UK today

905
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:27,118
not just a little under half of all

906
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:28,759
deaths are due to cardiovascular disease

907
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,039
which which costs the UK economy about

908
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,440
$45 billion equivalent US Dollars

909
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,519
equivalent in healthc care expenditure

910
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,559
and lost

911
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,519
productivity and this is going to be the

912
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:42,358
norm increasingly in the years ahead

913
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:43,759
it's already the case in Latin America

914
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:46,719
and the Caribbean that the leading

915
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,720
causes of death are not the infectious

916
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,719
diseases anymore they're age related

917
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,838
degenerative diseases we're actually

918
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,078
living long enough now to die of

919
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:56,719
degenerative

920
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,880
disease so what we have to do now this

921
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:02,559
is the next Frontier in medical research

922
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,880
is we have to find a cost effective way

923
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,199
to reduce the burden of the age related

924
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,519
degenerative diseases but we have to be

925
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,960
able to do this for a far greater number

926
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:15,559
of people than ever

927
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,760
before and this is the single most

928
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:20,000
important driver behind the development

929
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:24,280
of the new industry for neutraceuticals

930
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,639
and functional foods because these are

931
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,839
food stuffs and medical uh I ingredients

932
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:31,480
in a medical

933
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:34,119
format that contain actives and

934
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:36,639
micronutrients most of them plant

935
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:40,440
extracts that give us a cost effective

936
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:42,598
way just by changing people's diet to

937
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,318
reduce the burden of age related

938
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,318
degenerative

939
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:51,559
diseases by in about

940
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:55,279
2010 the global market for these product

941
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:57,559
was estimated at about $40 billion

942
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,720
US by the time we get to the the end of

943
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:03,880
this decade most projections show it

944
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:05,959
going over 200 billion US a year about a

945
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,838
third of the global market is the in the

946
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,159
United States Europe represents about a

947
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:11,719
quarter but the real growth

948
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:13,440
opportunities are in fact in the

949
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:15,959
developing economies the the new

950
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,639
industrial economies the market in India

951
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,119
is growing at nearly 20% per ano so

952
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:22,400
these are really the markets that we

953
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:26,079
should be looking to

954
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,160
now some not all but some of the uh

955
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,079
ingredients needed for this new industry

956
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:32,838
can be produced in

957
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:36,240
Jamaica now as many people here know I

958
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:38,199
did I was the first to identify the

959
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:40,558
potential of the neutral and functional

960
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:41,439
Foods Market for Jamaica back in the

961
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,640
late

962
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,920
1990s and at the time I did that

963
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:48,440
research the market for neutraceuticals

964
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,318
and functionals Foods was just one tenth

965
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:54,240
of the size it is now so over that

966
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:56,880
period this Market has grown tfold now

967
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,318
we have lost out on a lot of the um a

968
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,599
lot of that growth

969
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:03,558
opportunity but the good news is that

970
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,000
all the projections show that this rate

971
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:10,280
of growth is going to continue for many

972
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,960
years yet to come so it is not too late

973
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,519
we can still get into this Global Market

974
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,159
and we can still build a globally

975
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:21,358
competitive industry in this

976
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:24,039
country but as several people have

977
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:26,639
already pointed out the fact that the

978
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:29,318
industry the market is there the fact

979
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:31,318
that we have have products that we can

980
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:34,000
manufacture and export from here in

981
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:35,159
Jamaica does not automatically mean it

982
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,559
will

983
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:40,039
happen there are a number of things we

984
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,880
have to get right and if we cannot get

985
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:43,000
them right this industry will not work

986
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,838
for

987
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,800
us and we have to be absolutely clear

988
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:50,838
about this this is not about traditional

989
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,800
herbalism this is not what the market

990
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:55,400
now

991
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:58,920
requires we have to focus on product

992
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:01,599
quality on proven efficacy we have to

993
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,920
have standards controls in place we have

994
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,280
to be able

995
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:08,519
to trace any problems with contamination

996
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,280
back to source and deal with them in

997
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:14,280
other words everything that you now need

998
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,839
to run a modern food or pharmaceutical

999
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,960
export industry there are no shortcuts

1000
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:21,558
we have to be willing to do the work to

1001
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,639
put all of the foundations and the

1002
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:26,880
prerequisites for this new industry in

1003
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:28,920
place but if we do so this is a market

1004
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,440
that is projected to grow for the rest

1005
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,440
of this century and by the time we get

1006
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,000
to the century it will be many times

1007
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,920
bigger than it is now it's still early

1008
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,440
days there's still everything to play

1009
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,480
for so provided we do the work now and

1010
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,200
I'm hoping that today will be the start

1011
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,199
of a new commitment to build this

1012
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:49,439
industry in Jamaica provided we do that

1013
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:52,118
then this country could build a major

1014
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,920
future on the strength of this industry

1015
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:58,079
ladies and gentlemen thank you very

1016
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,869
much thank you very much

1017
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,440
can we give our panelist a big round of

1018
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:06,000
[Music]

1019
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,200
applause thank you I'd like first to

1020
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,838
recognize mayor bronberg welcome and

1021
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:11,598
thank you for his support we have a

1022

number of distinguished guests in our

1023
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,119
audience today if I begin a start

1024
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,040
calling names I know I'm going to get

1025
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,079
myself in trouble so I want to thank you

1026
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,358
all for your kind support and thanks for

1027
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:23,559
joining us here today this is a clear

1028
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:24,799
indication of your commitment to the

1029
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:26,720
development as well as the

1030
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,760
sustainability of a National neutal

1031
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:29,358
Industry

1032
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,559
at this point we get to the me of the

1033
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:34,318
matter we have just about 15 20 minutes

1034
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,040
we're going to open the floor for

1035
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,759
questions you can throw questions at to

1036
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:39,838
our

1037
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:43,800
panelists can you please join us so the

1038
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:46,358
floor is not open to um our participants

1039
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:49,240
can ask as many questions as you want to

1040
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:52,078
we'll try our best to address them in an

1041
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:54,879
amicable manner you can show by raise up

1042
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,559
hand and I'll run to you one second

1043
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,240
please also indicate the person to whom

1044
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:01,240
you are direction of

1045
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:03,078
question I'm Paul Chang with the ganja

1046
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:06,558
future grows and producers Association

1047
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:08,160
of Jamaica and the president director

1048
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:12,079
and the professor who just spoke from

1049
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:13,219
the United Kingdom um does the inputs

1050
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,760
the

1051
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:17,199
[Music]

1052
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:20,119
plant Professor does it does the plant

1053
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:24,799
inputs for this neutral industry require

1054
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,800
certified organic plant inputs

1055
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,159
uh let me just correct one point I'm

1056
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,640
actually from Jamaica at the University

1057
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:36,639
of the West

1058
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:44,239
Indies very proud of

1059
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:47,920
that uh no thank you well welcome I'll

1060
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:50,799
take that okay thank you um no or it's

1061
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,639
it is not about Organics okay except

1062
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:57,760
possibly as a marketing point but no the

1063
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:59,078
key is to identify the active now again

1064
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,400
if you remember I said we're not talking

1065
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:04,559
about traditional herbalism what you

1066
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:07,160
actually have to do is identify the

1067
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:10,960
complex molecular compound that actually

1068
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:14,118
has the identifiable health benefits and

1069
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,079
really over what we have to aim for is

1070
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:19,039
to actually understand the molecular

1071
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,240
pathway so that we can be uh very

1072
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,558
precise about what it is we're

1073
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:26,279
addressing and how it is we can address

1074
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:27,440
it and then what you have to do is you

1075
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,359
have to do the

1076
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,599
extraction because when you take a

1077
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:33,558
traditional herbal product you are

1078
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,000
getting some of the active that maybe

1079
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,200
does you some good but you are also

1080
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,559
getting typically hundreds of other

1081
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,919
molecular compounds some of which may in

1082
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:44,079
fact be bad for you and as I'm sure you

1083
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,200
know there was a big Scandal a few years

1084
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,839
ago with some Chinese heral medicine

1085
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:50,480
which it turned out was actually uh

1086
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:51,920
quite toxic and and caused permanent

1087
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,838
liver damage and some of the people who

1088
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,318
took it so no that's just a stage we

1089
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:59,558
came through the next stage is we have

1090
00:47:57,318 --> 00:48:03,119
to identify the compounds that actually

1091
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:04,640
do people good and extract them and then

1092
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,400
package them and that may mean for

1093
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:10,799
example uh microencapsulation and starch

1094
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,720
which we have to do with um the

1095
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,680
flavonoids for example because to get

1096
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:18,598
the dose that actually does you good you

1097
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:21,039
have to actually be consuming so much

1098
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:23,200
that it would be unpalatable so there we

1099
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:25,880
need to look at coating these products

1100
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:27,159
in starch so that when you consume them

1101
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,800
they actually don't break down until

1102
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:31,159
they're in your intestine and that way

1103
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,440
you get the health benefits but the the

1104
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:37,039
key to a lot of this industry is to look

1105
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,679
at lowcost delivery mechanisms and

1106
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,318
that's why functional foods is actually

1107
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:42,879
probably got the potential rather than

1108
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:44,960
neutrals neutrals you put it in a

1109
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,240
conventional medical format but

1110
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,760
functional foods you just put it in a

1111
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:52,639
standard food or Bakery product or a

1112
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,280
drink or a spread which means that

1113
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:56,480
people can actually adopt a much much

1114
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,440
healthier diet without having to make

1115
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,159
fun fundamental CH changes to their

1116
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:04,119
lifestyle and this it looks very much um

1117
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:06,440
to me is the way to go so if you take

1118
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:10,240
for example the flavonoids from turmeric

1119
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:13,119
that we believe act as um uh

1120
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:15,000
to the flavonoids in turmeric can take

1121
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,880
block something called tumor necrosis

1122
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,280
Factor Alpha which is a cancer precursor

1123
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,440
so if you um introduce a higher level of

1124
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,519
these compounds in people's diet you can

1125
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,519
reduce the incidence of certain cats of

1126
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:30,759
cancer so so this is the way we have to

1127
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:33,239
go next but this has to be a

1128
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,880
science-based industry we can start by

1129
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:37,118
looking at traditional herble remedies

1130
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,838
that's a very good place to start but to

1131
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,599
go to the next level we have to do the

1132
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:42,599
uh scientific

1133
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:49,759
assessment any further yes further

1134
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:52,920
questions we can only take one more

1135
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:57,400
question we're out of 10 so I ask you to

1136
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,400
just have discussion to the p

1137
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:07,960
just the the I understand that you know

1138
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:11,318
the the growing of uh uh uh uh marijuana

1139
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:16,000
you could go um inh housee with lights

1140
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:17,000
or um outside with with sunlight does

1141
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,798
the

1142
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:25,400
property of the uh uh plant changes

1143
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:27,519
depending on what um how it is gr

1144
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:31,200
sunlight or

1145
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:34,838
artificial light because I I I I fear

1146
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:38,960
that if we concentrate just on um one

1147
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:40,480
particular type of uh uh growing we may

1148
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,639
lose

1149
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:49,000
um another aspect because of what is

1150
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:52,440
natural and more um a cheaper energy

1151
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,519
cost for us all right I don't know

1152
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,440
enough about the specifics of producing

1153
00:50:54,519 --> 00:51:01,358
T hydr can Abol but

1154
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,240
I think it is quite clear that um as

1155
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,000
part of the demographic change I talked

1156
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:08,159
about

1157
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,079
earlier uh we have to look at much more

1158
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:13,639
uh intensive ways of producing food and

1159
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:15,519
fiber because we're going into a world

1160
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:19,639
where we're going to have to feed

1161
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:21,838
another 5 and a half billion people over

1162
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:24,759
and above the 7 billion who are alive

1163
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:27,159
today and that means we have to find

1164
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:30,359
ways to produce more food

1165
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:32,399
more fuel more fiber and more

1166
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:35,960
pharmaceutical Products off a smaller

1167
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,440
area of land than ever before so another

1168
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:41,079
one of the key directions of scientific

1169
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,159
research is how do we do that and it's

1170
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:46,160
clear we have to look at production in

1171
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:47,879
intensive conditions in Hydroponics we

1172
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:50,679
we simply cannot we we'll no longer be

1173
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,519
able to afford the kind of extensive

1174
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:55,639
agricultural inefficient agricultural

1175
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:57,440
systems we have now so I think that

1176
00:51:55,639 --> 00:52:02,000
however it's going to work we have to

1177
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,000
find ways to produce more intensively in

1178
00:52:02,139 --> 00:52:06,879

1290
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:24,719
various

1291
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:26,400

lives might be transformed in positive

1297
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,760
ways we pray that you might teach us not

1298
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:47,239
to be

1299
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:51,280
greedy but rather to support legitimate

1300
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:52,679
needs we pray that you might help us to

1301
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,720
be people of

1302
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:56,719
sustainability that we will keep the

1303
00:58:55,719 --> 00:59:00,759
crop

1304
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:05,038
going and that whatever Industries we

1305
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:08,200
produce might be able not only to

1306
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:12,640
satisfy individual needs but the common

1307

Dr Steven Jennings when I was growing up

1316
00:59:36,358 --> 00:59:40,239
in the hills of

1317
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:43,680
Clarendon I think most of our medical

1318
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:46,759
needs were taken care of by the plants

1319
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:49,038
we had around our home there was Leaf of

1320
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:52,480
life and all we were required to do was

1321
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:56,480
wash it and chew it to get rid of a cold

1322
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:59,838
there was fever grass there was Cy St

1323
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:03,280

1324
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:04,880
Leaf Tea yes Lime Leaf Tea enjoy that

1325
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,079
not the lime you know but the Lime Leaf

1326
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,200
Tea but if you don't have the lime tree

1327
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,720
just make a little cup of hot lemonade

1328
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:12,838
it is so good I grew up with six

1329
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:15,118
different kind of flour in a my y of my

1330
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:17,558
country rather for the non Jamaicans at

1331
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,880
my home in rural Jamaica there were six

1332
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:23,480
different kinds of flour there I had

1333
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:26,720
banana flour i casava flour i araro

1334
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:31,000
flour I had bread fruit flour I had FL

1335
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:34,759
and then we regular counter FL the look

1336
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,838
like not a me look good this age of my

1337
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:39,200
life because me eat all of the proper

1338
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:40,639
things right you see all that doctor on

1339
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:42,558

1340
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:44,318
baritone him have all of those things as

1341
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,039
a young man to you know but we tell him

1342
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:49,038
more about it but the point I'm making

1343
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:50,799
is these things have always existed but

1344
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:54,200
we have used them in our homes for

1345
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:56,440
domestic purposes it is now time to get

1346
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:59,038
the real value and

1347
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,798

BS to be

1379
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,400
fed in

1380
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:39,519
1980 at the age of 24 when many

1381
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:42,278
Jamaicans were migrating I made a choice

1382
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:45,358
to stay in

1383
01:02:42,278 --> 01:02:47,798
Jama and create employment and domestic

1384
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:47,798
Capital

1385
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:56,358
formation I started perishables Jamaica

1386
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:58,798
Limited with $300 Jamaican dollars

1387
01:02:56,358 --> 01:03:05,278
at that time it was

1388
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:05,278
$175 us at today's rate of exchange it's

1389
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:09,519
$2,000

1390
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,880
fortunately in

1391
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:16,278
1980 there was not a

1392
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:21,240
$60,000 penalty for starting a

1393
01:03:16,278 --> 01:03:24,079
business if so I dare say I would not be

1394
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:26,959
standing here talking to you today as a

1395
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:29,880
small farmer and

1396
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:32,720
businessman our

1397
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:34,480
mission is to efficiently produce and

1398
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:37,318
aggressively Market indigenous

1399
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:40,679
agricultural products and byproducts at

1400
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:40,679
a reasonable price to the

1401
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:45,119
consumer let's think back could we make

1402
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:49,960
that

1403
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:52,480
$60,000 an incentive for people who are

1404
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:53,519
wanting to get into business instead of

1405
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,039
a

1406
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:59,759
disincentive the first indigenous herb

1407
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:02,319
we developed in to an industry was sat

1408
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,359
VI minia also known as Jamaican

1409

peppermint and we are the only Tea

1410
01:04:04,358 --> 01:04:10,119
Company in Jamaica that produces

1411
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:12,759
indigenous Jamaican peppermint all

1412
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:12,760
others are

1413
01:04:14,199 --> 01:04:21,558
important today we have over 500 Farmers

1414
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:24,078
supplying supplying us this commodity we

1415
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:26,400
have commercialized 13 traditional

1416
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:29,079
Jamaican medicinal plants

1417
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,760
with small farmers and wild Crafters

1418
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:32,240
some of whom are members of the South

1419
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:35,278
Manchester herbs and spices

1420
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:37,278
multi-purpose Cooperative society and we

1421
01:04:35,278 --> 01:04:41,199
are currently developing another 20

1422
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:43,679
plants under various Brands including

1423
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:45,798
our own tops and sip a copper itle

1424
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:48,358
Jamaican Brands forgive me the

1425
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:51,759
commercial we export our products to the

1426
01:04:48,358 --> 01:04:54,480
USA Canada the UK and the Caribbean our

1427
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:57,200
products are competitively priced in

1428
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:59,719
terms of quality and reliability of

1429
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:03,480
supplies our business

1430
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:06,879
strengths are our human resources both

1431
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:11,039
external and internal the development of

1432
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:14,278
unique medicinal plants we use 96% local

1433
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:16,520
raw materials in our processing we are

1434
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:19,719
net earners of Foreign

1435
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:22,119
Exchange we solar generate our daily

1436
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:24,318
electricity needs and sell a little

1437
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:27,798
excess to the grid each

1438
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:30,920
day what are the threat store business

1439
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:35,239
inconsistent and inferior quality

1440
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:38,798
contaminated materials Rees and pests I

1441
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:41,118
dare say the additional 100% increase in

1442
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:43,559
asset tax is a threat to our

1443
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:47,240
business lack of

1444
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:49,440
water water is life based on the example

1445
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:52,358
of the Yas water pipeline I hope that

1446
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:54,960
the government of Jamaica and the bside

1447
01:05:52,358 --> 01:05:57,639
companies will in the near future find

1448
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,318
it possible to convert some of the

1449
01:05:57,639 --> 01:06:03,798
craters that are created in the

1450
01:05:59,318 --> 01:06:06,759
highlands of our country into water

1451
01:06:03,798 --> 01:06:10,159
reservoirs this water could be gravity

1452
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:12,480
fed yes not pumped using electricity to

1453
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:14,920
Farmers Downstream to provide

1454
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,679
sustainable water supplies for the

1455
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:21,480
production of our herbs and spices we

1456
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:24,159
need to harvest store distribute this

1457
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:28,079
precious commodity more

1458
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:30,440
intelligently for our long-term

1459
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:34,079
development I'm

1460
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:36,639
closing my mission is to share as much

1461
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:39,400
knowledge technology resources and

1462
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:42,118
skills with my brothers and sisters so

1463
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:45,358
we can build and develop a long-term

1464
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:47,240
sustainable neutraceutical industry

1465
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:49,558
while contributing to keeping the

1466
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:52,558
Jamaican social fabric

1467

01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:09,199
nothing I will leave the same way with

1471
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:12,278
nothing but Jamaica will be

1472
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:15,000
different should we invest in Moringa or

1473
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:20,880
ganja the resolution might yet be to

1474
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:26,318
develop paba dog blood donkey weed rang

1475
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:29,760
dashal Stevia or Lam V to this end it is

1476
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:33,719
understood that our human resources will

1477
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:37,520
determine the success of our

1478
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:40,318
industry we just go search my

1479
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:45,159

1480
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:45,159
answer I'm a promise I'm a

1481
01:07:48,679 --> 01:07:56,118

here to help in any way we can with the

1518
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:44,798
science we have to move the

1519
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:47,679
Jamaican projects

1520
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:50,119
forward and I want to tell you why that

1521
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:53,119
is and I made little emotional because

1522
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:56,439
it's near dear to my heart I work with a

1523
01:09:53,119 --> 01:10:00,519
tremendous number of very very six

1524
01:09:56,439 --> 01:10:02,399
children and we don't always win those

1525
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:05,600
situations sometimes we

1526
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:07,679
lose currently in the United States one

1527
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,840
of the most important drugs we need that

1528
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:13,079
comes from Mother Earth in this plant is

1529
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:14,199
a compound called CBD to stop the

1530
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:16,719
seizures and

1531
01:10:14,198 --> 01:10:18,359
epilepsy we have very little in the

1532
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,880
United States we're working hard to

1533
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:21,559
create it but when you create it from

1534
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,199
the ground up because Mother Nature

1535
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:26,920
didn't have it there takes a lot

1536
01:10:24,198 --> 01:10:28,559
longer um um currently when these

1537
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:30,600
children are incredibly sick and we're

1538
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,400
just trying to keep them from dying we

1539
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,520
give them terrible drugs that keep them

1540
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:36,559
alive but destroy their

1541
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:39,920
bodies when that

1542
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,719
happens we not only are creating

1543
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,520
Devastation of the patient we're

1544
01:10:41,719 --> 01:10:45,319
devastating their families if they live

1545
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,920
in tight group communities we're

1546
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:48,719
devastating those

1547
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:51,560
communities and it's extremely

1548
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:54,840
frustrating to me

1549
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:56,000
that wonderful medicinals like CBD and

1550
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,079
th

1551
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:02,000
see don't kill anyone they have no

1552
01:10:59,079 --> 01:11:05,600
capacity to stop you from breathing they

1553
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,399
have no capacity crack much to cause a

1554
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,520
lethal dose without eating and consuming

1555
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:13,799
massive amounts far beyond what anybody

1556
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:15,000
would do they rarely have major allergic

1557
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,279
reactions or

1558
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,399
intolerances I can't say that about any

1559
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:22,599
drugs we're using and it's a pretty hard

1560
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:23,960
thing to know that as a Healer when

1561
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:26,120
you've got to make that difficult

1562
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:29,158
decision am I going to give this patient

1563
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:31,279
this young patient these terrible

1564
01:11:29,158 --> 01:11:32,679
drugs you know am I really certain

1565
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:35,559
they're likely to die if I don't give

1566
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:38,480
them to them it's a real tough position

1567
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:42,080
to put any healer any physician any

1568
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:43,919
herbalist into and so for me part of

1569
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:47,639
coming here is hoping that you will let

1570
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:50,920
me assist you in leading the way in the

1571
01:11:47,639 --> 01:11:53,480
world to understanding why these sort of

1572
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:55,600
treatments are much more Humane why

1573
01:11:53,479 --> 01:11:57,198
these treatments have greater dignity to

1574
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:00,440
them why these treatments have a

1575
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:02,919
tremendous amount of compassion to them

1576
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:05,678
now the reason why I'm extremely hopeful

1577
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:07,840
about Jamaica is as a very spiritual

1578
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:10,319
person I know a spiritual Nation when I

1579
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:12,719
see one and when you have a spiritual

1580
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:15,599
nation that was basically created out of

1581
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:18,319
a demand for dignity and a strong

1582
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:21,039
compassionate feeling you can make these

1583
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:24,279
things happen in a very wonderful way in

1584
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:26,960
the United States we're up against all

1585
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:29,279
sorts of walls where that's concerned

1586
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,319
because people close their Shades at

1587
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:32,800
night rather than opening their window

1588
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:36,238
at night to look across the street and

1589
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:38,840
say is my is my neighbor okay okay we're

1590
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:40,839
losing that but in a highly spiritual

1591
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:43,600
Nation based on compassion there's

1592
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:45,520
almost nothing you can can't do and

1593
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,360
you've been given you may think in some

1594
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,960
ways I I know the world sees some of

1595
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:52,279
your resources poor resources I don't

1596
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,399
believe it first off you have a huge

1597
01:12:52,279 --> 01:12:57,599
resource in spirituality in your entire

1598
01:12:54,399 --> 01:13:00,119
community secondly Mother Nature has

1599
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:02,639
given you a rainforce that's filled with

1600
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:04,880
herbals and yes cannabis is important

1601
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:06,639
but there are many important drugs that

1602
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,440
are better to give to patients than the

1603
01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:12,000
drugs we're using and you have a great

1604
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:15,039
number of them here um you have a desire

1605
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,679
to improve your situation and again it's

1606
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:20,000
not just at the individual level it's

1607
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:22,279
the entire Community that's phenomenal I

1608
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,920
mean I don't see that in the United

1609
01:13:22,279 --> 01:13:25,719
States the degree I see it here except

1610
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,960
in the small Mountain col

1611
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:29,520
the small Mountain communities like

1612
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:31,719
where I come from but in the big cities

1613
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:36,080
that kind of spirit is gone it's just

1614
01:13:31,719 --> 01:13:38,719
it's it's asleep I don't know so what I

1615
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:41,119
will tell you is if you allow us to help

1616
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:43,800
you if you allow me to do what I can to

1617
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:45,479
assist you I will happily come back and

1618
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,480
work at University teaching your people

1619
01:13:45,479 --> 01:13:50,599
up I will give you every medicinal

1620
01:13:47,479 --> 01:13:52,439
remedy I have uh I will help you develop

1621
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,880
others I will go out in your Forest like

1622
01:13:52,439 --> 01:13:55,879
I've been doing the four I didn't go to

1623
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:58,039
a beach when I got here first time J

1624
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,960
make I didn't go to a beach I'm not here

1625
01:13:58,039 --> 01:14:01,519
for

1626
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,079
recreation um I asked Olivia the person

1627
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,080
planning all this for me fil up my

1628
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:08,000
calendar let me talk to as many

1629
01:14:05,079 --> 01:14:09,960
communities and as many people as I can

1630
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,079
and that's what we've been doing and if

1631
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:15,359
you allow me to do this I will be

1632
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:17,519
immensely thankful and I think if you're

1633
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:20,119
patient with your program and if you're

1634
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,719
encouraged to build your program I think

1635
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:22,679
in a very short amount of time the rest

1636
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:24,760
of the world is going to be looking

1637
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:25,600
towards de and saying what is going down

1638
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,199
there

1639
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:30,440
and I'll tell you what I have patients

1640
01:14:28,198 --> 01:14:33,198
in States like Florida on the far other

1641
01:14:30,439 --> 01:14:34,638
side of of our of our country who

1642
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:36,158
because they can't get what they need

1643
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:38,679
but they can get it from me and get it

1644
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:41,399
from California every month they have to

1645
01:14:38,679 --> 01:14:43,239
make a pilgrimage all the way across the

1646
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:45,839
country to get the medicines and

1647
01:14:43,238 --> 01:14:48,718
treatments their children need if they
