emancipation Park uh reggae in the park

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,040
that they were doing every Sundays and I

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,280
had hooked up with I Wayne to tell him a

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,880
little bit about the YouTube

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,799
monetization and how he could

28
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,118
potentially be reaping some rewards from

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,680
his views as he did have some very good

30
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,239
views and I was pretty stoked to see I

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,520
Wayne as he's got a great voice um

32
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:44,399
really talented individual so I was

33
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:46,959
excited and halfway through his show

34
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,239
someone that I've waited a very long

35
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,798
time to see in concert I've waited till

36
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:54,039
3:4 in the morning and missed this guy I

37
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,600
waited one time till 9:00 in the morning

38
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,439
at a Tony Rebel salute and only as I got

39
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,919
in the van and drove away did I hear

40
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,078
them mention that he was going to be

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,359
taking the stage who I'm talking about

42
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:09,318
of course is szla kangi so in this

43
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:13,959
particular video we've got szla kangi

44
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:15,919
we've got I Wayne and um yeah they do a

45
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,439
variety I think szla does two or three

46
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:22,039
small short songs and I Wayne does a

47
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:23,519
really nice um new song I don't know if

48
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,318
it was a freestyle that he was spitting

49
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,599
or something that he wrote but he does

50
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:30,759
announce in the video that it was new so

51
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:34,159

53
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,239
