00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,439
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world I

3
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:29,239
am back at high integrity glass art for

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,320
an absolute heater of a review we've got

5
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,119
now for the last 10 minutes off camera

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,039
I've been trying to remember all of the

7
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,320
names of this pipe so we went online and

8
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,878
we found uh Emerald glass actually who

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,320
has a similar piece uh has written

10
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:46,000
pastel rainbow ready sleeved over Fire

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:51,079
and Ice re Wiggies so this is obviously

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,960
ad DOA AKA The Banger hanger which I

13
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,719
really kind of like that nickname piece

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,840
is

15
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:00,840
absolutely beautiful the Chug on it

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,840
without the Banger in it

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,680
serious I don't know exactly what kind

18
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,118
of perk he's got in here but all I know

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,720
is there's nothing blocking the

20
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,239
mouthpiece from the perk and you get no

21
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,879
water even touching your lips in any way

22
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,879
no matter how hard you

23
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:19,679
pull quite a bit of reduction once you

24
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,000
get the Banger in

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,720
there can really see it and hear it you

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,478
can almost feel like it's a like a

27
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:29,280
silencer has been put on the piece I've

28
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,759
got some beautiful um cookies rosin here

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,960
that we're going to be hit hitting up

30
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:33,640
I've already got a little piece on the

31
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:37,078
Dabber and of course I couldn't help

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,640
myself so I dipped into the into the

33
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:43,239
grape ghost Blue River Tarpin for the

34
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,960
wind so without further Ado this piece

35
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:48,839
is just beautiful Dosa man you're

36
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,519
killing it bro there's no doubt about it

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,719
and I'm really stoked that high

38
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,759
integrity glass art is nearby and I'm

39
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:57,959
able to always visit because I myself

40
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,359
don't collect pieces on this level

41
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,280
anymore not since the late ' 9s so it's

42
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,599
really quite an honor always to be able

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,280
to come and and and hit a piece like

44
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:07,439
this I mean my God look at this thing it

45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,280
is

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,039
absolutely

47
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,919
beautiful oh yeah just hitting it dry

48
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,919
brings me joy come on that's

49
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,719
ridiculous all right here we

50
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:28,680
go this part I'll probably edit out cuz

51
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,680
I hate the sound of the torch

52
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,599
you do that right about the tip like

53
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,120
that I read a little article where they

54
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,639
were talking about the hottest part of

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,959
the

56
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,799
torch closer no I just go side to side

57
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,360
then up but that's fine you go side to

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,360
side in your mouth it's your Banger

59
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,879
that's fine Banger etiquette how about

60
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,680
that nickname that the Banger hanger

61
00:02:55,878 --> 00:03:01,079
good all right let's uh let's do a

62
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,319
little little time

63
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,400
marusi got to have your timer on these

64
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:08,719
days thank God for the

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,640
iPhone and I've been told a good 55

66
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,680
seconds heating this Banger up and

67
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,798
waiting about 55 seconds gives a really

68
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,159
nice not too hot not too low temp uh dab

69
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,439
but something that will be quite

70
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,878
substantial I'm sure got my little dab

71
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:25,199
on the uh Dabber right there with a nice

72
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,280
selection of Blue River

73
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,798
turpins and I'm pretty sure we're going

74
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,479
to go through this entire group of TP

75
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,680
means right after we finish this quick

76
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:39,518
little video of this little review of

77
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:42,519
the Dosa Banger hanger the level of how

78
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,158
many how many layers he's done here is

79
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,599
is really quite incredible I mean I've

80
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,359
always just been impressed with even

81
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:51,119
single layers of of ready wigwags to see

82
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,959
how tight the lines can get but once you

83
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,480
start overlaying them one two three deep

84
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,079
it it just becomes a whole a whole

85
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:03,000
different dimension to the art so pretty

86
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,000
stoked on that we're at 55 let's do

87
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,870
[Music]

88
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,840
this bet you guys are peeping this carb

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,160
cap this is a special Dosa carb cap

90
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:28,319
totally joking we don't have the carb

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,320
cap right now so we're using this

92
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:39,439
[Music]

93
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,520
had a little JS technique there moving

94
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,519
the uh moving the dab

95
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:49,639
around God when you hit that so perfect

96
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,880
and it just cleans to just perfection

97
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,240
that's how you want your Banger looking

98
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,279
after you have a nice dab right there

99
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,680
really

100
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,679
nice well that was so nice I felt like

101
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,120
we can't just do a one dab review we're

102
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,079
probably going to have to hit something

103
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,680
else we've got a little bit of the

104
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:10,879
Lindsay here we've got some Congo and

105
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:14,280
we've got some pink I said we go pink

106
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:18,000
little pink pink hush for the

107
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:19,439
win oh yeah yeah that's that's looking

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,560
right proper right

109
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,959
there you guys can see

110
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,959
that oh

111
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,600
yeah oh my gosh just beautiful

112
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,759
all right well let's get ourselves one

113
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:39,039
more little dab here for the for the

114
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,360
Dosa review so far I'll say the pipe

115
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:45,719
feels incredible in the hand really nice

116
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,639
feel to it obviously before you touch

117
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,120
the pipe you can see it and you you're

118
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,960
realizing right away that this is this

119
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,918
is a serious piece of glass it's on

120
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,038
point

121
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,159
artistically um the the work is

122
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,599
ridiculous the the Reed and the wig wags

123
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,280
are completely ridiculous

124
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,199
and I'm also really really impressed

125
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:09,399
with how well it feels uh when hitting

126
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,000
it with and without the uh The Banger so

127
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,159
let's get another TP dip that was the

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,478
grape ghost that we just hit um I've got

129
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,599
ACDC I've got cush cleaner and I think

130
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,318
I'm going to have to go with the cush

131
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:23,478
cleaner pink cush and the cush cleaner

132
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,598
are going to create a really nice uh

133
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:28,478
aftertaste that is for sure so let's

134
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:31,199
just get that in there get that nice

135
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:34,560
cushy taste in the back of my

136
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,919
throat and I guess we'll do this again

137
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,918
there we

138
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,478
go yeah fits great in the hand I'm

139
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,560
really loving the fact that the pipe

140
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,918
blowers the glass blowers are making

141
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,240
pipes a lot smaller these days when I

142
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:54,918
first got into this in the mid99s early

143
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,400
'90s pipes were much bigger when I got

144
00:06:54,918 --> 00:07:00,519
into rure of course rers were huge they

145
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,598
had big 188 uh glass on glass

146
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,918
connections that were you know designed

147
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:08,120
for buds to be shoved into uh into the

148
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:11,359
bowl and uh and go like

149
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,759
that since then even companies like rure

150
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,560
have been creating more and more

151
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,879
reduction smaller uh carbs uh smaller uh

152
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,478
glass joints and just making everything

153
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,080
a little bit tighter you can see quave

154
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,800
with his Banger and how he's got a

155
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:27,839
really nice tight tight area that goes

156
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,240
down and opens into a 144 uh I think

157
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,079
there's something to be said for not

158
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,598
only the placement of where he's put

159
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:34,478
that tube in the top of the banger but

160
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:37,038
for the size as well you can really feel

161
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,478
it when you take a hit and obviously um

162
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,240
you get used to your your different

163
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,000
bangers and it's uh it's not quite the

164
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,079
same when you hit a pipe without

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,158
