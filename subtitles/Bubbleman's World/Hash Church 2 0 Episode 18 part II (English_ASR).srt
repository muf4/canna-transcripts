the corner oh gosh well thanks for you

27
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:18,290
know what after 220 of these I have to

28
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:20,688
say like if this was like a year or two

29
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,759
ago I would have been having a harsh

30
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:25,158
reality right now let me tell you

31
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,579
so bubble man I have a question quickly

32
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,250
yes tomorrow the Google goes away April

33
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:33,978
first I'm gonna be able to use this

34
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,688
format in the future I honestly have no

35
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:37,759
idea what's gonna be happening but I

36
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:39,978
will figure something out that we will

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,718
be able to do what we're doing right now

38
00:01:39,978 --> 00:01:44,420
and whether that happens through Google

39
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:46,368
or some other option I will make sure

40
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,978
that it happens that's been making me a

41
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:50,718
little nervous too actually might be why

42
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:52,728
things are a little wonky right now so

43
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:54,530
yeah there's no support that's why I got

44
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:56,149
on I figured it may have been the last

45
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,858
time in this type of format so I wanted

46
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:06,368
to make sure to get on at least give my

47
00:01:57,858 --> 00:02:06,368
love yes Kelly oh no I can't hear you

48
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,310
maybe it's a simple mute though well we

49
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:14,650
can walk you through it sometimes it's a

50
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,209
simple mute other

51
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,180
times you gotta go into the little cog

52
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,370
and you got to check what you have set

53
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,400
up for your microphone yeah on the

54
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,239
left-hand side there's a control room

55
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,188
section so if you're having problems

56
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,259
check under your control room and make

57
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:31,120
sure you have the right microphone

58
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:32,878
because sometimes you also have to go

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,680
into your systems and check your

60
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,858
headphones and microphone output if

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,599
you're using a microphone microphone

62
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:42,760
right yes okay well we still got a

63
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:44,169
couple hundred people back in the room

64
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,370
they're laughing right now there's a

65
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:49,059
special welcome to bubble man's gong

66
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,920

74
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,979

Barcelona Oh miss turn it on right there

76
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:28,689
and yeah you did and so because Sam

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,530
missed it we made sure we got him like

78
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:36,789
some t-shirts and I got the card for him

79
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:39,280
the invitation and all of the samples

80
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:41,429
from legends so he could kind of be a

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,049
part of it

82
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:49,299
