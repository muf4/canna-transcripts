00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:12,780
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,940
it is nice and early on a Wednesday

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:18,059
afternoon and I'm actually heading over

5
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:20,100
to Sunshine Coast today can't really see

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,799
it over there but I assure you it is

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,779
over there just got to take a ferry to

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,480
get over there gonna jump on that ferry

9
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:29,099
in about about 45 minutes I'm only a few

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,679
minutes from the ferry terminal from my

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,390
house so nice and quick and today we're

12
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,000
gonna be going and seeing stratosphere

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,520
and Cory Cottenham glass so these two

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,738
guys have been absolutely killing it up

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,120
on the Sunshine Coast I only see them

16
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,788
every once in a while but every time I

17
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,218
do they have absolutely impeccable glass

18
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,808
that is you know beyond inspirational

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,890
one of the things I've heard that

20
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:52,159
they've been doing lately is they're

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,689
producing moving pieces of glass

22
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,159
spinners and whatnot built into the

23
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,198
pieces so hopefully we'll get to see

24
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,339
some of that today we're gonna spend a

25
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,039
little bit of time with them have some

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,379
breakfast have a session find out what

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,150
they're up to in the next couple of

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,409
months here and hopefully get this see

29
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,960
them on the torch a little bit for a

30
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,240
little bit of glassblowing so hopefully

31
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:13,739
that all works out and I'm gonna bring

32
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,649
you guys with me the whole time so we're

33
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,419
gonna jump in this truck right here and

34
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:21,109

35
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,109
you guys join me

36
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,040
all right so we're heading down here

37
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:31,908
towards Horseshoe Bay which is called

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,409
the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal from

39
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,090
Horseshoe Bay we're gonna head over to

40
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:39,590
the Sunshine Coast to the terminal

41
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:42,250
called Langdale I'm sure the trucks

42
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,250
beeping out there

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,180
Tasha credit

44
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:14,099
all right so we're heading down here to

45
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:16,439
the ferry so we can jump on that boat

46
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:19,829
and head over to see stratosphere and

47
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,329
Cory should be a good little day over on

48
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,570
the Sunshine Coast been a while since

49
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:28,530
I've been over on the Sunshine Coast

50
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:32,209
looks pretty dead I better stay in lane

51
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,210
eleventh one she told me to stay in

52
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,250
what I'm doing

53
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:50,130
right behind the old Impala all right

54
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,129
guys that much closer

55
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,919
all right guys so I'm here at the line

56
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,829
up to the ferry which isn't much of a

57
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,919
lineup at all we have about maybe thirty

58
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,890
five minutes to wait for it to come in

59
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:13,318
there's maybe 25 cars here I have once

60
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:15,899
again I have this bane of my existence I

61
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:19,799
have to share with you guys I have have

62
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:23,879
one of these converters a terminator

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,830
mobile power inverter and I try I got

64
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,959
this from my Dean ale and I bought this

65
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,090
and of course the Dean ale has too much

66
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,830
power it doesn't heat up using this so

67
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,509
that's okay because I talked to the guys

68
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,040
at Dean ale and they they were like

69
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:36,840
we're gonna send you a battery we're

70
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,159
gonna figure out what battery works best

71
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,469
and we're gonna send you a battery so

72
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,449
they sent me this battery they actually

73
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:44,609
sent this battery locked into a table

74
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:46,079
that my friend has so my friend who

75
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,480
bought the table food email who didn't

76
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,000
want to open the table he got me this

77
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,669
battery the same battery and I'll tell

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,959
ya it doesn't work with the D mail which

79
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:57,449
you guys have seen in my videos before

80
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,180
and I keep forgetting the unit that does

81
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:02,429
work which is the dab inator

82
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,189
the dab inator is a European model it's

83
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,920
220 volt it works on 110 it basically

84
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:10,889
works everywhere and it on everything

85
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,750
but I forgot it it's a little bit bigger

86
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:14,759
my D nails the smaller unit and it's

87
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,108
more travel friendly so I really got to

88
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:17,548
start figuring this out because I was

89
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:20,219
gonna have a nice D mail session with

90
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:23,129
you guys I got not a bad back up here I

91
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:27,210
got the sarin pen which is my little pen

92
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:28,620
that's got the ceramic internal pieces

93
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:32,699
here I got it let's see there we got

94
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:35,689
that on there we're gonna heat up we are

95
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:38,550
gonna heat up we've got heated up edge

96
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:39,990
nice sizzle on that pen and I got all

97
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,500
sorts of nice rosin that I'm bringing

98
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,139
over for to share with the boys we've

99
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:51,180
got some some darker stuff here that I

100
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:53,129
made from some sweet sweet pink cush the

101
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,019
sweet pink that's some other much

102
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:59,159
lighter stuff that I made from the

103
00:04:55,019 --> 00:05:01,180
Lindsay og this is also Lindsay og

104
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,340
really nice color on this lane

105
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,680
it's got beautiful color and really nice

106
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:12,310
stability too you can totally pick it up

107
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:14,509
and play around with it a little bit so

108
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:25,689
why don't we put a tiny little bit of

109
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:25,689
this lindzei into oh my god it's so nice

110
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:30,168
yeah I usually just turn the little

111
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,019
heater on a tiny little bit when I'm

112
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:37,430
putting rosin in and it just it just

113
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:39,378
drops it off beautifully so we'll have a

114
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,810
couple of little rips here pretty

115
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:43,759
excited to go see these guys I haven't

116
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,939
spent a ton of time with either of them

117
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,770
but I have known them for some time now

118
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:51,199
between the two of them and they're just

119
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:53,838
extremely talented glass blowers it's

120
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,520
nice that we have some glass blowers of

121
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:57,199
this sort of caliber that lived right

122
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,718
here in British Columbia literally right

123
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,430
across the water from me so I have to

124
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:03,740
admit I am feeling pretty spoiled today

125
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,389
that I just get to wake up drive the

126
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,338
truck over to the Sunshine Coast over

127
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:09,259
the ferries maybe catch some dolphins

128
00:06:07,338 --> 00:06:11,718
and whales you never know off the ferry

129
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:15,319
and you know go see a couple of great

130
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:16,848
guys see what they're up to and share it

131
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:25,848
all with you guys so I hope you guys are

132
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:27,228
excited for this saerom pen Gibbs I got

133
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:32,269
to admit it's got two heaters on the

134
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:37,278
inside if you want to know how to spell

135
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:40,908
it at CER AM PE n the Cera FN and it's

136
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:44,180
got two ceramic heater coils on the

137
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:46,069
inside two little loops so most of them

138
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,569
come with one this one comes with two

139
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:50,389
and I have to say it really makes a a

140
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:52,598
notable difference on how it how it

141
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,598
vapes

142
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:06,089
well I guess I'm gonna sit here and puff

143
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,230
more of this rosin and yeah once we get

144
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:11,129
onto the ferry I'll give you guys a

145
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:13,230
little bit of ferry view get out onto

146
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:14,579
the top upper deck and maybe check out

147
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,230
the water I think it's a pretty nice day

148
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:18,269
out I'm not sure exactly the temperature

149
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,680
18 degrees or something a little bit

150
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:21,149
overcast but you know what

151
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,069
this is the kind of weather that you see

152
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,989
the wildlife in the ocean so I'm not

153
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:26,459
bummed out about it at all

154
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,670
we'll see you on that ferry real soon

155
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,669
guys

156
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,740
all right so I'm back at the back of the

157
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:51,360
ferry the classic place that you had to

158
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,360
if you want to enjoy cannabis

159
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,569
be a pretty chill but

160
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:07,689
having a few rosin drips out of the

161
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,819
ceramic pan at the back of the ferry I

162
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:13,649
look forward to landing though and

163
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:13,649
having a serious d-mail session

164
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,999
[Music]

165
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,839
alright guys so the ferry is almost

166
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:37,259
ready here just about to head out pull

167
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,950
up to the Sunshine Coast which is right

168
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:40,629
there

169
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,070
and I just got a little bit of a drive

170
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:43,899
today I'm going to be driving up to a

171
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,260
place called Roberts Creek which is

172
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:49,949
about maybe 20 25 minutes up into the

173
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,950
Sunshine Coast

174
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,309
I can't even remember all the different

175
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,209
names these places but

176
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:58,208
this is where we're heading

177
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:03,289
make it on me there now so won't you

178
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,289
join me

179
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:02,600
all right Sunshine Coast bound here we

180
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:05,929
are alright so now we just head down the

181
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:09,050
one Main Street here that is the street

182
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:10,128
to be on Gibson's way is the one we're

183
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:12,469
looking for we're going to be turning

184
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:14,449
onto Gibson's way and this Street takes

185
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,160
you all the way through you know right

186
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:20,118
to the end to the ferry that will take

187
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:22,368
you to the powell river and lund and

188
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:24,139
that sort of stuff this is the Sunshine

189
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:25,670
Coast and you can drive down this road

190
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:27,619
for God it's got to be over an hour

191
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:29,178
before you get to Earl's Cove which is

192
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:31,160
the ferry at the end of this road and

193
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:34,730
you go through Gibson's you go through

194
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:37,159
Robert's Creek and you go through sea

195
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,649
Scheldt so we're gonna be taking

196
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:42,019
Gibson's way here just in a little bit

197
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:44,328
less than half a mile beautiful up here

198
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:46,549
on the Sunshine Coast though real

199
00:10:44,328 --> 00:10:48,109
different vibe right away you land and

200
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:50,058
you just feel more of this sort of

201
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,308
Island vibe even though we're not on the

202
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:54,860
island we're on the mainland it's still

203
00:10:52,308 --> 00:10:57,129
a ferry away they're not able to drive

204
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:01,688
their cars so it makes for a pretty cool

205
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:01,688
cool vibe on the coast no doubt about it

206
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,509
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

207
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:21,679
I'm here on the Sunshine Coast I finally

208
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:24,709
made it here and I'm here with

209
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,719
stratosphere glass and Cory Cory caught

210
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,198
him in the house thanks for having me up

211
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,730
guys

212
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:34,159
this is I got up and it was rainy and

213
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,500
gray kind of like drove to the Horseshoe

214
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:39,649
Bay ferry it's all just this real sort

215
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,339
of somber it happened halfway here

216
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:45,139
literally halfway here it was like oh

217
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:46,939
the clouds will help this morning it was

218
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:50,180
shining here already it was beautiful

219
00:11:46,938 --> 00:11:52,278
day yeah that's nice for sure yeah yeah

220
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:54,679
we went to what was that the angry chef

221
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:56,360
yeah that is a pretty good spot if you

222
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,649
guys are ever in Gibson go check it out

223
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,810
they definitely had been hammered out

224
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:02,870
some really nice breakfasts for a pretty

225
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:04,578
darn good price for four people and yeah

226
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,049
we filled up we came up here we've

227
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:07,458
already hung out a little bit and puffed

228
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:08,838
some bowls and they showed me a little

229
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,758
bit of glass but I thought you know what

230
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,370
why don't we sit down have a little

231
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,500
discussion I don't really get to talk

232
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,948
about the glass scene that much on my

233
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:35,208
channel so it's nice to be able to

234
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:36,588
veteran dude I can only imagine because

235
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:39,318
to me it was just happening all around

236
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:43,790
me and I guess we don't realize when we

237
00:12:39,318 --> 00:12:45,789
look back at things like that at how you

238
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:48,049
know these communities are so small that

239
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:50,389
eventually when that small community you

240
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:52,039
travel 25 years into the future and

241
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:53,379
they're you know these are well-known

242
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:56,139
artists now who

243
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:57,490
in museums and capturing prices for

244
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:59,830
their glass that you just kind of can't

245
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:03,310
even fathom from a from a layman's

246
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,930
standpoint but it's it's quite something

247
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:07,689
when you're in it you don't realize that

248
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:11,099
it's like these all these amazing

249
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:14,110
artists were involved in that project oh

250
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,879
my god some pretty inspirational pieces

251
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,580
in there for sure I got to give it up to

252
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,620
slinger cuz he was really you know I say

253
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,629
that we both curated that show but in a

254
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,580
sense when it comes to the art really

255
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:26,529
slinger curated that show in the sense

256
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,750
that he knew every one of those blowers

257
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:33,309
there used to drool over that East peace

258
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:36,340
doughnut penetrated yeah I do what it

259
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:37,750
looks like the bowl at the top but it's

260
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,280
not the bowl actually comes through the

261
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,590
penetration yeah because it's almost got

262
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,299
this weird like not a pendant it's a

263
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,190
part of the piece but it's like pushed

264
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:47,649
there soon yeah I loved it because I

265
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,840
used to put hash on my pipes that was

266
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:52,179
one of the pieces that I have to admit

267
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,399
that I was a little bit bummed that I

268
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:55,899
didn't get you know because that the

269
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,340
color on that thing as well was just

270
00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:01,329
absolutely spectacular

271
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:03,399
I remember slinger being like hey you

272
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:06,070
know Jason wants to do a piece with this

273
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,909
guy Steve hops he's not not not many

274
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,730
people know who he is

275
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:11,860
can can he be in the glass show or oh

276
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,509
I've got this friend bearclaw he's never

277
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,330
been in a show before but he's really

278
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:18,549
he's he's on point and you know can we

279
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,440
bring him in it was just like to be the

280
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:21,759
responsible to be one of the people who

281
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,860
are like yeah let's bring this guy in

282
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,169
and then you know once again look back

283
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,899
10 to 15 years later and see you know

284
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:30,519
where some of these guys are it's it's

285
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,740
been pretty great I have to admit you

286
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,069
know as a hash guy I really have to give

287
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:40,149
it up to the oil in how it seemed to

288
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,680
induce this frenzy of collecting would

289
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:44,429
you guys not agree that somewhere along

290
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,429
the line when it

291
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,129
[Music]

292
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:53,989
it's like a futuristic thing it is

293
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:55,938
you're just going to have a rip it's not

294
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:58,790
it's not your standard thing anymore now

295
00:14:55,938 --> 00:15:00,889
there's cables and plugs and wires and

296
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:02,958
carbs and you know all the different

297
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:06,558
things and then you guys take it a step

298
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:08,149
further with your with moving blacks so

299
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:09,409
I like that you guys have sort of you

300
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:11,649
know what what kind of brought you to

301
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:14,238
the fact that you wanted to see glass

302
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:17,028
moving on your pieces because I mean to

303
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:18,410
me as a blast user there's been lots of

304
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:27,438
other people have made some cool pieces

305
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:28,818
I mean that back-in-the-day pieces I've

306
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:31,099
seen it here and there being able to

307
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:32,778
play with your glass too you know that

308
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,999
extra little bit of function it's got

309
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:37,068
that more purpose to it I think it's

310
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:41,928
pretty cool I like to that things have

311
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:44,238
gotten so much more accurate if you will

312
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:46,009
you can get so much you know that

313
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:48,139
perfect detail in where you can have

314
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:50,629
that glass spinner spin so perfectly

315
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:51,860
it's on a boat they call a cavitation I

316
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:54,048
don't know what they would call it in

317
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,058
the spin when when the spin is not

318
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:58,039
proper when it's just there's some

319
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:59,719
little bit off a little bit of problem

320
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:01,578
in water through cavitation it's

321
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,069
unbelievable but it'll make a boat feel

322
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:05,928
yeah it's just taking the extra time the

323
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:08,389
tediousness to make sure everything is

324
00:16:05,928 --> 00:16:10,519
lined up and straight the lathe really

325
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:13,999
helps out a lot with it too oh I can

326
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,230

346
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:11,869
can focus your brain on cognitive

347
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:14,559
activity and he of course put the arts

348
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:20,149
highly up in the cognitive activity

intensive it must have just started

397
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,220
getting more and more intense as you

398
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:36,640
started stacking and building exterior

399
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:42,528
and scarier yeah yeah it's I mean it's

400
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:45,500
kind of leaves you with nothing to say

another building and they all just seem

509

we've been pulling some canes through

521
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:18,480
making readies so we've been putting

522
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:20,129
these color plugs and dunking them in

523
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,990

under your belt the ability to sort of

536

control and manipulate and produce your

537
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,090
