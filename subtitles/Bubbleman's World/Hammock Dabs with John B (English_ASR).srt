all right well welcome back everyone uh

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,278
something I don't often do is go up into

4
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,278
the forest I have like acreage behind my

5
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:32,880
house and it's just trees for for Miles

6
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,159
literally you can walk over my house and

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,239
you can end up in Cypress bowl and I've

8
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,000
got hammocks strung up here two of them

9
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:41,000
here it's a little bit harder to get to

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,878
but me and John managed yeah and you

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,679
know it's a nice little drop here and

12
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,599
looks yeah it's like a 50ft drop or

13
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:48,359
whatever I'm used to those we should be

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,879

15
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:51,558
head John oh [ __ ] you know I've been

16

64
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:47,919

65
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,598
the

66
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,598
denail but we needed something that was

67
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:55,399
quicker and easier than that case each

68
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:57,039
time and the amount of you know how fast

69
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,239
things were traveling for us one scene

70

00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:07,199
crazy you know lot of fun so I've heated

73
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,599
it up right on the right where it says

74
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,280
hot the hot right in front of you there

75
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,639

76
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,199

77
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:18,839
it from there but he dunked a huge

78
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:22,759
monster dab on there and it this little

79
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,479
10 mil Bowl it's not very um it's not

80
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:27,199
very forgiving if you make any mistakes

81
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:31,039
so a little bit of my hit actually went

82
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:34,518
down the center but John hit that with

83
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:37,039
