I'm more accepting of this sort of thing

76
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:26,478
happening hits kind of going off the

77
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:30,359
edge although you can car cap it it'll

78
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:32,399
just sort of save it

80
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:38,599
like that I've got a carb cap on the way

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,300
would such a small

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,420
amount you're going to get the

83
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,420
[Music]

84
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,879
hit yeah so we're just uh once again

85
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,519
happy to

86
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:54,560
be

87
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,599
exempt federally happy that we still

88
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,199
have our licenses for March 31st

89
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,000
hopefully further

90
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,840
um but you know right now the the

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,959
licensing as it sits it allows John and

92
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:09,198
I to get together it allows us to do the

93
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,239
things you see us doing and uh share

94
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,038
them with you without the worry of any

95
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,840
sort of negative consequence which

96
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:18,159
really when you're sharing things like

97
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,279
what John and I are sharing I don't

98
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,000
think there ever should be a negative

99
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,159
consequence I think all we're really

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,918
talking about here is actually how to

101
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,520
extract the medicine out of the plant

102
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:33,359
properly because that's how I'm properly

103
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,159
able to medicate and uh something that

104
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,600
worries me what we just talking about

105
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,600
which is with the program ending with

106
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,319
health Canada's medical marijuana access

107
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,960
regulation program where I personally

108
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,840
and Mark personally can grow her own

109
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,359
medicines in her house while now I will

110
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,119
not be able to access uh making fresh

111
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,038
frozen or making the bubble hash that

112
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,280
I've been using now for quite some time

113
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,079
for my paint control so it's actually um

114
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,758
basically doing all the things we do

115
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,639
yeah everything I'm doing right now

116
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,639
we won't it won't be feasible no I'll

117
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,960
have to actually buy it from a

118
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,639
commercial production facility to bring

119
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,159
home and then with whatever they give me

120
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,680
then I can try and make something which

121
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,919
is but will that be legal I know the

122
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,680
buying it will be legal but once we buy

123
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,519
it and take it home are we allowed to

124
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,800
extract resin from it I think we're

125
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,038
pretty much allowed to do whatever we

126
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,319
want with it within the new regulations

127
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,719
well I know here in BC we're kind of

128
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,759
safe but the rest of Canada is not so

129
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,039
and I think

130
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,439
even yeah I think it's all changing

131
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,120
either way uh it's important that

132
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,839
everyone pay attention that's involved

133
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,439

143
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,000
our cause um donation and uh everything

144
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,520
you can do is drawing awareness towards

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,399
um what is happening here in Canada with

146
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,799
our federal system that has been legal

147
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,719
since 2001 for people who are suffering

148
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,240
from disabilities and other ailments

149
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,240
related to their health issues and uh

150
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,038
now we are going to be forced to buy

151
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,759
from basically a commercial producer

152
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:32,199
yeah our bigger corporate corporate

153
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,800
corporate take over on the medical

154
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,079
marijana they're going to control the

155
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,240
production and they're going to control

156
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,560
the distribution and I think personally

157
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,079
that it's a component that is necessary

158
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,319
for a certain group of our uh population

159
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,680
100% but I think that um you know vapor

160
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:52,240
bars and uh dispensaries and growing

161
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,918
your own is abolutely a must they can

162
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,598
have they can still grow they can

163
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,359
actually buy legal perect completely

164
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:01,038
legal so that makes no sense then we got

165
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,120
uguay body can actually grow their own

166
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,800
we're going to have to go do some

167
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,158
filming in in uguay Washington right

168

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,720
riding motorcycles

212
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,920
[Music]

213
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,600
just sitting here thinking about

214
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:10,159
um just how great it is to be able to uh

215
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,440
enjoy natural M we're very blessed John

216
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,519
yeah it is it's quite nice and and the

217
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,240
way things are happening worldwide and

218
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,879
the way people are waking up I just look

219
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,720
over here at the Facebook page and

220
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:24,360
CNN and everything there's just so much

221
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,879
information that's exploding on the

222
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,600
endocan avonoid system there's no hiding

223
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,120
it the body's on T and how it Reg the

224
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,800
central nervous system it's quite

225
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,399
amazing what's happening world I think

226
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,120
it's why we're going to see Canada open

227
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,720
up I think we're going to see more than

228
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,440
even what we're hoping for which is the

229
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,040
grandfathering of The Growers who have

230
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,399
already had their licenses I don't think

231
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,759
that's fair to the rest of the Canadian

232
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,839
citizens I think everyone always has to

233
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,519
have the right to be able to

234
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,160
grow regardless of what year they might

235
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,278
have gotten their license and more

236
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:57,879
importantly regardless of their a

237
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,958
because we should not be classifying

238
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,120
ails as

239
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:04,479
certain ones be it's it's about quality

240
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,039
of life so whatever your a is you want

241
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,600
to improve your quality of life and no

242
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:11,319
one's quality of life is worth more than

243
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,600
anyone else's 100% And like would always

244
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,600
say cannabis theoc cannaboids body own t

245
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,000
regulates the central nervous system so

246
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,240

just you're not getting high from it's

253
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,440
it's what they want pharmaceutical pills

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,560
to be but they aren't you know

255
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,720
pharmaceutical pills are pure and

256
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,638
straightforward poison that just kill

257
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,320
people well PHA is needed in in acute

258
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,079
stages of pain Absolut certain

259
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,079
conditions absolutely but the addiction

260
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:52,838
of it and the months of it it's like

261
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:55,120
yeah short periods of time I mean I when

262
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,639
I broke my collar bone they gave me pain

263
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,519
meds I chose not to take them I felt all

264
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,759
the pain it was terribly painful for

265
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,720
about 5 weeks and I just chose not to

266
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,879
take the medicine uh the t3s and

267
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,000
whatever other things they were trying

268
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:11,399
to offer me just because I felt like the

269
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,440
damage that those would do to my liver

270
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,839
and to my body and the potential

271
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,399
addictive qualities just weren't worth

272
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,920
it to me now I albe it it was only one

273
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,958
bone I wasn't in traction in a hospital

you get all kinds of different receptors

278
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:36,360
and stuff like that but definitely it is

279
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:39,198

oh my gosh these are those rid you

352
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,880
brought these to Toronto right yeah okay

353
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,240
I was going to say so John brought these

354
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:59,000
nugs the chorono and for whatever reason

355
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,399
they dened up in a way that

356
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,278
it's like some of the Dead you could

357
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,679
drive over it with a car for sure but

358
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:08,720
but everything did all of my we did

359
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,439
everything was rock hard but wasn't this

360
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,679
the one you showed all of us and we were

361
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,720
all tripping out about it yeah yeah so

362
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:18,000
that was the hard was it not the hardest

363
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,480
one am I mistaken it was cuz I thought

364
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,880
you it

365
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,558
is anyway wild to do that BC cure right

366
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,120
you got the humidity and it's like

367
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:29,918
fluffy and marshmallowy and then you

368
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,359
take it on the plane it's just like

369
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,480
and then you get into a nice dry yeah

370
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:37,359
the humidity is just gone it's gone

371
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,440
there everybody's like wow it was just

372
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,079
like you're just like yeah that's how I

373
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,960
grow it it's one more reason how this

374
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,480
thing that is the internet is classic

375
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,880
for which is the Assumption of others

376
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,679
you know I see it all the time where

377
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,080
I'll post a photo of a friend of mine's

378
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:55,240
pipe and a thousand people will assume

379
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:58,960
you know I'm a huge baller cuz that's my

380
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:02,440
pipe and it's not my pipe at all

381
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,840
I see it with a texture of hash people

382
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,798
post the texture of hash and then others

383
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:08,399
assume that that person is responsible

384
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,558
for the

385
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,840
texture of the hash whereas I think

386
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,639
really what's responsible is how well it

387
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:19,519
was grown and then yeah sure you isolate

388
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,960
it the texture is the texture it's not

389
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,279
Oil we're not doing Special processes to

390
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,720
it to change the texture it is what it

391
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,440
is people ask me all the time how how

392
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,480
how can I make it waxy how do I make it

393
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,120
sh

394
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,480
it's like you grow dank resin that's how

395
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:37,319
and people ask me how you get this

396
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,319
killer I was like well I grow

397
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:44,480
organically I'm happy that you do I use

398
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,720
one smoke this every day works Awesome

399
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,798
every day and I flush for like 40 days

400
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,000
it's that's great it's great and the

401
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:57,158
plants just give me always full melt

402
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,798
beautiful flavors consistently over and

403
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:00,760
over and over you sure do I remember

404
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,558
when I met you and we made the killer

405
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:05,210
dry sift I was kind of confused as to

406
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:06,519
why your bubble wasn't

407
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,690
[Music]

408
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,679
killer because I

409
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:14,798
[Music]

410
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:16,919
wasn't but you had proper

411
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:21,240
res that was the

412
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:24,360
crazy you had proper resin oh um that's

413
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,798
right too because I

414
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:27,719
wasn't and then that's where I realized

415
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,558
once I

416
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:35,400
clean I didn't run just a 160 bag and a

417
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:36,960
50 bag I actually run the8 bag system

418
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,400
and really understand how to use the

419
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,400
bubble bags and the screens and

420
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:46,558
[Music]

421
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:51,480
everything start aning like people like

422
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:54,599
oh man yeah as yeah but you don't stack

423
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,798
that is that is proper 90 Micron and

424
00:19:54,599 --> 00:20:01,319
people like to take out I use a 220 bag

425
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:04,119
and a 160 B and then go right down to

426
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:06,158
the 50 bag or the 45 and then come up

427
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,959
with these big rock check this so it's

428
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,039
all

429
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,759
compress and you look at go what are you

430
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,960
doing important factor people that they

431
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,158
don't understand they want the 73 and

432
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,279
the 90 we all do but you have to

433
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,320
understand the other bags are key to get

434
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:22,918
those bags to be the way they are it's

435
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:25,119
the difference between the oil community

436
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,038
and the hash Community we smoke a

437
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,199
particular size gland head we don't

438
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,599
smoke 25 generally

439
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,159
a lot of us don't smoke 160 some of us

440
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:38,079
don't even smoke 120 which I find insane

441
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:41,200
cuz I love it myself 12 120 90 and 73 or

442
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:45,798
my three I will smell 45 I've SM killer

443
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:48,519
45 and you know Crush 45 nothing sure

444
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:51,918
yeah and outdoor sungrown sativas in

445
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:56,480
Equatorial you know tropical places

446
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,880
produce amazing 25 M now so they all

447
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,000
have their place uh it's just important

448
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,760
you use them all in order to get the

449
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,759
ones that you

450
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,759
like I know you have pictures of this

451
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,959
but just when you open up this

452
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:21,519
J thousands and thousands of

453
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,480
littley millions and so you see I like

454
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:27,879
to this is the same hash I like to cure

455
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,200
in both containers I don't uh you know

456
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,880
although I like glass more I find that

457
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,919
if I'm always willing to learn then I'll

458
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,159
do things well then I then I'll learn I

459
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:40,880
find if I'm always willing to learn I'll

460
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,159
learn and if I just think glass is the

461
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,799
greatest thing and there's no place for

462
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:48,640
hash in plastic then I lose any

463
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:50,918
potential possibility of you know a

464
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,200
discovery what one thing I've learned is

465
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:59,278
when you carry your Buckle hasing BL J

466
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:01,400
say like cooler like this and it falls

467
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:04,919
and all that

468
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:08,080
Bub so so that's why I've actually more

469
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:10,000
containers St I like a lot of these

470
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,199
little containers I pack these up good

471
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,480
they're good for the Trippy Stick

472
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,558
they're good for the containers are

473
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,038
everywhere everybody's got these

474
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:20,798
containers and you know what just U make

475
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:23,240
sure you put on the bottom like mine's

476
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:25,679
73910 as we were talking about the three

477
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,359
that we like the most yes absolutely of

478
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,000
course that's an absolutely definitely

479
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:32,079
your your favorite I don't think yeah

480
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,159

481
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,399

00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:23,839
legalization

494
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,840
Colorado I think it's almost

495
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,000
done I thought there might have been hit

496
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:34,199
there but I think it might be a one of

497
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,720
those

498
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,278
that's

499
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,919
wow yeah that's

500
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:43,839
strong it is it's strong yeah I already

501
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:46,080
said that too I was like I need

502
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:49,278
something strong right now this is nice

503
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:51,240
but this is more than nice this is ice

504
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:55,480
wine this is

505
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,599
like like liquid nitrogen made uh ice

506
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,319
cream you know this is like the high-end

507
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:03,199
dessert at the high-end restaurant this

508
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:06,439
is every hash smoker just wants to smoke

509
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,640
this until they fall asleep it's so

510
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,000
freaking

511
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,360
tasty I have to say yeah that is the

512
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,119
best I've ever had is that that's tasty

513
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:15,798
tasty tasty for me I've never made

514
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,719
anything like that until you show me

515
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:19,038
these way it's just and that's the

516
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,000
beautiful thing when you grow it

517
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:24,319
properly and you do it properly that

518
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,519
every you know not every strain but

519
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,558
potentially there's a lot of strains out

520
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,200
there that have the potential to be what

521
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,678
I call like the best in the world you

522
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,120
know sure there might be a hundred there

523
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,480
might be a thousand I don't know how

524
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:39,199
many there's definitely a lot of them

525
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,720
I've seen a lot of full melt out there

526
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,679
years ago I was going to start a company

527
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,399
with a friend called Full melt

528
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,159
genetics and we were just going to

529
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:50,519
broker seeds that we had assured people

530
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:53,320
would produce full melt resins if grown

531
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:55,599
properly and uh so I paid attention over

532
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:59,359
the years to the strains that do and wow

533
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:02,839
it's a growing list I'm happy to say

534
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:02,839
happy to say

535
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,219
