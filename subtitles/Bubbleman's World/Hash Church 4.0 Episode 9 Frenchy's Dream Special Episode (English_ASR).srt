168
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,318
actually a pretty good time to do a hash

169
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,560
church so feeling pretty about that you

170
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,639
know uh you know we're here at the the

171
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,399
gwa smoke Club in Barcelona we were here

172
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,879
a month ago with Stephen green lifee uh

173
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,799
Stephen quy from Green life and when we

174
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,919
came to Barcelona we really really felt

175
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,840
the impact of Frenchie canoli and all of

176
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:53,918
the work that Frenchie's put out there

177
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:55,519
because the love for hash is here in a

178
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,198
way that you just you know you see it in

179
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,719
a lot of places but there's just there's

180
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,840
just a huge amount of appreciation here

181

186
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,639
life like Frenchie and Elders that

187
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:22,399

188
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:24,759

189
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,198

193
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,918
of respect for everyone that's on this

thank you so much you want to say one

196
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,120
more thing yeah I just wanted to say

197
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,240
that one thing you know that we are

198
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,320
focused on in dragonfly Earth medicine

199
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,320
is just really education education for

200
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,800
Community Education for regenerative

201
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,560
medicine

202
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:57,639
and uh connecting with Frenchie on that

203
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,759
level was definitely one of the

204
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:06,600
highlights of my life he changed the way

205
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:08,799
I thought he challenged so many ideas he

206
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,120
would take apart everything that you

207
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:15,559
would say and want to rebuild it in a

208
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:18,600
Frenchy way and because of that I have

209
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:21,199
so much love for him and the education

210
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:25,079

we always found it uh uh 10 Deep uh

236
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,240
whenever we came to his booth and we

237
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,800
were never able to hook up at a couple

238
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,759
of the cups we were trying to hook up so

239
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,719
when we finally did meet it was an honor

240
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:46,838
to meet him and it was at a gold key

241
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:50,240
event in Las Vegas a few years back and

242
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,440
um it was just so cool because um uh he

243
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,159
was actually part of the registration

244
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,959
process so anybody who who went to that

245
00:10:55,159 --> 00:11:00,719
event uh met met Frenchie but then we

246
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:03,759
had a a little moment later on over by

247
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,959
the pool where yeah I mean I I so what I

248
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:10,159
got from him just because I remember

249
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:12,638
watching him at these events is is again

250
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,399
to speak with Josh and Kelly just said

251
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,200
how he was the educator the consumate

252
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,919
educator and how there was a whole group

253
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,680
of people around him that was absorbing

254
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,838
everything he was saying and everything

255
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:29,399
he was doing and that's why like in so

256
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,720
many ways he's like people who've passed

257
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:36,879
before who have left such an inspiration

258
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,120
in their educational uh time on this

259
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,919
brief period that were on this shining

260
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,919
blue ball and it was just it was so

261
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:48,599
meant for him to be that educator who

262
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:51,399
brought his passion and his journey that

263
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,120
only he singularly took in life to you

00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:51,879
learning but this connection between um

329
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,920
you know place and plant and people and

330
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:58,078
um terar and and what that all really

331
00:14:54,919 --> 00:15:02,759
means and um and he really mentored Us

332
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:04,919
in that in that idea of Appalachians and

333
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,800
that this was something really important

334
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:10,519
and that we we needed to take it

335
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:13,639
seriously and that if we wanted to talk

336
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:15,959
about how the the weed that we grow here

337
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,480
in in the matle valley and and humble to

338
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,638
special that it's not something you can

339
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,560
just lightly say that if you're going to

340
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,720
talk about this you you really need to

341
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,838
take it seriously and and have a respect

342
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,000
for the the old traditions of what these

343
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:34,079
these words like app ations mean and and

344
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,679
he was he was he was really um intent on

345
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,399
that and that like don't say that unless

346
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:40,120
you are serious and you're going to do

347
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,559
the work and there's science and there's

348
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,600
work and you can't just throw this

349
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:47,719
around lightly and um so he really was a

350
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,959
mentor and he told us books to read and

351
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,639
and sent us links and came and visited

352
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:54,799
and talked with us and introduced us to

353
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,399
to to all sorts of people and so you

354

00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:42,639
don't think we've met uh

370
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:46,240
physic uh hi waade laughter here and no

371
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:49,399
we haven't met specifically but I

372
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,120
um I I could say some of the same things

373
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:55,360
that Dr Mark said about uh the couple of

374
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,720
times I managed to run into Frenchie uh

375
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,360
he was surrounded by a mob and I've

376
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,360
always been a bit of a hermit

377
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,640
and so I just gave him plenty of space I

378
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,199
I actually did invest a couple of times

379
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,319
in some of his work uh for my own

380
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,318
personal uh Joy if you

381
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:18,959
will uh and yeah

382
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:21,199
uh I would say this my my experience of

383
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,480
Frenchie uh as I've watched some of the

384
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:29,360
videos he's made um I I feel like as a

385
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,480
traveler he discovered a culture and

386
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,038
developed a passion for it in different

387
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,679
countries where traditional hash making

388
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:40,599
was being practiced and he took the

389
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:44,080
heart if you will of those cultures and

390
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:48,159
brought it to the work here in the west

391
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:50,279
and uh taught us again he his approach

392
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,720
was I don't have any secrets I want to

393
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,839
share with you what I've learned and

394
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,360
maybe I'll learn something too I could

395
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:59,439
be talking about me but that was my

396
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:01,319
sense of Frenchie that he was so open to

397
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,038
uh the people who did who did manage to

398
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:06,960
fight through the crowd and talk to him

399
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:08,679
and I did actually um a couple of years

400
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,480
back just before the emerald cup the

401
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:15,880
dragonfly Earth medicine family hi J and

402

403
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,559

404
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,079
was but yeah Frenchie came he brought

405
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,960
his his big hookah and I did have a

406
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:28,599

again I got there early and he got there

411
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:39,798
late and but I did chance to

412
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:42,158
share his work directly through his

413
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:45,079
hookah and that is a lot where I got my

414
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:47,159
sense of his love for what he was doing

415
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,960
that I don't have any secrets here it is

416
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:52,280
drink deeply of what I have experienced

417
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,840
in my life and that's an inspiration to

418
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:57,918
me because that's that's a lot where my

419
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:02,399
love for this plant comes from I've I've

420
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:05,000

421

inches deep out there oh [ __ ] W last

465
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:10,798
night I had to go out and scrape off the

466
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,919
uh the Satellite Dish thing and I had to

467
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:16,519
scrape off the solar panels as they had

468
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:21,080
a bunch of snow the snow was over my

469
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:24,319
boots wow and my my fingers were cold

470
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:29,079
but that's the report talking well okay

471
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:29,079
frie would love the snow I'm sure

472
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,879
fry well what a great friend he was and

473
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:38,200
we had a lot of good times

474
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,278
together and we had that special

475
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,960
connection from Goa you know and we have

476
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:47,278
a lot of mutual friends who knew

477
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:50,079
Frenchie as Camy back in Goa right he

478
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:53,880
was a whole another character back there

479
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:56,558
but he realized his full true life's

480
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,799
purpose when he came to

481
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:01,678
California right cuz he was looking for

482
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,558
the best to make the best hash and he

483
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,120
finally realized to make the best hash

484
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:09,678
you need the best flower and when he

485
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:12,719
came here I think the tpin blew the head

486
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,200
the top off of his head and so that was

487
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,159
just the whole thing that he dived in

488
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,319
and he was kind of in many

489
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,919
ways chronology wise he was kind of a

all over the world that are going to be

528
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:13,798
scheduling some in-person events so that

together um and then after that we're

532
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,399
going to do a live stream so that we can

533
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:27,759
talk about the films so that I can uh

534
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,080
get the filmmaker online with us and you

535
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,720
guys can ask some questions and we can

536
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,639
just hear what yall think about the film

537
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,960
and the

538
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,440
experience I I can't thank you enough

539
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,480
for finally putting it uh online

540
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,000
unfortunately every time that it's aired

541
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,960
uh my mother is in hospice so I've had

542
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,599
to travel back to Mississippi to visit

543
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,240
and be with her so it's just been a

544
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:54,678
series of unhappy accidents

545
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,278
unfortunately and I am beyond excited

546
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,840
and I will have my own little watch

547
00:24:56,278 --> 00:25:00,720
party here probably with my my veterans

548
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,199
Action Council friends uh we'll probably

549
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,120
get together and do a little watch party

550
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,080
out of love because Frenchie was an

551
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,079
inspiration to all of

552
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:14,959
us we also haven't haven't seen it yet

553
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:16,918
so we're waiting to see it we were gonna

554
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,519
maybe get to see it at The Hive in

555
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,440
California while we were there but it

556
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,119
didn't get to happen Luna was there so

557
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,798
that was beautiful to spend time with

558
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:30,798
Hera or Elena and uh and um yeah just uh

559
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:32,000
really stoked uh to see it up in Alberta

560
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,960
because I think it's going to be in

561
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Edmonton where we see it at the grow off

562
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,519
yes so that might be a really fun place

563
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,599
to to finally see it and I know the

564
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,798
family here in Barcelona want to see it

565
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,798
as

566
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:50,119
well a number of the social clubs are

567
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,678
gonna hold a a little screening so

568
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:55,278
that's going to be an option for a lot

569
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,440
of people um so that's lovely and I

570
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:00,000
shout out to the growup for being so

571
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,000
supportive of the film um you know they

572
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,839
kind of set this precedent of screening

573
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,798
the film and selling tickets and then

574
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:09,079
they're donating the money to the

575
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:11,839
nonprofit that were working with the

576
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:13,918
origins Council because Dylan and some

577
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,119
of the farmers featured in the film are

578
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,640
doing a little project on cannabis

579
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:21,959
terare and so we're using the donations

580
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:26,600
to help support those scientific studies

581
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,600
so we're pretty stoked about that

582
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,200
and and we're incredibly grateful

583
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:36,599
Kimberly for for for the help that you

584
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,159
and the support um you know both

585
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:40,719
financially but just um with with you

586
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,840
you you hold a lot of that wisdom that

587
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,440
freny shared with all of us so it's um

588
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:50,158
we're we're really all of us out here in

589
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,840
the matle are incredibly grateful um to

590
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,120
have you be participating and and

591
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:56,839
helping with us in that work and and

592
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,359
that's uh you know part of the spirit of

593
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,359
Frenchy living on for sure and we're

594
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,639
we're going to try to do right by him

595
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:05,839
it's um it's complicated science and

596
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,880
it's not something that's that's been

597
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:13,558
done um so it's it's certainly

598
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:16,159
challenging but um but but through um

599
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:17,759
working with Origins Council and Swami I

600
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,799
appreciate you as well I know you're

601
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:23,440
you're on the board of of OC and um you

602
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:25,240
know they've connected us with some

603
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,440
really incredible advisers and we're

604
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:31,240
working with Leaf Works who is uh put

605
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,640
together an experiment that we will be

606
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,759
diving into full scale this summer and

607
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:40,720
and really trying to to make this causal

608
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:44,480
link connection between the place and

609
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,919
the plant and how it expresses and um so

610
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,960
so thank you for mentioning that

611
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,240
Kimberly no my pleasure I was just uh

612
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,120
reading the newspaper yesterday that you

613
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,000
know so this whole concept of uh having

614
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:59,798
a tear wear that's then used to create

615
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,640
an appalation which which is this legal

616
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:06,599
uh structure to kind of protect the

617
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,960
small farmers for these recognized AGR

618
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:10,959
agricultural products they have this

619
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,000
precedent in Europe where they've used

620
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,600
it for cheese and for wine and for um

621
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,558
you know sausage products in Spain but

622
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,398
unfortunately in the US we don't have

623
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,319
much respect for this I just saw

624
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:27,439
yesterday that the government had ruled

625
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:30,480
that they're going to allow American Air

626
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,080
to be sold sold as Grier when this is a

627
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,278
product that has a a named protection in

628
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:39,398
Europe so it's a little frustrating that

629
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:42,079
somehow this concept is not honored or

630
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:44,079
that it's somehow appropriated and just

631
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,759
like anybody can use it if they make a

632
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,599
cheese that has holes in it and has been

633
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,240
aged for more than 90 days so I think

634
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:52,398
that's kind of a similar thing with some

635
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,000
of the challenges our industry has

636
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,278
experienced with

637
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,640
legalization having these like Mega

638
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:03,240
grows that flood the Market with product

639
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,880
that is you know not doesn't meet the

640
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,159
same standards there needs to be a way

641
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,960
to differentiate so that the the

642
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:13,640
dispensaries the consumers other people

643
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,640
are able to have access to Quality that

644
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,200
they want and frenly that was his whole

645
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,720
focus with his travels you know one of

646
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,399
the main things was he always wanted to

647
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,798
have access to the best product and

648
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:26,518
realized you had to go to the farmers

649
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,599
that the source of the quality was the

650
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:32,480
farmers and so I can't think of a better

651
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:36,278
way to support his legacy than to fund

652
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:40,480
things that emphasize that quality and

653
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:43,640
help the Legacy Farmers have their their

654
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,640
correct place in the marketplace in the

655
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,480
in the efforts what we're doing yeah

656
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,720
yeah frency and I talked about that as

657
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,079
you well know Kimberly forever and ever

658
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,360
and ever and we had some very energetic

659
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:59,278
discussions in the typical Frenchy way

660
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,678
uh and i' lived in South America enough

661
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,480
to know that uh shouting and screaming

662
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,798
is just passion not

663
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,079
anger right but for all of you who don't

664
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:12,839
know so much about Appalachian in France

665
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:15,038
uh which as you say it started hundreds

666
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:16,558
of years ago first with Roa for cheese

667
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:20,038
because some King wanted to be sure it

668
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:23,359
was Roa for cheese uh well uh there's

669
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:26,679
like 10 pages of appellations on Farm

670
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:29,319
Goods on agricultural products uh crops

671
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:31,919
in France there's there's uh Appalachian

672
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:33,439
butter there's saffron there's honey

673
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,360
there's lavender all these different

674
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,399
things which are like French basil so on

675
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:41,839
they're special products that get their

676
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:44,239
special flavor and quality from the soil

677
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,759
that they're grown in and from the

678
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,159
culture of the farmers who are the ones

679
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:53,519
doing the growing and the farmers are

680
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,200
are the car of the intellectual property

681
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,519
and when you have a collective of

682
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,840
farmers they have a group knowledge a

683
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:03,159
group uh understanding wisdom uh that

684
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,038
develops over the years now some people

685
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:06,799
would argue that in in the Cannabis

686
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,960
world we haven't been doing it quite

687
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:12,879
long enough to have that uh fundamental

688
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,399
uh you know wisdom of the people but we

689
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,760
do have a lot of that and we do know and

690
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:19,119
we do share that knowledge and that's

691
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,119
one of the key things about an

692
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,678
appalation that the the standards

693
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,879
practices and varietals are determined

694
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,759
by the farmers themselves not by a state

695
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,519
bureaucratic Department department and

696
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:33,679
that's key also to the French way of

697
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,599
doing which is adapted also by the

698
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:39,600
entire European Union so there are many

699
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:41,558
many many agricultural crops that do

700
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,519
have what they call the flavor or the

701
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:45,960
taste of the of the place where they

702
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,200
grow right curiously enough in the

703
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,200
United States there is not a single true

704
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,360
French style appalation they do not

705
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,880
exist and there you'll see driving

706
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:59,839
around certain Vine wine areas and

707
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,639
they'll say appal on the sign and they

708
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:06,240
legally cannot use that word the

709
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:07,879
technical word is geographic indicator

710
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,519
right they can use a geographical

711
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,840
indicator if it's grown in that area we

712
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,440
have it now in cannabis as well because

713
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:17,480
you can put the name of your county and

714
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,360
say it was grown in that county if you

715
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,798
can verify that 100% of the product in

716
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:25,079
the jar is from that County so we do get

717
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,599
County of designation but that's simply

718
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:30,439
a geographical there are no standards

719
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,959
prac IES and varietals for that so

720
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,000
that's the key to appalation uh how it's

721
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,480
going to play out uh in the United

722
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,278
States California was the first state to

723
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,759
actually legally put that word and those

724
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:45,119
qualifications onto any product and it's

725
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:48,480
cannabis it doesn't exist for any other

726
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:50,839
product in the US right everyone in the

727
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,360
US says all lawyers you talk to say well

728
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:54,918
just get a trademark it's the same thing

729
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,759
and you kind of look at them and say

730
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,080
well you don't quite understand this do

731
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,398
you because a trademark can be bought

732
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:03,158
and sold it can be moved it's owned by

733
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:04,798
somebody there are people in Florida

734
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:07,600
selling Humbolt this and that and the

735
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:10,119
other thing right so the thing is that

736
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:12,839
an appalation only belongs to the

737
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:15,319
farmers who create it and they have to

738
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:18,558
then create an a business entity of some

739
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:20,798
sort to uh enforce it and they also then

740
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:23,839
create their own standards practices and

741
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,398
varietals and so I'll kind of let off on

742
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:27,519
this because I could go deep down in the

743
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:29,959
hole like French he always used to do

744
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,000
but if you have other questions and uh

745
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,919
thanks also for you know mentioning the

746
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,159
the origins Council because we started

747
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:39,360
uh in

748
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:42,840
2015 that's eight years ago now folks we

749
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:45,240
started in 2015 talking about appalation

750
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:47,398
uh Janine and I and Justin calino for

751
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,200
the amendes appalation projects that

752
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:52,439
that then grew into Origins Council and

753
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,600
so many more people came on board and

754
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,440
now all the Legacy growing areas are

755
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,719
represented by Origins Council and uh

756
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,960
we're keep getting more people too so

757
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,120
Origins council is really the only

758
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,840
spokesperson uh Janine particularly

759
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:09,598
Adept at it for uh the small farmer of

760
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:12,119
the Legacy Growers of California so it

761
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,159
needs all our support that we can give

762
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:18,079
it yeah I'm really excited that the film

763
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:20,838
is Gen uh donating 20% of all of our

764
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,879
proceeds forever to the efforts of the

765
00:34:20,838 --> 00:34:25,199
origin Council because I think that you

766
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:27,039
know it's not only important for

767
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,638
California you guys are setting a

768
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:30,320
predent for for things that are going to

769
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,519
happen all over the world and I keep

770
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,480
thinking if you guys can create the

771
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:37,960
model and get legal recognition then

772
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,519
maybe we can help protect the Legacy

773
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,679
farmers in Afghanistan or Lebanon once

774
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:46,320
things legalize worldwide because I just

775
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,119
feel like those Traditions Northern

776
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,280
India those places where we had such you

777
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:54,720
know profound experiences When We Were

778
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,839
Young they need the protection as well

779
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:59,719
so this work that we're doing it's not

780
00:34:56,838 --> 00:35:02,838
just for us it's really to set a set a

781
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:05,799
standard around Legacy cannabis

782
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:09,199
worldwide outdoor sungrown cannabis and

783
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:12,119
this tradition of making hashish in

784
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:14,759
these really old cultures that I think

785
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:18,079
it's really important for Humanity um

786
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,520
because I agree 100% uh Kimberly because

787
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,720
that was always part of my reference too

788
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,679
because I haven't smoked as many places

789
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,679
as Frenchie probably but I missed

790
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:28,799
Northern Africa but I've smoked in

791
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:31,799
Israel I smoked in Afghanistan in

792
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,680
Amsterdam in Nepal uh even in China you

793
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,359
know so it's like uh Thailand so it's

794
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:40,759
really a worldwide thing and one of the

795
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:42,799
things that working with hashish is to

796
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,440
remember that this is a plant that's

797
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,119
been you know helping Humanity for you

798
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,119
know at least 10 20,000 years

799
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:58,318
right uh oh looks

800
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:01,960
like the mesino bandwidth has has struck

801
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:04,519
again uh while we wait for also as you

802
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:08,240
just said kly protect the small farmer

803
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:10,239
in in Morocco in Lebanon anywhere the

804
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:13,479
people are growing quality and have a

805
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:15,679
skill that is an ancient tradition uh

806
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,480
you know walking along The Terraces in

807
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:19,759
in Northern India in the mountains and

808
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,679
you turn around a corner and you see

809
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,200
this Terrace and all of a sudden there's

810
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,598
20 foot high cannabis plants there with

811
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:29,118
with birds roosting in the in the

812
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:31,480
branches and so on and and it's right

813
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,000
next to the compost pile and then they

814
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,119
come down and there's some lady she's

815
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,639
rubbing this this hash like this and and

816
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:39,640
and you get a little smoke from it and

817
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:41,239
so on it's just you know you go over to

818
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:43,318
visit somebody and they invite you in

819
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:45,399
for tea and biscuits and and then they

820
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:47,239
they light up a Chillum you know so and

821
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,440
you're smoking now a Chillum with with

822
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:51,799
the mayor of the village and and the the

823
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,079
the director of the school system right

824
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,599
and it's just part of their culture that

825
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,560
you know is a whole sort of way of life

826
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,119
and you know I still remember the first

827
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,639
little old farmer who taught me how to

828
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,318
use a Chillum way back in the mountains

829
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:07,118
of Nepal and so he said no no no that's

830
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:08,920
not right that's not right here here's

831
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,599
how you do it and you know just wanting

832
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,440
to share that sort of stuff and so it's

833
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,760
a tradition that we're part of and we

834
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,920
need to be proud of it and share

835
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,920
it I'd just like to add that India also

836
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,920
taught us how to recognize the small

837
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,079
farmers with their protest that happened

838
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,680
in India last year the the Indian

839
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:32,880
farmers protest really stood up for

840
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:35,519
small farmers and how they can out

841
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,720
produce corporate farming while

842
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,480
producing a higher quality in India

843
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:42,759
really does uphold Community farming and

844
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,559
Community gardening and that's another

845
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,200
nice aspect for us to learn which

846
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:50,400
Frenchie also kept that India connection

847
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:52,799
and um all that knowledge going I really

848
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,680
appreciate everything that was said and

849
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,280
also welcome Lena it's beautiful to see

850
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:59,919
you today um also I just wanted to add

851
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,680
one more thing Dylan you said you know

852
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,639
we hope that we can live up to to to

853
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:08,960
Frenchie's expectations and live up to

854
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:10,960
you know his moral compass and I believe

855
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,639
that that's what we're talking about

856
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,679
here we're talking about you know every

857
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:21,639
single one of those tricomes those

858
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:25,118
crystals to be farmed by a small farmer

859
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:27,960
in community in recognition of the soil

860
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,519
in that area and in that terroir

861
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,519
while sharing seeds with the local

862
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:36,280
community of what grows best there while

863
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,559
then sharing education on how to make

864
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:42,599
the best

865
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:46,358
resins you know and and that that is

866
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:49,838
living up to Frenchie's moral compass

867
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:52,759
and that is the importance of his legacy

868
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:55,480
and Kimberly this movie and everybody

869
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,720
here who is watching and everybody who

870
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:02,000
continues to keep friend

871
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:04,799
she's voice alive and and and it and it

872
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,880
isn't just about him it was about the

873
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,519
education that he was putting forward

874
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,960
which now becomes you know surrounded in

875
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:16,440
heart space and community and love and

876
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,280
medicine and people and it continues to

877
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,079
come back to the farmers and the people

878
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,000
and and I just think that that's the

879
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,160
Legacy that we have to live up to and

880
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,960
it's incredibly important for us to

881
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:33,598
continue to spark that bright light that

882
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,838
he carried

883
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,440
always I think it's that element you

884
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:39,880
know he used to always say we made too

885
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,039
much of him and that it wasn't about him

886
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,680
it was about the traditions and it was

887
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:48,519
about this evolution of passing on the

888
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:51,719
traditions and how important that was so

889
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:53,639
thank you for emphasizing that aspect of

890
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:57,919
community um

891
00:39:53,639 --> 00:40:01,759
because I'll just say one thing

892
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:05,159
just come on hi guy this chilum is for

893
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:10,200
Frenchie is a chilum of

894
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:10,199
dryft for remember your

895
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,680
soul blessings and

896
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,760
love uh listen when when you brought up

897
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,280
um the India just now I had a a

898
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,440
flashback I researching the sort of the

899
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,640
origins of the organic regenerative food

900
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,240
movement and I can't remember the guy's

901
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:36,118
name but some English scientist who went

902
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:38,000
out to India uh in the early 1900s and

903
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,680
he was going to teach all those Indian

904
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,679
people how to grow uh using industrial

905
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:44,879
chemicals salt-based petroleum chemicals

906
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,239
and they was going to increase their

907
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,720
yield and so on and uh so he was doing

908
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,879
that and then after about four years his

909
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:55,078
yield started to go down and his quality

910
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,960
wasn't very good and he noticed that the

911
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,440
farmers around who weren't doing what he

912
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,000
told them to do were actually doing

913
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,760
better that their crop was was more and

914
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,519
so he started to research hey what are

915
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,880
these people doing well they've only

916
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:09,838
been doing this for the last two 10,000

917
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,640
years or whatever and they've kind of

918
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,400
figured out how their environment

919
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:15,358
interacts with their products and they

920
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,920
have special cultivars and they were

921
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,679
using manure and they were using organic

922
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,400
methods that we now are referring to as

923
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:25,399
regenerative method so those primitive

924
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,519
local little Farmers eing out a tiny

925
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,880
little crop were doing way better than

926
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,559
this fancy scientist from England and he

927
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,838
had the smarts and the humility to turn

928
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:37,519
around and say I can learn from these

929
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:39,719
people and so he did and out of that

930
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,119
came the rodali and all these other

931
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:44,879
things that we call organic but it

932
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:47,079
originated with little local farmers uh

933
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,358
in India who've been doing this for uh

934
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:50,760
you know I don't know seven or eight

935
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:52,920
thousand years so we have a tradition

936
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,319
and and that moral standard that you

937
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,240
brought up is is a really great thing

938
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:59,800
about how to be honest with yourself

939
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:02,279
yourself and honest with your food and

940
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,599
honest with your medicine uh and how

941
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,280
that has to pervade our whole life and

942
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:09,280
be part of our basic ethic and and what

943
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,200
we share with people because this this

944
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,720
is this is truth we we're working with

945
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:16,799
here a lot of that is what we try to

946
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,799
embody with with the Dem pure

947
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,400
certification and it is beautiful

948
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,280
there's five six people here from that

949
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,920
and and we really do work our best at

950
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:32,079
projecting that and

951
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:35,800
uh you know recognizing that we are

952
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:38,599
creating local appalaches but we are

953
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:41,000
worldwide we have this capability to

954
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:42,838
talk to you all live we have these

955
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,599
capabilities to learn from each other no

956
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:48,960
matter what language boy Google instant

957
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:52,039
translate is is amazing and how quickly

958
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:56,240
that we can communicate with each other

959
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:58,960
but this thread of our connection to

960
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:01,318
Nature and con ction to community is

961
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,639
everything that Frenchie was about and

962
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:05,679
that continues to move forward also and

963
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:07,960
Peter Proctor wrote a really amazing

964
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:12,358
book from uh he's from New Zealand went

965
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:15,880
to India one man one cow one man one cow

966
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:20,318
and it's a biod dnamic you know uh way

967
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,318
of Clos Loop farming in India

968
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:27,690
[Laughter]

969
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:40,079
well I'd like to say a little something

970
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,559
about Frenchie our path's crossed more

971
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,680
than a few times for certain and uh one

972
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:47,200
of the things I loved about him as

973
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:49,000
everyone's already mentioned is uh you

974
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:50,960
know I thought I was passionate about

975
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,039
hashish I thought I'd met passionate

976
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,599
people about hashish I had traveled to

977
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:58,759
hashish countries and I had gone to the

978
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:01,519
Maha kumaa and kashish with the Babas on

979
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:04,000
the sides of the ganji I did all sorts

980
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:07,079
of amazing I I traveled to the Bobo

981
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Shanti um communities in Jamaica and

982
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:10,800
helped make cash with those guys with

983
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,199
the Lamb's bread and did all of these

984
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,240
sorts of things but uh and I'm also

985
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:19,838
French that's also my lineage is most

986
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:22,318
I'm about 50 to 60% France and so we

987
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:24,199
were able to speak French the the when

988
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:28,358
we would bump into one another but his

989
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:30,759
absolute passion was just radiating off

990
00:44:28,358 --> 00:44:35,078
the man in a way that uh you really kind

991
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:38,880
of had to be um numb or or dead inside

992
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:41,440
to not almost be overwhelmed by it um

993
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,400
and so you know obviously I love hashish

994
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,440
I love talking about hashish I love

995
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,280
connecting the dots um but fren she

996
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,838
really took it to another level and I

997
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,640
you know I didn't get to spend as much

998
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:54,279
time as I would have liked to with them

999
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:56,759
as we were on similar paths in in

1000
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,760
different places that seem to cross uh

1001
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,920
paths but the last time I I got to hang

1002
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,079
out with him was in a very private

1003
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,358
setting as Wade mentioned earlier frie

1004
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:08,599
often had a crowd around him and I I had

1005
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:10,838
showed up at HQ in Barcelona my friend

1006
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:13,318
David's Club a club of which I was one

1007
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:15,799
of the first members of uh eight or nine

1008
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:17,719
years ago when I when I first went into

1009
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,359
that club when it was brand new and he

1010
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:21,118
said you know what I'm busy right now if

1011
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:23,078
you just want to go upstairs for my

1012
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,280
little private area there I'll come and

1013
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:28,240
see you later and I went up there and uh

1014
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,519
it was just frie sitting up there by

1015
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,159
himself and I he didn't even tell me

1016
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:35,960
that Frenchie was up there so Frenchie

1017
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:38,000
and I got to sit in HQ uh and and smoke

1018
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:41,960
hash and play with hash and talk about

1019
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,480
hash and it was a a lovely way for us to

1020
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,318
spend our last uh our last time together

1021
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,039
so I'll definitely hold that dear and uh

1022
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:52,079
remember that for the rest of my life

1023
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:53,440
and just uh you know thank uh thank

1024
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,280
Frenchie for everything that he brought

1025
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,119
to the community you know there's all

1026
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,160
sorts of different people doing all sort

1027
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,240
to different things but he really made a

1028
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:03,358
mark That's not uh that's not going to

1029
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:06,439
be going away and you know Wade also

1030
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:09,598
mentioned the way he brought that heart

1031
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,960
of the culture you know as we you know

1032
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,800
as I as I experien legal cannabis in

1033
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,880
Canada as I experience you know Veil

1034
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,760
purchasing Whistler these corporate

1035
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,960
entities that try to come in and

1036
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,040
eliminate the culture that existed at

1037
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,639
the core and whenever they do it it

1038
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:28,519
ruins good things so to have someone

1039
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:31,598
like Frenchie take that core information

1040
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:33,960
out of Himel pesh and out of Milana and

1041
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,640
Parvati Valley and these very special

1042
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,440
zones that a lot of people have never

1043
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:41,199
been able to go to and visit and sort of

1044
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,240
bring that into the new world I'll be

1045
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:47,199
honest it's really what Legends of hash

1046
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:49,399
was always about trying to pay homage to

1047
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:50,639
to the elders to the to the culture you

1048
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,559
know I meet a lot of people in the

1049
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,400
Canabis industry I've been doing this

1050
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,880
since the 60s you know I'm one of the

1051
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,960
ogs but then I like to think of the ACT

1052
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,119
ual people who were doing it four five

1053
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:04,039
six seven 800 years ago a thousand years

1054
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,960
ago and we can't forget about them

1055
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:08,039
either because they're the true OG's and

1056
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,039
I think that uh you know Frenchie

1057
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:12,519
carried them with him wherever he went

1058
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:15,039
and he emanated that energy and I I see

1059
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:17,159
everyone on this panel you know will

1060
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:19,838
will now carry that with us for the rest

1061
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:24,039
of our hashish days so uh once again

1062
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:25,838
boom Shankar Shankar mahv to freni uh I

1063
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:28,838
think it might be time to smoke a bowl

1064
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:28,838
in his honor

1065
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:39,800
I noticed that um Lena jumped on and I

1066
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:41,960
just wanted to see if she wanted to say

1067
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,039

closely with Frenchie and under him and

1086
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,559
learn from him the first moment I met

1087
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,240
him I uh had just gotten into hash

1088
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:38,839
making and just wanted to better my hash

1089
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:43,799
making skills and

1090
00:48:38,838 --> 00:48:45,838
just the radiance he like emanated in

1091
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,039
the room the moment I met him I was just

1092
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,119
like sold he could have been talking

1093
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:52,279
about anything and whatever it was like

1094
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:54,880
I want to do exactly that and learn

1095
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:57,839
exactly that and be that person like it

1096
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,519
was just beautiful so he definitely

1097
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:03,279
helped me further my love for hash

1098
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:06,400
making and he really believed in me well

1099
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,319
before I believed in myself so um it's

1100
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,960
pretty cool and the moment I brought him

1101
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:14,039
my first hash after taking his class he

1102
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:17,798
was just mind blown and that really kind

1103
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:20,960
of just gave me

1104
00:49:17,798 --> 00:49:22,639
uh a lot of determination and like

1105
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,079
knowing that I was going on the right

1106
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:27,239
path and working with the right material

1107
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:29,480
so uh yeah

1108
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:32,279
really happy to have known

1109
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:35,159
him I can't get over how some of your

1110
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:38,040
recent posts if I didn't if they hadn't

1111
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:41,118
been posted under your name it would

1112
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:44,318
look like stuff Frenchie posted five six

1113
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,318
years ago um especially the ones where

1114
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:49,239
you're really showing the full dimension

1115
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:51,480
of brightness the way he did where he

1116
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:54,639
would line the washes up so that you

1117
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:57,440
could see the variation in color and

1118
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:59,879
then um when they pancake it's just such

1119
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:03,920
a joy to see that because you know kind

1120
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:06,039
of that was the ultimate goal was to uh

1121
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,480
harvest the triom in such a way that you

1122
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:10,480
were getting almost the pure resin and

1123
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,519
then when you leave it for a second it

1124
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,838
just falls under its weight it just

1125
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:17,119
feels like there's I don't know some

1126
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:19,358
kind of like we're talking about this

1127
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:22,160
tradition and this Evolution like those

1128
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:24,199
things connect back to humans to great

1129
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,199

1130
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:27,519

1162
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:55,679
out to the farmer and to the land

1163
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:58,440
Frenchie used to tell me I I think the

1164
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:01,919
most beautiful thing about you linaa is

1165
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:04,639
and and even bird you guys work with um

1166
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:07,400
you work very closely with a

1167
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:11,440
farmer um and you really represent the

1168
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:13,599
land and that area and uh and I think in

1169
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,679
my experience that's just been the most

1170
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:18,960
profound impact is

1171
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:20,719
environmental um Frenchie even used to

1172
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,400
say you know when he was traveling in

1173
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:25,000
producing countries um you know when he

1174
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,760
was traveling in the mountains people

1175
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,679
would wouldn't they wouldn't care care

1176
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,359
that he was the one who made the hash

1177
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:33,798
they asked him how far he went to go

1178
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:37,838
make that hash what altitude what valley

1179
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:41,000
did he go to to make that hash and um

1180
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:43,480
and it's the same thing where as as a as

1181
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,239
a craft hashishin you know we kind of

1182
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:51,280
use the ter or um you know the land as a

1183
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:54,000
compass to Source our material um like

1184
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:58,359
you know you represent the matol valley

1185
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,358
the Lost Coast bird represents

1186
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:04,798
Willets you know um and uh and I I have

1187
00:53:02,358 --> 00:53:09,239
the honor to represent a lot of I ALS

1188
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:12,838
matol and other other Farmers bryand all

1189
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:14,919
these other kchi um and it's it's it's

1190
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:17,318
always these genetics you know and it's

1191
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:20,000
these genetics and these these C these

1192
00:53:17,318 --> 00:53:22,079
these strains that that farmers you know

1193
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,039
the neighbors have had for a while you

1194
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,960
know they've been growing it for a while

1195
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:28,759
you know it's been traded amongst that

1196
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:30,880
same area so it's almost like that plant

1197
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,480
those plants really know that area and

1198
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,960
that land and it kind of it has the most

1199
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:39,400
profound impact when it comes to the the

1200
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:41,358
pro the turine profile um so again it

1201
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,000
always comes down to the bringing it

1202
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:47,279
back it always comes down to the land

1203
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,798
and and the farmer so um yeah just want

1204
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,359
to give a shout out to all the farmers

1205
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:54,599
who are on here right now thank you I

1206
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:58,000
appreciate all of you very

1207
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:59,838
much and in Frenchie words I mean unless

1208
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,039
you're doing it all yourself which is

1209
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:05,279
really hard to do we don't eat and we

1210
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,719
don't smoke without the farmer so we

1211
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,440
have to give them the utmost respect and

1212
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:12,798
love and take care of them because they

1213
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,200
take care of us and they take care of

1214
00:54:12,798 --> 00:54:17,239
the um land they're working on and the

1215
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:20,118
surrounding environments like a lot of

1216
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:23,598
work goes into this so thank them

1217
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:26,760
regularly and support

1218
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:29,519
them and the

1219
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:32,440
so hard to preserve

1220
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,280
too shout out to the fungi as well we

1221
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,280
couldn't do it without the fungi the

1222
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,559
symbiotic relationship that that that

1223
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,640
that missing component that allows the

1224
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:43,559
plant to express the

1225
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:45,239
terroir you know because that's really

1226
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:46,839
what cannabis is doing for us it's

1227
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:48,879
allowing us to experience these

1228
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:50,920
different areas and I love the fact that

1229
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,400
there are very specific hashes cultures

1230
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:55,960
in the world but I also love the fact

1231
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,280
that there are terar for us to explore

1232
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,599
and to to meet for the very first time

1233
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,720
there's going to be some zones that

1234
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:04,640
cannabis has produced in in the in the

1235
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:07,879
in the upcoming decades that will

1236
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:10,039
Express I'm I'm certain unlike anything

1237
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,960
we've ever experienced and right now

1238
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:14,039
there's no doubt about that California

1239
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,838
is definitely the center of the Cannabis

1240
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:19,000
universe and there's some other amazing

1241
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:20,558
terar out in the world but uh I

1242
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,440
sometimes think there that we're going

1243
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,640
to be discovering some new ones as well

1244
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,440
here with uh with this lovely plant that

1245
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:29,558
we uh that we all have such a a

1246
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:32,119
wonderful relationship with I wonder

1247
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:33,720
about the whole aspect of breeding you

1248
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:37,039
know when Frenchie was in the mountains

1249
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:39,279
he rented a field uh uh from a some

1250
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:41,960
Farmers up there for years and the

1251
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,000
farmers used to cultivate those fields

1252
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,280
by breaking it up and throwing seeds out

1253
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,239
you know year overy year and just

1254
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:50,440
letting the rain work its magic and

1255
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:52,719
after the first year Frenchie asked them

1256
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:55,119
to stop doing that and to let the plants

1257
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:57,759
just go back to their wild State and

1258
00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:00,920
respond to the environment that they

1259
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:04,119
were in and I had the most amazing

1260
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:06,838
contct uh conversation with Kevin JRE uh

1261
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:10,519
at one of the ganier council meetings

1262
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:13,920
where he talked about how if you allowed

1263
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:15,759
the natural cultivar to express itself

1264
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,000
there was the elements of the humans

1265
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,920
that lived in that region and what they

1266
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,119
needed and that their needs were going

1267
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,119
to be slightly different based on the

1268
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:25,880
environment that they were in and not

1269
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,000
meaning not only like the weather that

1270
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,358
was there

1271
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,960
but like if you're up north in Canada

1272
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:34,318
and it's cold maybe you don't want to be

1273
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,400
as energetic as somebody who's living in

1274
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:40,038
a Southern Hemisphere and they're on a

1275
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:43,280
beach or vice versa and so kind of to

1276
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:45,520
your point we have humans that right now

1277
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,599
are directing the breeding of certain

1278
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:52,000
cultivars what would happen if we threw

1279
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:55,798
the seeds out there and let nature kind

1280
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,079
of develop a cultivar based on that what

1281
00:56:55,798 --> 00:57:00,920
they understood the needs of the humans

1282
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:03,280
living there to be I wonder how that

1283
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:06,720
that might differ and there's also this

1284
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:10,359
element of of humans breeding four very

1285
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:12,558
high levels of THC everybody knows I

1286
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:15,920
don't smoke anymore the THC is too much

1287
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:18,760
for me it overwhelms me immediately and

1288
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,440
so I just wonder in its natural

1289
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,559
environment looking at some of the

1290
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,358
studies that were done for example in

1291
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:27,000
Israel at one point the government

1292
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:29,798
commission studies using material from

1293
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,199
Buss that they had gathered and this was

1294
00:57:29,798 --> 00:57:35,559
like around

1295
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:37,798
2014 and the THC leveled in the material

1296
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:40,280
that they were um getting from these

1297
00:57:37,798 --> 00:57:43,960
smuggling operations was so low like the

1298
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:44,720
charas was 3 to 7% the hashish was less

1299
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,318
than

1300
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:48,879
177% but I remember getting really

1301
00:57:47,318 --> 00:57:52,400
really high in India when we were

1302
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:55,358
smoking that stuff so is it really

1303
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,200
necessary or a benefit these high THC

1304
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:59,960
levels because I in California when we

1305
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:02,118
sell to dispensaries they're like less

1306
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:05,159
than 30% we won't even look at it we

1307
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:07,440
won't even talk to you and I'm just

1308
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:09,519
wondering if this is like is this the

1309
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,679
right path for humans

1310
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:15,480
to to approach how the the plants

1311
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:17,879
cultivated and what what makes it to the

1312
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:20,599
shelves in a commercial

1313
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:24,680
environment I I I think a lot of it has

1314
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:27,920
been driven by uh prohibition uh because

1315
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:30,798
prohibition drove a a lot of neoy

1316
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:34,119
smokers and when they smoked they got so

1317
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:36,159
high experienced Growers and as uh

1318
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:37,720
Frenchie and others have taught us and

1319
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:41,358
one of the things that we found when we

1320
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:45,038
were initially testing back in 08 and 09

1321
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:47,078
is we had a lot of my first 1500 tests

1322
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:49,480
before we even released the results we

1323
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:54,119
found that a lot of the chemical

1324
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:56,639
structure was identical almost 90% of

1325
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:58,160
the Cannabis was the same

1326
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,118
but we knew there was something

1327
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:02,519
different and of course we've come to

1328
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:05,079
realize it's the tpine profiles the chem

1329
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:08,038
of our profiles that are different in

1330
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:12,079
each that we couldn't register under THC

1331
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:14,039
level so back then we had an issue and a

1332
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,318
ethical issue and one that we're still

1333
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:20,200
struggling under and one that we found

1334
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:23,079
is that oh [ __ ] we're gonna have a

1335
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:25,519
causation in America because we have due

1336
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:27,760
to Prohibition and alcohol prohibition

1337
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:30,679
there's this [ __ ] up mentality that

1338
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:34,359
the higher the number the more [ __ ] up

1339
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:37,399
you get and that causality is something

1340
00:59:34,358 --> 00:59:39,639
we have struggled with and one we had an

1341
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:42,200
organization back in uh the ODS called

1342
00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:47,358
the medical cannabis Safety Council the

1343
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:49,279
mcsc I was part of the um um uh

1344
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:51,318
contaminants committee but one thing we

1345
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:55,000
struggled with on the nomenclature

1346
00:59:51,318 --> 00:59:57,000
committee was how do we address this

1347
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,639
issue because we were able to show that

1348
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,440
and unfortunately Steve D'Angelo pushed

1349
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:05,358
out testing quicker than we could come

1350
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,440
up with the understanding to convey to

1351
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:09,639
the consumer that there's something

1352
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:12,200
happening that the THC number does not

1353
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:15,159
matter and there's something that's else

1354
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:18,078
happening within these flowers these

1355
01:00:15,159 --> 01:00:20,318
unique flowers that are having a

1356
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:23,280
different effect on different people and

1357
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:26,519
what we saw was uh people like

1358
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:30,400
Harborside rejecting anything that have

1359
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:32,440
now a this now created fictitious THC

1360
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,798
level and then all of a sudden Berkeley

1361
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,838
Patients Group had a whole bunch of

1362
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:38,038
varietals that I've been wanting to have

1363
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:39,880
for years come my way that I was able to

1364
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:43,599
purchase that I would have never had

1365
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:46,480
before because now an imaginary line had

1366
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:49,079
been D driven into the sand that has

1367
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,639
unfortunately become the pervasive

1368
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:54,039
reality uh since legalization has

1369
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:58,038
happened because we've never been able

1370
01:00:54,039 --> 01:01:01,400
to get behind that Pandora's box once it

1371
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:02,960
was open it run away from us all and

1372
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:06,680
unfortunately we're still struggling

1373
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:09,199
with it and I feel a guilt mentally

1374
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:11,960
because we were never able to do so and

1375
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:13,960
I always have an anger at Steve because

1376
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,000
Steve knew this and we challenged him

1377
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,318
not to do this and he went at it because

1378
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,760
of dollars as opposed to the Integrity

1379
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:21,960
needed so that we could convey it

1380
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,920
properly s to explain that but I wanted

1381
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,960
to give a historical context from

1382
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:29,159
California because I think it's

1383
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,599
responsible that people understand where

1384
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:34,399
we [ __ ] up we had a chance to be good

1385
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,680
stewards here and we [ __ ] up and so

1386
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,079
y'all can do better than us learn from

1387
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:40,440
our

1388
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:42,920
mistakes yeah thank you for that I think

1389
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,920
that's really

1390
01:01:44,358 --> 01:01:51,159
important yeah it's hard to let ganja be

1391
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,679
wild and be intelligent in the soil and

1392
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:56,679
just interact with our spirits and then

1393
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:59,719
you know if we had a like a good

1394
01:01:56,679 --> 01:02:01,399
the numbers and so on and the high THC

1395
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:08,159
you know we had something that came in

1396
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:10,559
at like eight THC and and and six uh CBD

1397
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:12,719
and everybody loved it but we couldn't

1398
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,839
sell it because it just didn't have that

1399
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:17,038
high THC number so one of the things

1400
01:02:14,838 --> 01:02:20,078
that Frenchie and Madam canoli and Nikki

1401
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:22,359
and I and about five 15 other people we

1402
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:25,278
work to create the ganier council and

1403
01:02:22,358 --> 01:02:27,639
the ganier program and the purpose of

1404
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:29,679
that it's still in the process of being

1405
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:31,960
you know developed further and so on but

1406
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:34,000
to get to a place where we could come

1407
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:37,440
out with a score at the end of an

1408
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,400
evaluation based on a 100 points that

1409
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:43,358
would not be uh determined by

1410
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:45,639
THC and that everybody's buying by one

1411
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:47,719
number the TAC number and we said well

1412
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:49,519
we want to look at the appearance we

1413
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:51,959
want to look at the flavor we want to

1414
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:53,960
look at the the aroma and we look at all

1415
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:56,318
these things and we come out with a 100

1416
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:58,720
point scale so Frenchie was very much

1417
01:02:56,318 --> 01:03:01,719
key and Madame canoli as well in

1418
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:04,639
developing that program and so that's

1419
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:07,519
the idea the point about this I think at

1420
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:10,440
is to educate the customer educate the

1421
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:12,679
consumer and that's on us that's what we

1422
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,519
have to do and we have to do it every

1423
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:19,038
day all day and we have to go through

1424
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:21,318
the nose as we all well know the secret

1425
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:24,799
to cannabis is always through the aroma

1426
01:03:21,318 --> 01:03:27,000
and the nose because in my research now

1427
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:28,838
I'm GNA say this there's a great book

1428
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,039
which I really highly recommend for all

1429
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:34,318
of you it's called nose dive and it's

1430
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:37,359
this amazing book and it talks about

1431
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:40,798
everything that produces Aroma nose dive

1432
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:44,038
it's like 500 pages on the Aromas and

1433
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:45,960
there's only like 40 pages on tpin but

1434
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:48,640
there's flavonoids and Esters and

1435
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:50,639
phenols and volatile sulfur compounds

1436
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:53,558
and and all these other things which are

1437
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:57,159
creating the Aromas in cannabis it's not

1438
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:59,920
only tpin so now all of a sudden we said

1439
01:03:57,159 --> 01:04:02,358
we need one thing to determine cannabis

1440
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,480
is it sativa oh no that doesn't work is

1441
01:04:02,358 --> 01:04:07,278
it THC oh no that doesn't work is it

1442
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:09,679
dominant tpine oh no that doesn't work

1443
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:12,559
because cannabis we always come back to

1444
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:14,960
the full plant it's always about the

1445
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:17,798
full plant and that's our that's our

1446
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,960
moral compass in some ways right there

1447
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:22,838
without the whole plant that isn't doing

1448
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:24,960
what it's really capable of doing and

1449
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:26,558
when Madame canoli says let's let the

1450
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,400
plant grow to to the place where it

1451
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:32,079
grows wild then we're now back into this

1452
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,480
total conversation with nature with our

1453
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,839
bodies with our awareness and the plant

1454
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:40,278
is talking to us like it always has been

1455
01:04:36,838 --> 01:04:42,078
talking to us but the idea that THC is

1456
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:45,199
going to tell you what's going to happen

1457
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:48,079
is a completely erroneous assumption

1458
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:50,239
it's really all about what the flavor is

1459
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:53,278
and I'll throw in one more thing about

1460
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:55,078
aged cannabis vintage cannabis people

1461
01:04:53,278 --> 01:04:56,278
don't even want anything more than three

1462
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:58,480
months old

1463
01:04:56,278 --> 01:05:00,400
I say we never got anything until it was

1464
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,920
eight months old in the past whether it

1465
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,160
came from Mexico or Thailand vintage

1466
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:07,880
cannabis is really where it's at and

1467
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:11,038
I'll shut up now and let everybody else

1468
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:13,559
talk I thank you for saying that both

1469
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:16,880
Swami and um

1470
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:20,119
etn like that is definitely kind of the

1471
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:22,720
new challenge or the the challenge right

1472
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:25,920
now for me is

1473
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:28,439
explaining to everybody that it's not

1474
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,358
just about these high THC percentages

1475
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:35,519
and it's about the the broad spectrums

1476
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:37,199
of beautiful cannaboids and tpin because

1477
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:39,719
when you have more of that you know I

1478
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:42,838
prefer something with a with a you know

1479
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:45,598
higher tpine and lower THC you know even

1480
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:46,960
different cannaboids and it like you get

1481
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,680
this like when you smoke something

1482
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,920
almost wild like I remember when I was

1483
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:53,719
smoking Thai you know stuff from

1484
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:57,920
Thailand I I I felt like this overall

1485
01:05:53,719 --> 01:06:00,239
well-being this like like like elated

1486
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:03,440
like I don't get that you know when I

1487
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:07,239
when I came here I I was just high like

1488
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:10,000
I was just super high like Beyond High

1489
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:12,479
um and I think that due to selective

1490
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,519
breeding we've we we we you know bred

1491
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,679
towards those high THC percentages so we

1492
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:19,880
really shot ourselves in the foot in a

1493
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:21,358
sense and we have a lot of work to do to

1494
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,680
make up for it and that's kind of my

1495
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:27,159
challenge as what Frenchie kind of like

1496
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:30,639
passed down to me is this next this next

1497
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:35,239
challenge of educating the generations

1498
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:38,400
under me because that is my job now and

1499
01:06:35,239 --> 01:06:40,318
uh that is my generation's job is to

1500
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,680
make sure that we're leaving behind

1501
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:44,318
we're first getting a consensus on the

1502
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:46,838
language that we are using the

1503
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:50,278
vocabulary that we are using and then

1504
01:06:46,838 --> 01:06:51,798
second to to Really to really educate

1505
01:06:50,278 --> 01:06:55,639
like you guys are saying educate

1506
01:06:51,798 --> 01:06:58,519
everybody on the beautiful the the the

1507
01:06:55,639 --> 01:07:00,480
totality of the beauty of this plant and

1508
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:03,358
all the cannaboids and all the turbines

1509
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:06,838
but so I was talking to Derek from the

1510
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:08,558
ganier program we had a lovely dinner um

1511
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:11,759
just a couple weeks back on Valentine

1512
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:14,079
near Valentine's Day and I was asking

1513
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,200
him you know Frenchie in order to get

1514
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,760
people to really understand and and to

1515
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:19,960
get people to love it one thing he

1516
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,640
taught me was you have to get people to

1517
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:25,760
smoke it and he was like baby that's

1518
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:29,239
what we do we smoke people out we smoke

1519
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:31,720
them out all day and that is what we did

1520
01:07:29,239 --> 01:07:34,038
we smoked people out and you can just

1521
01:07:31,719 --> 01:07:38,000
see their eyes light up you could just

1522
01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:41,720
see the oh my God you know just the like

1523
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,760
yes it's good right and and boom you

1524
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:46,399
know they were just experienced

1525
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:49,278
something they never experienced before

1526
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:52,039
time and time and time again and that is

1527
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:54,599
one of the most profound ways that I

1528
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:56,480
found that that really Ed that can

1529
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:58,200
really share it even even to people who

1530
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,719
don't smoke they can they can look at it

1531
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:03,000
and appreciate it but my challenge is is

1532
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:06,719
they took that away from

1533
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:09,719
us they took that opportunity away from

1534
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:12,199
me so I was asking Derek Derek what is

1535
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:13,838
it g to take like how do we bring that

1536
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:16,158
back like what happened because we were

1537
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:18,880
chilling we you know everyone had their

1538
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:20,599
rigs out I know Co I get that I I

1539
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,880
totally totally get that I really really

1540
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:25,000
do but I mean what happened all of a

1541
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,798
sudden all of a sudden it's legal now

1542
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,600
now every body can't be smoking all

1543
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:30,719
around like what what changed you know

1544
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,798
be taxes money you know it all comes

1545
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:35,480
down to that every single time but

1546
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:37,158
Derek's point was he said something

1547
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:39,238
profound that really stuck with me and

1548
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:42,198
he said that it comes down

1549
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:45,318
to um it comes down

1550
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:48,278
to to change you know to the low to the

1551
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:51,319
small groups and getting a consensus

1552
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:53,359
amongst a lot of small groups then those

1553
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:55,000
small groups become big groups you get

1554
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:58,039
the attention of your small local

1555
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,960
government you Chang things in your town

1556
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:03,560
you Chang things in your little city and

1557
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:06,439
then you change things in your county

1558
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:09,039
and the more counties that jump on board

1559
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:10,838
then you change things in your state and

1560
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:12,719
then your state changes and then other

1561
01:09:10,838 --> 01:09:15,198
states start to change it's a lot of

1562
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:18,079
work we have so much work ahead of us it

1563
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:21,639
was a little overwhelming to be quite

1564
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:24,079
honest but I that's where I'm at is is

1565
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:26,199
coming back to sharing this together

1566
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:28,158
smoking this together there's something

1567
01:09:26,198 --> 01:09:30,079
about being in a circle there's a reason

1568
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:31,759
why a hook is passed in a circle you

1569
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:33,399
know there's a reason why Chillum is

1570
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,359
passed in a circle a circle is a

1571
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:38,399
continuous flow of energy it's a

1572
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:41,679
continuous flow of of communication you

1573
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:43,679
know and and it brings us back together

1574
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,399
and and and together looking at each

1575
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,520
other being in that present moment

1576
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:50,318
together rather than our phones you know

1577
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,880
away you know smoking together is you

1578
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:55,679
know it's it's it's probably some of my

1579
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,239
closest friends in the whole world um um

1580
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:58,920
and I I want to bring that back and

1581
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:00,959
that's kind of my challenge right now is

1582
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,840
bringing that back and and educating

1583
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:06,439
people and and and really sharing the

1584
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,440
beauty of it's not just about these high

1585
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:13,719
THC percentages it's not about it being

1586
01:10:08,439 --> 01:10:17,039
clear it's not about any of that um but

1587
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:18,679
yeah so um yeah I welcome I welcome

1588
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:20,479
ideas you know how how are we G to bring

1589
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:22,760
the smoking back

1590
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:25,919
guys

1591
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:27,480
please Belle that's I mean you're that's

1592
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,920
everything you're saying is so amazing

1593
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:33,919
and it's so true I mean what what you

1594
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:35,480
know as a farmer um and and first of all

1595
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,840
i' just like to you know acknowledge

1596
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:40,079
that that that you and Frenchie and Lena

1597
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,760
and and we hear so much about you know

1598
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:44,079
it all comes from the farmer and I just

1599
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:46,039
want to to take that back and say that

1600
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:47,640
it really all does come from the land

1601
01:10:46,039 --> 01:10:50,640
and that's what I see it's like it's

1602
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:52,520
it's the soil it's the fungus it's the

1603
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,400
the the microbes it's everything it's

1604
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:59,440
the the place the environment um

1605
01:10:55,399 --> 01:11:01,679
honestly I I get I I'm really I I i'

1606
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:03,960
like to have humility about that because

1607
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:06,440
it's like as Farmers if we're doing what

1608
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:08,800
we should be doing we're just really

1609
01:11:06,439 --> 01:11:11,839
providing the space for the plant to

1610
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:14,039
interact with the place and the soil so

1611
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,640
um but to what you're

1612
01:11:14,039 --> 01:11:18,399
saying this is what legalization has

1613
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,800
done is completely

1614
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:24,119
disassociated the consumers with with

1615
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:26,159
that and with that connection and and

1616
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:28,719
it's just really bad policy and there's

1617
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:30,319
so much work to do and and we and and

1618
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:32,800
this is something that origin's council

1619
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:35,960
is really taking a lead on and working

1620
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:39,400
to you know there's you know we we are

1621
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:41,679
not able to smoke people out like we're

1622
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:44,839
not able to bring we're literally

1623
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:48,359
prohibited from bringing people to our

1624
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:51,159
farms and smoking them out like that is

1625
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:54,719
against the law which is just absolutely

1626
01:11:51,158 --> 01:11:57,559
absurd and um that is the big work that

1627
01:11:54,719 --> 01:12:01,840
we need to to do is is change the way

1628
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:05,080
that this legalization is so that we can

1629
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,719
have smoking circles and have events

1630
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:09,279
that you know there's talk about Farmers

1631
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,960
Market events but so far what we have in

1632
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:13,519
California there is no such thing as a

1633
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,560
real Farmers Market it's like it's it's

1634
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,920
a it's a fake Farmers Market because a

1635
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,440
farmers market is where you as the

1636
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:21,000
farmer have your product on the table

1637
01:12:18,439 --> 01:12:23,399
and you can share it and just like at a

1638
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,960
at a actual vegetable Farmers Market you

1639
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:27,238
can cut up an apple and give somebody a

1640
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,439
slice and then they're right there

1641
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:31,039
talking to you and it's coming from your

1642
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:32,799
hand and you can tell them about where

1643
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:37,079
you grew it and what was special about

1644
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:40,039
that place and um and that is lacking

1645
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:42,960
right now and it's not it's not lacking

1646
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:44,880
because um I don't believe that it's

1647
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:47,239
lacking because somebody forgot to put

1648
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,880
that in regulation this is like the way

1649
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:52,919
of the corporate world is to

1650
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:56,199
intentionally remove the consumer from

1651
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:59,520
that connection and uh

1652
01:12:56,198 --> 01:13:01,879
it's it's it's daunting and overwhelming

1653
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:06,400
but we have to keep the faith and

1654
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:07,679
educate and um and you know dragonfly

1655
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:10,638
with the work you're doing around the

1656
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:13,480
world that's part of the education

1657
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:16,719
um it's there's so much more work to do

1658
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:19,479
and so I'm all ideas too but you know it

1659
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:22,880
it's a bummer that as Farmers I find

1660
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:25,158
that we have to become so engaged in

1661
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:27,679
policy and this stuff that really is not

1662
01:13:25,158 --> 01:13:31,000
where we want to be doing but if we

1663
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:33,520
don't nobody else is doing it and it's

1664
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,920
just going to you know this problem will

1665
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,159
continue to compound and and I see in

1666
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,119
the chat you know we've got

1667
01:13:37,158 --> 01:13:41,920
conversations happening internationally

1668
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:43,639
and and with legalization and it's all

1669
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:46,760
it's there's a part of me that's so

1670
01:13:43,639 --> 01:13:48,639
scared of US Federal legalization

1671
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:51,000
because it's like they're just going to

1672
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:54,719
keep [ __ ] it up worse

1673
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:57,039
and um we have to we have to stay super

1674
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:58,800
engaged aged and and that is hard work

1675
01:13:57,039 --> 01:14:00,800
for a bunch of farmers and hash makers

1676
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:03,719
but we're the only ones really preaching

1677
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:06,159
this and so you know keep it up

1678
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:08,600
everybody it feels to me sometime like

1679
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:10,879
this is like greater than just us as a

1680
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:13,800
community this is something that's so

1681
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:15,920
deep because our shared connection to

1682
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:19,199
the plant goes back to the point before

1683
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:23,359
we were even a thought in Consciousness

1684
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:25,479
you know that ha having humans develop

1685
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:28,079
with an endocannabinoid system with a

1686
01:14:25,479 --> 01:14:30,638
plant that existed 26 million years

1687
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:34,319
before we did you know there's something

1688
01:14:30,639 --> 01:14:39,279
that just it would be wrong to not fight

1689
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:41,599
for this and for this understanding that

1690
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:43,359
it you know that the plant is

1691
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:46,320
encouraging community and human

1692
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:48,599
connection and I don't know

1693
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:50,279
conversation because without that you

1694
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,400
know the way forward this kind of

1695
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:55,319
militaristic model that we find

1696
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:58,399
ourselves in is not viable and we see

1697
01:14:55,319 --> 01:15:01,158
that it's not taking us to a place of

1698
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:02,559
overall overall well- beingness like B

1699
01:15:01,158 --> 01:15:05,279
mentioned before that was one of

1700
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:07,639
Frenchie's favorite words of describing

1701
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:11,119
his experience of Canabis if it wasn't

1702
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:13,679
making you feel overall in a really good

1703
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:17,399
place then then something was not right

1704
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:20,039
with it um I think also the hookah that

1705
01:15:17,399 --> 01:15:22,198
multi-host hookah we were in Denver once

1706
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:23,560
at an event and I was standing next to a

1707
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:25,439
guy it was the first time he had ever

1708
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:28,760
smoked the hookah and he turned to me

1709
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:30,839
and he said this is like sharing a lum

1710
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:34,119
with four people you know that he was

1711
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:36,600
smoking with at the same time that it

1712
01:15:34,119 --> 01:15:39,399
was just such a profound experience for

1713
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:42,120
him and maybe that's more of what we

1714
01:15:39,399 --> 01:15:44,039
need is those opportunities to get

1715
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:46,479
together and pass the smoke and have

1716
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:50,479
conversations like we're doing now

1717
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:53,319
because that grounds Us in community and

1718
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:55,319
uh it I just think it's an important

1719
01:15:53,319 --> 01:15:57,319
pass forward that's part of why I

1720
01:15:55,319 --> 01:16:00,880
advocate for you all so

1721
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:04,359
much thank you so much uh you know we we

1722
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:07,520
we all of us are the Entourage effect in

1723
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:11,000
human form that are here to heal

1724
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:13,880
Humanity so it's interesting how that

1725
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:17,238
biodiverse effect just continues to show

1726
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:20,039
itself in our soils in humanity in the

1727
01:16:17,238 --> 01:16:21,919
medicine and honestly you know that's

1728
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:24,679
part of our big mission out here that

1729
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,960
we're we're using Frenchie and this this

1730
01:16:24,679 --> 01:16:28,000
this Spirit to EMB body change we have

1731
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,399
Alice

1732
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,760
here from Brazil go ahead and say

1733
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:35,359
something I love you all so

1734
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:38,280
much much love to all of you and to

1735
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:40,479
Frenchie which was the key to bring

1736
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:42,880
education to all of us I think if

1737
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:45,238
there's something that sums up his work

1738
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,800
is the way he educated people and the

1739
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:50,319
way he multiplied education and the way

1740
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:52,440
he never held information behind and he

1741
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:55,880
just wanted to share so we could

1742
01:16:52,439 --> 01:16:58,479
multiply and we could all smoke more

1743
01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:00,600
know more and actually be a real part of

1744
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:02,079
the hash history it's not only about the

1745
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:04,360
past right it's what we're doing right

1746
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:06,479
now so there is time to change and if we

1747
01:17:04,359 --> 01:17:08,839
all stay together and keep together like

1748
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:10,718
fren always said for us to be and

1749
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:13,480

1750
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:15,760

thank

1754
01:17:20,279 --> 01:17:25,279
you and another thing I just wanted to

1755
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:27,319
say is that we're all talking about you

1756
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:30,960
know continuing to push forward

1757
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:34,519
legalization in a way that um helps the

1758
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:36,639
farmer helps the community and one way

1759
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:39,480
that really helps cannabis is to

1760
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:42,000
continue to push forward hom

1761
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:44,718
Growers that all of the education that

1762
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:48,198
we're doing is that cannabis is in every

1763
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:50,639
single backyard that apartment complexes

1764
01:17:48,198 --> 01:17:52,799
have small little cannabis Gardens that

1765
01:17:50,639 --> 01:17:55,400
have some tomatoes and some zucchini

1766
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,279
that's growing there we're seeing that

1767
01:17:55,399 --> 01:18:00,879
here there's Community Gardens that

1768
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:03,279
people are utilizing and if we continue

1769
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:05,520
to bring that education forward through

1770
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:07,359
Federal legalization we know that it's

1771
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,639
going to get [ __ ] up for the farmers

1772
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:12,279
for the for even the consumers but we're

1773
01:18:09,639 --> 01:18:15,639
going to be able to have the capability

1774
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:18,479
to consume our own flour to consume our

1775
01:18:15,639 --> 01:18:20,400
own concentrates and when we are doing

1776
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:22,678
that and we are pushing the education

1777
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:25,519
forward then people are truly being

1778
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:28,440
healed by getting down in soil they're

1779
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:30,480
breathing the soil microbes that right

1780
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:32,879
there is going to help them create

1781
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:34,399
better decisions for the plant and then

1782
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,760
and then the plant that they're going to

1783
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:39,479
grow is going to be in communication

1784
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:41,679
with that person the entire time and

1785
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:44,359
there's DNA that's swapped there's

1786
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:47,199
energy there's frequency that's swapped

1787
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:49,359
and we really believe that the best

1788
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:52,719
medicine in the world is the one that

1789
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:54,839
you grow yourself and also you know

1790
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:57,560
making your own nutrients and making

1791
01:18:54,840 --> 01:19:00,079
your own soil and really using your

1792
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:03,120
environment is the ultimate way to

1793
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:05,399
create terroir and Appalachia so and

1794
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:08,039
Frenchie really agreed with that that

1795
01:19:05,399 --> 01:19:10,238
just having a pot and soil that's bought

1796
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:12,679
at the store and using botal nutrients

1797
01:19:10,238 --> 01:19:15,319
it will never give you any type of

1798
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:18,079
unique flavor or Terra water or or

1799
01:19:15,319 --> 01:19:20,599
anything for your area so really a big

1800
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:22,679
part of the mission that we are all on

1801
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:24,760
is teaching people how to make their own

1802
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:27,719
nutrients teaching people how to make

1803
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:30,520
their own soil you know teaching Homer

1804
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:33,719
home Growers how to make their own sift

1805
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:37,560
you know this is the way we engage with

1806
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:39,679
our power and how we use cannabis as um

1807
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:42,560
the opportunity that it is cannabis

1808
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:45,239
could be treated industrial and more

1809
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:47,760
like a prisoner or it could be treated

1810
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:50,238
more freely like a gift to us we could

1811
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,880
make clothes and oil and food and

1812
01:19:50,238 --> 01:19:57,559
medicine so I just want to encourage us

1813
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:59,560
to continue that nature aspect of of

1814
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:02,880
creating the Cannabis and as

1815
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:06,280
legalization it can be done indoors in a

1816
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:09,600
way where there's regenerative style

1817
01:20:06,279 --> 01:20:12,800
techniques used and uh you know that's

1818
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,840
uh important it's a best Outdoors but if

1819
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:18,320
you're doing it indoors you can still do

1820
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:22,719
it by using local environmental uh

1821
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:22,719
inputs for your for your farm

1822
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:33,359
I'd like to jump in for a minute uh I

1823
01:20:32,198 --> 01:20:36,238
haven't been saying much I've been

1824
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:37,799
listening a lot and I really appreciate

1825
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:40,959
the

1826
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,800
uh uh the beauty of this conversation

1827
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,279
and one of the reasons that I feel

1828
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:49,079
compelled to speak is that

1829
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:51,559
uh we we meet because of Frenchie in his

1830
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:54,960
work and and Madame canoli the way you

1831
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:59,280
have uh gotten this film uh to the

1832
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:04,039
attention of so many folk is great um uh

1833
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:06,599
but I it struck me to say that

1834
01:21:04,039 --> 01:21:10,039
um we

1835
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:14,079
have the dragonfly Earth medicine family

1836
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:16,880
representing ideal uh if in my opinion

1837
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:18,920
uh practices towards creating the best

1838
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,840
versions of the cannabis plant in terms

1839
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:23,600
of the health and vitality of the plant

1840
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:25,719
itself and as a medicine maker and other

1841
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,600
medicine makers know you get the best

1842
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:31,119
medicine whatever medicine means to you

1843
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:33,440
from the cannabis plant from the best

1844
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:37,238
Farms the best cultivation practices

1845
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:39,000
produce the best medicine and uh you can

1846
01:21:37,238 --> 01:21:41,399
make medicine from mediocre product but

1847
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,079
it's not going to be what it could have

1848
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:49,279
been and stewardship to the Earth

1849
01:21:45,079 --> 01:21:52,279
there's a um a respect for the earth and

1850
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:54,960
the importance of the fungal kingdoms

1851
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:57,759
and the diversity that comes in a

1852
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,600
regenerative Garden uh and so deep

1853
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:02,920
respect for that if you will for the

1854
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:05,360
roots of this conversation and meantime

1855
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:08,119
it is Hash church so we are all about

1856
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:09,519
concentrating the results of that work

1857
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:12,279
and

1858
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:15,159

1865
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:41,760
with awareness of CBD oil and the needs

1866
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:46,520
of patients long enough that Harry the

1867
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:49,159
owner and friend uh at one time uh

1868
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:51,480
created and owned the domain name

1869
01:22:49,158 --> 01:22:54,599
cbdoil.com

1870
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:57,559
which was a while ago and he sold it

1871
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:59,440
years ago uh but uh yeah that's how long

1872
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:02,719
he's been doing it as long as I have

1873
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:05,599
probably um and he's he's a longtime

1874

resident up here uh and meantime my

1875
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,199
friend Sweet Leaf Joe's dropped by but I

1876
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:13,880
want to go I want to finish through the

1877
01:23:10,198 --> 01:23:16,599
cycle here of of my thoughts on this

1878
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:17,480
conversation today because not only do

1879
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:20,480
we

1880
01:23:17,479 --> 01:23:24,079
have beautiful cultivators respect to

1881
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:26,519
the planet best product made for the

1882
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:29,359
Manu facturers to turn that into a

1883
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:31,760
product that's suitable for use and

1884
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:33,479
people like Dr Mark keeping track of

1885
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:36,760
what's going on with the manufacturing

1886
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:39,439
processes ensuring best results again

1887
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:42,560
for the end user and it's on us at some

1888
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:46,000
point to educate the public about why

1889
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:48,760
THC numbers are such a terrible way of

1890
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:52,439
finding best product for your own

1891
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:55,039
needs um and and the last part of my mad

1892
01:23:52,439 --> 01:23:58,198
ramble I'm almost done I promise

1893
01:23:55,039 --> 01:24:00,439
is there's also this component uh

1894
01:23:58,198 --> 01:24:02,719
represented on the professional level by

1895
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:08,079
eten and his work at Berkeley patience

1896
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:10,800
group uh uh I thought uh I saw that uh

1897
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:14,319
Alex Dixon might join the our group

1898
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:17,000
today but uh I run into him he's on the

1899
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:20,960
board with Valerie Corral uh down in

1900
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:24,639
Santa Cruz uh uh and again Sweet Lea Joe

1901
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:27,560
and myself uh have for years been about

1902
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:30,520
making sure those who really need

1903
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:33,239
cannabis if you will the very end of the

1904
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:35,760
supply chain being discussed here

1905
01:24:33,238 --> 01:24:39,158
today and the beauty of

1906
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:41,600
this we have the bases covered if you

1907
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:44,559
will and I think the one whole in it is

1908
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,679
we really do have to help the

1909
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,960
consumer uh particularly folks who are

1910
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:51,079
new to cannabis to understand that

1911
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,560
cannabis has so many different

1912
01:24:51,079 --> 01:24:54,600
properties so many different

1913
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,360
possibilities and a lot of it has based

1914
01:24:54,600 --> 01:25:01,000
on what does your body

1915
01:24:56,359 --> 01:25:03,359
need anyway um deep gratitude for the

1916
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:07,840
Gathering today and deep gratitude

1917
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:10,559
Frenchie for calling upon us to respect

1918
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:15,520
the the generations going back you know

1919
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:18,880
has been said thousands of years um and

1920
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:22,119
uh not all of the changes that uh have

1921
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:26,118
happened have been to the best of the

1922
01:25:22,118 --> 01:25:29,279
cannabis plant itself I I at one point I

1923
01:25:26,118 --> 01:25:30,759
thought that our focus on THC had

1924
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:34,479
created an

1925
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:37,440
imbalanced overloaded branch of the

1926
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:40,079
possibilities that the cannabis plant

1927
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:42,279
represents and I'm sure if skunkman Sam

1928
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:45,559
had been been able to join us today he

1929
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:48,319
would call me out [ __ ] on that and

1930
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:51,520
uh I will stop there and I would like to

1931
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:54,000
give Joe a chance to say hello and I do

1932
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:57,320
have to observe that it has snowed a

1933
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:00,359
couple up times down here in town and I

1934
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:02,840
live 800 ft in elevation higher than

1935
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:06,839
where I'm sitting at the moment so in

1936
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:08,319
respect to my well-being and my wife's

1937
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:12,719
very

1938
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:16,759
strong respectful love filled

1939
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:20,639
request I might have to step out

1940
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:22,639
early Joe hi everyone I'm sweet leaf Joe

1941
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:25,118
the founder and director of The Sweet

1942
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:27,719
Leaf Collective um

1943
01:26:25,118 --> 01:26:31,198
we help lowincome terminally ill

1944
01:26:27,719 --> 01:26:35,000
patients veterans people of color the

1945
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:39,000
lgbtq community seniors we basically all

1946
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:42,198
underserved demographics we help access

1947
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:45,520
free medical cannabis and we've been

1948
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:50,118
doing this since 1996 we're California's

1949
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:52,800
oldest cannabis brand and um yeah just

1950
01:26:50,118 --> 01:26:55,639
wanted to to come and check this out

1951
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:58,279
Wade invited me today and I like also

1952
01:26:55,639 --> 01:26:59,920
what Wade was talking about too you know

1953
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:02,039
it is important to protect small

1954
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:03,960
business and the cultivators and all of

1955
01:27:02,039 --> 01:27:06,399
the strains but the other part of the

1956
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:10,118
picture is protecting access to those

1957
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:13,319
who can't afford it because as we saw in

1958
01:27:10,118 --> 01:27:16,319
2019 when compassion programs Health

1959
01:27:13,319 --> 01:27:17,238
Equity and cannabis nonprofit shut down

1960
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:19,719
in

1961
01:27:17,238 --> 01:27:22,959
California due to

1962
01:27:19,719 --> 01:27:26,239
taxation people died so there's a human

1963
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:28,600
cost when people do not have access to

1964
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:31,919
free medical cannabis and they cannot

1965
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:35,520
afford it so that's my little

1966
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:38,760
feel and I'll just lean in and say I uh

1967
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:43,159
I first ran into Joe's work back in the

1968
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:45,199
90s um I was very very just beginning my

1969
01:27:43,158 --> 01:27:48,399
professional work with cannabis myself

1970
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:51,759
but I was doing volunteer work for a

1971
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:55,759
group called The Shanti project who was

1972
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,760
um all about helping

1973
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:01,920
people dying of

1974
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:03,360
AIDS that's how I first met Joe and you

1975
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:05,800
can probably tell I had a number of

1976
01:28:03,359 --> 01:28:11,198
friends who were doing the same who were

1977
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:15,400
dying from AIDS and uh my thing was uh

1978
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:15,399
providing emotional support and uh

1979
01:28:18,198 --> 01:28:22,638
caregiving I want real deal people it's

1980
01:28:21,319 --> 01:28:25,158
important

1981
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,639
work thank you for being also the

1982
01:28:25,158 --> 01:28:29,079
leaders I mean you're three years older

1983
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:30,560
than BPG and we're 23 years old and

1984
01:28:29,079 --> 01:28:32,399
people like oh that's crazy for a

1985
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,960
dispensary and it's like well we learned

1986
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:36,679
from the collectives and you one of the

1987
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:39,480
original collectives so I want to give a

1988
01:28:36,679 --> 01:28:42,719
shout out to not only one of the the

1989
01:28:39,479 --> 01:28:46,039
oldest but one of the most enduring and

1990
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:48,960
uh we continue to support and uh will

1991
01:28:46,039 --> 01:28:51,760
always continue to support those because

1992
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:54,279
uh I'm a patient myself as a veteran and

1993
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,600
uh that saved my life and unfortunately

1994
01:28:54,279 --> 01:28:58,000
a lot of these dispensary owners

1995
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:01,920
nowadays aren't patients and don't

1996
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:04,840
understand the reality or the

1997
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:07,279
um the responsibility that we carry to

1998
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:10,159
do things right and responsible which is

1999
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:12,238
why we worked with people who were doing

2000
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:16,238
it right who were doing it with

2001
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:20,238
Integrity like Frenchie like Joe like

2002
01:29:16,238 --> 01:29:22,959
Wade and others who are there to not

2003
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:26,479
only do it right but to take the time to

2004
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:30,520
educate you on on why it should be done

2005
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:34,079
right and not only do we explain it by

2006
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:36,560
living at as an example day in and day

2007
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:38,840
out waking up tomorrow and getting up

2008
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:40,639
and doing it again planning today for

2009
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:43,079
tomorrow so that that hash or that

2010
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:45,359
cannabis is ready so that that patient

2011
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:47,079
because that patient is coming tomorrow

2012
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:49,880
for that cannabis expecting that

2013
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:52,079
cannabis for them and Joe's right people

2014
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:54,440
died unfortunately and we had to fight

2015
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:55,920
within our own State uh to to have

2016
01:29:54,439 --> 01:29:58,039
compassionate giving and we're going to

2017
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:00,399
have to fight again and band together

2018
01:29:58,039 --> 01:30:02,560
again here in another year to go Lobby

2019
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:05,319
to change the law again so that we can

2020
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:07,440
continue to give free cannabis to those

2021
01:30:05,319 --> 01:30:10,158
that are in need and this is something

2022
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:12,799
the other states have to realize and I

2023
01:30:10,158 --> 01:30:14,359
hope the audit that's about to happen in

2024
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,000
Canada since you're coming up on your

2025
01:30:14,359 --> 01:30:19,279
five years there uh that you know

2026
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:22,399
compassionate giving and medical

2027
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:24,800
cannabis can stand the test of time

2028
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:27,399
because it's now legal since December of

2029
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:29,440
2020 and I'm working with the group the

2030
01:30:27,399 --> 01:30:33,399
veterans Action Council will actually be

2031
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:36,238
in um Vienna uh we have representatives

2032
01:30:33,399 --> 01:30:38,319
and we have another side event at the 66

2033
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:41,279
CND where we're working toward

2034
01:30:38,319 --> 01:30:44,079
legalization for adult used by

2035
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:46,840
2029 and we believe that's a possibility

2036
01:30:44,079 --> 01:30:50,198
so that no one will be executed around

2037
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:52,639
the world for cannabis ever again so uh

2038
01:30:50,198 --> 01:30:54,439
we're we're at the local state federal

2039
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:56,639
and we're at the international level

2040
01:30:54,439 --> 01:30:58,919
and when the galactic level decides to

2041
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:02,199
call us up we'll be there and ready to

2042
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:05,118
push cannabis into the Galaxy further so

2043
01:31:02,198 --> 01:31:07,799
again humbled and honored to be here and

2044
01:31:05,118 --> 01:31:11,039
thank you Wade and thank you of course

2045
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:15,279
Sweet Leaf Joe for your Decades of

2046
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:17,560
leadership and uh humble ability to

2047
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:19,679
navigate the very difficult Waters that

2048
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:22,360
it takes to get the Cannabis to get it

2049
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:24,800
to people for free and the logistics

2050
01:31:22,359 --> 01:31:27,359
that go in between nothing but mad

2051
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,360
respect and

2052
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:35,960
love you just made me realize uh at and

2053
01:31:33,118 --> 01:31:39,920
there is a milestone to be had who will

2054
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:39,920
be the first person to smoke hash in

2055
01:31:43,118 --> 01:31:50,158
space who will be that person and who

2056
01:31:46,158 --> 01:31:52,000
will grow that hash yeah well Kimberly

2057
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:54,238
as you know sometimes they bring me in

2058
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,840
on hash Church to break down all the

2059
01:31:54,238 --> 01:32:00,599
science that happens in in hash and in

2060
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:05,119
cannabis and yeah this this unfortunate

2061
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:08,199
thing about needing to know the percent

2062
01:32:05,118 --> 01:32:11,599
THC in a plant material that

2063
01:32:08,198 --> 01:32:15,719
produces all this other stuff and it it

2064
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:17,760
produces THC produces thca actually

2065
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:22,600
right so when we smoke it it converts it

2066
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:25,000
to THC and the difficulty about taking a

2067
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:27,920
Botanical and Quant ifying the amount of

2068
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:30,000
an active ingredient on there is that

2069
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:33,840
the Botanical itself has a lot of

2070
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,560
moisture content and in order to provide

2071
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:38,960
an accurate assessment the

2072
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:41,480
standardization is usually to report the

2073
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:45,239
amount of a chemical substance in a

2074
01:32:41,479 --> 01:32:47,919
plant based on dried weight based on the

2075
01:32:45,238 --> 01:32:50,879
dry weight of the plant material so it's

2076
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:54,520
been completely dried so the challenge

2077
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:56,840
at the Laboratories is well

2078
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:59,760
the Cannabis they're getting is not is

2079
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:01,719
not dried right so they have to dry it

2080
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:04,239
so let's talk about that for a second so

2081
01:33:01,719 --> 01:33:06,399
when you dry something you're going to

2082
01:33:04,238 --> 01:33:08,839
put it in a vacuum and you're going to

2083
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:11,158
heat it up well gee what happens to

2084
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:13,960
cannabis when you heat it up right

2085
01:33:11,158 --> 01:33:16,198
there's the volatilization of the tpes

2086
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:20,118
and as well as the loss of the water I

2087
01:33:16,198 --> 01:33:22,279
mean it's it's even known now that some

2088
01:33:20,118 --> 01:33:25,679
of these Labs because they're trying to

2089
01:33:22,279 --> 01:33:27,679
crank through as many samp as they can

2090
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:30,000
one of the knobs that they can turn here

2091
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:32,239
is they turn up the temperature right

2092
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,920
that way they can process more samples

2093
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:36,759
because the more samples the lab

2094
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:39,158
processes the more money the lab makes

2095
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:41,159
right so when they turn up the heat

2096
01:33:39,158 --> 01:33:42,439
guess what happens to the cannaboid

2097
01:33:41,158 --> 01:33:46,638
acids they

2098
01:33:42,439 --> 01:33:49,158
decarbox turn into THC right so now what

2099
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:53,159
you're putting into the hlc to measure

2100
01:33:49,158 --> 01:33:57,359
the the canabo content on is not only

2101
01:33:53,158 --> 01:34:01,519
been dry but it's been detered it's been

2102
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:04,719
decarbox and it's difficult when each

2103
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:08,960
individual lab has a different

2104
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:11,719
sop that's doing this process right so I

2105
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:14,359
think the difficulty has always been the

2106
01:34:11,719 --> 01:34:18,079
reproducibility between labs and there's

2107
01:34:14,359 --> 01:34:21,319
lawsuits in states where producers it's

2108
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:24,359
this THC inflation to be able to get

2109
01:34:21,319 --> 01:34:26,920
their stuff into the market and and at

2110
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:30,000
and knows when there's wholesale

2111
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:32,199
exchanges you know what is the what's

2112
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:35,079
the metric well it looks good it looks

2113
01:34:32,198 --> 01:34:37,158
really good well hell I was talking to a

2114
01:34:35,079 --> 01:34:39,039
guy who is in Washington Square Park

2115
01:34:37,158 --> 01:34:40,679
bought something in New York City that

2116
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:42,840
thought it looked good didn't get them

2117
01:34:40,679 --> 01:34:45,399
high at all it's probably just sprayed

2118
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:47,920
hemp right he's buying it from a weed

2119
01:34:45,399 --> 01:34:50,198
truck where there used to be food trucks

2120
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:54,158
now there's weed trucks in New York

2121
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:56,960
City it's just it it's a metric that

2122
01:34:54,158 --> 01:35:00,158
not the right thing and we were talking

2123
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:02,198
about this Marcus with Jeremy and that

2124
01:35:00,158 --> 01:35:04,638
group that came out with that paper the

2125
01:35:02,198 --> 01:35:07,519
nose nose which I think is one of the

2126
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:10,960
most fascinating papers that I've read

2127
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:13,880
in the open uh cannabis literature which

2128
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:16,639
again puts the emphasis not on THC

2129
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:19,600
content and not typically on on like

2130
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:22,079
tpine content like you can't look at one

2131
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:25,000
tpine as one instrument in this

2132
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:27,118
Orchestra right you're listening to this

2133
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,439
Orchestra play this beautiful music and

2134
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:33,519
you can't just isolate one tpine and say

2135
01:35:30,439 --> 01:35:36,279
wow it's kopine I need a krya offline

2136
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:38,800
dominant or Lon it's it's the way that

2137
01:35:36,279 --> 01:35:40,559
they play this music together and and

2138
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,800
these are just the turpins that we can

2139
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:45,199
see are the ones that are analyzed in

2140
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:48,880
the laboratory there's a whole host of

2141
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:52,559
turpins and as was uh graciously pointed

2142
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:55,880
out earlier non-terpenoid molecules like

2143
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:58,920
the uh the sulfur containing molecules

2144
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:01,719
Marcus right we had these discussions

2145
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,719
about these new

2146
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:06,520
volatile as it turns out those those

2147
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:10,879
thols are

2148
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:13,600
actually um uh a sulfur compounds but

2149
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:16,800
they're they're prenol they're prated

2150
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:20,239
sulfide so they are derived from

2151
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:23,679
isoprene so essentially they are uh

2152
01:36:20,238 --> 01:36:26,479
thiolated or sulfur containing compounds

2153
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:28,480
but their starting material kid you not

2154
01:36:26,479 --> 01:36:31,039
is isoprene which is the same starting

2155
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:34,238
material that all tpin are derived from

2156
01:36:31,039 --> 01:36:38,319
so I'll stop by just saying it is so

2157
01:36:34,238 --> 01:36:40,959
difficult in this age of prohibition

2158
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:44,639
ending and commercial production

2159
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:47,679
happening without having some sort of

2160
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:51,118
metric and until we figure out this

2161
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:53,719
issue about how to standardize there are

2162
01:36:51,118 --> 01:36:56,198
standardization methods but when you

2163
01:36:53,719 --> 01:36:58,118
take a wet cannabis flower so everything

2164
01:36:56,198 --> 01:37:01,919
that we smoke in our pipe or everything

2165
01:36:58,118 --> 01:37:04,599
that we would make hash out of it's not

2166
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:06,679
it's not on a dried weight basis right

2167
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:09,039
and when you convert that sample in a

2168
01:37:06,679 --> 01:37:11,199
laboratory to a dried weight basis

2169
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:12,960
you've just not only lost all your water

2170
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:16,198
you've lost all your tpin you've lost

2171
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:18,079
all your aldhy THS all these other

2172
01:37:16,198 --> 01:37:20,039
compounds that we don't know about and

2173
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:21,880
you've decarbox your turpine so what

2174
01:37:20,039 --> 01:37:24,679
you're putting into your hpo machine is

2175
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:28,279
no representation of what you're bu

2176
01:37:24,679 --> 01:37:32,520
Mark let me bud in for there's our

2177
01:37:28,279 --> 01:37:37,359
friend I just wanted to mention that you

2178
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:40,760
can uh bring your moisture level down to

2179
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:43,639
practically zero with the with the

2180
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:46,520
desiccator so without heat no heat at

2181
01:37:43,639 --> 01:37:49,039
all and that preserves the majority of

2182
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:51,199
the Turpin right the problem with that

2183
01:37:49,039 --> 01:37:52,479
though Sam is and you bring up a really

2184
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:55,198
great Point there's a couple

2185
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:59,238
presentations out on the Internet by a

2186
01:37:55,198 --> 01:38:03,039
researcher named Jenny Curry g i uh j i

2187
01:37:59,238 --> 01:38:05,279
n i c r r y and she's an analytical

2188
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:07,039
chemist who works at a Testing Lab who's

2189
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:09,238
given a couple presentations on this

2190
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:11,238
recently and you're absolutely right Sam

2191
01:38:09,238 --> 01:38:14,079
the problem is is that if you're going

2192
01:38:11,238 --> 01:38:17,039
to do desiccation it takes overnight

2193
01:38:14,079 --> 01:38:21,399
overnight that lab is not making enough

2194
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:24,560
money to run those samples maybe if you

2195
01:38:21,399 --> 01:38:27,638
had a hundred desiccators cuz we used a

2196
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:30,840
glass one that held about I don't know

2197
01:38:27,639 --> 01:38:33,920
maybe 50 grams maximum and it took at

2198
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:38,639
least one day to uh because we were

2199
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:42,199
storing it at maybe uh I don't know uh 8

2200
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:45,279
10% moisture so we you still had to get

2201
01:38:42,198 --> 01:38:48,000
rid of the rest of it right but it's

2202
01:38:45,279 --> 01:38:50,800
fair to say though Sam right that if

2203
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,800
you're desiccating and you're removing

2204
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,520
some of the moisture you are probably

2205
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:57,679
going to be losing some of your most

2206
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:59,960
volatile compounds in that loss that's

2207
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:01,920
one thing it depends what the room

2208
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:04,719
temperature is if the room temperature

2209
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:07,560
is fairly low then no that doesn't

2210
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:11,239
happen but also I wanted to mention that

2211
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:14,520
the thols I'm doing some tests

2212
01:39:11,238 --> 01:39:17,399
now some pure

2213
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:21,239
thca and I'll be

2214
01:39:17,399 --> 01:39:24,359
using uh some of the fils that were

2215
01:39:21,238 --> 01:39:28,198
given to me to test the see if they can

2216
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:32,319
either modulate or potentiate THC the

2217
01:39:28,198 --> 01:39:35,519
way some of the tpes can I'm sure they

2218
01:39:32,319 --> 01:39:39,439
will I'm not sure but I'm curious as

2219
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:42,199
hell well I love like the the garlic

2220
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:44,759
essence of like some of the hazes and I

2221
01:39:42,198 --> 01:39:48,118
think that there is something to that

2222
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:50,079
beyond the gas essence you know but

2223
01:39:48,118 --> 01:39:53,799
those guys actually have developed kind

2224
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:55,920
of like the the the the gas scale based

2225
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:58,279
on some of the volatile Tarpin that

2226
01:39:55,920 --> 01:40:00,800
they've or volatile sulfides that

2227
01:39:58,279 --> 01:40:04,158
they've identified yeah and the one that

2228
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:08,760
I got is the one that they suspect is

2229
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:11,439
the most likely and also that uh is the

2230
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:14,920
most potent I mean you you you're

2231
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:18,238
talking about the tiniest amount on a

2232
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:22,000
pin head it can stink up the whole room

2233
01:40:18,238 --> 01:40:22,000
for like days

2234
01:40:23,719 --> 01:40:29,079
and how is your wife uh loving that Sam

2235
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:32,000
well I I haven't taken it out yet when I

2236
01:40:29,079 --> 01:40:34,960
do it I'll do it out on my balcony good

2237
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:37,399
call good call well welcome to uh our

2238
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:41,118
celebration of Frenchie skunkman Sam

2239
01:40:37,399 --> 01:40:44,439
it's been uh too long excuse me I was

2240
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:46,319
just uh meditating on my puffco and uh I

2241
01:40:44,439 --> 01:40:49,519
spaced it out the

2242
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:53,359
time on your puffco or your Magna

2243
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:56,199
Carta well I'm not using my Magna cardi

2244
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:59,118
yet I don't have it in my hands so I'm

2245
01:40:56,198 --> 01:41:02,359
using the puffco and uh I'll try to make

2246
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:02,359
the card as soon as I get

2247
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:19,880
one is somebody talking or no so we were

2248
01:41:17,198 --> 01:41:23,359
telling stories about Frenchie do you

2249
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:28,400
have any stories about Frenchie Sam well

2250
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:30,960
Frenchie and I had a very very close uh

2251
01:41:28,399 --> 01:41:34,879
relationship he wanted to use more

2252
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:37,800
science to prove you know the various

2253
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:41,359
theories and feelings he had about

2254
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:46,119
hashish and uh I I encouraged him in

2255
01:41:41,359 --> 01:41:49,960
every way that I could to uh to do so I

2256
01:41:46,118 --> 01:41:53,039
I think right when uh at the time he

2257
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:56,760
died he had done some recent work where

2258
01:41:53,039 --> 01:42:01,319
they they were taking hashish and then

2259
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:04,320
pressing it rubbing it and uh storing it

2260
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:07,679
for you know 3 months 6 months nine

2261
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:10,880
months to see what happens to the canono

2262
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:13,359
inter turpine profiles because uh you

2263
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:16,440
know he he had a lot of feelings that

2264
01:42:13,359 --> 01:42:20,039
new turpins were created or there was

2265
01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:22,919
something going on and uh I I wasn't so

2266
01:42:20,039 --> 01:42:25,039
sure about the new tpin but I says the

2267
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:27,800
way to answer the questions is with

2268
01:42:25,039 --> 01:42:29,279
science and so he he's it took him a

2269
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:32,840
couple years to get it together but he

2270
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:36,279
was doing it right when uh unfortunately

2271
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:39,199
uh he left us yeah that was studies that

2272
01:42:36,279 --> 01:42:43,279
he did with high North labs in

2273
01:42:39,198 --> 01:42:45,118
Toronto um and it was just the initial

2274
01:42:43,279 --> 01:42:48,238
uh study to kind of establish the

2275
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:51,559
Prototype and figure out uh the protocol

2276
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:53,879
sorry um how to do the longer term study

2277
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:56,480
and so that's something that I to fund

2278
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:58,039
in the future as well because Frenchie

2279
01:42:56,479 --> 01:42:59,678
had the experience you know one of the

2280
01:42:58,039 --> 01:43:02,639
things they would do when they would go

2281
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:04,599
back year after year in the mountains

2282
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:06,560
with the Italians that were up there

2283
01:43:04,599 --> 01:43:08,679
with him because it was just a couple

2284
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:11,320
French people and some Italians back in

2285
01:43:08,679 --> 01:43:14,239
the day that really went to the areas

2286
01:43:11,319 --> 01:43:16,279
that he was at before they would go down

2287
01:43:14,238 --> 01:43:19,198
to Goa for the winter you know when the

2288
01:43:16,279 --> 01:43:21,559
snow would hit up there they would leave

2289
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:23,638
a little bit of the chus that they had

2290
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:25,199
made that year they would bury it

2291
01:43:23,639 --> 01:43:27,480
underground so that they would have

2292
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:30,238
something to smoke as soon as they came

2293
01:43:27,479 --> 01:43:33,519
back up and they would have these little

2294
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:35,638
G togethers and over the years you know

2295
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:37,400
once he had been doing this for five six

2296
01:43:35,639 --> 01:43:40,039
years there were Italians that had been

2297
01:43:37,399 --> 01:43:43,000
there 10 years before him he started

2298
01:43:40,039 --> 01:43:45,960
smoking hat that was 8 10 12 years old

2299
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:49,319
and really had this you know kind of

2300
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:51,480
amazing experience of how good this aged

2301
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:53,840
charas I should say it was Char charas

2302
01:43:51,479 --> 01:43:57,799
was and that kind of plan the seed in

2303
01:43:53,840 --> 01:44:00,239
his brain of there was this whole area

2304
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:03,400
in the commercial Marketplace that was

2305
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:06,000
still open for development around aging

2306
01:44:03,399 --> 01:44:07,920
hashish and I think being French and

2307
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,399
having the experience you know the

2308
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:14,319
culture there with aging wine or certain

2309
01:44:11,399 --> 01:44:16,879
alcohols that are that are aged and

2310
01:44:14,319 --> 01:44:19,439
develop a a different profile and

2311
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:20,599
expression with the passage of time that

2312
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:23,598
was something that was really

2313
01:44:20,599 --> 01:44:25,679
interesting for interesting to him

2314
01:44:23,599 --> 01:44:27,319
and of course he loved talking with all

2315
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:30,118
of you who have the scientific

2316
01:44:27,319 --> 01:44:32,599
background because he really felt that

2317
01:44:30,118 --> 01:44:34,559
the ancestors they intuitively knew

2318
01:44:32,599 --> 01:44:37,520
something because of what they had

2319
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:39,360
learned generation after generation you

2320
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:42,040
know working with people he would asked

2321
01:44:39,359 --> 01:44:44,439
them in those traditional cultures why

2322
01:44:42,039 --> 01:44:47,399
do we do this thing and the answer was

2323
01:44:44,439 --> 01:44:49,598
always because it makes a better hashish

2324
01:44:47,399 --> 01:44:51,559
because it makes a better charas they

2325
01:44:49,599 --> 01:44:53,599
couldn't explain the science but they

2326
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:55,560
knew what they knew because because they

2327
01:44:53,599 --> 01:44:57,880
had paid attention to the plant and

2328
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:00,239
their their parents or their

2329
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:02,440
grandparents had passed the knowledge on

2330
01:45:00,238 --> 01:45:05,238
and he really wanted to be able to

2331
01:45:02,439 --> 01:45:10,039
validate their their understanding

2332
01:45:05,238 --> 01:45:12,359
through modern science and uh and yeah

2333
01:45:10,039 --> 01:45:16,399
leave that with the

2334
01:45:12,359 --> 01:45:20,960
world well I'm I'm in favor of cannabis

2335
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:23,479
science that has been my life and uh I I

2336
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:29,599
I encourage him in every way I could to

2337
01:45:23,479 --> 01:45:33,279
to we we both had a deep deep love of

2338
01:45:29,599 --> 01:45:36,319
hashish uh I I had very slight uh

2339
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:40,800
different feelings for example I and I

2340
01:45:36,319 --> 01:45:45,399
think uh Marcus also likes this prefer

2341
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:47,239
unpressed dry sifted resin uh it I don't

2342
01:45:45,399 --> 01:45:51,279
know there's just something about it

2343
01:45:47,238 --> 01:45:54,198
that I like a little bit better but uh

2344
01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:57,759
uh for any sort of long time

2345
01:45:54,198 --> 01:46:01,158
preservation uh I I would strongly

2346
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:04,920
recommend pressing it like uh like

2347
01:46:01,158 --> 01:46:07,638
uh everybody else uh around me

2348
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:09,960
does I just like to say too you know the

2349
01:46:07,639 --> 01:46:16,679
other thing that Frenchie used to

2350
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:19,719
comment on a lot was how um hard we

2351
01:46:16,679 --> 01:46:22,679
are like one person's preference to

2352
01:46:19,719 --> 01:46:25,198
another sometimes within the concentrate

2353
01:46:22,679 --> 01:46:27,679
uh community and he used to say you know

2354
01:46:25,198 --> 01:46:31,158
it's so funny you never hear a tequilo

2355
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:33,639
drinker trashing a CNAC consumer for

2356
01:46:31,158 --> 01:46:36,759
their choice and he would be the first

2357
01:46:33,639 --> 01:46:38,679
person to say you know bless whatever

2358
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:41,079
you want to consume if you should

2359
01:46:38,679 --> 01:46:43,158
consume what makes you feel good and

2360
01:46:41,079 --> 01:46:45,198
what meets your needs and your

2361
01:46:43,158 --> 01:46:47,879
preferences but that there shouldn't be

2362
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:49,879
this judgment against another person

2363
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:51,639
because they want you know so in the

2364
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:54,039
case of Frenchie he loved the

2365
01:46:51,639 --> 01:46:56,359
traditional pressed and even aged

2366
01:46:54,039 --> 01:46:59,599
hashish he wasn't going to say that he

2367
01:46:56,359 --> 01:47:03,960
didn't think you should not smoke your

2368
01:46:59,599 --> 01:47:06,199
unpressed loose live resin by any means

2369
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:08,480
you know um so I just would like to

2370
01:47:06,198 --> 01:47:09,678
throw out I think we need more tolerance

2371
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:12,118
that would

2372
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:16,599
be what I was talking about actually

2373
01:47:12,118 --> 01:47:19,000
wasn't live resin it's dried plants it's

2374
01:47:16,599 --> 01:47:22,039
been dried for two weeks it's been cured

2375
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:26,079
for a couple of months then you dry sift

2376
01:47:22,039 --> 01:47:29,800
it and then you smoke it as unpressed

2377
01:47:26,079 --> 01:47:32,679
pollen that's it it's very slight

2378
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:35,000
difference but uh it it's different and

2379
01:47:32,679 --> 01:47:37,639
I agree different smokes for different

2380
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,800
folks whatever turns your crank is

2381
01:47:37,639 --> 01:47:42,840
what's good for you as long as it's

2382
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:46,719
clean and safe for the consumer but you

2383
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:46,719
let 1,000 ideas

2384
01:47:48,039 --> 01:47:53,679
Bloom uh just in the spirit of aged

2385
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:56,199
resin we have a a traditional ball here

2386
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:58,920
that mean Jean gave to us and it's N9

2387
01:47:56,198 --> 01:48:00,439
years old it's got to be I don't know je

2388
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:03,960
maybe if mean Jean's out there he can

2389
01:48:00,439 --> 01:48:07,279
say exactly how old it was but it's it's

2390
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:09,158
probably over nine years now we did add

2391
01:48:07,279 --> 01:48:11,920
some other stuff in it there but it's

2392
01:48:09,158 --> 01:48:15,679
very beautiful we've been smoking snakes

2393
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:18,279
out of it in into the joints right now

2394
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:22,840
and uh we all really love smoking

2395
01:48:18,279 --> 01:48:26,759
hashish like this is it dry or is it

2396
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:31,840
water hash dry sifted do you know water

2397
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:33,520
hash water hash yeah yeah and uh it it

2398
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:37,840
would have been nice if you could have

2399
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:41,440
analyzed it uh nine years ago and uh

2400
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:44,639
every five years or so along this trail

2401
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:47,118
that I'm I'm very curious about

2402
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:50,800
that we would like to do that as well we

2403
01:48:47,118 --> 01:48:53,598
have some preco hash also from uh 2019

2404
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:56,199
Mendo breath which is kind of fun

2405
01:48:53,599 --> 01:48:58,319
and uh you know we can uh give that a

2406
01:48:56,198 --> 01:49:00,559
test and if you have some we can talk to

2407
01:48:58,319 --> 01:49:03,479
High North because we work with high

2408
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:06,599
North out in Ontario from our British

2409
01:49:03,479 --> 01:49:08,158
Colombian farm and uh maybe we can do

2410
01:49:06,599 --> 01:49:10,760
some of that testing that would be fun

2411
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:13,920
to do we're going to keep it you know in

2412
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:16,960
a cool dry place in a good container and

2413
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:20,118
all that but I know when I did uh

2414
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:23,359
storage uh studies in my laboratory

2415
01:49:20,118 --> 01:49:26,598
years ago when I was busy working uh I

2416
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:30,000
found that cannabis after one or two

2417
01:49:26,599 --> 01:49:33,599
years of just storage in boxes in the

2418
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:36,800
dark and cool room uh lost the majority

2419
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:40,760
of its tpping but it canabo profile was

2420
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:44,039
still identical whereas dry sifted

2421
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:46,840
resin uh also it loses the majority of

2422
01:49:44,039 --> 01:49:52,118
its turpins and it'll start to turn from

2423
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:54,679
like a a golden uh T sand colored to a

2424
01:49:52,118 --> 01:49:58,439
almost red reddish color just from the

2425
01:49:54,679 --> 01:50:02,279
oxidation of the uh

2426
01:49:58,439 --> 01:50:04,158
THC yeah I've got some red uh pass right

2427
01:50:02,279 --> 01:50:07,599
here actually that

2428
01:50:04,158 --> 01:50:10,559
um I can show it real quick here get to

2429
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:15,279
the different view this piece of hash is

2430
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:18,639
is 13 years old that's in

2431
01:50:15,279 --> 01:50:22,000
here 13 person that I know would do that

2432
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:23,599
is Kenny from Tricom technology he would

2433
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,000
uh whip out

2434
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:29,560
I mean literally 15 20 different

2435
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:32,439
varieties two years old just to show you

2436
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:35,920
the difference in the flavors Etc and

2437
01:50:32,439 --> 01:50:37,198
there's definitely uh the that the uh

2438
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:40,239
yeah it's

2439
01:50:37,198 --> 01:50:42,319
definitely um for sure uh it's

2440
01:50:40,238 --> 01:50:45,000
definitely couch lock kind of hash for

2441
01:50:42,319 --> 01:50:48,158
sure but definitely you could tell the

2442
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,599
tpin all that were were definitely gone

2443
01:50:48,158 --> 01:50:51,839
you really had to get in there to get

2444
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:53,119
any type of flavor and the flavor really

2445
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:56,159
didn't come out until until it was

2446
01:50:53,118 --> 01:50:58,880
actually lit so not many people I know

2447
01:50:56,158 --> 01:51:00,638
in America will actually age hash but

2448
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:02,960
not many people I know would do that

2449
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:05,560
many hashes that many years that he

2450
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:08,239
likes to do but to also like Sam what he

2451
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:11,320
was doing to see the differences and

2452
01:51:08,238 --> 01:51:13,479
what the changes that transpire happen

2453
01:51:11,319 --> 01:51:15,920
but uh yeah

2454
01:51:13,479 --> 01:51:17,919
it's couch lock yeah you can only you

2455
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:19,880
can only cure for so long although you

2456
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:21,719
know this this particular hash which is

2457
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:24,960
you know almost 14 years old now it

2458
01:51:21,719 --> 01:51:28,520
still has an incred flavor it has almost

2459
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:30,719
no smell it smells almost stale which is

2460
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:35,119
like what I've seen from resin that's in

2461
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:36,800
the you know almost 15 to 20 year s Sam

2462
01:51:35,118 --> 01:51:38,799
used to have some really old resin as

2463
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:40,480
did one of his partners he wasn't

2464
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:43,239
necessarily curing it as much as

2465
01:51:40,479 --> 01:51:46,598
preserving it but it was I was doing

2466
01:51:43,238 --> 01:51:50,078
that was at minus 30 Centigrade and it

2467
01:51:46,599 --> 01:51:52,880
was I sucked all the oxygen away from it

2468
01:51:50,078 --> 01:51:55,399
for long-term storage and then it kept

2469
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:58,480
and the tpin were kept everything was

2470
01:51:55,399 --> 01:52:00,559
really really nice but if you're not

2471
01:51:58,479 --> 01:52:04,678
super careful about your long-term

2472
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:09,280
storage of dry sifted resin for example

2473
01:52:04,679 --> 01:52:11,000
then uh yeah it it it definitely changes

2474
01:52:09,279 --> 01:52:15,479
and there is a point of diminishing

2475
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:17,679
returns did Frenchie freeze his once he'

2476
01:52:15,479 --> 01:52:20,158
had it piece pressed and he wanted to

2477
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:22,199
keep it for a few years would he would

2478
01:52:20,158 --> 01:52:24,759
he freeze it or store it at room

2479
01:52:22,198 --> 01:52:27,118
temperature temp he would store it in

2480
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:30,520
the basement almost like a wine seller

2481
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:32,880
because he was interested in kind of the

2482
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:36,040
transformation what was happening with

2483
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:38,760
the Turpin and whatnot over time but in

2484
01:52:36,039 --> 01:52:40,560
the study that he wanted to do like you

2485
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:43,840
have done he wanted to have some that

2486
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:45,520
was stored at very very cold conditions

2487
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:47,480
and then you know kind of like three

2488
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:49,320
different temperatures yeah no that

2489
01:52:47,479 --> 01:52:52,319
that's exactly what you need to do for

2490
01:52:49,319 --> 01:52:52,319
science

2491
01:52:54,800 --> 01:53:02,279
so Lebanon was Notorious for producing

2492
01:52:58,679 --> 01:53:05,480
red hashish but to my knowledge they're

2493
01:53:02,279 --> 01:53:07,439
no longer producing red hash today but I

2494
01:53:05,479 --> 01:53:11,439
believe their drying methodologies are

2495
01:53:07,439 --> 01:53:15,678
the same so what's different now uh it

2496
01:53:11,439 --> 01:53:17,719
had soil uh I was able to get uh uh

2497
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:21,560
Lebanese when I was in Saudi Arabia for

2498
01:53:17,719 --> 01:53:25,840
the Gulf War oops um and uh I was able

2499
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:27,920
to trade with epod and uh I got it and

2500
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:32,159
it was a little dry and brittly it was

2501
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:36,319
compact it would come in Long uh thin

2502
01:53:32,158 --> 01:53:38,279
slats and uh yeah it was just red and it

2503
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:40,118
didn't have a right flavor to it but

2504
01:53:38,279 --> 01:53:41,519
from what I'm told that's just from the

2505
01:53:40,118 --> 01:53:46,799
the dust of the

2506
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:49,520
soil absolutely red soil makes lebanes

2507
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:51,960
red it may not be the only reason but

2508
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:54,440
it's the majority of the reason iron

2509
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:54,439
silicate

2510
01:53:54,649 --> 01:53:57,699
[Music]

2511
01:53:58,399 --> 01:54:02,679
um I think part of the uh the problem

2512
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:05,000
with the Lebanon is that there's it's

2513
01:54:02,679 --> 01:54:08,239
just become like extremely punishable

2514
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:11,800
there and I we we were just talking with

2515
01:54:08,238 --> 01:54:14,799
a a cannabis man from Lebanon in a

2516
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:17,039
coffee shop in Amsterdam and they come

2517
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,760
out here because any anything they do

2518
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:20,198
there

2519
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:22,440
is it's just really hard to get around

2520
01:54:20,198 --> 01:54:24,439
in Lebanon right now especially after

2521
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:27,118
the bomb and that whole thing and even

2522
01:54:24,439 --> 01:54:28,198
this is Mick back here from gwa and he

2523
01:54:27,118 --> 01:54:30,960
he's saying that a lot of the

2524
01:54:28,198 --> 01:54:32,759
traditional nice to meet you guys a lot

2525
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:35,719
of the traditional hash that's going

2526
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:38,000
around here 95% of it coming from

2527
01:54:35,719 --> 01:54:40,158
Morocco at this

2528
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:44,039
moment yeah that's that's what's

2529
01:54:40,158 --> 01:54:48,039
flooding Europe is Morocco and most of

2530
01:54:44,039 --> 01:54:51,679
it is about the best you can get is z z

2531
01:54:48,039 --> 01:54:55,639
which uh they take 100 kilos of dried

2532
01:54:51,679 --> 01:55:00,158
plants and they make at least two kilos

2533
01:54:55,639 --> 01:55:02,159
of uh collected resin from it and I know

2534
01:55:00,158 --> 01:55:06,638
cuz I tried that double zero that you

2535
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:08,559
gave to to Ed at positronics back in 96

2536
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:12,440
and that was the first and only time I

2537
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:15,239
ever had that and when you snapped it it

2538
01:55:12,439 --> 01:55:18,559
you used a knife and it clicked just

2539
01:55:15,238 --> 01:55:21,598
like glass I remember that sound and I

2540
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:24,199
remember smoking that and that was

2541
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:27,679
lights out some of the most amazing uh

2542
01:55:24,198 --> 01:55:32,638
hash I've ever ever had that's because

2543
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:34,960
it was anywhere from 70% resin heads to

2544
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:38,159
hire I I don't remember that particular

2545
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:42,000
piece but uh you know when I made it for

2546
01:55:38,158 --> 01:55:43,559
gifts it was usually uh you know 70 80%

2547
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:47,439
resin

2548
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:48,760
heads I I I remember being laying on and

2549
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:51,198
I went around and did all the different

2550
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:52,880
hash places in Amsterdam and I just

2551
01:55:51,198 --> 01:55:57,439
remember laying on the bench there at

2552
01:55:52,880 --> 01:56:01,359
patronic staring at the sky and um I

2553
01:55:57,439 --> 01:56:03,919
when I left I had just one little gram

2554
01:56:01,359 --> 01:56:07,158
left and I ate it and I remember Landing

2555
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:10,520
in New York and trying to walk toward

2556
01:56:07,158 --> 01:56:13,638
the Customs guy and everything was in

2557
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:17,159
slow motion my wife said I was fine but

2558
01:56:13,639 --> 01:56:19,039
I was [ __ ] lit out of my [ __ ] mind

2559
01:56:17,158 --> 01:56:21,279
and I don't know how I made it through

2560
01:56:19,039 --> 01:56:24,960
there but you know the universe was kind

2561
01:56:21,279 --> 01:56:26,800
to me and uh yeah it was yeah still

2562
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,639
without a doubt one of those memories

2563
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:32,599
that stick in my mind and that's due to

2564
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:35,880
you and due to real dou

2565
01:56:32,599 --> 01:56:39,119
zero we had conversations with Frenchie

2566
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:42,840
about going on a tour in in

2567
01:56:39,118 --> 01:56:44,519
Kimberly in Morocco and visiting Farms

2568
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:47,520
because he was saying that a lot of the

2569
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:49,920
Farms there were just not growing in a

2570
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:52,239
way that he thinks is best for the resin

2571
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:55,000
and that he felt like the local

2572
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:56,919
cultivation could be you know done

2573
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:59,238
better for their local

2574
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:02,399
cultivation and uh you know they use the

2575
01:56:59,238 --> 01:57:04,359
beaten Sith technique there and there's

2576
01:57:02,399 --> 01:57:07,519
also like interesting to see how the

2577
01:57:04,359 --> 01:57:09,920
beaten sift technique that's come into

2578
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:12,920
like bags here in Barcelona you can get

2579
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:14,719
beaten sipped bags you know and make

2580
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:18,199
hash the Moroccan way and it is it's

2581
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:21,639
less heads but you can still make really

2582
01:57:18,198 --> 01:57:24,399
beautiful you know kind of Patties or or

2583
01:57:21,639 --> 01:57:27,639
big think pressed hash which is

2584
01:57:24,399 --> 01:57:31,319
beautiful to smoke in ganja dues or

2585
01:57:27,639 --> 01:57:33,000
tobacco which a lot of people do here um

2586
01:57:31,319 --> 01:57:34,840
but uh the beaten sift technique is

2587
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:37,800
interesting and I don't see it as much

2588
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:40,319
at home um because the pure resin heads

2589
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:43,639
are better for dabbing and it doesn't

2590
01:57:40,319 --> 01:57:46,198
make sense to have a 70% heads but the

2591
01:57:43,639 --> 01:57:50,118
tpping ratio on it is in a way a lot

2592
01:57:46,198 --> 01:57:51,598
higher some and also I was thinking Josh

2593
01:57:50,118 --> 01:57:54,519
just mentioned Morocco that was

2594
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:57,560
definitely something that Frenchie and

2595
01:57:54,520 --> 01:58:00,000
we were dreaming about because he would

2596
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:02,599
talk about Morocco and sort of get stars

2597
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,840
in his eyes and say oh we got to teach

2598
01:58:02,599 --> 01:58:07,679
him biomass we've gotta go back and

2599
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:09,920
retach him there are people up in the

2600
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:14,319
hills who are still doing it properly

2601
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:18,039
and that passion to bring you know the

2602
01:58:14,319 --> 01:58:21,519
old world practices and the old world

2603
01:58:18,039 --> 01:58:24,000
techniques even to the people who were

2604
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:27,719
their still even the people who have

2605
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:30,520
lost it he was still out there teaching

2606
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:32,279
them their old ways or reintroducing

2607
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:35,040
their old ways

2608
01:58:32,279 --> 01:58:37,000
and just really thinking about that and

2609
01:58:35,039 --> 01:58:39,000
dreaming about that and how that's one

2610
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:42,198
of my greatest dreams to get out to

2611
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:45,920
Morocco because he just talked about it

2612
01:58:42,198 --> 01:58:51,158
so much I I feel like I have to

2613
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:53,960
go honest I shout out to Marcus because

2614
01:58:51,158 --> 01:58:56,000
it was actually and having bubble bags

2615
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:59,158
which brought an ideal to people at the

2616
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:01,880
different size screens mattered I mean

2617
01:58:59,158 --> 01:59:03,799
has literally uplifted the quality of

2618
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:05,359
hash now granted there's different

2619
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:10,199
people who have knocked off what Marcus

2620
01:59:05,359 --> 01:59:11,759
has done but regardless that type of

2621
01:59:10,198 --> 01:59:15,638
understanding that different types of

2622
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:19,199
flowers produce different size Micron

2623
01:59:15,639 --> 01:59:21,560
size you know flowering tops I mean it

2624
01:59:19,198 --> 01:59:23,519
mattered and it still matters and I just

2625
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:27,639
want to thank bubbl man and the others

2626
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:29,639
who use that technology that has risen

2627
01:59:27,639 --> 01:59:33,078
the quality all the way around because I

2628
01:59:29,639 --> 01:59:35,000
know uh fren she used those bags and was

2629
01:59:33,078 --> 01:59:38,359
very successful in helping him get at

2630
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:40,719
the Quality so the technology standards

2631
01:59:38,359 --> 01:59:43,078
have also helped raise the standards

2632
01:59:40,719 --> 01:59:47,439
outright so I just want to bring back to

2633
01:59:43,078 --> 01:59:50,319
thank Marcus for his ingenious uh time

2634
01:59:47,439 --> 01:59:51,719
and place in the hash history to uh move

2635
01:59:50,319 --> 01:59:54,559
things forward because we wouldn't be

2636
01:59:51,719 --> 01:59:57,198
where we are if that understanding in

2637
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:58,800
itself wasn't out there for people and

2638
01:59:57,198 --> 02:00:00,960
it really

2639
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:03,560
matters but you know kind of

2640
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:08,078
piggybacking on what you just said about

2641
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:11,639
um going to Morocco I think we have a we

2642
02:00:08,078 --> 02:00:14,000
kind of owe them a debt because we

2643
02:00:11,639 --> 02:00:17,639
brought these cultiv ours that really

2644
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:19,520
were not suited to the local ter there

2645
02:00:17,639 --> 02:00:22,239
and now they're needing to use more

2646
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:24,320
water they're having problems with pet

2647
02:00:22,238 --> 02:00:27,519
they're having all kinds of issues that

2648
02:00:24,319 --> 02:00:32,399
they didn't have in the in the past and

2649
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:36,880
I I think you know we do we do owe them

2650
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:39,279
uh some help in in seeing that maybe

2651
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:43,359
they should let things go back or you

2652
02:00:39,279 --> 02:00:45,960
know use cultivars that are more adapted

2653
02:00:43,359 --> 02:00:48,118
to the environment there and not try to

2654
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:51,439
change the environment it's kind of like

2655
02:00:48,118 --> 02:00:52,639
I'm seeing pictures of people doing ice

2656
02:00:51,439 --> 02:00:55,198
waterer

2657
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:57,118
in the Himalayas you know where in

2658
02:00:55,198 --> 02:00:59,960
traditional Chas cultures in

2659
02:00:57,118 --> 02:01:02,639
environments that are very humid and not

2660
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:06,399
suited to drying the material after it's

2661
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:08,279
been washed and so I just would love for

2662
02:01:06,399 --> 02:01:10,198
people in these traditional environments

2663
02:01:08,279 --> 02:01:12,920
to understand that just because we're

2664
02:01:10,198 --> 02:01:15,559
doing something in Northern California

2665
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:17,760
in one way that suits the climate the

2666
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:20,360
environment that we have here that it's

2667
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:23,000
not necessary going to be the perfect

2668
02:01:20,359 --> 02:01:25,319
fit and that maybe what they have

2669
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:28,198
traditionally is what the world needs

2670
02:01:25,319 --> 02:01:29,960
and not for them to replicate what we

2671
02:01:28,198 --> 02:01:32,519
what we have I don't think we've always

2672
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:35,599
done the best service by trying to

2673
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:38,400
replace the the original genetics that

2674
02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:44,760
were in these producing

2675
02:01:38,399 --> 02:01:44,759
countries agree agree you want to say

2676
02:01:45,319 --> 02:01:50,000
anything talking about I just think it's

2677
02:01:48,039 --> 02:01:52,679
beautiful to see traditions and

2678
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:56,078
Technology get together you know

2679
02:01:52,679 --> 02:01:59,078
we all here and Frenchie and all of you

2680
02:01:56,078 --> 02:02:01,118
honor so much the tradition but we can't

2681
02:01:59,078 --> 02:02:03,519
deny where we live in right we live in

2682
02:02:01,118 --> 02:02:06,399
the world where is I mean we live in the

2683
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:10,040
present and I think it's beautiful like

2684
02:02:06,399 --> 02:02:12,719
Belle's work is completely uniting also

2685
02:02:10,039 --> 02:02:15,078
tradition and Technology honoring the

2686
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:17,760
tradition and honoring the different

2687
02:02:15,078 --> 02:02:20,359
colors of P the different amounts of

2688
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:22,639
plant matter that can be in that hash

2689
02:02:20,359 --> 02:02:26,118
and um I went

2690
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:28,679
Miracle eight years ago and then now and

2691
02:02:26,118 --> 02:02:30,598
then in just in brief eight years I

2692
02:02:28,679 --> 02:02:33,239
could see the big change in Traditions

2693
02:02:30,599 --> 02:02:34,840
to technology I I know that people here

2694
02:02:33,238 --> 02:02:36,919
in Europe probably know way more about

2695
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:38,880
me than that but for the first time

2696
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:41,199
people in the street were trying to sell

2697
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:43,679
things to me talking about the

2698
02:02:41,198 --> 02:02:45,559
Micron before eight years ago they were

2699
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:48,520
not talking about what Micron that was

2700
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:51,199
made they were showing me some

2701
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:53,119
strawberry banana bars and a bunch of

2702
02:02:51,198 --> 02:02:54,559
them come to ear come here to Barcelona

2703
02:02:53,118 --> 02:02:57,039
too but they were showing all these

2704
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:59,800
different kinds of genetics so of course

2705
02:02:57,039 --> 02:03:01,960
it's beautiful for us to um think of a

2706
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:04,239
world when it's untouched but

2707
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:07,359
globalization somehow happened and

2708
02:03:04,238 --> 02:03:09,759
that's what we have nowadays uh I just

2709
02:03:07,359 --> 02:03:12,399
hope we keep honoring tradition that we

2710
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:14,599
just don't develop just technology and

2711
02:03:12,399 --> 02:03:15,920
forget about the tradition so both

2712
02:03:14,599 --> 02:03:18,119
directions are

2713
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:20,078
important both both directions are

2714
02:03:18,118 --> 02:03:23,000
important to have to keep our Roots but

2715
02:03:20,078 --> 02:03:25,319
to grow up towards the St you know it's

2716
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:27,118
uh it it's it's important to have them

2717
02:03:25,319 --> 02:03:30,158
both and I'll tell you there was several

2718
02:03:27,118 --> 02:03:32,198
years where I would take some I we made

2719
02:03:30,158 --> 02:03:34,118
some incredible water hash with Dr

2720
02:03:32,198 --> 02:03:36,598
Atomic he brought some of his flowers

2721
02:03:34,118 --> 02:03:38,118
over to my house and we made some he

2722
02:03:36,599 --> 02:03:40,800
brought like three or four pounds of

2723
02:03:38,118 --> 02:03:42,799
flour when flour was worth $3,000 a

2724
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:45,199
pound and said whatever let's just make

2725
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:47,279
some nice bubble hash with it and I took

2726
02:03:45,198 --> 02:03:49,919
that bubble has to Bob Marley's birthday

2727
02:03:47,279 --> 02:03:53,880
bash in Kingston Jamaica that year and

2728
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:56,800
he took it to Nepal for the Shiva ratri

2729
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:58,559
and everyone we shared it with and

2730
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:01,760
everywhere we shared it with he actually

2731
02:03:58,559 --> 02:04:05,360
put it on a plate at a celebration of

2732
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:08,880
hash in at shivar ratri in in in

2733
02:04:05,359 --> 02:04:11,479
Katmandu and it was the People's Choice

2734
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:14,159
it was the Bubba's choice of hash for

2735
02:04:11,479 --> 02:04:15,959
that evening it was the one that no one

2736
02:04:14,158 --> 02:04:17,719
could get over no one could believe of

2737
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:20,559
course they weren't you know dissing

2738
02:04:17,719 --> 02:04:22,559
their traditional hashes but they had

2739
02:04:20,559 --> 02:04:25,320
just never seen any anything like this

2740
02:04:22,559 --> 02:04:27,279
this was six-star full melt bubble and

2741
02:04:25,319 --> 02:04:30,639
they were smoking it in chillums in a

2742
02:04:27,279 --> 02:04:32,719
cave in in in catmandu and it was just

2743
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:34,520
uh and and very similar experience

2744
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:37,599
happened in Jamaica I smoked it with a

2745
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:41,320
variety of rasta farai from different

2746
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:43,078
tribes and I also uh not only smoked it

2747
02:04:41,319 --> 02:04:45,840
but we put it in the steam pipe as well

2748
02:04:43,078 --> 02:04:46,960
so it was vaporized and it was uh it's

2749
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:49,960
neat to

2750
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:52,158
see we couldn't have what we have today

2751
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:54,198
without those Traditions so it's kind of

2752
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:56,920
like by creating something new you're

2753
02:04:54,198 --> 02:04:58,678
really paying homage to the tradition

2754
02:04:56,920 --> 02:05:00,880
because you couldn't you're you're a

2755
02:04:58,679 --> 02:05:03,199
step in a ladder and you couldn't take

2756
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:05,520
that step without all the steps before

2757
02:05:03,198 --> 02:05:08,118
you and if there's no steps after you

2758
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:10,599
well then the ladder ends and that's uh

2759
02:05:08,118 --> 02:05:13,920
that's sort of a sad thought as well so

2760
02:05:10,599 --> 02:05:16,800
I think one of our most important steps

2761
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:20,639
recently has been well by recently I

2762
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:25,400
mean last few decades has been using

2763
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:29,599
simpia to produce water hash or dry sift

2764
02:05:25,399 --> 02:05:34,719
and uh yeah that because simpsom and

2765
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:36,400
resin is uh funly fundamentally got more

2766
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:41,319
of what we

2767
02:05:36,399 --> 02:05:41,319
want and cleanliness is Next to

2768
02:05:47,198 --> 02:05:53,359
Godliness That's all folks in the case

2769
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:57,760
of a Morocco you're definitely seeing

2770
02:05:53,359 --> 02:06:01,479
like you know runs and Kush mins and

2771
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:04,920
things coming over from Morocco a lot um

2772
02:06:01,479 --> 02:06:06,959
which is like kind of a bummer but also

2773
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:08,800
maybe cool for them because they love

2774
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:12,760
ganja too and they're just exploring

2775
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:15,520
these new flavors as well um there are

2776
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:17,280
definitely uh some regions where you

2777
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:19,599
know I would imagine that the the

2778
02:06:17,279 --> 02:06:21,679
Moroccans still you know it's it's a

2779
02:06:19,599 --> 02:06:23,840
little bit more land raced but we we

2780
02:06:21,679 --> 02:06:28,078
have been talking about going on a trip

2781
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:30,239
this fall um to explore during the hash

2782
02:06:28,078 --> 02:06:33,000
times you know to see what's what's

2783
02:06:30,238 --> 02:06:36,399
going on out there you you will not find

2784
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:38,279
pure land races in Morocco because all

2785
02:06:36,399 --> 02:06:42,519
of the crops are seated and they're

2786
02:06:38,279 --> 02:06:45,679
seated by the uh the new multi pooly

2787
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:48,880
hybrid Imports so it the pollen is

2788
02:06:45,679 --> 02:06:52,199
everywhere and uh there there are no

2789
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:55,559
pure land races anybody who says so

2790
02:06:52,198 --> 02:06:58,000
it's they just don't really understand I

2791
02:06:55,559 --> 02:06:59,400
I totally agree and even this cona back

2792
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,039
here knows

2793
02:06:59,399 --> 02:07:03,679
about higher in the mountains you know

2794
02:07:02,039 --> 02:07:06,039
maybe is the best place that you're GNA

2795
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:08,399
find anything that res has no trouble

2796
02:07:06,039 --> 02:07:11,639
getting higher in the

2797
02:07:08,399 --> 02:07:13,879
mountains zero zero problem first time I

2798
02:07:11,639 --> 02:07:17,279
visited Morocco was

2799
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:19,800
1971 and they had only been

2800
02:07:17,279 --> 02:07:23,840
growing Keef because they were growing

2801
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:26,400
Keef until about 65 that's when they

2802
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:29,239
first grew

2803
02:07:26,399 --> 02:07:31,679
uh hea and they grounded up and made

2804
02:07:29,238 --> 02:07:35,519
hash out of it before that they were not

2805
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:38,440
making hash of Morocco it hashish is new

2806
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:40,679
to Morocco ke smoking is hundreds of

2807
02:07:38,439 --> 02:07:40,678
years

2808
02:07:42,679 --> 02:07:47,559
old and was it true that it was a

2809
02:07:45,279 --> 02:07:50,000
Nigerian guy who brought Lebanese

2810
02:07:47,559 --> 02:07:52,199
screening techniques to

2811
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:55,520
Morocco uh

2812
02:07:52,198 --> 02:08:01,078
that's the story that was told um me and

2813
02:07:55,520 --> 02:08:04,119
Rob from the family who was the big wazo

2814
02:08:01,078 --> 02:08:08,039
in uh the Riff they had been growing

2815
02:08:04,118 --> 02:08:10,118
more and longer uh than anybody else and

2816
02:08:08,039 --> 02:08:15,078
uh we talked to the grandfather and he

2817
02:08:10,118 --> 02:08:19,039
told us it was an Algerian black guy

2818
02:08:15,078 --> 02:08:22,000
Mustafa who who who brought the method

2819
02:08:19,039 --> 02:08:24,880
from Algeria and I don't know if was

2820
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:28,679
ever a big producer maybe he had seen it

2821
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:31,118
in Lebanon that I don't know but uh

2822
02:08:28,679 --> 02:08:33,840
these people were serious serious when

2823
02:08:31,118 --> 02:08:36,598
we were we were introduced to the

2824
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:40,078
younger parts of their family and they

2825
02:08:36,599 --> 02:08:42,639
were were helping us do some work there

2826
02:08:40,078 --> 02:08:45,319
and but before they would work with us

2827
02:08:42,639 --> 02:08:48,480
they wanted the grandfather to meet us

2828
02:08:45,319 --> 02:08:51,519
and we had to meet him and we had to be

2829
02:08:48,479 --> 02:08:52,879
approved and uh when we walked into the

2830
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:56,639
their their

2831
02:08:52,880 --> 02:09:00,159
home above the front door there was a

2832
02:08:56,639 --> 02:09:04,679
big giant male plant wrapped into a

2833
02:09:00,158 --> 02:09:09,198
circle and hung there like an

2834
02:09:04,679 --> 02:09:09,199
uh uh a Christmas

2835
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:16,319
wreath yep that's the other way to do it

2836
02:09:14,479 --> 02:09:18,638
is with your

2837
02:09:16,319 --> 02:09:22,238
hands Sor I didn't mean to interrupt you

2838
02:09:18,639 --> 02:09:25,159
Sam no problem

2839
02:09:22,238 --> 02:09:28,158
was that Charis in the

2840
02:09:25,158 --> 02:09:28,158
making

2841
02:09:28,399 --> 02:09:31,960
absolutely Milana

2842
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:39,800
Val our friend Kush Kirk um in southern

2843
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:42,559
Oregon has dedicated a few plants

2844
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:44,520
completely to making Charis um the last

2845
02:09:42,559 --> 02:09:46,760
couple years and it's been really

2846
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:49,840
awesome and it's a fun project and he's

2847
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:52,239
inspired other people to do that so I

2848
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:55,119
think that's a really ever checked out

2849
02:09:52,238 --> 02:09:57,359
what the yield is or does he do it from

2850
02:09:55,118 --> 02:10:00,439
living plants or does he do it from dry

2851
02:09:57,359 --> 02:10:02,960
plants from living just like normal like

2852
02:10:00,439 --> 02:10:05,719
he does it from living plants and uh you

2853
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:07,359
can you know ask him exactly what his

2854
02:10:05,719 --> 02:10:10,319
yields are they're really good you know

2855
02:10:07,359 --> 02:10:12,078
they're way better than the other you

2856
02:10:10,319 --> 02:10:14,039
know doing it in the Himalayas or

2857
02:10:12,078 --> 02:10:16,158
whatnot because the plants are have

2858
02:10:14,039 --> 02:10:18,039
larger crystals you know bigger crystals

2859
02:10:16,158 --> 02:10:22,198
and stuff but it's really beautiful hash

2860
02:10:18,039 --> 02:10:24,800
and it's traditional and um it's uh it's

2861
02:10:22,198 --> 02:10:24,799
so it's

2862
02:10:26,039 --> 02:10:31,639
different hey this is we I got to jump

2863

nada County anyway it's dry sift done

2872
02:10:54,198 --> 02:11:02,399
cold lightly pressed to make a uh a yeah

2873
02:11:00,198 --> 02:11:04,678
a nice little

2874

hand does it have the no heated no all

2880
02:11:22,439 --> 02:11:28,678
no water no nothing but screening and

2881
02:11:26,078 --> 02:11:31,279
Light press wait does it have the THC

2882
02:11:28,679 --> 02:11:31,279
level I'm

2883
02:11:31,319 --> 02:11:37,479
curious um

2884

yeah uh how about I it what it's got

2885
02:11:37,479 --> 02:11:45,839
here this is you said this is two grams

2886
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:50,639
two grams yeah so it's 9 50% two

2887
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:51,880
grams yeah 980 milligrams in a 2 G

2888
02:11:50,639 --> 02:11:54,118
Little P

2889
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:57,840
with a little gold leaf lightning strike

2890
02:11:54,118 --> 02:12:00,198
on it so that's like

2891
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:05,159
407 or

2892

02:12:10,039 --> 02:12:16,439
into price but yeah yeah it when when I

2896
02:12:13,319 --> 02:12:19,960
made dry sift that was

2897
02:12:16,439 --> 02:12:22,039
99.9% resin heads but about the highest

2898
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:25,840
I ever got was in the low

2899
02:12:22,039 --> 02:12:29,880
80s THC and that was from skunk number

2900
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:33,679
one cleaned up absolutely clean and uh

2901
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:34,840
it was uh almost like smoking honey oil

2902
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:38,118
it was

2903
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:40,000
amazing but didn't you prefer your 60%

2904
02:12:38,118 --> 02:12:42,719
Sam because I think that was well it's

2905
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:45,158
easier to smoke because when when you

2906
02:12:42,719 --> 02:12:48,198
smoke the really really really clean

2907
02:12:45,158 --> 02:12:50,799
stuff it wants to drip through screens I

2908
02:12:48,198 --> 02:12:53,558
mean it it was it it depends how you

2909
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:56,360
smoke if you smoke it in a vaporizer or

2910
02:12:53,559 --> 02:13:00,039
a glass pipe it's not a problem but if

2911
02:12:56,359 --> 02:13:02,920
you I I used to smoke in a roar bong

2912
02:13:00,039 --> 02:13:05,559
with the three really really fine

2913
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:08,480
screens on it I think you might remember

2914
02:13:05,559 --> 02:13:12,239
and if I put the

2915
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:16,439
99.9% on it and I put heat to it it

2916
02:13:12,238 --> 02:13:16,439
would leak right through all three

2917
02:13:17,399 --> 02:13:21,719
screens the guy who pardon the

2918
02:13:19,599 --> 02:13:24,800
interruption the fow who

2919
02:13:21,719 --> 02:13:28,800
handed me this at my request points out

2920
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:28,800
that in California to have it in on the

2921
02:13:29,639 --> 02:13:35,719
Shelf th000 milligrams in any package

2922
02:13:34,238 --> 02:13:38,638
that's why it's

2923
02:13:35,719 --> 02:13:41,359
980 okay but then what you could have

2924
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:43,359
done was I'm not saying you should but

2925
02:13:41,359 --> 02:13:46,000
you could have made one gram on the

2926
02:13:43,359 --> 02:13:49,279
package then 1,000 milligrams it would

2927
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:52,039
have been P THC I'm not I'm not saying

2928
02:13:49,279 --> 02:13:55,039
that's better because I don't find it is

2929
02:13:52,039 --> 02:13:57,519
I think you need the uh the full Pines

2930
02:13:55,039 --> 02:14:01,000
and everything flavor everything else

2931
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:03,520
because that that's way better than uh

2932
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:07,279
pure Crystal

2933
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:09,800
thca I I agree and uh part of why I

2934
02:14:07,279 --> 02:14:12,759
needed to jump in is it has started

2935
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:15,000
snowing here um and there was patches of

2936
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:18,199
blue sky but yeah it started snowing

2937
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:20,520
again and like I said uh the difference

2938
02:14:18,198 --> 02:14:23,039
in elevation between the town where

2939
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:27,559
there's electricity and internet and

2940
02:14:23,039 --> 02:14:32,719
where I live uh is uh 800 feet we live

2941
02:14:27,559 --> 02:14:35,440
at about a a th000 meters elevation

2942
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:39,760
3270 ft is what the title says on the

2943
02:14:35,439 --> 02:14:42,039
farm but uh yeah there was 5 feet on the

2944
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:44,119
ground Wednesday and today it's down to

2945
02:14:42,039 --> 02:14:48,000
about three feet but we're supposed to

2946
02:14:44,118 --> 02:14:49,920
get that much more again this week and I

2947
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:52,399
promised I would leave in time to get

2948
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:54,760
home safely so I'm I'm going to sign off

2949
02:14:52,399 --> 02:14:58,719
have such deep respect not only for this

2950
02:14:54,760 --> 02:15:00,599
group but uh Frenchie and Madame canoli

2951
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:02,920
I I do look forward to seeing the film

2952
02:15:00,599 --> 02:15:04,639
at some point soon I haven't my health

2953
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:06,520
has not allowed me to travel very much

2954
02:15:04,639 --> 02:15:08,440
in the last year or two since the film

2955
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:12,760
came out but

2956
02:15:08,439 --> 02:15:17,158
um uh I'm I I'm healing like many of us

2957
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:20,320
uh it's it's a process life uh and so

2958

yeah forward to the next time maybe sh

2967
02:15:44,039 --> 02:15:48,439
for now yeah CH sweet

2968
02:15:49,399 --> 02:15:54,799
leave I I app appreci that little

2969
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:57,599
conversation about the dry sift because

2970
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:59,239
it it reminded me that you know this was

2971
02:15:57,599 --> 02:16:00,920
um one of the some of the last

2972
02:15:59,238 --> 02:16:04,158
conversations that I was having with

2973
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:06,800
Frenchie was about um you know because

2974
02:16:04,158 --> 02:16:09,198
he really wanted to have that that

2975
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:13,000
connection to the farm and try to figure

2976
02:16:09,198 --> 02:16:15,039
out how to do that also commercially and

2977
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:18,198
and to be able to put something into the

2978
02:16:15,039 --> 02:16:21,479
California market and he he was talking

2979
02:16:18,198 --> 02:16:25,439
about you know the regulations do ow for

2980
02:16:21,479 --> 02:16:27,638
what they call ke and we cannot do ice

2981
02:16:25,439 --> 02:16:30,238
waterer hash on the farm without you

2982
02:16:27,639 --> 02:16:31,960
know a whole rigamaroo of of Licensing

2983
02:16:30,238 --> 02:16:36,119
even though it's nonvolatile and so he

2984
02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:39,558
was talking about um you know working on

2985
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:42,359
kind of and and Lena and Belle probably

2986
02:16:39,558 --> 02:16:43,920
could fill in the gaps on on where where

2987
02:16:42,359 --> 02:16:45,679
he was going with his thought but he was

2988
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:47,359
like wow we should be doing dry seaing

2989
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:49,719
on the farm and then we can press it and

2990
02:16:47,359 --> 02:16:51,679
we can have put out a packaged product

2991
02:16:49,718 --> 02:16:53,598
that would actually you know come

2992
02:16:51,679 --> 02:16:57,200
straight from the farm and have never

2993
02:16:53,599 --> 02:17:00,398
had to you know be frozen or or travel

2994
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:02,240
through the distribution chain and um so

2995
02:17:00,398 --> 02:17:03,519
it it's neat to see that somebody I

2996
02:17:02,239 --> 02:17:06,359
don't know if that was made in a

2997
02:17:03,519 --> 02:17:08,079
facility or on site by a farm but um

2998
02:17:06,359 --> 02:17:11,800
that's cool to see I've not seen that in

2999
02:17:08,079 --> 02:17:11,799
the commercial Market

3000
02:17:14,359 --> 02:17:18,719
before one of the Reas they should bring

3001
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:21,599
it back to dry sift sorry Sam I didn't

3002
02:17:18,718 --> 02:17:25,318
mean to cut you off but water is is very

3003
02:17:21,599 --> 02:17:27,799
difficult um just you know like kind of

3004
02:17:25,318 --> 02:17:31,159
the whole fluid Dynamic element behind

3005
02:17:27,799 --> 02:17:34,558
it it's expensive to chill water pumps

3006
02:17:31,159 --> 02:17:39,280
are expensive to have water um honestly

3007
02:17:34,558 --> 02:17:41,239
dry sift is is uh a lot more conducive

3008
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:43,000
really environmentally if if if you

3009
02:17:41,239 --> 02:17:46,519
really think about

3010
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:49,599
it the the main thing about dry sift is

3011
02:17:46,519 --> 02:17:53,200
the yield is is quite low that you just

3012
02:17:49,599 --> 02:17:56,000
get you know one two 3% yield from the

3013
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:57,559
best of the best of the best per kilo

3014
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:01,359
you know that's a

3015
02:17:57,558 --> 02:18:05,959
killer and uh but what you can do is if

3016
02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:08,800
you have uh a laboratory facility after

3017
02:18:05,959 --> 02:18:10,959
you dry shift it theoretically you could

3018
02:18:08,799 --> 02:18:13,558
take the rest of the material and do

3019
02:18:10,959 --> 02:18:17,119
some sort of an extract either an

3020
02:18:13,558 --> 02:18:20,438
alcohol extract or a water extract or

3021
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:22,840
whatever to try to get more because uh

3022
02:18:20,439 --> 02:18:26,239
with with dry sifting you're throwing

3023
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:29,120
away 90% of the THC you know that's just

3024
02:18:26,239 --> 02:18:32,558
the way it goes you you dry sifting

3025
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:34,519
yields are low water sifting is higher

3026
02:18:32,558 --> 02:18:36,518
and of course solvent extraction gets

3027
02:18:34,519 --> 02:18:38,719
almost

3028
02:18:36,519 --> 02:18:41,679
everything yeah we were trying to figure

3029
02:18:38,718 --> 02:18:44,759
out how to do it at scale which is the

3030
02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:47,679
difficult part and producing quality at

3031
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:50,840
scale but the goal was to be as close to

3032
02:18:47,679 --> 02:18:53,519
the farmer as possible because the less

3033
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:55,519
people who manhandle your product the

3034
02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:57,800
better um product you're going to have

3035
02:18:55,519 --> 02:18:59,519
on the shelves and we thought we could

3036
02:18:57,799 --> 02:19:02,358
do something and like work through the

3037
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:05,000
Maze of Bureau but it turned out to be a

3038
02:19:02,359 --> 02:19:07,519
lot more difficult than we originally

3039
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:09,599
thought it definitely is there's there's

3040
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:11,519
there's a number of people I mean Cry

3041
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:13,398
came out with their liquid nitrogen unit

3042
02:19:11,519 --> 02:19:14,880
I've never really seen it used but I

3043
02:19:13,398 --> 02:19:17,558
have another friend who's been working

3044
02:19:14,879 --> 02:19:20,199
on a very similar unit that will

3045
02:19:17,558 --> 02:19:22,518
basically go and reduce biomass from the

3046
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:24,880
field direct can be right off fresh

3047
02:19:22,519 --> 02:19:28,159
plants it can reduce the you know the

3048
02:19:24,879 --> 02:19:30,199
plant matter into just basically sift

3049
02:19:28,159 --> 02:19:31,920
and then that sift can then be taken it

3050
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:34,000
would have to be dried because if it's

3051
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:36,719
off of a fresh plant the wax membrane is

3052
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:38,679
going to hold some moisture um so it is

3053
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:40,678
not really dry sift in that sense it's

3054
02:19:38,679 --> 02:19:42,760
fresh sift but then being able to use

3055
02:19:40,679 --> 02:19:45,120
you know a static uh technique or

3056
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:46,920
something to then clean up the sift I

3057
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:51,079
think it'll happen I think we will see

3058
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:54,478
the day where we can um you know scale

3059
02:19:51,079 --> 02:19:56,318
uh sifting to a to a larger scale but uh

3060
02:19:54,478 --> 02:19:58,599
it's certainly not easy and it's very

3061
02:19:56,318 --> 02:20:02,000
counterintuitive the more you try to get

3062
02:19:58,600 --> 02:20:04,079
with screen that's one of the reasons

3063
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:08,000
that's one of the reasons Marcus that we

3064
02:20:04,079 --> 02:20:10,680
always try to dry it for a couple weeks

3065
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:13,799
cure it for a couple of months and so we

3066
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:16,239
had raisins rather than grapes you know

3067
02:20:13,799 --> 02:20:19,398
reduce that moisture content so you can

3068
02:20:16,239 --> 02:20:22,239
work with the resin uh but I know why

3069
02:20:19,398 --> 02:20:26,119
people like you know fresh live resins

3070
02:20:22,239 --> 02:20:30,398
because they're definitely got more

3071
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:32,560
turps I would just to is hey

3072
02:20:30,398 --> 02:20:35,119
Selena

3073
02:20:32,559 --> 02:20:37,559
Selena sorry I didn't mean to interrupt

3074
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:40,720
I was like oh my God that's Selena it's

3075

good to see you guys um we have this

3076
02:20:40,719 --> 02:20:46,398
incredible dry sift here from Ki and he

3077
02:20:44,079 --> 02:20:48,439
can explain it um it's probably some of

3078
02:20:46,398 --> 02:20:51,039
the most amazing dry sift you'll find in

3079
02:20:48,439 --> 02:20:52,720
Barcelona it's absolutely like

3080
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:55,760
incredibly

3081
02:20:52,719 --> 02:20:59,119
flavored and um yeah I mean they are

3082
02:20:55,760 --> 02:21:02,439
producing like some really incredible

3083
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:06,359
dry sift material here this is static

3084
02:21:02,439 --> 02:21:09,720
static uh static clean and uh zti by

3085
02:21:06,359 --> 02:21:12,840
cush Ms right yeah buban inspired me for

3086
02:21:09,719 --> 02:21:14,719
a long time know he's been following

3087
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:17,079
bubble man since

3088
02:21:14,719 --> 02:21:19,840
2005 and everything that's been coming

3089
02:21:17,079 --> 02:21:21,680
out and just you're the original

3090
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:24,520
inspiration brother and here's this

3091
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:27,040
amazing product being put out

3092
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:30,600
organically from the local community

3093
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:32,800
here in a smoking club which it's it's

3094
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:35,800
kind of illegal out there but it's legal

3095
02:21:32,799 --> 02:21:37,159
in here so it really is kind of an

3096
02:21:35,799 --> 02:21:38,519
embodiment of everything that we're

3097
02:21:37,159 --> 02:21:41,600
talking about here did you have

3098
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:45,600
something say a ask him what is the

3099
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:47,760
yield of Clean dry sift where you get it

3100
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:50,000
cleaned up as much as you can with

3101
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:54,079
static because that's I know more than

3102
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:57,280
90% resin heads so what's your yield

3103
02:21:54,079 --> 02:21:57,280
from a kilo of

3104
02:21:59,239 --> 02:22:05,559
cannabis we you

3105
02:22:01,799 --> 02:22:08,119
know static one% and

3106
02:22:05,559 --> 02:22:11,719
static okay yeah basically what you're

3107
02:22:08,120 --> 02:22:16,680
saying you know one to two% one or two%

3108
02:22:11,719 --> 02:22:19,840
okay well I keep for a miracle but dude

3109
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:21,600
I mean the flavor on this is literally

3110
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:23,719
like

3111
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:27,840
I hope to be smoking it in a couple of

3112
02:22:23,719 --> 02:22:30,239
days yeah give us the wait to you

3113
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:33,359

3114
02:22:30,239 --> 02:22:35,079
on yeah definitely some of the most

3115
02:22:33,359 --> 02:22:37,159
beautiful

3116
02:22:35,079 --> 02:22:40,920
resinous you know

3117
02:22:37,159 --> 02:22:45,959
odoric uh stuff on the menu has been the

3118
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:48,359
organic dry sift pressed hash here it's

3119
02:22:45,959 --> 02:22:50,079
just so incredibly beautiful and then

3120
02:22:48,359 --> 02:22:52,800
you have the Aged hashes which you're

3121
02:22:50,079 --> 02:22:54,559
just whole other experience for sure so

3122
02:22:52,799 --> 02:22:56,519
I actually can't say which one is my

3123
02:22:54,559 --> 02:22:59,478
favorite I take it

3124
02:22:56,520 --> 02:23:02,760
back they're all they're all

3125
02:22:59,478 --> 02:23:06,519
good a lot depends on what the plant

3126
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:06,520
used to make the material

3127
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:12,799
was and how you grew it there's a lot of

3128
02:23:10,159 --> 02:23:15,039
sought after hash cultivars in this area

3129
02:23:12,799 --> 02:23:17,519
too and it's really cool to see what

3130
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:19,760
people have chosen here you know uh some

3131
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:22,640
of it's from California but a lot of it

3132
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:24,439
also is just hunted and pheno hunted and

3133
02:23:22,639 --> 02:23:26,840
created here and that's the funnest

3134
02:23:24,439 --> 02:23:30,359
thing about traveling is seeing the

3135
02:23:26,840 --> 02:23:32,799
different flavors and techniques used

3136
02:23:30,359 --> 02:23:34,960
and uh it's also fun seeing how

3137
02:23:32,799 --> 02:23:37,559
different people have been inspired by

3138
02:23:34,959 --> 02:23:40,199
one another uh to make these you know

3139
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:44,680
really phenomenal products for people as

3140
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:44,680
the web gets wider The Weave gets

3141
02:23:46,079 --> 02:23:51,559
tighter oh yeah time for another dab

3142
02:23:57,079 --> 02:24:04,840
well um Frenchie was uh just super

3143
02:24:00,799 --> 02:24:07,278
important in the sense of uh I think

3144
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:09,359
passion more than anything like you can

3145
02:24:07,279 --> 02:24:13,399
talk about specifics and different hash

3146
02:24:09,359 --> 02:24:16,760
and dry sift or age but really it was

3147
02:24:13,398 --> 02:24:19,799
ultimately the attraction of his passion

3148
02:24:16,760 --> 02:24:21,719
I think that really is the really spirit

3149
02:24:19,799 --> 02:24:24,239
that really it's like the spirit that

3150
02:24:21,719 --> 02:24:26,398
enters it you know it's you called it

3151
02:24:24,239 --> 02:24:28,760
Josh he's he's a

3152
02:24:26,398 --> 02:24:32,478
pasen there you

3153
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:35,719
go it's so cool that passion rhymes with

3154
02:24:32,478 --> 02:24:38,879
hasion it's just like it just embodies

3155
02:24:35,719 --> 02:24:41,639
him 110% because now I think about

3156
02:24:38,879 --> 02:24:43,759
passion and I think of passion and then

3157
02:24:41,639 --> 02:24:46,159
I think of Frenchie it's just what

3158
02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:46,159
happens

3159
02:24:46,680 --> 02:24:53,520
now I'm gonna call him a Pas from now on

3160
02:24:50,478 --> 02:24:58,000
a new word created we we need to do Mark

3161
02:24:53,520 --> 02:25:01,079
is we we need to next time we discover a

3162
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:03,359
new uh turpine we can name it after

3163
02:25:01,079 --> 02:25:05,520
Frenchie and call it

3164
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:07,399
Frenching right there there's actually

3165
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:09,439
there there's what there's fench all

3166
02:25:07,398 --> 02:25:12,959
that's close to Frenching but right

3167
02:25:09,439 --> 02:25:16,520
there's already French all

3168
02:25:12,959 --> 02:25:20,879
well fench all benaw yeah

3169

all these new compounds that we don't

3171
02:25:23,359 --> 02:25:28,000
know yet but yeah I mean isn't it it's

3172
02:25:25,959 --> 02:25:31,799
so cool that you know again we live in

3173
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:36,600
this great page of information there's

3174

to you know write Kimberly I mean

3179
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:53,559
there's so much content and this movie

3180
02:25:51,159 --> 02:25:55,600
I'm sure will maybe give us kind of like

3181
02:25:53,559 --> 02:25:59,159
the the

3182
02:25:55,600 --> 02:26:01,840
backstage view of of his life and his p

3183
02:25:59,159 --> 02:26:03,680
i what are we gonna see in the movie

3184
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:07,439
that those of us who mostly know

3185
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:08,840
Frenchie from just his online Persona

3186
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:12,279
what are we goingon to see in the movie

3187
02:26:08,840 --> 02:26:16,318
that we wouldn't necessarily know from

3188
02:26:12,279 --> 02:26:16,319
just seeing stuff on YouTube and

3189
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:22,520
stuff you're muted

3190
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:25,559
you did she know

3191
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:27,680
that sorry about that um yeah I was

3192
02:26:25,559 --> 02:26:29,359
trying to be respectful when the rest of

3193
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:31,479
you were talking I was gonna say his his

3194
02:26:29,359 --> 02:26:34,840
love for the farmer you know just that's

3195
02:26:31,478 --> 02:26:37,840
really gonna um come true so so

3196
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:37,840
clearly

3197
02:26:38,359 --> 02:26:45,239
um um Kimberly since we're on the topic

3198
02:26:41,719 --> 02:26:47,639
would you mind explaining to what like

3199
02:26:45,239 --> 02:26:49,239
exactly how the live stream is going to

3200
02:26:47,639 --> 02:26:52,199
go down because I've had a couple

3201
02:26:49,239 --> 02:26:53,520
questions people ask me you know how you

3202
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:55,439
know how that's going to how they're

3203
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:57,560
going to be able to view that where the

3204
02:26:55,439 --> 02:27:01,639
multiple places are that's going to be

3205
02:26:57,559 --> 02:27:04,478
live streaming it so the idea is um we

3206
02:27:01,639 --> 02:27:07,119
want to have a worldwide celebration of

3207
02:27:04,478 --> 02:27:09,278
the film to just create a bunch of noise

3208
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:11,600
and to have an opportunity to come

3209
02:27:09,279 --> 02:27:12,560
together after you've all seen the film

3210
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:15,159
on the

3211
02:27:12,559 --> 02:27:18,879
29th um so we're planning three

3212
02:27:15,159 --> 02:27:21,559
screenings each would be at 700 p.m in

3213
02:27:18,879 --> 02:27:25,119
the local time so so first in Europe at

3214
02:27:21,559 --> 02:27:27,359
7 pm the film is 90 minutes then after

3215
02:27:25,120 --> 02:27:29,479
the film we want to open up a live

3216
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:31,559
stream like this I'll be using a

3217
02:27:29,478 --> 02:27:34,599
platform called restream that'll have

3218
02:27:31,559 --> 02:27:37,159
the same kind of living room environment

3219
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:39,600
and then that's going to stream to our

3220
02:27:37,159 --> 02:27:42,398
Instagram our Facebook our YouTube and

3221
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:44,880
our LinkedIn simultaneously so people

3222
02:27:42,398 --> 02:27:47,318
don't have to sign up for a new platform

3223
02:27:44,879 --> 02:27:50,358
they can just log on to whatever their

3224
02:27:47,318 --> 02:27:53,639
preferred platform is and they'll be

3225
02:27:50,359 --> 02:27:55,760
able to access it uh there um and so

3226
02:27:53,639 --> 02:27:58,599
then we'll do the same thing again East

3227
02:27:55,760 --> 02:28:00,760
Coast time at 7 and then you know so

3228
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:04,359
starting the live stream at 8:30 after

3229
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:06,159
the film and then West Coast times so

3230
02:28:04,359 --> 02:28:08,239
you could kind of depend on what your

3231
02:28:06,159 --> 02:28:09,879
schedule is if you're free in the

3232
02:28:08,239 --> 02:28:11,719
afternoon and you want to hang out when

3233
02:28:09,879 --> 02:28:13,920
we do it in Europe you're welcome to

3234
02:28:11,719 --> 02:28:16,119
join for Europe if you want to come for

3235
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:18,279
East Coast time welcome to come for East

3236
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:21,399
Coast time and then you know we'll have

3237
02:28:18,279 --> 02:28:25,600
that ultimate one on the west W coast

3238
02:28:21,398 --> 02:28:27,719
and people are creating um uh ticketed

3239
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:29,720
events in some of the major cities and

3240
02:28:27,719 --> 02:28:33,438
I've got that information on the

3241
02:28:29,719 --> 02:28:35,159
Frenchie dreams of website um but also

3242
02:28:33,439 --> 02:28:37,200
people are going to be doing like their

3243
02:28:35,159 --> 02:28:39,200
like ien was saying you know just having

3244
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:41,200
your family and friends together to

3245
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:43,479
watch it in your living room and you

3246
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:46,159
know with your favorite smoking uh

3247
02:28:43,478 --> 02:28:48,398
device um so I'm hoping all of you will

3248
02:28:46,159 --> 02:28:50,719
join us afterwards in the live stream

3249
02:28:48,398 --> 02:28:53,278
and that some of you will join be in

3250
02:28:50,719 --> 02:28:56,239
this kind of living room environment and

3251
02:28:53,279 --> 02:28:58,640
we can talk about the film we can talk

3252
02:28:56,239 --> 02:29:02,478
about what you're smoking I hope a lot

3253
02:28:58,639 --> 02:29:04,519
of people will have a um a hookah so

3254
02:29:02,478 --> 02:29:06,879
that we can virtually pass the hookah to

3255
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:09,960
each other because that was Frenchie's

3256
02:29:06,879 --> 02:29:12,959
kind of preferred methodology to get a

3257
02:29:09,959 --> 02:29:15,879
bunch of people together and smoke you

3258
02:29:12,959 --> 02:29:19,079
know the hashish if you put the hashish

3259
02:29:15,879 --> 02:29:22,519
and the quazar shisha head you know the

3260
02:29:19,079 --> 02:29:25,279
low temperature just Vapes the material

3261
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:29,120
forever so great way to have a a party

3262
02:29:25,279 --> 02:29:33,200
and um have hashish to smoke forever I

3263
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:36,600
want to do some test um uh events before

3264
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:38,319
then so I'm hoping bill you and I can uh

3265
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:40,760
break out the hookah and show people how

3266
02:29:38,318 --> 02:29:43,439
to set up their hookah for smoking with

3267
02:29:40,760 --> 02:29:46,639
hashish you can also smoke flour in it

3268
02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:48,279
if you prefer to smoke flower um just

3269
02:29:46,639 --> 02:29:51,920
thought that would be a fun way for us

3270
02:29:48,279 --> 02:29:54,040
all to kind of be United in uh in this

3271
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:58,159
event and this little celebration of the

3272
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:58,160
film on the 29th on April

3273
02:29:59,398 --> 02:30:03,719
29th awesome Kimberly thank you for

3274
02:30:01,639 --> 02:30:05,358
sharing that and uh we'll put it in the

3275
02:30:03,719 --> 02:30:07,318
link as well and I'm sure there'll be

3276
02:30:05,359 --> 02:30:10,520
some groups out here in Vancouver that

3277
02:30:07,318 --> 02:30:12,119
we'll do some live uh streamings of the

3278
02:30:10,520 --> 02:30:15,239
hopefully we'll get book club actually

3279
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:18,600
there's a really cool uh venue here in

3280
02:30:15,239 --> 02:30:20,279
um Vancouver that does um a thing called

3281
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:22,520
book club and it's just basically place

3282
02:30:20,279 --> 02:30:25,079
for people from the Cannabis Community

3283
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:27,600
to gather and actually like you said

3284
02:30:25,079 --> 02:30:29,200
earlier um be able to have conversations

3285
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:31,559
and dialogue I think it's one of the

3286
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:34,040
last most important things missing right

3287
02:30:31,559 --> 02:30:35,359
now from Cannabis and Belle mentioned it

3288
02:30:34,040 --> 02:30:37,120
earlier about getting together and

3289
02:30:35,359 --> 02:30:40,239
smoking it doesn't necessarily have to

3290
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:41,920
be smoking um it can just be consuming

3291
02:30:40,239 --> 02:30:44,159
but we need to be able to get together

3292
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:45,680
and have Gatherings and be able to have

3293
02:30:44,159 --> 02:30:48,478
these conversations and I've mentioned

3294
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:50,279
it before the way when bars became a

3295
02:30:48,478 --> 02:30:52,239
thing pubs with alcohol all the

3296
02:30:50,279 --> 02:30:54,159
workingclass people having these drinks

3297
02:30:52,239 --> 02:30:57,039
after work and those conversations would

3298
02:30:54,159 --> 02:30:59,600
shape the world eventually we would get

3299
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:01,640
coffee H or tea houses next more of an

3300
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:03,520
intellectual group they would gather and

3301
02:31:01,639 --> 02:31:05,760
drink their tea and their conversations

3302
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:07,880
would shape the world uh and it happened

3303
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:09,600
as well with coffee and it's going to

3304
02:31:07,879 --> 02:31:11,358
happen with cannabis as well and it's

3305
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:13,159
the one thing they seem to be holding

3306
02:31:11,359 --> 02:31:15,720
back from us even in Canada Federal

3307
02:31:13,159 --> 02:31:17,318
legalization big Whoopi we don't even

3308
02:31:15,719 --> 02:31:21,119
aren't even allowed to have vapor

3309
02:31:17,318 --> 02:31:23,519
lounges so book club is a private club

3310
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:26,720
it allows us to gather uh they charge a

3311
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:29,279
very small fee I'll talk to adalo and

3312
02:31:26,719 --> 02:31:32,239
axel and John the founders of book club

3313
02:31:29,279 --> 02:31:36,159
