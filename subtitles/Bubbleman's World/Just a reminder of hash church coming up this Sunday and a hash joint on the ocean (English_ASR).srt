1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,160
I'm uh pretty relaxed here out on the

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,599
house sound chilling on the boat but I

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,080
wanted to uh give you guys a mention

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,080
that we're going to be doing hash church

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,679
again uh this Sunday I thought it would

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,839
be a good idea to let everyone know in

8
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,519
advance I'm hoping on getting Dr David

9
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,320
Allen to come in and chat with us I

10
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:19,759
spoke with him a little bit today about

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,760
some very interesting things that I'll

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,880
leave to him if he comes in on Sunday um

13
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,519
I've invited Horatio back I've invited

14
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:30,320
Johnny B in d420 K and I've actually

15
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,839
invited uh Tony verzura from uh United

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,679
cannabis and from River Rock Wellness

17
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,840
Center he hasn't said whether he's going

18
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,359
to be able to do it but he's definitely

19
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,559
going to make an attempt so that's cool

20
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,119
too and I figured while I had you guys

21
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,159
here on the

22
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:45,839
boat we would smoke a pure hash joint

23
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:48,439
because I know it's dark I'm back lit by

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,039
the sun I just figured I'd share a

25
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:54,479
beautiful hash joint with the bubble

26
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,480
man's world audience so let's do it

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
up

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,600
a little bit different than lighting

29
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,000
your everyday joint because you got a

30
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,079
big hollow space when you're sucking in

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,359
that heat off the Cherry it's

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,399
substantial you kind of want to put your

33
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,159
teeth in in in the way cuz the air that

34
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,640
you suck through the tube is extremely

35
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,359
hot that's why I had to light it three

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,239
or four times but uh that's a gram of

37
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,599
hash right there and it'll probably burn

38
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,399
for 15 to 20 minutes judging by my last

39
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,000
video where I smoked a pure hash joint

40
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,118
to the uh right down to the roach and

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,920
then finished that off in the Swiss perk

42
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,319
I think that was about 20 minutes

43
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,280
luckily I have a couple of friends with

44
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,959
me on the boat today one holding the

45
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,680
phone and one sitting just out of the

46
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:46,798
camera angle and they're they're going

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,399
to be enjoying it with me so remember

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,880
