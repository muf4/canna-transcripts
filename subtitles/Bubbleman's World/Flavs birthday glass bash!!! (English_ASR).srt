actually quite Shar you could impale

92
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,360
someone quite quickly and that's the dry

93
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,359
ball right

94
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:51,198
there awesome all right well let's get

95
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:54,719
some hash out and start ripping these

96
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,080
bad boys d nails plugged into the Fab

97
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,880
yep the clear excellent the rest we got

98
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:01,879
beline I brought a little bit of uh dry

99
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,959
sift couple of different varieties that

100
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:07,038
I made have some hash we have some all

101
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:10,159
sorts of open think this is John stuff

102
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,839
here yep Jon's got the MK uh the MK

103

104
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,439
frozen super sick quality you guys have

105
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:17,638
seen that on the channel already so yeah

106
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,240
I guess we'll invite the rest of the

107
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,240
guys in here and start hitting this like

108
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,680
it's going out of uh style it's a good

109
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,680
idea very good idea I think so I think

110
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,918
so too all right what to

111
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,680
hit so what I mean the easiest start

112
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,399
would be obviously the one with the bows

113
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,160
so we're not dabbing except for the nail

114
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,599
we don't have a torch on the table so

115
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,240
you need a torch I have one right here

Dabber probably need a couple of

120
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,560
these like it was

121
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:57,240
1999 evolution of the culture it is
