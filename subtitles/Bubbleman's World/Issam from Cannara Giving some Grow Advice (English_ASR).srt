1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,799
I've got a question for Assam. We've got

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,559
a passionate audience here at Hash

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,960
Church that's uh paying attention right

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,279
now. What's one piece of advice you'd

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,120
give to cultivators big or small who

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,160
want to use nutrients to elevate their

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,519
game inspired by what Canera is doing? I

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,920
think you've kind of answered this

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,160
question, but I wanted to be specific

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,279
because I want to make a nice clip of it

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:30,160
after the show is over. Yeah. So, as I

12
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:33,439
mentioned, you hear me guys? Absolutely.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,359
True. So yeah, as I mentioned earlier, I

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,039
think the main two criterias when

15
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,039
talking about nutrients and its

16
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:43,280
correlation with plants is to look at

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:45,600
the uh the gaining weight as referring

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,039
to the human nutrition and the the

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,520
quality and quantity of excrements,

20
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,760
right? Unfortunately in in in cannabis,

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,160
we can't look at the gain of in in

22
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,558
weight because that's the yield. And uh

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:02,159
if we wait to look at that, it's too

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:05,399
late, right? Uh so the main criteria is

25
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:09,679
the quality and quantity of runoff we

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,439
generate. Uh so that makes the the uh in

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,760
the substrate the main aspect to assess

28
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:17,199
if we are fitting well our plants or

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,520
not. Right? So in in term of quantity uh

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,040
I think we better we we we have to

31
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:26,158
target a 10 to 20% runoff uh during the

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,840
vegetative uh watering and no more than

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,759
15%

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,439
in in in the generative uh in term of DC

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,239
and this is the according to my

36
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,399
experience I mean it's it's not nothing

37
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,438
in the book but it's my own experience

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,240
my own point of view is unlike uh other

39
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,639
substrates like soil and cocoa uh when

40
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,519
growing your rock wall I recommend

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,200
monitoring the EC uh at the root zone

42
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:55,840
and not at the uh the runoff level uh

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,280
for better accuracy uh because it's

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,520
different theuh it's inert the the the

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,399
rock wall it doesn't have the same

46
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,519
criteria as the cocoa or or the soil. So

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,598
that's why this may maybe have an an

48
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,239
additional cost like you have to invest

49
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:16,079
in sensors that are able to give you

50
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,800
real time readings of the uh EC at the

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,000
root zone but I guarantee that the ROI

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,800
is is is evident there especially for

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,680
large large scale growers. Uh the other

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,400
point is the uh weekly weekly leaf

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,319
analysis. It's a it's a I mean it's a

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
good

57
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:37,598
practice but I I recommend not making

58
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,719
drastic change uh based on the results

59
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:43,679
of these analysis. The reason is that

60
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:46,479
the standard nutrient branch that labs

61
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,879
the labs are are using as a reference

62
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,079
are very general and they are not

63
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:54,479
genetic specific and I think they need

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,560
it needs further studies to be specific

65
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,479
to group

66
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,159
of because you get your report for you

67
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,439
send samples leave samples you get a

68
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,479
report oh you have you're overfeeding on

69
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,239
nitrogen or calcium magnesium but what

70
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,799
is the reference what is your your

71
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,319
standard curve in in there it's are we

72
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,000
taking a general one for all the

73
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,639
genetics but we know they don't behave

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,360
all the same so that's why I mean I

75
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,878
would take just the general uh when it

76
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,680
turns to red phytotoxicity you have to

77
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:29,280
intervene and reduce your uh your

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,840
nutrient concentration but don't we

79
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,560
shouldn't go in the into the the details

80
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,560
and and and do drastic changes just

81
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,039
based on the uh leaf analysis

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,598
Well, it's good advice. Uh doing it at

83
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,158
the root zone and not the runoff. That's

84
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,878
uh geez, if your levels are high at

85
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:52,798
runoff, then uh it's going to be much

86
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,798
worse right on the plant.
