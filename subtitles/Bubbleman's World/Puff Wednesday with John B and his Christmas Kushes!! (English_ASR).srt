00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:50,759
uh with the bubble bag lights and with

37
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:53,639
some of John's 99% gland head dry sift

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,560
where to start John where to start well

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,079
let's breaking the sublimator I'm really

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,560
stoked to Breaking the sublimator it's

41
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:00,158
been on for about a half an hour now

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,039
should we make sure that the timer still

43
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,280
good yeah she's good okay so we're good

44
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,920
and we're going to start with number two

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,280
number two so we photographed all these

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,199
nuggets a little earlier I'll be

47
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,439
inserting them into the video so as we

48
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,598
pull out a nugget as we pull out a

49
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:18,400
little p oh yeah this is uh jeez look at

50
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,598
that it's reminiscent of of almost

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,080
cookies just this particular Bud that he

52
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,598
pulled out cuz it's it's a little bit of

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,239
a smaller lower Branch Bud they're just

54
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:31,119
completely coated in a velvety

55
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:34,080
Valour turpine rich

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,319
gland heads I can't oh that's that's a

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,440
real nice exotic cush smell which number

58
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:43,639
is this number two so number

59
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,079
two jeez there's something in there

60
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:47,439
excellent why don't you grind that up

61
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,879
and let's uh let's sublimate so the

62
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,318
sublimator represented most excellently

63
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:55,639
this year at the Cannabis Cup and Rico

64
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,199
and Al really busted it out they um they

65
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,679
were all over Amsterdam they were at the

66
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,799
greenhouse on the harer stri

67
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,400
as well as sometimes at the greenhouse

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,360
uh off the dam Strat uh they had the

69
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,439
sublimator going they were sharing it

70
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,680
with anyone that was willing to come and

71
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,439
try and we had a Kind of a Funny

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,439
experience didn't we with the kids from

73
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,400
with the the two girls from Costa Rica

74
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,359
yeah we thought we were being nice but

75
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,039
we absolutely moonshine Haze annihilated

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,200
these uh two girls and they ended up

77
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,239
going out and standing out by the canal

78
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,560
for a good 20 minutes at least 20

79
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,920
minutes yeah they never came back in so

80
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
that wasn't Our intention we don't

81
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,679
really look forward to doing that I I

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,479
thought we were just being gentle but

83
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,480
the sublimator is

84
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:43,039
truly a Beyond vaporization unit it's

85
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:46,238
not just your everyday unit I've I'm

86
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,000
really happy um to know that the

87
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,039
sublimator in the denail for instance

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
you see them side by side here they

89
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,318
aren't really a comparable product the

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,840
denail is a sort of a

91
00:03:54,318 --> 00:04:00,518
standalone uh used with any one of your

92
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,680
bongs 14 or 18 uh dabbing full melts or

93
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,000
oil on top of the nail it's not really a

94
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,560
unit that you're going to be using for

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,959
cannabis so in my

96
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,920
opinion I love both of these units

97
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,438
equally they're different you know this

98
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,119
one does what it does this one of course

99
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:17,918
is a is a completely different unit the

100
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:21,239
sublimator is going to give us um rips

101
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,719
of herb of hash and of oil solventless

102
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,439
oil that we pull out of the down stem

103
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,840
whereas the Dil is is a completely

104
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,319
different unit really just great for the

105
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,879
ease and the not having to a be line

106
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,478
constantly not having to uh find a

107
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,199
lighter the dils just constantly on and

108
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:38,478
uh I really like that you cleaning that

109
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,560
out a little

110
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:44,478
bit yeah did you get a little hit I got

111
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,478
a nice H nice well it's been a while

112
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,120
since we've had our sublimator uh mine

113
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,478
went on the fritz a while ago I have the

114
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,120
older version this is of course the

115
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:52,839
newer version that comes with the timer

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,079
and I believe it's a 70 watt instead of

117
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,560
a 50 WT and it's titanium instead of St

118
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,198
steel so it's it's it's a much better

119
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,680
unit

120
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:07,160
um you can see nice big Smoky rips even

121
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,959
from Cannabis Vapor um little bit of you

122
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,199
know this my unit hasn't been used in a

123
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,638
while so it'll just do have it's a

124
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:17,319
little bit stuck right there I could

125
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:21,199
probably wipe that clean and make it a

126
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:24,038
little bit easier but yeah wipe quickly

127
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,080
generally that's little need a little

128
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:30,000
wipes I'm not sure if I have wipes but I

129
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:32,198
will find a a a an asate for to dump

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,879
your used Urban oh that's actually a

131
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:38,000
great idea yeah we're going to be

132
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,879
filling that thing up so here you go

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,959
there's a little rure asay from Martin

134
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,639
nice

135
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,638
gift passed on over the

136
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,680
years even this one as

137
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,918
well so you can definitely see the

138
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,319
difference here of the color one's burnt

139
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:54,079
one's not we can see the difference

140
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,360
Brown this all nice still has the

141
00:05:54,079 --> 00:06:00,079
purpley Fall colors just

142
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,759
beautiful oo well hook me up I'm down

143
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,879
for a sublimator hit so we're going to

144
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,400
do we're going to hit all five of John's

145
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,918
flavors we're going to hit all of these

146
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,799
hashes we're going to do it through a

147
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,240
variety of ways sublimating denailing

148
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,800
we're even going to hit the Swiss perk

149
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,759
with the beine just to show that we love

150
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,240
all the varieties of smoking it's puff

151
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,960
Wednesday it's puff Wednesday and we're

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,160
going to puff so am I loaded up there

153
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,159
John there you go

154
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,399
dude

155
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:36,638
all right my first sublimator hit in

156
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:39,000
quite a while I guess since Amsterdam I

157
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,160
hit it quite a few times

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,399
there absolutely

159
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,199
wonderful essence of the herb just

160
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,198
perfect for the herb right now so it's

161
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:59,399
uh amazing to get Vapor rips like

162
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,038
this off a pinch of cannabis and it's

163
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:04,519
one of the things while I'll always go

164
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:08,120
back to this uh

165
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:10,839
sublimator even with the plastic bom and

166
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,000
the and the food grade hose something

167
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:15,839
I'm not a huge fan of I still get the

168
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,360
most incredible tasty hits the most

169
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:24,038
incredible tasty is and it's just like

170
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,598
wow it gives you great medicine I I know

171
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:28,878
for me it it really relaxes me it takes

172
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:30,120
that pressure here and just does one of

173
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,560
these

174
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,360
100% And also while we're doing

175
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,639
that we're producing sublimate that oil

176
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,800
that just condenses in the down stem

177
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,560
right in here almost at any given time I

178
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,158
haven't even used this unit in a in a

179
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,280
while but I can guarantee that there's

180
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:51,680
oil in there somewhere you know and

181
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,399
there it is you know it's always in

182
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,879
there

183
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,959
so tiny little bit of sublimate this is

184
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,840
not to be confused with the reclaim that

185
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:03,198
you pull out of an oil ring this is pure

186
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:06,519
herb and and wet wash we'll dab it in

187
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,520
the side hole for John

188
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,880
[Music]

189
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:31,199
here little bit

190
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:34,080
of little itty bitty hits so that was

191
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,038
that we just smoked number two number

192
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,719
two and number

193
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:41,120
two and my room right now my number two

194
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,000
would have been my um calling Dennis

195
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,720
Hopper which is the hopper the hopper we

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,240
like the Dennis Hopper it's very pretty

197
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:52,240
nugget really all of John's herb is fall

198
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,519
colors it's got those really nice cush

199
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,600
purpley fall colors at the end of its

200
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,839
life cycle some have more orange some

201
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,800
have more red but generally they all

202
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,079
have this really nice purpley color

203
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:05,679
going through not to be confused with

204
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:08,799
that old school late '90s East Coast

205
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:12,278
purple that no one wanted to smoke but

206
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:14,958
really you know that Bubba that OG that

207
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:17,480
those deep kushes that

208
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:20,159
just just flower out so pretty at the

209
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,159
end of their life

210
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,800
cycle all

211
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,919
right yeah well a lot of people just

212
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,679
don't take them to the end of the life

213
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,120
cycle and that's why we're not seeing

214
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,120
these pretty fall colors too much

215
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:37,000
exactly you want to freshy in

216
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,519
there bur did you did you clean the

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,958
screen or did you even bother check see

218
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,560
I probably no you're good let's get you

219
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,559
let's get you

220
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,240
pack here we go

221
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,278
sublimating oh and the flavor want

222
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,269
[Music]

223
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:13,240
to yeah it's hard to describe the flavor

224
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:15,399
you almost never taste this aspect of

225
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,200
the tpin no you don't only with this

226
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,200
machine here I mean I I have to you know

227
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,200
and I I don't own this machine and I

228
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,680
don't own any uh you know I don't own

229
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,040
any steaks in the company I I can just

230
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:28,838
say that it is it's the best hit

231
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,480
flavor-wise that I get and it allows me

232
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:35,200
to enjoy cannabis which I normally don't

233
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,200
I'm usually just strict a hash

234
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:43,359
guy just exploding those

235
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:45,078
little head it's true I am in a sense

236
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,560
I'm still spoking

237
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:51,479
Ash thing about the suppor is um we're

238
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:54,838
just not smoking all

239
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,079
the what we say all the contaminant you

240
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,279
know what I think that's the second best

241
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,838
thing about the sublimator I think the

242
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:02,559
best thing about the lator is that it

243
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:06,000
makes this solventless red oil it's

244
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:08,439
almost as though the solventless red

245
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,078
oil is the product that you're looking

246
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,519
for

247
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,000
I I'm going to have to agree much the

248
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,399
way the Bubble Bags you know they're the

249
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,559
messenger that really brings you the

250
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,480
product which is the bubble the bubble

251
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,359
without the bubble the bubble bags are

252
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,159
are nothing really special so why don't

253
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,440
we grind up another flavor and get

254
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:29,519
through these five flavors so we can get

255
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,160
into some of these hashes

256
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,879
we're just going to set one jar down

257
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:35,919
here and grab the next one yeah and with

258
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:38,519
this we have a number four this is a

259
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,838
paty cross with this one was beautiful

260
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,720
this one is oh the smell the look I mean

261
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,680
they all are

262
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,200
but this is definitely what I would say

263
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,278
uh this is the one feno that I've kept

264
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,240
that I really really enjoy they all have

265
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:55,759
such unique unique undertones they have

266
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,278
their strong Kush flavor you know you've

267
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,919
got some of them have the OE some of

268
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:04,439
them have the Bubba but with in that

269
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:06,000
there's these undertones of kushes that

270
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,399
are just very unique it would be great

271
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,879
to get tpine uh gas chromatograph tests

272
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:15,720
done on the tpine spikes and see exactly

273
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:19,720
which tpin are are and and in what ratio

274
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:23,120
they are to be making these really

275
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,320
floral this is my favorite spicy smells

276
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,919
that that

277
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,600
smell it's just more than a cush it's

278
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:34,479
got It's almost got a lemon smell in

279
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,079
there and absolutely SM lemony tones

280
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,360
yeah and I think that would be the Laro

281
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:41,239
g thear o g yeah that's the Packy cross

282
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,639
with thear o

283
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,839
g Pakistan

284
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:50,278
represent nice strong rure asay crack

285
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,560
crack crack no problem not a problem

286
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:53,320
certain asay you might not want to do

287
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,000
that you don't want I'm I'm used to this

288
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,839
so I'm just touching it I'm not hitting

289
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,159
it I'm hammering it yeah but there's

290
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,800
certain dishes certain glass Flo certain

291
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:03,439
glass dishes that you would just never

292
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,278
do that to whereas the ruer ashtray it's

293
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,839
not one of those you can absolutely do

294
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,958
that and not have uh have really any

295
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,920
worry I can't wait to hit this here we

296
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:15,159
go number

297
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,439
four the Pakistan crossed with the lemon

298
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:21,639
Larry

299
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,639
OG looks good looks

300
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:32,120
good it's a real gentle you can't you

301
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,600
can't pull it the way you want uh when

302
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,360
you let the sublimator build up with a

303
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,759
little bit of oil which we inevitably

304
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,320
do there's a learning curve to pulling

305
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,799
the bowl you saw John kind of do these

306
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,680
little things it it won't it won't give

307
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,838
you that snap you're looking for okay it

308
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,479
will if you keep your rig all clean and

309
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,199
maybe use a different bong and whatnot

310
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,440
with this particular bong it pulls out

311
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:58,519
real slow so all you have to do is put a

312
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,880
little bit of pressure on it and just

313
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:04,360
let let it pull out slow it won't do the

314
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:06,120
quick lift but it will definitely do um

315
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,639
it'll definitely come out want to empty

316
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,399
that out and load me

317
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,278
up I'm excited I can hear you making the

318
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,480
sound of licking your lips I know it's

319
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:16,078
just like wow I can still taste the last

320
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,000
flavor on my lips which is another thing

321
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:21,278
I'd like to sort of give props to enrio

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,078
and his sublimator for is the Taste and

323
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,240
the

324
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:29,000
flavor seems to hang around more in your

325
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,000
mouth in your throat uh with the

326
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,120
sublimator than any other way that I

327
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,360
consume cannabis and of course this is

328
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,879
just my

329
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,519
opinion but I took my last hit several

330
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:45,039
minutes ago and I can still taste it on

331
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:49,399
my lips top of my right at the top of my

332
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,399
throat that's yeah it's it's so

333
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,679
tasty

334
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,319
like that's

335
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,199
tasty yeah that's deep tasty that almost

336
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,120
is reminescent of the old school

337
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:13,639
champagne hash plant in there that

338
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,480
musky just

339
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:19,079
potent taste that flavor is just so

340
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,519
unique yeah it's hard to describe

341
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:24,278
actually it's very hard to describe for

342
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,600
how strong it is it's not sharp it's not

343
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:29,120
stringent it's not

344
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,360
fruity

345
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,959
it's just it's D it's Kush musk yeah

346
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,839
it's just D it's like if if Kush was a

347
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:41,719
horse that would be like it's

348
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,480
piss if push was a horse this would be

349
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,560
the P this would be the piss we're

350
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,560
coming up with new things always

351
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:54,610
[Music]

352
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:01,120
here those are

353
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,120
hits that as you take

354
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,920
them you know how high you're

355
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,758
getting of that I can't wait to get to

356
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,838
the

357
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,240
hall I can't believe how good that last

358
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,759
rip was I know once again we're hitting

359
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,919
herb just little pitches and I going to

360
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,919
hit

361
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:26,639
this wow was that good I know we just

362
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,599
keep repeating ourselves and it could

363
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,198
potentially be getting boring but

364
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,480
can't say enough about the taste on the

365
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:37,359
sublimator so it's getting a little burn

366
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,360
so we know that uh my hits were

367
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,839
perfect I got none of that uh burnt

368
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,879
popcorn taste that was really

369
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:49,360
strong that's

370
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,720
medicinal I mean uh not to say I didn't

371
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,639
get high off the first one but that

372
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,120
second one got me

373
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,759
stoned oh this yeah I know this jar is

374
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,000
just wow the Christmas

375
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:07,318
kushes cheers for the Christmas

376
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,318
kushes I like

377
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:16,319
it and how about the irony of me wearing

378
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,360
a pure hemp rolling paper company

379
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,558
t-shirt it's hemp so I love it but I

380
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,159
don't actually use rolling papers

381
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:28,279
however if I did use Rolling Papers I'm

382
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,279
certain I would probably use use I use

383
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:32,599
yeah so there you go yeah I'm wearing it

384
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:35,599
good bunch of guys too I'm wearing it

385
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:39,319
for you I think you're

386
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:41,000
wearing wow yeah the sublimator a couple

387
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:43,279
of good rips on the sublimator is

388
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,119
reminiscent of like the first time you

389
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,240
smoked like 50 volcano bags and got to

390
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:50,678
that point where you were like holy

391
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,160
smokes you can really get high off

392
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:56,080
vaporization it is the concentrated

393
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,600
version of vaporization that's that is

394
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:01,960
what the sublimator is it's it's it's

395
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:06,519
none of this lightweight Airy hits it's

396
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:09,840
like fullon Smoky intense rips and

397
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,440
we're just hitting herb you know once we

398
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,359
get through all these herbs oh just like

399
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,720
a pinch we're going to hit these hashes

400
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,839
tiny pinch and the hashes

401
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,000
are it's going to bring us to the next

402
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:24,439
level I'm

403
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,839
excited five uh flavors of herb five

404
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,279
flavors of

405
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:32,319
hash um what a great day

406
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:35,480
I can't wait to get to this uh this one

407
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,158
that I pressed out this is some once

408
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:42,440
again cush it's a

409
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:45,919
c and that's uh that's this stuff right

410
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,798
here I know I saw goodness you see the

411
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,759
the Shine from the plastic you see all

412
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:51,759
the thousands of millions of little tiny

413
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,679
balls that's what's so cool about

414
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,919
looking at it we might do some dabs from

415
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,080
this slab later theor pressed it out to

416
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,960
this

417
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:05,918
so we'll play with that a little later

418
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,798
on for now I think we are moving on to

419
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,799
what are we here your last hit in number

420

421
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:13,960

00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:26,689
[Music]

John gave me another rip of this cuz the

427
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,840
first two rips

428
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:40,000
were like this one is way stronger than

429
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,798
that first one we hit that number two

430
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,119
yeah it is number two number you can

431
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,000
taste how strong it is in the content of

432
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,000
the resin that

433
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:56,558
musky so we're going to that was Inda

434
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,679

442
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,200
what you should call it so that's what

443
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,319
it is because that's exactly what it is

444
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,880
Excell well I'll tell you that last and

445
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:34,839
that Pakistani cross with the lemon

446
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:38,159
Larry OG is uh it's very nice it's in

447
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:41,959
behind my eyes totally loosen my body

448
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,440
completely I uh have broken about 16

449
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,360
bones in my life so I have a little bit

450
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,080
of arthritis insert the spots it cause

451
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:51,719
me pain littleit nug Stu to my nose

452
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,639
there and so when I smoke a strong

453
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:58,558
strain like that how I notice it mostly

454
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,240
right away is a my collar bone won't be

455
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:03,918
aching immediately you know which

456
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,038
usually goes into my shoulder and just

457
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:10,200
as a photographer and stuff it can cause

458
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:12,319
a little bit of pain not the case all

459
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,278
these little heads just falling over

460
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,960
they're bouncing bouncing we'll get them

461
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:19,038
all we'll get them all we'll get them

462
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,079
all we've got the giant dry screens

463
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:24,200
right behind you oh that's what uh and

464
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:27,839
this is pretty fresh herb so luckily not

465
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,240
a ton of heads a 14-day hang yeah yeah

466
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:33,639
but you can tell the humidity is not

467
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,880
crack bone dry which is okay I I don't

468
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,880
want that personally unless I'm dry

469
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,799
sifting if you're going to vaporize it

470
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,440
it's okay to have a little bit of

471
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,119
moisture the

472
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,240
sublimator it hits so intense you can

473
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,839
actually

474
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,159
see did we lose

475
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:52,359
our 30 minutes sublimator might have

476
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,559
gone off there if we were noticed I just

477
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:58,439
turned it back on so why don't we do a

478
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:02,960
denail rip while we're waiting for the

479
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:05,200
sublimator hit to yeah we'll hit this

480
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,640
uh we'll hit this stuff here so the

481
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,120
sublimator now has a timer built into it

482
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,919
so this way you don't leave it on all

483
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:15,519
day because apparently that's

484
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:18,278
why I was doing I would plug it in in

485
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,000
the morning and um I'd basically just go

486
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:21,720
and hit it whenever I needed some well

487
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,079
that's kind of the ideal situation and I

488
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,759
got to admit the guys at denail they set

489
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,480
up their unit for that very reason at

490
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,158
the Cannabis Cup we had this thing going

491
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,640
for what 10 to 12 hours a day it was

492
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,520
nice to be able to walk in a cold

493
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,520
environment so the nail was being uh

494
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,599
constantly bombarded with cold air so it

495
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:42,319
was working and uh then we came home to

496
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:45,639
the hotel and had it on for another 4 to

497
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:48,119
6 hours so 16 hours a day we had this

498
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,880
unit going every single day when I get

499
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:53,399
home I do the same thing I turn my uh my

500
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,080
dmail on and I leave it on for 10 to 12

501
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,559
hours I hope that the sublimator

502
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:00,759
eventually gets to that that point that

503
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,639
would be my one wish for the sublimator

504
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:05,038
a 30 minute timer for me I'm going to be

505
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,759
pushing that button you know literally

506
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,519
30 times I'm already like to buy a

507
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,319
passive but I'm told

508
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,119
them right they should be red you know

509
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,480
the great thing about enrio is he's

510
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,639
constantly

511
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,200
improving his product he he is not one

512
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,960
to believe that it's perfect and it's

513
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,840
where it needs to be he's like always

514
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,640
trying to create a new thing to be in

515
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,439
he's he's he's already worked out

516
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,000
something else right now exactly he

517
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,240
always is so we got to give praise uh to

518
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,679
enrio for his

519
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,000
really if anyone out there can tell me

520
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:42,720
of a of a unit that gives a tastier hit

521
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,278
of cannabis please I'm willing to try

522
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,120
and now John I'm Still tasting that last

523
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,759
one but you're kind well I got you a

524
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,759
nice little nice little

525
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,319
dab nice and slow I've been hitting the

526
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,880
Dil a lot and it hits a little bit

527
00:23:55,319 --> 00:24:01,439
differently than uh a sublimator

528
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,960
you want to go real slow draw depending

529
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,880
on the temperature you have I think I

530
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,640
might keep my Dil up a little bit higher

531
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,400
than the most 8810

532
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,278
de

533
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,919
um I've had it down at 4 and 500 I find

534
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:17,759
the hit to be tasty but just too light I

535
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,360
don't want just a tpping hit I can get

536
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,919
that with any vaporizer what I really

537
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:25,000
want is uh the full hit like what John

538
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:28,520
just received there which was good and

539
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,079
still receiving and still receiving

540
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:34,278
and that was some of that uh pressed

541
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:37,240
out Kush

542
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:40,079
pubs doesn't even want to stick to the

543
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,319
the thing though it's great toat it up

544
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,319
just

545
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,548
[Music]

546
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,320
stick I'm going to take myself da that

547
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,759
myself not that we need huge dabs but

548
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:13,509
[Music]

549
00:25:14,398 --> 00:25:19,079
Marana so a little trick there is um

550
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:21,558
it's just covering up the hole so it

551
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,480
actually turns into like a shot which is

552
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:26,678
kind of

553
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,679
nice yeah it's a nice little

554
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:31,759
uh light

555
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,919
little almost like a carb yeah I need to

556
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:37,398
get a carb

557
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,399
cap bua from

558
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,360
so had one in Amsterdam and that was

559
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:49,720
great uh when he was there we were being

560
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,798
able to carve the the nail perfectly and

561
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,759
really hold the

562
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:56,119
hidden but uh he wasn't always around

563
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:58,798
and when he wasn't around of course he

564
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:00,038
took his carve cap with them so

565
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:01,639
something I definitely want to get in

566
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:04,720

567
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,038

we talked about Christmas cushion

594
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:25,720
05 and that hence was the beginning of

595
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:27,038
the Christmas cush was actually the last

596
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,919
one we're going to try here is the many

597
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:30,440
cush that's was the Christmas cush

598
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:35,038
excellent and that's that's where the

599
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:37,919
all generated from and that was in yeah

600
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:41,038

uh

604

very strong cushy Funk as well tastes

605
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,798
the cush more than anything very

606
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440

610
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:44,399
yeah definitely once again it's got that

611
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:47,558
overtone of the musky

612
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,439
strong kushy flavor but then something a

613
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:50,519
little

614
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,399
different something else I don't taste

615
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:55,200
the haze per say and I'm not even sure

616
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:59,398
that I taste the skunk but it's

617
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,399
something that that could be the

618
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,240
the secret

619
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,240

fresh cannabis the dankest that I've

674
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:44,079
actually ever

675
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,038
grown excellent sure is substantially

676
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,720
darker than this other pile here look at

677
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:51,638
how green that is compared to this is

678
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:54,000
just almost dark purple same room side

679
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:56,798
by side wow this one just went extra 30

680
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,679
days well let's put it in the same Bowl

681
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:02,918
let see what we got make sure it's all

682
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:05,278
nice and clean this is the last

683
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:07,080
here we'll be getting into doing some

684
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,759
denail hits in a while after we hit the

685
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,398
sublimator but um for now the sublimator

686
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,879
stands alone to be able to give rips

687
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:15,158
like this you really have to give it up

688
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,320
to

689
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:22,039
sublimator we can

690
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:24,519
uh we can also stand with the best of

691
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:29,079
them for

692
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:31,798
um dabbing and even just dropping bubble

693
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:34,278
into the bowl cuz you can you can dab in

694
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:36,720
the sublimator put little hits of bubble

695
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:38,558
into the holes but I always found the

696
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,079
best hits were when I dropped bubble on

697
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,798
top of a screen inside this bowl and

698
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:45,240
then put the wand down on top of it

699
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:49,119
something about the the lack of direct

700
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:52,798
content uh contact really created um a

701
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,798
nice flavor I got

702
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:59,200
you I think the key the trick would

703
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:02,919
would have been to clean the inside of

704
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,720
this this is what's yeah I know we're

705
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:05,880
going to clean that one out yeah let's

impressed with the headbanger push that

721
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,000
he

722
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:47,158
had something that I think that um we

723
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,398
were trying that I said that came at a

724
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,720
Prince George that was a little

725
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,759
different and it was a headbang or

726
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,278
headbang we didn't know the exact name

727
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:57,638
of it but I was able to uh place the

728
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:58,798
name of it when I landed in as

729
00:33:57,638 --> 00:34:01,240
oh

730
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:03,398
okay all right so I think I got that a

731
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,839
little bit clean maybe I'll just clean

732
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:09,239
this real quick too I'm going to give

733
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:12,559

734
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:15,439

735
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:18,480

738
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,759
sir here we

739
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:28,878
go

740
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:33,239
oh that's

741
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,119
easier the back end of the I tast like a

742
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,119
fro Loop

743
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,639
taste

744
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,159
wow you can see earlier we might have

745
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:52,599
seemed like we were struggling we might

746
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,878
have made the sublimator look a little

747
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,079
sketchier than it is once you clean it

748
00:34:55,878 --> 00:35:01,559
properly it comes out the way it's

749
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,359
supposed to come out so if sit for two

750
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:04,838
months and not use it and then just jump

751
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,719
on it that's the problem I think it's

752
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:07,719
sat for 3 months

753
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:15,479
actually four big rips still tasting

754
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,880
good holy

755
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,920
B pass that on to you

756
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:24,119
Johnny one big Smoky popcorn rip for

757
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:29,358
John that's what that

758
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,358
was thank you I like I'm

759
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,279
okay now always say when and burn when

760
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,000
we did some testing before is when

761
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,560
you're actually getting the loss of all

762
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,039
those canabal and stuff might not be the

763
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,639
tastiest hit but I guarantee it's the

764
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,920
one of the most medicinal hits yeah I

765
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,039
would put some cash on that as well yeah

766
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,480
so it's definitely quite nice but uh

767
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,719
we're pretty much going to pack in the

768
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,000
weed I think um but we have one more

769
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:55,519
left oh I forgot about don't forget I

770
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,480
think we have one or two left we have

771
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:59,880
number three number three three number

772
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,240
three and number three is number three

773
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,880
was a Rin cross with a lemon Larry OG

774
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:08,719
there you go all right I'm just grabbing

775
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:12,240
the let me smell the jar please it's

776
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:13,598
it's um it's very unique again oh okay I

777
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,439
wanted to tell them a little bit about

778
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,519
this one this one

779
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,440
had this one had such a light green in

780
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,519
certain aspects it's almost though I

781
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,599
have three buds right here and it looks

782
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,480
as though it's three different strains

783
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,240
you know what I'm saying look at the

784
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,159
Orange hairs on this one look at the

785
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,479
underlining light leaves on this one and

786
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:36,039
then look at the purple kix's on this

787
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,039
one when I had this out in the sun I

788
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:41,039
thought it had powdery mildew on it at

789
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,838
one point and I pulled this nugget out I

790
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,679
remember it was the bottom of not this

791
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:47,519
one where did it

792
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:49,919
go yeah this one I had thought it had

793
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:53,400
powdery mildew from a distance in the

794
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,318
sun no powder mildew total crystals I'll

795
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,400
throw a couple of pictures up so you can

796
00:36:55,318 --> 00:36:58,880
see what we're talking about

797
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,160
let's give it a shot the three different

798
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,079
colors too that you're talking about

799
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:03,639
absolutely yeah yeah they're substantial

800
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,400
and this is the one you just round up

801
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:09,000
now yeah just right now that one there

802
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,820
the Romulan uh the number cross number

803
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,559
three

804
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,480
[Music]

805
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:17,159
excellent it's it's quite nice to be

806
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,318
able to try these flavors on the suppl

807
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,480
and get the true flavor um this was uh

808
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:22,679
something I was really looking forward

809
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,318
to

810
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,879

834
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,960
while I'm find this one here it's right

835
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,520
in the middle of the eyes and it's like

836
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,519
this and it's so tast

837
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:36,440
okay so this is I'm going to clean this

838
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,440
one up Lo me

839
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,789
[Music]

840
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:46,119
up a little mixy

841
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,318
perfect such a pleasure to have a a nice

842
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:50,318
little cannabis vaporization session

843
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:52,759
usually cannabis isn't intense enough

844
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:54,838
for me most vaporizers don't do the

845
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,599
trick I've always felt like if we could

846
00:38:54,838 --> 00:39:00,519
multiply it by 50 or 100 times a volcano

847
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,400
bag or whatever and then enrio came up

848
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:07,318
with this design and for whatever

849
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,318
reason it works thank you

850
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:14,159
sir it works very well it gives that

851
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,519
most

852
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:22,199
flavorful intense yet but oh wow it's

853
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:24,719
just like anything with power you got to

854
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:28,399
give it some respect and that's when we

855
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:30,358
talk about uh some people get

856
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,280
sublated

857
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:35,559
uh they do a little too

858
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,880
much well experience people that are

859
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:41,318
dealing with uh different types of pain

860
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,599
control or just generally like ourselves

861
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:45,920
have a higher

862
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:49,359
tolerance uh we team seem to enjoy this

863
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,000
thing uh daily and and wouldn't you say

864
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:54,318
that the implications are vast for The

865
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,599
Med user as opposed to the recreational

866
00:39:54,318 --> 00:40:01,400
user 100% that's why recreational user

867
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,838
is going to gain in um the oil that is

868
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:07,480
produced as a free product they're going

869
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,719
to save uh money on herb or hash or oil

870
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,800
whatever they're using because they're

871
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:13,639
going to generally use less of it you

872
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,800
can take the crappiest weed and this is

873
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:18,118
going to take that weed and make it

874
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,519
amazing it's pretty wild I mean it's

875
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:21,318
definitely like I don't personally want

876
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,159
to smoke crappy weed out of it I like

877
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:26,960
smoking your great weed out of but we're

878
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:29,039
talking you know but and it was just one

879
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,079
it was just saying that what you put in

880
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,440
there it has nothing to do with this yes

881
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:37,440
I have great resin but even weed that

882
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,240
isn't so FL fful whatever like that um

883
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,720
there's still the tri that's in there

884
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:44,039
and the sublimator is able to actually

885
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:45,838
benefit with that and so let's rephrase

886
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:48,279
that not the crappy weed but the The

887
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:51,039
nonf Fragrant the stuff that isn't uh

888
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,319
hung dry it's being done with on screens

889
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,119
and with dehumidifiers more commercial

890
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:57,239
grade stuff it's a hot air extraction

891
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,480
unit there you go definitely is a hot

892
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,799
air extraction have we managed to hit

893
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,199
all five of your jars I think we just

894
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,640
did yeah that was the loss of number

895
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:07,519
three well that was so great that was

896
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:09,759
really enjoyable I've just totally

897
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:12,838
satiated with Kush right now so I'm

898
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:16,079
thinking that we should probably do um

899
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:19,920
maybe a denail hit each of some of that

900
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,560
fiveyear Cur Master Kush and then while

901
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,720
we're doing that let's turn the

902
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:26,719
sublimator up to maximum so we can come

903
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,598
back and we can we can hit the m cush

904
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:31,519
off the sublimator and we can give our

905
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:33,079
audience sort of an honest taste test in

906
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:38,119
the difference between the

907
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:41,280
titanium sublimator and the titanium Dil

908
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:42,680
hey that's awesome I like that all right

909
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,880
okay that's what we're going to do

910
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:46,679
that's what we're going to do got the

911
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:50,079
5year Cure right

912
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:53,358
here I'm turning this yes one up you

913
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:56,318
turn that up and the time on so this

914
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:58,639
this this is some master cush uh 90

915
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:01,079
Micron bubble that I've had for oh about

916
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:05,639
5 years now it's about as long as we've

917
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:07,180
had the 90 Micron bag and it's

918
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:08,559
just

919
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:11,399
[Music]

920
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:14,799
absolutely incredible what

921
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:18,039
it's how it's I don't want to say

922
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,480
degraded because it it is a misnomer at

923
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:22,639
best but it has in a sense degraded the

924
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,519
Tricom head the way it's melted the wax

925
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:28,879
away the way the resin is finally just

926
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,838
mulched down into a putty it's produced

927
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,079
this really unique texture and I

928
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:35,679
appreciate it for the fact that I didn't

929
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:37,920
do it I didn't make this texture the

930
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:41,440
resin made the texture something that

931
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,720
just happened over time exactly so I

932
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,440
will offer you one first

933
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:49,318
John oh I think um the master cush we're

934
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,559
going

935
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:54,519
to you're

936
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:57,720
good

937
00:42:54,519 --> 00:43:00,358
okay and um one of the things I can

938
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:02,159
guarantee you that John mentions right

939
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:03,759
away which is interesting when you have

940
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:05,920
something that's been curing for five

941
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,280
years although it did spend a good 2 and

942
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,119
1/2 years in a a

943
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,440
refrigerator is the

944
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,480
taste of the hash there's no way you can

945
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,440
say there's no taste you can say that

946
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:23,400
the Tarpin have been affected greatly

947
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,240
but I wouldn't say in a way that they've

948
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,269
evaporated and disappeared what would

949
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:31,419
you say about the taste that Master

950
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:31,420
[Music]

951
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,760
cush

952
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,480
wow excellent so now you've heard it

953
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,480
from John

954
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:50,519
B

955
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:54,480
wow the The Taste is

956
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:00,079
um it's

957
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,839
strong it's a strong taste is it not

958
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,800
it's strong and it's through my whole

959
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:06,480
mouth it just isn't like on the top I

960
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,720
can the whole mouth is that oh I know

961
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,639
it's what I my tongue it's in my lips

962
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:15,719
it's just it's just everywhere which is

963
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:15,719
uh actually quite

964
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,719
um the high

965
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:27,880
has very sedating it's um

966
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,599
definitely something I'm liking right

967
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,200
now it's uh giving me that relapse it's

968
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,039
being an hard day we were both talking

969
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:35,439
earlier how with the cold weather backs

970
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:37,400
were starting hurt and stuff like that

971
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,720
so this is definitely uh more of a

972
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:42,280
strain that

973
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:45,399
uh feel the

974
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,599
relaxation oh my God I know got full

975
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,039
flavor as I

976
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:54,880
coughed I blew out the taste I was

977
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:54,880
coughing the taste of that

978
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,199
hash

979
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:01,920
it's very different from everything else

980
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:04,118
we've smoked even that other hash which

981
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,559
will hit again as a reminder I'm very

982
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:08,039
interested to hit this hash off the

983
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:10,559
sublimator and to see if we can increase

984
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:13,440
the intensity of that taste or whether

985
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,599
or not it's going to be on par with uh

986
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,000
with the denil yeah actually yeah keep

987
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,920
in mind the denil um we can turn it up

988
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,199
to any temperature we want so if we do

989
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:27,039
find The Taste is tastier on the

990
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:28,879
sublimator I say we turn the denail down

991
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,358
to see if we can't modulate those

992
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,599
effects of those tastes without

993
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:34,078
dissipating the hit you know I don't

994
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:35,800
want to dissipate the hit I know if we

995
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,839
turn this thing down to 400 we could get

996
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,119
a straight turp hit and it would be

997
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,960
amazing but it would be this light like

998
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,838
blow up nothing I I still want to get a

999
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,838
rip yeah you

1000
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:50,639
know yeah that was tasty

1001
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:53,599
sedating

1002
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,960
absolutely it's uh I'm in my heaven

1003
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,160
right now hitting all these cushion and

1004
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,639
all the sedation I was just going to say

1005
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:01,239
I was just going to say for people that

1006
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,838
aren't in chronic pain or that aren't

1007
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:06,558
just chronic recreational users of like

1008
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:09,639
cush or heavy narcotic like

1009
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:12,000
strains most people don't enjoy doing

1010
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:15,440
gauntlets like the one we're doing right

1011
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,119
now we do you know you've got oh there

1012
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,480
if you would I'm pretty sure watching

1013
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,680
the beginning of this video to where I

1014
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,240
am now I'm late back I'm relax oh yeah

1015
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:25,919
absolutely I mean my goodness I'm I'm

1016
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,799
just waiting for the next rip and what

1017
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,760
what going to

1018
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:36,119
be we do have uh we do have that nice uh

1019
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:40,160
brick of uh lovely powder what was that

1020
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:42,880
orang this one here yeah I think it's PK

1021
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:46,000
yeah that was close I I I thought I was

1022
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,599
burning myself I know it was I was like

1023
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,639
don't be burning yourself because that

1024
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:53,400
flavor that's in our mouth right now why

1025
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,960
don't we try that on the sublimator next

1026
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,480
I want to clean my palette oh you want

1027
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,199
to clean palette want clean my palette

1028
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,280
so I'm going to do this you don't you're

1029
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:02,039
welcome to his well I like I like that

1030
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,559
concept I think we should clean this out

1031
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:07,519
a little bit

1032
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:09,440
too um not sure how many of you guys own

1033
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,119
a denail one of the things you end up

1034
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,440
having to do is blow out a little bit of

1035
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,079
the carbon residue off the nail I

1036
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,280
personally like to close my eyes when

1037
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:19,960
doing this the idea of blowing red hot

1038
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,680
carbon into my eye is frightening I

1039
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,960
wouldn't do it so it's just something to

1040
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:25,279
keep in mind when you're doing it warn

1041
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:29,720
your friends as well going to blow this

1042
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,720
up you want blow this up I'm

1043
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,959
look so there we go so what we're saying

1044
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,319
is while doing that you should always

1045
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,960
warn your friend or colleague or people

1046
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,119
around you it's not a bad idea when

1047
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:43,039
you're touching any kind of an apparatus

1048
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:47,960
that is prob

1049
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:50,759
h° plus you want this one please all

1050
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,679
right oh you have like 3

1051
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,720
seconds it was

1052
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:57,078
Dripping it was

1053
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,239
Dripping

1054
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:02,680
love the ease of the denail love the

1055
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:06,318
lightweight cable fits in the mothership

1056
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:06,318
like it was made for

1057
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:14,680
[Music]

1058
00:48:10,838 --> 00:48:14,679
it how's the taste on

1059
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,039
that that was this guy

1060
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:30,240
that was

1061
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:31,318
this so I'm going to hit this clear my

1062
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:33,959
palette and then we're going to do the

1063
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:33,960
sublimator

1064
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:46,199
ri I think as um Mar hitting this I'll

1065
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,838
be saying one thing two is the the

1066
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:50,558
intense

1067
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:52,199
flavor of the L that we were hitting

1068
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:56,079
that's

1069
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:58,838
5e C that's just amazing you can

1070
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:02,680
definitely see The Taste the difference

1071
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:05,119
and you can see the difference um it's

1072
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:07,759
really hard to

1073
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:11,720
compare it is isn't it it is it's just

1074
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:17,160
like you went from rollsroyce down to

1075
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:21,519
Ferrari you know por which is nice but

1076
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:25,838
definitely I can't wait to uh put some

1077
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:30,159
resin into a little container and R it

1078
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:32,318
year on it Cate in 20 [ __ ] 25 here we

1079
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:33,639
go I like that I'd like to see you guys

1080
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:35,838
do that too you know if you've got a

1081
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:37,838
little piece of your favorite resin you

1082
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:40,920
know put it away if you want if you want

1083
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:43,920
it to stay the same you can seal it in

1084
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,280
an almost oxygen starved environment uh

1085
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,480
there are ways to replace the uh oxygen

1086
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,839
with nitrogen which will uh hold the

1087
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,760
resin and the Turpin in contact or you

1088
00:49:50,838 --> 00:49:54,400
can just put it in a freezer you can get

1089
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,760
away with that for quite a long time

1090
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,079
without the resin ch changing now if you

1091
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,760
want to cure it you can put it in glass

1092
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:03,720
you can put it in Wood you can put it in

1093
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,440
a variety of places dark and cool places

1094
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:09,719
much like a wine

1095
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:13,400
seller and uh you can affect slowly you

1096
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:17,199
know by slowly changing the tarpine

1097
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:19,680
content you affect the modulation of the

1098
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:21,480
canabo profile so it's something worth

1099
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:22,798
kind of experimenting with I've been

1100
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,880
doing it for

1101
00:50:22,798 --> 00:50:28,000
years lots of people have it's cool most

1102
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:31,920
of my most of my canvas it goes into

1103
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,599
jars like this and yeah I mean it's a

1104
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,639
crush 2 3 months is a is in average good

1105
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:38,798
cure before you can really start getting

1106
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:40,519
the full flavors out of because that's

1107
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:41,759
when you get rid of all the chlorop

1108
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:43,639
stuff is out of there and you getting a

1109
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,839
really full flavor and burping your

1110
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:48,879
drawers every day and it's the same with

1111
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:50,798
hash or anything else it's uh it's like

1112
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,920
a fine wine the way I look at it

1113
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,679
absolutely so flavors here's a question

1114
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,880
for

1115
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:59,480
you should we hit this

1116
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,160
dabbed in the hole or should we drop it

1117
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,039
into the bowl and hit it that way I

1118
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:04,879
think if we drop it into the bowl we

1119
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,798
should heat the bowl up first well

1120
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,160
absolutely that is one thing that enrio

1121
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:11,000
always talks about if you are going to

1122
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:13,798
drop it in the bowl you leave the unit

1123
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,798
on the bowl getting the bowl hot is part

1124
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:18,480
of how the sublimator works it doesn't

1125
00:51:16,798 --> 00:51:20,440
take a a super long time but it's

1126
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,400
definitely something that you want to

1127
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:25,119
now with something like that being so

1128
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,200
resiny and gooey almost like an oil I

1129
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:31,079
think putting in the hole might be yeah

1130
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:34,519
mhm and I mean look at that oh how would

1131
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:36,920
you describe that how would I describe

1132
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:37,880
that well like a lot of you guys out

1133
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,358
there that are hitting all these

1134
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,480
shatters and stuff like that M they look

1135
00:51:40,358 --> 00:51:45,239
at that and 100% be like oh that looks

1136
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,760
like killer shatter and and and and

1137
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:48,239
first you would laugh and go yeah wait

1138
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,480
till you try this

1139
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:54,399
because here's the flavor here's the

1140
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,679
genuine tress and and that's that's what

1141
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,440
a lot of you guys will look like but I

1142
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:01,719
mean what I see is uh I see seethrough

1143
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,679
gold it's just if you can PE this off

1144
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:06,239
it's completely if we took it outside

1145
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:08,399
for a few minutes it would get so cold I

1146
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:10,118
can see through this that would peel off

1147
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,838
very nicely you can see through them oh

1148
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:15,960
yeah it's it's it's and keeping in mind

1149
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:17,318
the reason it's so dark okay which is

1150
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,760
funny cuz when you post this on

1151
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:23,079
Instagram a lot of the younger BHO kids

1152
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,799
saw this and they were like Tain soup

1153
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:27,519
they think it's dirty nasty utane you

1154
00:52:25,798 --> 00:52:28,838
know some some would be like oh no

1155
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,639
that's really nice some would be like oh

1156
00:52:28,838 --> 00:52:33,679
no that's not the good stuff at all and

1157
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:34,879
in the meantime it's not BHO at all so

1158
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:38,000
it's just kind of a funny thing it's

1159
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:41,119
water hash so let's give it a shot

1160
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,838
through the sublimator try a little a

1161
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,838
little dab for

1162
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:53,959
starters all right see if I can lift

1163
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:57,239
this up for

1164
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,240
you boo

1165
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:04,359
so that is a pretty nice little unit you

1166
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:09,079
can see how it

1167
00:53:04,358 --> 00:53:09,078
hits fairly exceptionally

1168
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:28,759
W ha I tasted

1169
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:32,279
it the herb got left in there clean it

1170
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:35,079
no so it felt a little hot even though

1171
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:37,720
the herb is very dark it's still not

1172
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:40,880
burned which is quite something cuz we

1173
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:40,879
turned the sublimator

1174
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:46,920
up

1175
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:50,239
so we have to redo that hit cuz

1176
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,240
really how do

1177
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:57,159
you how do you call that a hit

1178
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,640
down my throat needs a little recovering

1179
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:06,838
we've been coughing and puffing like Mad

1180
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:10,639
