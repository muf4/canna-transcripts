00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,039
hey guys welcome to Bubble manan's World

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,278
I am over with Nate a buddy that I just

4
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,640
met really online in the last month or

5
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,599
so sure so kind of a funny story how

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,120
Nate and I met he purchased some Blue

7
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,039
River tpin from me and he was having

8
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,759
some credit card nightmares and so we

9
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,079
ended up just being like I'm canceling

10
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:41,280
that one and I guess he forgot that he

11
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,280
had done this order with me and so it

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,439
came back and also when he did the order

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,679
there was also a little bit of it was a

14
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,079
different address and a different

15
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,759
shipping address with a different

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,239
country in fact and uh it was kind of

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,119
funny you know I was a little worried

18
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,878
that it was a scam and I contacted him

19
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:59,000
and he assured me no dude trust me it's

20
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:00,599
all good but things kept taking a little

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,960
bit longer like a week and I started

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,439
getting more nervous and was a little

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,359
bit aggressive and he was like oh bro

24
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,719
I'm so sorry I'm so sorry and then like

25
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,719
a week later he's like hey do you want

26
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,759
to come over and hit this pipe that I

27
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:14,118
just purchased which was um is even a

28
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,040
stranger trippier story CU of course if

29
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:17,959

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,719

31
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:23,199
Mothership that uh high integrity glass

34
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,959
from Montreal out east had purchased it

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,240
and he actually came to my hotel room on

36
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,798
a few occasions and I was lucky enough

37
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,798
to smoke out of it while he had it and

38
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,640
now you know now Nate's got it and he

39
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,000
invited me over so I thought well let's

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,719
go film a fun video over at Nate's place

41

49
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:03,200
temperatures and different times I

50

carb cap of choice thank you very much

68
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,878
nice with the seed of life for the

69
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,080
single with the MEAP is so ridiculous

70
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,959
dude when I got it it had one that had a

71
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,760
slit in it still oh wow wow so you just

72
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,360
grabbed yourself a mega pot for sure

73
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,519
down in the states good call good call

74
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,879
12 seconds on that so you want to tell

75
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,360
us a little bit about this pipe you must

76
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:13,399
have learned all the fancy names and

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,560
everything about it by now I heard 3D

78
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,560
Purple Rain exosphere and that's about

79
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,000
it thing that's different that I heard

80
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,400
is that second little exosphere kind of

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
inside of

82
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,080
it sick though it hits so well when you

83
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,080
hold it in your hands like that you can

84
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,200
feel the rumble like crazy compared to

85
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,200
if it's just on the surface even

86
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,788
[Music]

87
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,080
agreed got a little uh Q Tip action for

88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,079
sure what a beautiful piece what a

89
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,560
wonderful Rumble he's it's true it's um

90
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,560
it's actually one of the reasons why

91
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,560
this particular piece a lot of the

92
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,158
really heady pieces I won't pick up I'll

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,560
leave it there and I'll hit it like that

94
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,759
but with a piece like this you really

95
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,319
want to feel it rumbling in your hand

96
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,560
and Rumble it does that was a perfect

97
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,039
low temp dab by the way this timer is

98
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,560
the best it does how long you heat it

99
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,639
how long you cool it it works

100
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,160
perfect 100 dabs and this thing's barely

101
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,879
even dirty well let's get you one of

102
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,840
those cuz it was just so darn nice it

103
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:25,800
wasn't a huge dab by any means I usually

104
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,799
take slightly smaller dabs when I'm TP

105
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,400
dipping for sure I'm not sure if you're

106
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,160
on the same boat with that but

107
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,839
I also find that it really potentiates

108
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,039
it so much

109
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,038
that L seems to work

110
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:46,519
fine that was number nine what are the

111
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,120
differences in well I'm about to go into

112
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,120
my little phone here I got to go to the

113
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,120
picture and I'll tell you while you're

114
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,959
taking your dab what the difference is

115
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,639
so number

116
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,918
nine number nine is a second press it

117
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,560
was um

118
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:06,478
six of a gram that came out it's the

119
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,800
Teflon and it was the second press so

120
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,560
yeah well it was delicious I dipped it

121
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,639
in cookies too so it's not going to be

122
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,000
an accurate uh feedback of the the

123
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,680
cultivar itself but

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,639
uh stoked to be hit in this

125
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,038
3D

126
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:27,879
Mothership try to get some nice camera

127
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:31,120
up close for you guys to see the actual

128
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:34,079
uh bubbling that occur C here in the uh

129
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,759
rumbling I should

130
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,159
say can't believe the perfect perfect

131
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,960
temp that you're getting every time on

132
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:45,160
that I prefer personally a larger Banger

133
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:48,279
or XL honey pot like I just for sure

134
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,800
even for small dabs even that's it yeah

135
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,559
exactly it's all about that surface area

136
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,199
and especially the way quartz dissipates

137
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,360
its heat someone was asking me if the

138
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,079
etchings like in the actual bucket like

139
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,439
for the seat of life if that increases

140
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,318
the surface area and actually makes a

141
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,759
difference difference I have no idea if

142
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,080
it does or not interesting well I'll

143
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,598
definitely tell you that when I put the

144
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,519
sherbet pencil in and just moved it

145
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,279
around gently I right away noticed those

146
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,478
ridges there like okay so I'll be a

147
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,279
little more gentle maybe just hold this

148
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:18,478
here sure I always use the glass ones

149
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,799
instead of the titanium ones or anything

150
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,719
yeah yeah of course that makes total

151
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,960
sense

152
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,080
actually especially with ridges like

153
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,478
that with the titanium one I generally

154
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,879
will put it in a quartz and just do this

155
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:30,800
yeah just right on the side I just hold

156
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,439
it up against the wall and then uh yeah

157
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,918
I don't need to be uh there's lots of

158
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,160
people that like try so hard to get it

159
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,318
off there though you're like it'll just

160
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,439
smell give it a second I'll tell you

161
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,400
I'll tell you I think we should hit

162
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,879
another one just because a this piece is

163
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,038
amazing B we're just kind of meeting

164
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,000
each other and having our first sesh and

165
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,719
uh well there's all sorts of other

166
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,560
flavors here so what was number one that

167
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,680
I did was it this one was the first one

168
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,160
we just puffed right that's how I did

169
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,038
yeah I think so I kind of want to go on

170
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,439
this real super butter yeah for sure I

171
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,519
going say both of these look so light

172
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,519
and mess

173
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:09,800
butter Tor you the problem with it is

174
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:11,519
like smell so yeah little jar of Heaven

175
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,520
which two did you order when you ordered

176
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:18,240
I got the Crown Royal Jamaican one and

177
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,799
the I think Sour Diesel but I might

178
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,879
something El s diesel my favorite one

179
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,280
out of those Jamaican ones that was one

180
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,120
of my

181
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,038
favorit

182
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,560
beautiful excited to hit this again for

183
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,159
sure God I always look at a pipe like

184
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,360
this you probably noticed right away I

185
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,520
took my keys off from around my neck def

186
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,720
pendants or anything pendants Keys

187
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,519
anything I'm really one of the first

188
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,440
people even though it's not my pipe but

189
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:44,038
because I photograph them often and and

190
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,120
make videos with them and stuff I feel

191
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,959
still extreme responsibility of being

192
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,560
around them for sure that I have no

193
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,918
problem sharing that information with

194
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,120
people and being like Oh no you know

195
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:54,878
just really take the thing off it's not

196
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,478
even like the sunglasses on here that

197
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,439
can fall off just just all right here we

198
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,439
go

199
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,720
the carb cap is so deep in the crown

200
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,720
isn't it it's

201
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:29,560
crazy never even bother

202
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,240
trying it's like a full knuckle in

203
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,158
it's pretty cool though for sure it's my

204
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,080
favorite ofc well no

205
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:42,158
[ __ ] beautiful low temp dab on that and

206
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,560
did you notice the lighter color rosin

207
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,600
made a clearly lighter color oil in the

208
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,159
dish as well it's a great laugh sure and

209
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,040
if it's

210
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:55,799
50/50 absolutely there you go

211
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,078
Nate well what a pure joy I had no idea

212
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,439
today I was going to be a hanging out

213
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:03,958
with a new friend B smoking out of an

214
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,519
elite Mothership and see making a video

215
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,639
for all of you guys to enjoy I've been

216
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,360
pumping out videos lately like the last

217
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:13,600
four or five have been real consistent

218
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,720
and and good but uh today I had no ideas

219
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,920
I was just like ah we'll take a day off

220
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,800
no days off for you no rest you will

221
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:22,199
smoke

222
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:26,319
Elites Mothership sure has changed the

223
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,720
game you know it really have have taken

224
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,600
this whole thing to a new level which it

225
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,759
helps other glass blowers I'm sure

226
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,920
because it takes collecting to the next

227
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:38,159
level when you have a piece like this

228
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:42,000
that's you know literally five to six

229
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:46,679
figures it's uh it's a special piece of

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,839
art it's not uh it no longer is just a

231
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:52,919
thing anymore it's now an

232
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,200
actual piece of functional art I think

233
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,559
of all these people that spend millions

234
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,040
of dollars on Art and don't get to use

235
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,439
it they don't get to use the art I mean

236
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,639
sure hanging up on your wall and it

237
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,640
looks beautiful but this you can pull it

238
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:08,759
down take some Dabs out of it put it

239
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,278
right back up get completely

240
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,958
lit and then yeah put it right back up

241
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,600
that was a nice dab you got there that

242
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,199
was a really nice one and that was tur

243
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,759
free for sure don't get me wrong it

244
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,480
wasn't tur free it was just free of

245
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:24,838
added excess added

246
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,879
turbs so what are we thinking here now

247
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,160
maybe number eight eight looks pretty

248
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:33,278
like tacky for sure it's only just going

249
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:34,639
on of numbers yeah well that's I knew we

250
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,600
weren't going to be able to rewrite it

251
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,519
all you know yeah for sure I was like we

252
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,120
can't rewrite this all I know these

253
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,278
stickier ones that are less I mean it's

254
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,278
still pretty buttery but the more

255
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:49,439
tackier ones uh are are second runs

256
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:51,320
second presses and still completely

257
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,600
delicious so let's see what number was

258
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,959
that number eight you just got yet yeah

259
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,560
so number eight where are you number

260
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:03,199
eight five six

261
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:06,638
you are a second

262
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,320
press of the Teflon looks super nice and

263
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,919
golden there for the crappy picture that

264
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,079
it is it's like Golden

265
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:17,679
Tears all right so I guess we got to

266
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:20,679
heat this bad boy up want to take it

267
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,359
you're doing so good on the torch know

268
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,799
telling you it's all about that this

269
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,680
timer I like your timer I might have to

270
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,679
grab that what is it an

271
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:34,720
app it is called Interval Timer Interval

272
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,320
Timer who would have guessed well after

273
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,040
this dab is this my third and have you

274
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,920
had two or three two so okay so after

275
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:44,360
not this dab but the next dab that Nate

276
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:47,519
is about to take perhaps we will find

277
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,600
ourselves out in the city at a beach or

278
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,320
at a park or in nature we kind of wanted

279
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,200
to get out start the show here and then

280
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,720
take the piece somewhere really

281
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,399
beautiful and get a couple of nice

282
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,839
nature shots also brought the Drone so

283
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,799
that could potentially have happen as

284
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,160
well anyway I'm getting ready in the 10c

285
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:07,359
range

286
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,480
here 10c

287
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,480
range also a good pipe not to be

288
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,199
grabbing if you have rings around your

289
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,879
fingers you know grabbing with the Rings

290
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:17,879
that's a sort of faux paw in my mind

291
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,039
God it's just

292
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,959
so it's such a lovely

293
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,000
experience to ride in the

294
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:50,879
Bentley you

295
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,120
know that's really the truth of it right

296
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:57,480
there so well it's such a pipe that is

297
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,560
worthwhile of producing in Elite Form in

298
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,320
my opinion you know I've I've hit a few

299
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:03,919
head pieces over the

300
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,480
years that hit like utter incomplete

301
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,198
[ __ ] which is just like almost a crime I

302
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,360
remember really meeting with uh Jason

303
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:11,838
Lee and him talking about how you know

304
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,399
he just wouldn't sell a pipe like that

305
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,760
he would always put water in it he

306
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,159
always trouble trouble it you know make

307
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,000
sure you wanted to hit it and it was

308
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:20,919
good feel that it was hit in the way you

309
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,600
at least were you know felt like was a

310
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,278
good representation of your work but uh

311
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,800
you know with these ships that's the one

312
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,278
thing that is pretty consistent that uh

313
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:34,000
they hit great

314
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:35,759
have you ever hit the one that's the I

315
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,320
don't know exactly what it would be but

316
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,879
I guess kind of a Taurus then it has a

317
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,320
3DX sere in it and it doesn't have like

318
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:46,838
any Clin Parts at all here a picture of

319
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,720
it I might have it sounds like something

320
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,160
it's a weird one I had it for a bit but

321
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,639
it was horrible just the only one I've

322
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:57,838
ever hit that wasn't good

323
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,560
interesting I don't think uh I've hid it

324
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,800
before just let me oh no I've never even

325
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,919
seen that thing before that's tripped

326
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,679
out right it's one I got it took all

327
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:09,198
your breath to even get a little pull on

328
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,958
it or anything oh my God we'll show that

329
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,599
to you I'll insert it into the video so

330
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:16,719
you guys can see what we're looking at

331
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,720
right now so this one is

332
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:23,198
you after a torch

333
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:23,198
up yes

334
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,320
yes there you gok those TPS drip

335
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,679
downward

336
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,759
so yeah we should get out I don't know

337
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,078
where but somewhere it' be cool we've

338
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,120
got the Drone it would be cool to get

339
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:39,679
that thing in action as well we're

340
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,919
definitely limited to our time right now

341
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:45,919
it's 2:48 and it gets dark out like fast

342
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,240
so try to get some fat footage for you

343
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,599
if it works out it works out if not hey

344
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,159
we had a great session out of an elite

345
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,159
Mothership

346
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:57,719
piece yep yep it's finally Sunny too

347
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,639
yeah that's another thing it's been

348
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,040
rainy for about 60 days days here so

349
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,320
getting a little bit of sun is kind of a

350
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,639
big deal this is another reason I

351
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,440
suggest you learn how to ski or

352
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,519
snowboard and like the mountain because

353
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,839
if it rains the way it's probably going

354
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,600
to this winow there'll be a ton of snow

355
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,279
and the snow is super fun and it's like

356
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,440
a good vibe and the rain is kind of a

357
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:19,919
bummer and not a good vibe I mean it is

358
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,480
with people who don't mind it but the

359
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,799
people man if you have a problem with

360
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,600
rain and you move to like Washington

361
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:29,399
State or the west coast of British

362
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,560
Columbia don't do it cuz it rain here

363
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,600
it's like a temperate rainforest need a

364
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,198
lot of

365
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,759
water comes in pretty consistently nice

366
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:41,278
rip yeah that was so tasty those cookies

367
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,839
are so good dude I'm telling you cooks

368
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,838
all right well we are going to put this

369
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,639
thing in its case and head out into the

370
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:50,839
city of Vancouver so who knows where

371
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,079
we'll see you next but uh it's going to

372
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:56,639
be in about a split second transition

373
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:59,078
and there we will

374
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,959
be all right so Nate and I have made it

375
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:03,638
down to what is this English Bay it is

376
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,000
English Bay we're just kind of at the

377
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:06,560
far end of it oh yeah there's the boat

378
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,879
house over there that's all sort of

379
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,879
Denman Street and Vancouver part of

380
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,720
Vancouver in the background and then of

381
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,078
course the endowment lands are behind us

382
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,319
and we're right here on the Pacific

383
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,879
Ocean and I guess uh we brought the

384
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:20,439
beautiful piece we took some lovely

385
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:22,480
photos on the side of the the sand and

386
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,600

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,720
Integrity of that xile Banger and uh I

391
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:37,078

their music but I told them I wasn't

405
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,078
able to record if music was on so they

406
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,318

like it's much warmer out now when we

447
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,119

00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,679
Vancouver it's as large as the city of

473
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,319
downtown Vancouver so it's uh it's a big

474
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,280
chunk and it's definitely a bonus to

475
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:59,119
have it to be able to go walk through

476
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,200

guys that thing is so ridiculous I

498
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,000
wonder like what what do you even see

499
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,440
when you look at that but you don't know

500
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
what it is like what I want to interview

501
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,278
that guy right now she said she thought

502
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,480
it was beautiful yeah but did she even

503
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:56,798
know what it was was she like that's a

504
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,278
pipe or no I told her afterwards that's

505
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,519
what I'm saying it doesn't really look

506
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:00,519
like

507
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,480
all right all

508
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,400
right well we're here right on the side

509
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:18,319
of the lake that is

510
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,400
literally right next to the entrance to

511
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,599
Stanley Park through the city so there's

512
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,360

516
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,960
beautiful sunset and the you know but

517
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,000
we'd rather just sit here and I think

518
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,278
have a nice we've got the view and we'll

519
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,919
show you the view uh afterwards so

520
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:45,319
that'll work out fine so all right we're

521
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:49,080

that to hold it to make it look good

527
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:04,400
look it needs to be in the sun I think

528
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:06,918

529
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,919
