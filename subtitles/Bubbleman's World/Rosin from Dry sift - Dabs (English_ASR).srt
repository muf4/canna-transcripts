00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,439
hey guys welcome back to part two of the

3
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,519
Rosen Tech I have of course made a

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,518
little bit of it here I can uh got a

5
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:34,000
little dab here hanging from the from

6
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,159
the Dabber and just put that right there

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,878
for

8
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:41,159
now don't get that

9
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,519
lost guess that's the way she's going to

10
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,558
go so yeah I've got the Dabber here

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,920
filled with h a nice little rip of rosin

12
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,640
I've got the little bit on the piece

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,960
here that I made in the last video a

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,640
little bit of uh dry sift rosin that was

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,239
pressed out of here little no melts for

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,439
you made Ros and you guys saw the video

17
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:05,959
how great it worked how easy it was with

18
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,319
the 25 micron screen the 25 micron

19
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:10,679
screen is reusable um Jeff church was

20
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,879
saying that he he um cleans his with

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,520
either like a pure alcohol a grain

22
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,239
alcohol or even an isopropanol um I

23
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,560
would prefer a grain alcohol personally

24
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,679
the cleaner the cleaner the better and

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,439
that's what I'll do to reuse mine I'm

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,200
also going to try and make some smaller

27
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,039
pieces that are more fitting almost

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,079
circular pieces that I can start uh uh

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,240
selling on the site so that people have

30
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,759
access to this screen you can heat it up

31
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,478
and it's not going to release any type

32
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,719
of uh chemicals so that's important and

33
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:42,599
then of course what you guys all were

34
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:46,478
missing was the rip so without further

35
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:49,559
Ado I've got the um the special nail

36
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,359
here see if we can get this unhooked yep

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,879
beautiful

38
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,920
beautiful very nice it's a little bit

39
00:01:53,879 --> 00:02:00,679
different from working with uh with hash

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:04,759
that I'm so used to but the rosin still

41
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:08,319
pretty pretty dealable so I've got the

42
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:11,400
silicon carbide nail with the

43
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,598
um Sapphire insert if you can see that

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,360
let me see if I can get it a little

45
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:17,039
closer for you

46
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,160
guys yep sappire insert you can see I've

47
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,479
taken one rip already and that's the rip

48
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:23,439
that you guys are going to get to watch

49
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,000
on the nail as I take this rip now one

50
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,359
thing I noticed was the boiling and the

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,199
bubbling and the melting doesn't so much

52
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,160
occur when you've gotten rid of the

53
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,199
membrane um I always thought it was the

54
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,000
Tarpin boiling out but you'll see in the

55
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:40,318
video that it's mostly just oil on the

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,800
sapphire slowly um smoking off so here

57
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,799
we go Rosen dry sift rips through the

58
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Taurus

59
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,039
now it has a very similar taste to the

60
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:17,719
dry sip keep in mind this was dry sip

61
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:20,878
that wasn't that good it has the flavor

62
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,680
of that dry sift minus whatever that I

63
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,759
mean it's increased the potency and the

64
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,760
and the quality guaranteed even in the

65
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:32,919
taste now I'll admit I probably used

66
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,919
more heat than was

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,199
necessary but really what I can taste is

68
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:42,238
a purified version of the dry sip that I

69
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:45,560
wasn't as fond of now it's a tough gig

70
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,200
to try and make a rosin taste as good as

71
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,360
a a six-star full

72
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:53,598
melt because you've already grown that

73
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,480
six-star full melt so properly the tpin

74
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,280
are already present and of course Jeff

75
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,078
talked a little bit about how his tpine

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,400
content went up in hash Church on when

77
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,879
he tested his material which makes sense

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,760
if you get rid of the majority of the

79
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:07,560
hash and squeeze out just a smaller

80
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,639
amount of the oil you would think that

81
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,400
your tarpine ratio would go up just from

82
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,919
the removal of the wax

83
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,959
membranes however lets not us get

84
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,279
confused at the fact that those tpin are

85
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,918
going to be altered due to the fact that

86
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:24,638
heat was present U Mark mentioned uh one

87
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,120
of the sesquiterpenoids uh

88
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,360
caropine uh it starts evaporating at

89
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,439
107° and there's other ones present as

90
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,479
well at at those low temperatures so

91
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,240
obviously the the 200° temperature of

92
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,038
the rosin uh is going to heat that up

93
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,918
but that's why we're figuring out ways

94
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:44,560
to do it uh quicker get it off uh faster

95
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:46,680
and this is not by any means a

96
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,038
replacement for learning how to dry sift

97
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,759
or learning how to um wet wash what this

98
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:56,360
is is another thing for you to put in

99
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,080
your quiver another great way to test a

100
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,280
bud if you don't smoke bud and don't

101
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,959
have a vaporizer PR this is just another

102
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:05,079
option for you guys so uh don't think

103
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,120
too deeply into it don't start bashing

104
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:09,439
it just yet you know give it a shot it's

105
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,759
kind of fun I will tell you that the the

106
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,560
resin potency wise goes up more in my

107
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,240
opinion than three stars the the high

108
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,478
that I have from that hit of what was

109
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,280
considered a three star dry sift that I

110
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:24,560
wasn't even hitting to bump that up to

111
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:27,439
the Quality that this is right now I

112
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,918
can't say enough about it um I probably

113
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,120
will do a video with the pressing of the

114
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,439
buds when I finally get a little t-shirt

115
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,840
press because the hair iron just uh

116
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,120
isn't releasing any resin from the buds

117
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,318
so uh yeah stay tuned for that and of

118
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,439
course stay tuned for Barcelona I'll be

119
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,360
leaving uh in the next couple of days to

120
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,240
fly down for spannabis and we'll be

121
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,639
doing a large uh a huge variety of

122
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,120
videos down there I hope and most

123
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,840
importantly the one I'm really excited

124
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,399
about is Hash Church Todd McCormack set

125
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,478
up with Ben droners the owner of the

126
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,758
Sensei seed Museum in Amsterdam as well

127
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:04,159
as down in Barcelona that we are going

128
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,400
to be able to film in his 15th century

129
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,520
building uh that is approximately you

130
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,478
know 10,000 ft of just epicness uh Ben

131
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,799
does not cut any Corners he's a real

132
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:16,839
quality guy and it'll be interesting to

133
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,639
see uh you know hash Church filmed at

134
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,719
the at the Hemp Museum so please come by

135
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,879
and check that out next Sunday live it

136
