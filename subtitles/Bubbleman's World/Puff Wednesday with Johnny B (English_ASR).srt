32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,240

33
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:38,759
exotic cushy terpinolene Congo thing

34
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,438
going on I think uh can clean it with

35
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,799
some cush cleaner we could do cush

36
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:46,599
cleaner absolutely I'm pretty much going

37
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,600
to try them all we could do that no

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,280
problem he's

39
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,520
cleaning making sure it gets off nice

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,039
and clean there we go okay so this is

41
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:01,840
how we clean our resin oh my God lemon I

42
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,239
said that out loud didn't I lemony

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,920
goodness lemony goodness what's what's

44
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,640
that this is the carb cap and it's a

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,800
tricky carb cap because there's hash in

46
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,479
it I love that and as you put it on here

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,680
you're going to melt this hash and it's

48
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:16,000
going to drip down we call that a ninja

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,159
dab it's a ninja dab of sorts but it's

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
like a NeverEnding ninja dab so uh just

51
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:24,039
be aware of that while you're uh while

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,759
you're dabbing this up puff Wednesday

53
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:30,840
woohoo with Johnny B it's been so long

54
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,679

55
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,280

56
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,879
heck we get to together every Sunday at

57
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,878
hash church but other than that it's

58
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,560
really been like two ships Crossing in

59
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,719
the night I see him at events but we

60
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,158
don't we haven't even really been able

61
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:45,959
to hang out at the events it's been kind

62
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:47,799
of crazy I saw you at lift and I was

63
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,640
like on the last day and I was like hey

64
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,920
hey hey hey whoa you're here he's like

65
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,518
yeah I'm like I missed ASR he's like I

66
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,679
know oh my God does that ever look

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,959
beautiful that little just that little

68
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,200
piece that melted off looks so nice A

69
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,840
little bit of that

70
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,639
I'm going to do the same thing basically

71
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,959
know it's goodable this carb

72
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,079
cap it keeps giving you a rip long after

73
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,519
you've taken your

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,680
rip it works it does work too there's

75
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,200
definitely that aspect of it I'm always

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,599
B those things that work really well 8

77
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:25,518
for one solventless resin works very

78
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:27,839
well yes it surely does now those TPS

79
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,400
I've tried a lot of TPS a lot of TPS are

80
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,719
out there right now everybody's got some

81
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,519
kind of TP or this lot of TPS you know I

82
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:36,878
even have these TPS here but nothing

83
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,959
like these

84
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,560
TPS like it's truly a different flavor

85
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,158
well it's just different levels right

86
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,719
you know when you first uh well it's why

87
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,318
there was a star rating created for uh

88
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,039
full melt and I think it's why there's

89
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:54,039
going to become there's going to be a

90
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,598
rating uh uh attributed to tpin at least

91
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:58,039
in the sense like the way we will say

92
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,479
fresh Frozen whole plant well we might

93
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:03,479
want to say organic green house whole

94
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,919
plant you know over in if you've made it

95
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,919
out of trim if you've made it from uh

96
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,359
like Indra was doing with that's really

97
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,839
strong uh it like Indra was doing with

98
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,199
his

99
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,040
um uh Tarpin yeah he was talking about

100
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,680
that on hash Church there on Sunday if

101
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,319
you just missed the last one that was

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,478
hash Church 105 105 wow this got clean

103
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,800
actually I'm pretty impressed with how

104
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:30,079
clean I got the dish and John was

105
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,918
talking about and GR

106
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,599
which is you know what

107
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:37,000
like just even listening to him talk

108
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,759
about his experiences over the years and

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,759
the amount of time that he's put into he

110
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,439
was kind of like hidden in the

111
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,360
background he just it was all he was

112
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:45,560
about it was pretty cool that you know

113
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,400
the research that he's done over the

114
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,478
years that he's now sharing of course on

115
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:52,839
half Church which is the best place to

116
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,959
listen to that what we say bombs being

117
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:56,638
dropped yeah he was doing the Cal trap

118
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,918
on his oven and getting his turps out of

119
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,560
his uh out of his slab so I think all of

120
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:02,799
those things are substan different and

121
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,759
there should be almost like you should

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,240
put that on the packaging not just that

123
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,960
they're cannabis derived but they're

124
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,280
derived from an oil slab or they're

125
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,918
derived from trim or they're derived

126
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,478
from you know top quality organic Bud

127
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:16,319
whatever it is even if they are caught

128
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,879
in that in that in that trap or if

129
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,120
they're disit I mean if they're

130
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,519
steamed however however they are they

131
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,680
should it should exactly it should be

132
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:26,000
marked and that's going to give almost

133
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,319
like a star rating for turps yeah you

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,879
know I'm not looking for people's

135
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,680
techniques to find out exactly what

136
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,319
they're doing but I want want to know

137
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,160
what the starting material they used was

138
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:39,080
I definitely have a high interest in

139
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,720
knowing that hey we had a plan we did we

140
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,000
got a little stoned but now we're going

141
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,560
to get into that plan which was to kind

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,639
of talk about some of our puff

143
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,079
Wednesdays that we've done we we've had

144
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,600
some puff Wednesdays on boats we've had

145
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,839
some puff Wednesdays on boats and on

146
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,479
Bridges and on mountains and in gondolas

147
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,399
and uh freaking in vehicles and on decks

148
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,199
and we've definitely had some good ones

149
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,599
for for me reminiscent one of my

150
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,840
favorite puff Wednesdays would be the

151
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,960
time we went up to Squamish and did the

152
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,000
gondola that was amazing I thought that

153
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:11,239
was a pretty quality puff Wednesday I I

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,360
thought that was one of my favorites

155
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,240
it's something that I always like to

156
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,720
talk about is you know that Gondola trip

157
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,759
you ever get a chance you got to go up

158
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,840
there did we ever do a puff Wednesday in

159
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,919
Spain or Amsterdam or Toronto or I think

160
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:25,638
we in Spain didn't we do a puff

161
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:28,439
Wednesday with ton and and jibs and jibs

162
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,960
and we in the gothic that was fun that

163
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:31,519
was a couple years ago and I got that

164
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,839
reminder on Facebook see that's why I'm

165
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,719
reminding about the puff wedes get your

166
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,959
your memory remind your memory reminders

167
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,520
and and one was the one where we're

168
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,839
sitting together and and and and we look

169
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,918
like kids I commented on it today with

170
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,598
the mothership yeah you're like cuz you

171
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,159
just got the mothership just crazy cuz

172
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:48,918
that was a couple of years ago I guess

173
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,880
what that means is that John and I have

174
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:56,240
aged incredibly poorly in the last few

175
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,959
years falling apart here people falling

176
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,598
apart so let me give you another Rip but

177
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,359
even with the way and how things have

178
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:05,120
happened over the puff Wes days first it

179
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,800
was that we did that we I remember the

180
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,840
the dry sift rip that we first did and

181
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,319
that was coming back from as I'm in 2012

182
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,560
and it wasn't really a puff Wednesday

183
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,720
but it it's kind of what led into all of

184
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,879
these these puff Wednesdays yeah it was

185
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,000
really the beginning of sort of us doing

186
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,639
videos together and I mean I wasn't even

187
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,360
really doing that many videos at that

188
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,439
time I just remember I didn't even have

189
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,680
one you had this resin you were so

190
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:29,719
stoked about and I was like I am going

191
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,240
to show this guy something cuz cuz I

192
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,160
didn't know you very well I didn't know

193
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,639
either I didn't know so I'm going to

194
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,199
show this guy something and I think he's

195
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,038
going to be pretty stoked I had no idea

196
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,560
you'd be as stoked as you were but then

197
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,000
yeah we just cleaned this resin up and

198
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,399
it took forever a very small amount it

199
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,720
was like an hour plus of time that that

200
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,598
we that we worked on it just carding and

201
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,319
carding and carding we even spilled some

202
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:53,878
of in a little bit yeah and when we

203
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,039
finally got it to when I got it to 99.9%

204
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,199
heads and we did that rip and we filmed

205
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,439
that rip oh my God that was uh that was

206
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,038
for sure a bit of a game game changer

207
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,560
for me it was a total Game Changer it

208
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:06,079
changed everything for me and what I

209
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,759
knew about hash and resin like you

210
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,120
showed me something that that no one

211
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,080
showed me before and you were just like

212
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,319
hey check this out dude I'm like how

213

215
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,439
dry sift all the time even still and

216
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,280
that was only a few years ago three or

217
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,120
four years ago now I think it was

218
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:26,799
2012 uh when that happened so about 2012

219
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,879
December 13th yeah okay wow so almost

220

2013 it was almost 2013 look at lovely

221
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,000
mix I gave you the shatter Congo this

222
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,959
time with the cookies and I dipped you

223
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,559
into some grape

224
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,958
ghost so through all the puff Wednesdays

225
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:44,000
we've always had different types of

226
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,838
always being solventless we've and then

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,519
how how the how it's evolved even with

228
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,640
the static sifting to the raw and like

229
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,959
puff Wednesdays have gone through all of

230
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:54,799
these changes and the quiver that you

231
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,679
created over the years it's just like

232
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,719
yeah the solventless quiver is is for

233
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:01,319
sure a real part of our lives these days

234
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,240
and as we sit out here on in a late

235
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,519
September you know just going into fall

236
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,240
here in British Columbia absolutely

237
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,959
beautiful day it must be 22 or 23° which

238
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,720
over 20 it's going to be 75 to 80° at

239
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,838

getting an Indian summer up here not bad

242
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:24,479

243
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,958
September is usually pretty nice here so

244

00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:36,039
be puffing blls with Johnny B it's been

249
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,360
quite a

250
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,719
while after spending so much time

251
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,560
together filming so often puff Wednesday

252
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,040
was one show we filmed we used to film

253
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:47,479
much more often than that it was uh big

254
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,319
changes in the last couple of years

255
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,399
since I had a baby and John got more

256
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,839
into his own channel and picking up more

257
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:56,519
products my God baby is just so amazing

258
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,680
yeah he's wonderful it's a it's a great

259
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,240
thing to have kids well I think it's um

260
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,319
the way the industry is changing and

261
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,159
with business and and and the new

262
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,680
systems that are coming forward and and

263
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:10,600
of course you've been so busy with of

264
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,159
course Turin yeah turpins have been a

265
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,320
lot have been taking up a lot of my time

266
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:17,360
you know when Tony started Blue River it

267
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,720
was a natural thing to

268
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,200
um you know give support to it due to

269
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,240
the quality of the product that was

270
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,879
coming out you know it was just it's

271
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,200
just such a high quality product it was

272
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:30,000
easy for me to get behind and be

273
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,680
supportive of it I had no idea aidea

274
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,480
that I was going to end up starting a

275
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,838
blue river in Canada and uh and sort of

276
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,399
promoting and supporting him that way

277
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,160
it's been great I know that the

278
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,879
collaborations that we do between our

279
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:45,120
two Brands down in California have been

280
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,759
extremely well received the T awesome

281
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,200
the turp oil and the uh the turp rosin

282
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,799
and turp bubble uh that are available

283
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,278
down there through Harborside and the

284
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,359
BPG Berkeley's Patient Group and and

285
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:59,320
many other places that are slowly

286
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,919
starting to pick these up it's it's

287
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,278
Beyond exciting you know to be able to

288
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,159
have uh I wish the mechanism was here

289
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,278
that I could be a part of my own brand

290
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:10,000
you know how hard that is for me I know

291
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,879
to not be able to promote my own hash

292
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,879
and my own products but that's the way

293
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,240
the system is with the tpin it still

294
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:18,519
feels pretty great to be able to uh you

295
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,240
know to bring a great uh to bring a

296
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,519
great product to the hey something that

297
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,039
adds like we were always saying we

298
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,720
scratching the surface and every time

299
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:28,439
something new and great comes out

300
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,278
something else follows absolutely right

301
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,120
and and and then this whole mixing even

302
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:33,679
with with the health well with health

303
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,078
Canada with the new

304
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:39,719
ACM PR y all those different regulations

305
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,679
were how you can't use any solvents for

306
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,278
extractions even if it is your own stuff

307
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,879
like that but like rosin just kind of

308
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,159
flew right into there like just like

309
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,120
under the raadar I went yeah you're

310
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,439
really all these little things that we

311
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,720
can do and it's it's really good to see

312
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,079
how everything I do we can do and that's

313
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,160
I was going to say how we can continue

314
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,838
doing what we do we're lucky in that

315
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,240
sense well you know what um I don't

316
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,480
think it was luck I think it's just uh

317
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,879
okay it's luck well we we fought we

318
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,560
fought well we're still fighting there's

319
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,799
still places being shut down and access

320
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,319
is going to be really really hard for

321
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:13,278
people who are looking for different

322
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,040
kind of concentrates I don't think this

323
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,120
last fight was for dispensaries I think

324
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,078
it was for hom growing it was for hom

325
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,560
growing that fight was now the fight

326
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,239
will be for dispensaries that fight for

327
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:24,958
dispensaries cuz it's a different aspect

328
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,480
you know because the dispensary model is

329
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,879
a profit driven business it's just

330
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,759
different than someone fighting for

331
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,600
their right to grow cannabis which is

332
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:36,198
not a profit driven business access is

333
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,040
super important I just think well we all

334
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:40,278
know it wasn't even a thought the most

335
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,399
important thing was being able to get

336
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:45,439
the right to grow and so now now it's a

337
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,799
matter of getting more people access I

338
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,839
was speaking with Ramo on this very

339
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,359
topic today and it was just sort of like

340
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,680
it's like yeah just let the Growers who

341
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,519
are able to and the and the people who

342
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:58,000
want to distribute through dispensary

343
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,519
models that are able to follow the

344
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,480
simple rules and and you knowx

345
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,720
regulations regulations and test all

346
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,240
your products I think uh I'm looking

347
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,480
forward to that day there's no way we're

348
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,399
not going to have dispensaries in Canada

349
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,480
there's just no way and we can't with

350
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,799
the amount that are are thriving the

351
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,920
ones that are popping up all the new

352
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,240
ones that are popping up at different

353
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:21,078
districts now it's it's not like just

354
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,198

356
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:27,240
essential to people like people need

357
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,600
those they go to them every day and

358
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,720

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,920
she starts smiling and I reach in my

366
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,680

367

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,039
away she was talking about her pain and

374
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,000
everything while she was working at ups

375
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:01,879
71 she's been there for 15 years she go

376
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,440
I could throw them around before but not

377
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:06,439
anymore wow and she's using cannabis for

378
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,120
her pain that's cool I thought that was

379
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,720
pretty cool it's just what came up in a

380
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,078
conversation you know what I mean like

381
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,240
um very cool just good stuff like that

382
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,278
yeah it's access has to be granted for

383
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,159
sa the 70 yearold lady who needs

384
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:20,039
cannabis where is she getting it from

385
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,240
guarantee she's getting it from a local

386
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,399
dispensary in town well the same way

387
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,278
people don't want to be controlled and

388
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:31,360
and and sort of forced to purchase from

389
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:33,278
an LP there are other people who want to

390
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,480
be don't want to be controlled to and

391
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,439
forced to buy from a dispensary so I

392
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,720
think we should have farmer markets yeah

393
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,959
