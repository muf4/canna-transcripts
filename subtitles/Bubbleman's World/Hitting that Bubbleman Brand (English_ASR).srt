able to um Locate some of this as I

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,680
don't believe that there any drops were

57
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,959
actually made I think it just kind of

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,080
got traded out amongst uh close

59
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,158

maybe you could come on camera and tell

70
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,958

71
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,639
you know yeah you know what's going on

72
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,840
but feel free to take a couple

73
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,958

75
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,759

when you're trying to fix the camera you

95
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,199

walker TP

97
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:48,720
oil I think that one was in the 70s 70

98
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:50,439
percentile with 15 15 plus 15 20% turbs

99
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,080
had you tried that one yet is that your

100
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,439
first time hitting oh

102
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,918

cush it's a nice little sunset here so

106
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,918

107
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:14,359
yourself a little rip of uh let me take

108
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:15,799
a little rip of the dog walker dog

109
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,280
Walker's right here and then do lemon

110
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,199
remedy yeah lemon remedy and so the

111
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:22,038
lemon remedy was the one that ended up

112
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,360
going for first at the emerald cup sure

113
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:27,120
did right okay I wasn't 100% sure but

114
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,080
it's a delayed reaction you know like a

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,918
month or so right but uh you know they

116
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,599
were I guess you got to respect the fact

117
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,318
they'd go back and you know they're

118
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,759
trying to live to the standards of their

119
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,039
competition whether things were entered

120
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,038
under different uh understandings or not

121
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:46,038
but it was um distillates were

122
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:47,159
disqualified and anyone that failed

123
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:49,120
pesticides or

124
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,919
microbial was

125
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,879
also

126
00:05:50,918 --> 00:06:01,198
disqualified and so our uh lemon remedy

127
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:03,279
flower oil y was a 3:1 uh SE dvda to

128
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,800
thca and

129
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:09,198
uh and also had like I think 11% tpine

130
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,120
so it was like kind of a 3 to one to one

131
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,319
right 3 to one: one it's delicious it's

132
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,399

134
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:19,598

167
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,639
of these it's not a brand that's easily

168
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,079
represented you can't just throw

169
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,478
anything together for the bubble man

170
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:40,318
brand it really has to be um that

171
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,478
special special so well I think that was

172
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,000
also 2016 it was good that we kind of

173
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:46,038
got some stuff out there and there's

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,038
definitely

175
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:49,439
some know people are like oh why don't

176
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:51,598
you make more of it and things and it's

177
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,839
it's just uh one of those things where

178
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,279
it's like you got to have a certain

179
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:58,839
facility in standard and thank God knock

180

little time so figured we'd uh oh it's

209
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,439
the first time I hit these

210
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:12,439

211
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,440
yeah lemon remedy remedy and dog

212
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,560
walker that lemon remedy is just so

213
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,600
unique it's a true

214
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:23,679
blueberry afgh cross from a buddy named

215
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,480
Nick

216
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,519
really like I say it over and over you

217
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,240
know you can't make good resin

218
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,120
uh products extracts if you will from

219
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,879
bad no grown cuz for a while people

220
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,039
thought that extracting was creating

221
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:42,759
quality but then they slowly realize

222
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,679
that extracting is actually unveiling

223
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,480
whatever happens to be there you're just

224
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:50,159
unveiling it you don't um I mean in a

225
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,278
sense you you do make the appearance of

226
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,039
it to be better because you're smoking a

227
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:56,480
much Pur product and it affects you in a

228
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,360
more concentrated way but really all you

229
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,039
do as an extractor a hash maker is you

230
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,000
unveil the quality that the plant and

231
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,559
the grower have already um you know

232
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,639
spent months working on yeah and in the

233
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,000
beginning you know we were just kind of

234
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,679
pressing flowers but like you could see

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,320
the difference so when you take this

236
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:12,639
particular lemon remedy it almost grows

237
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,120
like a very naughty almost like an OG

238
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:18,639
mhm a little bit bigger it's got kind of

239
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,159
the pine cone uh shape to it and I asked

240
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,439
him you know don't trim it don't don't

241
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,480
touch it just hang it cure it and as

242
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,880
soon as it starts to bend you know and

243
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,000
just barely snap off then go ahead and

244
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:32,879
cut it right into a directly into a

245
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,120
turkey bag right so I got it that way

246
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:40,720
and then it was uh cured cold for a long

247
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:43,200
time um I would say a good month and a

248
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,399
half so the tricomes in a sense that

249
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,720
last bit of the curing mhm we did in the

250
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,839
freezer like in a a cold

251
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,278
dry uh environment so we did like kind

252
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,720
of a fresh cure kind of snapped off then

253
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,278
kept it really cold for a month what's

254
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,079
up gentlemen and then pressed that out

255
