8
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:42,359
Boy from TGA genetics and it was

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,960
originally bred accidentally actually by

10
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,519
bad boy who had he was breeding I can't

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,320
remember the three strains that he had

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,160
in the male pollen but he basically came

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,079
up with this bad boy uh the Astro Boy

14
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,759
this is the watermelon feno and um we

15
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,079
actually if you watch the video of me in

16
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:02,679
Nelson or in Proctor when I was with my

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,558
good friend Ron hickey we were making

18
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,519
bubble together outside in the snow and

19
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,560
we ended up making the watermelon bubble

20
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,359
he gave me a cut or two and I brought

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,799
them back and spread them out amongst

22
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,478
friends John and myself and John managed

23
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,560
to grow them up really nice and big and

24
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,519

so I mean this hash particular two to

77
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:51,120
three weeks of of just drying get to get

78
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,920
it into a situation where it could

79
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,239
cure all right golden scoop so yeah it's

80
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:00,000
uh when I when you look at it it's it's

81
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,000
crunchy it's beautiful and then if you

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,079
push together it's just perfect so yeah

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,639
it's uh you wouldn't think it's bubble

84
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,840
hush you would be like wow what's

85
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:13,958
this just want to give a shout out to

86
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,399
subcool and Jill the TGA crew they've

87
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,918
always been sort of family they've

88
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,159
always really um uh backed us and

89
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,560
promoted bubble bags and the and and the

90
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,800
way of of water extraction and they've

91
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,839
always been just good people sharing and

92
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,280
educating and and passing on you know

93
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,758
great genetics like

94
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:36,359
a plant like this I feel is is a special

95
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:39,879
plant it's a very special plant so I

96
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,720
guess um we've got our injunction

97
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,199
Happening Here in Canada we're hoping on

98

to court and we're going to find out

100
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,759
that our uh licenses will be extended

101
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,240
that's pretty much what has to happen

102
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,639
for us that's what's going to happen and

103

00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,959
and not you know what I mean I talk so

166
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,519
much about it but well now you're

167
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,598
focused on growing tricomes more than

168
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,680
growing

169
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,839
plants I take a better look at it 100%

170
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,918
because you're using just it's

171
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,439
definitely now I'm just my like my my

172
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,839
next videos are all on just I'm taking

173
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,759
my whole everything's going to Hash I

174
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,239
like the sounds of it's beautiful you

175
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,960
know what fresh froz and we're going to

176
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,400
freeze whole plant freeze the whole

177
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,000
thing yeah that's definitely what's

178
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:39,560
happening to my entire this whole plant

179
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,720
right here when it's buted out I'll show

180
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,439
you on video I'll be taking it I'll be

181
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,639
potentially hanging it over a screen and

182
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,399
doing some light bouncing of the whole

183
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,639
plant over a screen collecting the very

184
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,878
very finest that we can separating any

185
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,439
stigmas or cyith hairs capitate stocks

186
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,280
um uh pistolet hairs any of those things

187
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:00,399
will get out we'll have the purest of

188
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,519
the pure of the pure and then from there

189
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,918
I'll probably uh wet wash the majority

190
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:07,279
of my my crops and I might make a little

191
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:10,279
bit more dry sift depending we'll see

192
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,000
what happens there you go yeah I'm

193
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:14,559
pretty excited about it let's hope that

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,598
we can continue to do it oh you know

195
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,158
what let they're saying there in the

196
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:20,000
local papers and stuff you know a lot of

197
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:21,439
the Mayors aren't taking a look at these

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,759
small Growers that are growing a few

199
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,959
plants and stuff like that you know

200
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,520
they're not saying it's legal but um

201
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,079
like ourselves and stuff like that you

202
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,519
know there small little medical grows

203
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:32,360
for medic

204
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,639
mhm you know what take a look at law I'm

205
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,560
not going to get into the whole we've

206
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:37,240
talked about this on our previous shows

207
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,718
but absolutely pay attention to the

208
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,360
courts on March March 18th and then wait

209
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,000
for outcomes on the 31st hopefully and

210
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,720
let's just pray and uh you know what uh

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,320
we're getting close here to 420 I think

212
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,399
and and our next and our next puff

213
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,640
Wednesday is going to be in Barcelona

214
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,480
yeah we'll be arriving in we'll actually

215
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,720
be arriving in Amsterdam for our next

216
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,839
puff Wednesday so our next puff

217
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,000
Wednesday could potentially be in

218
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,720
Vancouver

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,519
in Amsterdam and in Barcelona so how's

220
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,200

221
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,200

225
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:25,340
the little arrow on the head so just in

226
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:27,679
case you slip you get a little bit of

227
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:30,000
[Music]

228
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,239

I know see how H you tonight cler

230
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,639
beautiful that's what did to me the

231
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,639
first

232
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:44,759
time so good so big shout out to Bad Boy

233
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,279
and the TGA crew subcool Jill Ron for

234
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:50,799
growing this great resin

235
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:53,958
here and and sharing you know it's funny

236
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:56,919
cuz he was at my place when bad boy gave

237
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:58,919
him this cut and so then I end up going

238
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:00,639
back I get it I give it to John John

239
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,759
takes it to his house he cares for it he

240
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,319
cuts them makes more clones brings a

241
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,120
couple over here and now here it is

242
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,680
again so this is the wonderful thing

243
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,639
about sharing cannabis and I want to

244
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:12,599
extol upon you the importance of never

245
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,639
hoarding genetics I know you seed

246
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,079
breeders think it's a good idea don't be

247
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:20,078
a feared uh everyone should share the

248
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,278
genetics do the best job you can

249
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,039
breeding what you've got to work with

250
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,200
but don't feel bad if someone takes your

251
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:27,599
hard work and and does something

252
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,800
different with it crosses it with

253
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,240
something or makes something that might

254
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:33,120
even be more interesting than the thing

255
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,079
that you made originally with it maybe

256
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,320
it'll be less uh nice than what you made

257
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:41,399
originally with it but share those

258
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,760
genetics out there do not hoard strains

259
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,720
it's very important uh if we're going to

260
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,200
claim that this is truly a medicinal

261
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,720
thing and a gift from you know from the

262
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,800
higher Powers then it's a great thing to

263
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,639
share so I'm very happy to be a part of

264
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,120
this little circle of sharing the

265
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,799
watermelon so it's very nice yeah

266
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,120

273
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,880
hard time finding him you can find him

274

Spain so we're going to see you next

284
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,000

00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,399
of a fun show of us heading to the

286
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,958
