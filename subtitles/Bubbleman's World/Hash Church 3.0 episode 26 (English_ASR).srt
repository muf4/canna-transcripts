strong as [ __ ] is skunkman Sams thcp so

48
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:18,359
are you taking like a micro pin tip head

49
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:23,598
of that or how are you I I took a couple

50
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:27,680
of regular siiz uh dabs of it and it it

51
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:31,759
uh it it was a bit you know creeper at

52
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:37,560
first and then I smoked the third one I

53
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:40,799
smoked uh half rosin and half

54
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,598
thcp and about the time I finished that

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,080
one I was getting pretty hammered from

56
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,439
the first two and uh yeah before long I

57
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,440
couldn't

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,720
walk literally lost the fun motor

59
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,598
functions in your legs or you just fell

60
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:01,120
well I no I could walk but I had to hold

61
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:04,878
on to the walls and I felt like I was

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,878
doing the Shimmy Shake as I did

63
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,920
it what it kind of reminds me of is if

64
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:15,519
you eat a lot of THC and it goes through

65
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:18,759
the liver pass first liver pass and then

66
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,080
you end up with 11 hydroxy that's it

67
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:23,039
reminded me almost more of 11 hydroxy

68
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,120
than

69
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:29,239
THC because I smoked I Vaped it but how

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,319
long how long did it last what was the

71
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:38,200
on said how long was the oh it it it

72
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:44,399
lasted quite a while long it onset was

73
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:45,479
not but uh it it had long duration very

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,280
long

75
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:53,199
duration can you give us any type of an

76
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:55,759
hour two hours 15 minutes no no time

77
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:59,518
designation no because I was too [ __ ]

78
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,239
high man dude that I don't think enough

79
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,079
people

80
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,560
understand how ridiculous that is what

81
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:04,560
you just

82
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:08,919
said I was too [ __ ] high when's the

83
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,759
last time you were too [ __ ] high when

84
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,280
you ate like a hundred hits of acid not

85
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:16,599
very not very recently but if you try

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,918
hard enough sooner or later you do

87
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,959
succeed ain't that the truth I'll say

88
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,839
that is the truth even for myself who I

89
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,918
don't claim to have the same level of

90
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,918
tolerance as you I can puff pretty good

91
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:32,478
but every once in a while I surprise

92
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:34,799
myself and I just find myself like woo I

93
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,439
uh I destroyed

94
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,240
myself well I mean I can remember at

95
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:43,600
Legends where we would get so [ __ ]

96
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,960
high on that Afghan Hubbly Bubbly

97
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,560
smoking you know full melt clear dome

98
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:54,159
but I could still

99
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,560
walk right it's true it's true I could

100
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,479
still walk that's true the only time my

101
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,879
walking was ever affected was the first

102
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,758
time I ever smoked at your house and I

103
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,199
could still walk although it was a lot

104
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,759
like John C and the funny walk Monty

105
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,280
Python clip I was still doing it not

106
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,840
being able to walk is a serious level of

107
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,839
highness that uh I think I've only

108
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,879
really experienced on psychedelics or

109
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:22,318
maybe eating large when I've seen it

110
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,240
more is when you orally eat several

111
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:28,280
grams of

112
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,879
THC that will get you to that point also

113
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:34,079
so was was it an and immediate Peak did

114
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:37,639
it come on gradually when you came down

115
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:41,279
was it come down grad it was more of a

116
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:44,840
creeper and uh I I'm not sure about when

117
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,239
it actually left because I was smoking

118
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,439
by then I was smoking hits that was half

119
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,240
THC and half

120
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:56,839
thcp and uh but it was high enough that

121
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,639
the next day I didn't want to smoke

122
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:03,359
it did the M try it to to also gauge her

123
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,000
or just you alone yeah

124
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,280
right I tried everything I could to

125
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,399
persuade her to take it but she was too

126
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,959
smart for me she knows you like the back

127
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,279
of her hand dude what are you talking

128
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:17,399
about you're not going to persuade her

129
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,879
to get lit on

130
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,879
thcp that's

131
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,800
insane but I'll come over and hit some I

132
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,759
was about to say if she's not you know

133
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,319
I'm more than happy to volunteer myself

134
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,160
to uh you know experiment it's serious

135
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,120
serious it's only scientific

136
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,360
experimentation ladies and gentlemen

137
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:42,280
strictly yeah a a interesting way to try

138
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:45,800
it might be because it it has no tpes

139
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:49,879
and it has no other canabo so it's

140
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,879
pretty you know

141
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,960
uh it it doesn't have

142
00:06:53,519 --> 00:07:00,079
individuality you know uh the way we

143
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:02,519
enjoy with cannabis products but

144
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,038
uh for example let's say you were going

145
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,719
to roll a joint and you smeared some of

146
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,240
this on a cigarette paper before you

147
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,240
rolled it I bet you anything that would

148
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,639
instantly make the strongest joint

149
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,160
you've ever smoked and it would taste

150
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,439
good would you like do like a a a thin

151
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,960
line with a pin on the paper or would

152
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:26,319
you just spot dab it on the paper what

153
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,198
whatever somebody enjoys doing is what I

154
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,120
would

155
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,319
do but but a thin line would actually

156
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,079
work right like a I never smoke

157
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:40,360
marijuana as you know so I'm merely

158
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:45,079
speaking theoretically here you

159
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,319
know theoretically hat it right lots of

160
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:49,439
ha

161
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,199
going I've been waiting to hear someone

162
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,680
puffing on this thcp for a while so Sam

163
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,800
it's not the stuff you want to be taking

164
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,720
to concerts and putting in joints and

165
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,120
passing over to stre I don't think so

166
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,759
because I think if you passed it to

167
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,280
somebody who was a naive user it might

168
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,319
be too much for him you know it'll give

169
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:12,478
them you know a bad trip on

170
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:15,639
marijuana so it would be a like a just a

171
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,918
straight THC High just constant

172
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,158
consistent elevation as you said since

173
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,478
it was a creeper that would definitely

174
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:24,598
be something not comfortable for a neoy

175
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,158
user for sure because they want to feel

176
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,319
they've arrived at an area not the

177
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:31,038
people that I've been around that I've

178
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,479
gotten too high that was their

179
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,080
explanation was like I keep getting high

180
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,919
I keep getting higher it won't stop

181
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,599
getting high you see it even more

182
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:43,799
commonly at CH with uh oral when people

183
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,278
eat hash cookies and they eat they eat

184
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,519
one or two and they're not getting that

185
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,320
stone so they eat a couple more and then

186
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,240
the first ones start coming

187
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,240
on and then time

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,120
stops well I'm going to have a dab all

189
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,639
this talk of Davin I got a little

190
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,639
grandma

191
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,639
oh

192
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:16,000
Frozen because I I don't know how THC is

193
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,320
created in other words is there a thcp

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,679
synthes is it a different feed stock

195
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,920
that's going in and therefore the THC is

196
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:31,759
it uh in other words if you look at the

197
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:36,000
CBD synthes it produces CBD but it also

198
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:40,480
produces about a 20 to1 ratio of

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,078
THC along with the CBD so maybe this is

200
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,560
also being produced by one of the other

201
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:48,559
syntheses I I just don't know where did

202
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,359
you extract is there a particular

203
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,518
genetic you extracted this from or is

204
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,759
this just a culmination of things that

205
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,320
you

206
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,559
extracted I'll I'll explain that to you

207
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,120
later I don't want to do it in public

208
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:06,039
understood thank you kindly appreciate

209
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,440
it you mystery scientists good luck with

210
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,719
that think the last time I was too high

211
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,120
was with when I when I spent time with

212
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,399

glass chunk Sam and you clicked off a

236
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,879
piece and the sound of the click made me

237
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,680
go what the hell and you passed it to Ed

238
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,679
and Ed packed a pipe and passed it

239
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:34,399
around and my eye is rolled back in the

240
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:36,319
back of my head and next thing I know I

241

308
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,439
know a little bit more liquidy than

309
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,679
shatter have you experimented with

310
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,639
evaporation temperatures when does it

311
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:22,719
tend to evaporate no I I don't know any

312
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:24,919
of that kind of [ __ ] yet my shit's hot

I'm

315
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:34,680
high yep I I I went right to the you

316
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,240
know the core of the issue which is you

317
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:40,439
know what is it like compared to pure

318
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:44,399
THC because I'm experienced with that

319
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:47,319
and uh yeah it leaves THC in the

320
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,799
dust you like that Sam like are were you

321
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:54,000
like my new best friend when you took a

322
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:59,078
couple of pup no no no because I really

323
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:03,720
like uh THC with the right Suite of tpin

324
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:03,719
that is my cream DEA

325
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:13,240
cream so is thcp uh Sam is it uh is it

326
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:16,599
an effect that that is uh immediate or

327
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,720
is it no it's not immediate it's more of

328
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,839
a creeper it's more of a creeper even

329
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,839
with the turps add it or was this when

330
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,880
you just hit

331
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:30,920
it I'm talking about without the uh

332
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:30,919
turps just the thcp itself

333
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:36,159
interesting huh Dr Mark is trying to get

334
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,480
in right now and it's giving him some

335
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,958
weird baloney here let me see if he

336
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,319
can't get in well while waiting and

337
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,679
always fun to do a interaction part

338
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:48,240
that's fun on YouTube is let's ask

339
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:51,318
everybody who's watching us what are

340
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,000
they smoking right now well no what we

341
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:55,318
could do is we could play a different

342
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,278
game it's called let's guess what Dr

343
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:58,919
Mark is GNA say to me as soon as he

344
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,399
comes online

345
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:03,919
[Laughter]

346
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:07,640
he's he's GNA say that there's lots of

347
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:10,279
people who say who sell thcp in America

348
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:14,919
but it's all uh

349
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:17,599
Delta uh nine Delta 8

350
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:21,240
THC in other words they just didn't

351
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:24,639
clean up their thcp the way they claim

352
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,880
and here he is there's the

353
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,480
man good morning

354
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,200
Mark morning doc

355
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,599
hey what's up guys how are you howdy

356
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,600
Mark I already told him everything

357
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,279
you're gonna say so you could just save

358
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,279
your breath

359
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,440
and so is it is it delta8 or is it Delta

360
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,919
9ine Delta eight and a half that's

361
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:54,960
what's

362
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:59,880
happening Del huh because I also got

363
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:03,319
delta8 THC from the same folks

364
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,320
that's so funny oh

365
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,720
man I can hear Kevin I can hear Kevin

366
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:11,399
seet now they're making a new marijuana

367
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,400
crack called

368
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:19,399
thcp we should tell him it's THC PP and

369
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,519
that way he'll go around telling

370
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,679
everybody whatever you do don't smoke

371
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,679
the

372
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:29,119
thcp No No No don't touch the

373
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,200
peeee did you see it Mark or hear

374
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,798
anything that was

375
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,519
discussed yeah I did um so it is

376
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,879
synthetic right

377
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:43,519
Sam yes it is knew was gonna go for that

378
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,480
one it's made synthetically that's

379
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:49,400
correct right so how do you compare it's

380
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,240
actually it's actually made from a

381
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,600
natural material bio but it's

382
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,400
synthesized from that

383
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:59,079
correct yeah

384
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,038
well everything must be made from a

385
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:05,000
natural material unless we're importing

386
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:07,359
feed stocks from Mars everything comes

387
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,038
from Earth

388
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:13,158
right even stuff stuff on Earth from

389
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,158
space yeah even the stuff from Earth

390
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:19,200
came from other stars so where does that

391
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:20,400
end damn star stuffer yeah why does it

392
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,880
end at

393
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,640
Mars nature isn't on Mars that's

394
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,919
like yeah [ __ ] Mercury and Venus you

395
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,919
know

396
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,919
right is there life on

397
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:38,919
Mars ask Mr Bowie he would know by now

398
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,880
right exactly Ground Control yeah so so

399
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:42,960
it's synthetic right so that means it's

400
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,280
made by a chemist in a

401
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:51,798
laboratory not by a producer of a

402
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:55,240
cultivated plant at a grow right so this

403
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:58,879
is a different same things it was first

404
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,079
isolated from a plant by the Italians

405
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,440
and

406
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,439
uh but the yield in a plant is

407
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,640
0.0000001 so it's not practical to

408
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:12,158
extract

409
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:16,280
it probably for good reason if it's as

410
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,280
strong as you say it is I hung up

411
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:23,038
here no we could hear you

412
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:26,200
mark you're just a little CH just stuck

413
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,359
my back okay back yeah so um it's it's

414
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,919
only there and a trace them out well

415
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:32,719
again could this uh be one of the uh

416
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,559
things that leads to the Entourage

417
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,440
effect even if it's in Trace Amounts but

418
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:41,000
30 times more active could it be part of

419
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,000
the cannabinoid soup that makes things

420
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,798
more active as an extract versus a

421
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,839
natural can thcp has not been found in

422
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:54,639
all that many varieties so I I I don't

423
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:58,038
suspect that's true well like a proton

424
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,200
NMR yeah well I was perhaps it's part of

425
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:03,158
that characterized fraction of what's in

426
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,319
there and now that there's analytical

427
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,480
standards for it we could actually find

428
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,720
it that doesn't mean that it hasn't

429
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,038
hasn't been there all along it could be

430
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,640
there could be that so this is the the

431
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:18,200
canabo with the

432
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:20,320
C7 side chain the N the thc's got a C5

433
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,278
side chain the c3s are the

434
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,278
varens um it would only go to show that

435
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:27,720
there's a

436
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:31,159
distribution of all of those chain

437
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,159
lengths in the molecule from C1 all the

438
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,120
way up to maybe even C11 and and and and

439
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,840
and and higher so those are going to be

440
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:40,439
higher molecular weight um but they're

441
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,000
all going to have kind of like the same

442
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,480
cannaboid structure they're just going

443
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,519
to have different tails and I guess the

444
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:53,519
um the uh thing that I I've wondered is

445
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:55,558
again uh you know the um group that

446
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,960
looked at making you know those

447
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:02,079
compounds uh Sam with the two methy

448
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,360
groups um next to the Benzene ring so

449
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,158
it's thought of that the that uh

450
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:08,879
methylene that's next to the Benzene

451
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,600
ring is an active site for oxidation in

452
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,600
the liver so what they did is they put

453
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:15,879
two methyl groups there to block it and

454
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:19,119
so there's a bunch of compounds I think

455
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,760
the JW compounds or maybe they were H

456
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,839
compounds that's what they were hu

457
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:26,558
compounds made it Hebrew

458
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:28,519
University that were C7 but they had two

459
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:31,240
extra methyl groups right next to the B

460
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:34,038
Benzene ring to block metabolic

461
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,359
oxidation at that benzilic position so I

462
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:37,079
always thought that that was interesting

463
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,079
that this is just sort of like the

464
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:43,038
linear version of a C7 versus kind of

465
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:45,038
like C7 in a sort of different isomeric

466
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,200
form I guess the other thing that you'd

467
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:51,038
have to think about is again the an

468
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,640
antimic purity of the starting material

469
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:56,879
tpine that you're using with so um so

470
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,559
the way that you make these

471
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,400
compounds is you re act something called

472
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:05,720
PM diol under acidic conditions with the

473
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,600
dihydroxy Benzene derivative so this

474
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,159
would be a dihydroxybenzene with the

475
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:13,278
with the C7

476
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,480
substituent and that's a difficult

477
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:18,480
reaction and it's difficult to make that

478
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:22,038
dial so uh these I hope that what you're

479
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,558
smoking here comes from the laboratory

480
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:27,679
of experienced chemists because not only

481
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:29,519
to make that reaction work well so the

482
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,278
product is clean

483
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,278
uh the starting material is a little bit

484
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:35,200
of a challenge to you don't just snap

485
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:38,798
your fingers and get it you do derive it

486
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,720
from lyine but it's it's a it's a diol

487
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:44,359
that's derived from lyine and it uses um

488
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,480
oh there's an oxidation in there I don't

489
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:49,199
know if it's peracetic acid or hydrogen

490
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,480
peroxide but something that can go boom

491
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,720
in that prep when when I tried to get

492
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,079
this a couple months ago I couldn't

493
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,120
because they hadn't yet successfully

494
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:01,439
separated the uh

495
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:04,479
uh

496
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:10,000
thcp from the

497
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:13,120
uh uh Delta 9 from the Delta 8 thcp but

498
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,798
now they have successfully separated the

499
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,439
two so basically what you're saying

500
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:20,319
ladies and gentlemen is you're hearing

501
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,919
Dr Mark tell you is don't try this at

502
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,879
home yeah and the people who are making

503
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,720
this or in pharmaceutical Laboratories

504
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,240
doing preparative chro chromatographic

505
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,880
separation that you need $100,000

506
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,759
equipment and really highly trained

507
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,559
staff imagine because I know the people

508
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:41,759
that uh that are over there across the

509
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:44,678
pond who Sam's getting this from so I I

510
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:48,240
hope again yeah there's um well you got

511
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:51,559
to remember too that uh gwiz it was a

512
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,640
couple months ago Max monrose said he

513
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:57,158
had

514
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:00,038
thcp remember that

515
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:02,159
Marcus yeah yes vaguely I do sorry I was

516
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:03,240
reading I'm trying to he never showed up

517
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,320
with

518
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:10,480
it oh he never did at at the time you

519
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:14,678
mark were worried about uh whether or

520
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:17,240
not it was truly thcp or or or uh you

521
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,399
wanted to analyze it and I was in favor

522
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,759
of you doing that because I was

523
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:26,479
skeptical also Mark that's the first

524
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:28,960
thcp I've ever seen so I've I've only

525
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,120
heard it as a mythical unicorn and now

526
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,120
I've actually seen the Unicorn it's

527
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:39,599
pretty yep and if it was turpine rich

528
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,440
with the right tping that you like I bet

529
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,439
you it would be unbelievably

530
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:59,240
wonderful THC mixed with tpin but let me

531
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,119
tell you you don't want to smoke

532
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:08,200
you you want to you want to smoke the uh

533
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:10,319
uh THC with the Turpin in resin or

534
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,480
something because it's way more

535
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:18,158
enjoyable and actually less THC will get

536
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:21,159
you higher than pure THC of an equal

537
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:24,000
weight yeah I was talking with um

538
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:27,080
Michael bakas and he was saying or or

539
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,200
maybe I heard it here uh about how the

540
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:33,678
uh he was doing modul ations with uh he

541
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,278
was feeding people high THC early in the

542
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,559
day and later on he was feeding them low

543
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:42,798
THC high turps and they were getting

544
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:45,480
higher later in the day uh because of

545
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:48,720
the you know the less THC because of the

546
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,240
saturation uh in the cv1s and then just

547
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,399
coming by back behind it with the turps

548
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,159
re stimulated reactivated it and

549
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:58,959
re-elevated it uh higher than it was

550
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:03,880
Prior yeah I'm I'm convinced that it was

551
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,919
the TPS that enabled original Haze of

552
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,640
Select

553
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,559
cultivars uh you could smoke it and no

554
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,640
matter what time of the day you smoked

555
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,599
it no matter what you've been doing

556
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,520
whether you've been up all day or you've

557
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:22,199
just woke up you would get higher from

558
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:25,599
one big hit of on a bong of uh original

559
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,319
Haze weed it it always got you higher

560
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:31,278
there was no ceiling I'm positive that

561
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,278
was strictly the

562
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,479
tpin what was that at the gray area they

563
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,240
used to have the uh the One Bowl

564
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,079
challenge or the one hit challenge what

565
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:43,159
was that where you go it sounds like

566
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:46,359
triome challenge but that was Adam that

567
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:49,000
was Adam at THC yeah he did that at the

568
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:50,599
Cannabis Cup he had the chair set up

569
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,240
I've seen some amazing ones I've

570
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:56,959
actually got some old ones from the 90s

571
00:27:53,240 --> 00:28:00,200
on video of him like just he also made

572
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:04,120
it almost imp possible to finish a

573
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,720
triome bowl mean right he couldn't cough

574
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:09,119
for a

575
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,558
minute [ __ ] enormous it was enormous

576
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,278
and he would hit it that I remember a

577
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,278
couple years it was out of a like three-

578
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:17,079
foot glass bong right it was a tall

579
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,798
piece as well

580
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:22,038
right I got video of the tallest where

581
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,839
he had the big chair set up it was like

582
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:26,960
you got to sit in the chair cuz the

583
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:29,439
pipe's like five or six feet long it was

584
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,440
unbelievable got all kinds of silly

585
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,759
people to do that from uh you know uh

586
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,880
film porn stars to Woody harelson to

587
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,960
yeah Miss not really much difference

588
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,799
between those two

589
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,798
but also crazy

590
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:50,240
Sean yeah he he I I saw him do that to

591
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:53,918
hundreds of people and I did it once or

592
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,038
twice but uh the Bulls are too big I I

593
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,559
like a big bull but not to the point

594
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:03,000
where it's makes me uncomfortable he he

595
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:04,678
actually has fish um on there doing it I

596
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,558
think two or three of them got did the

597
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:09,278
Tricom challenge like when they went

598
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,558
there in the late 90s and uh or maybe

599
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:15,798
early 2000s I can't remember but he had

600
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:17,918
all footage I I tried it failed failed

601
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:20,119
hard but it was a fun

602
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,880
fail

603
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:25,000
true that's awesome I wonder why Johnny

604
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,519
B never came in for a visit look like a

605
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,038
nice day over there Dr I one time took

606
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:34,240
about a ounce of dry sift over there and

607
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:37,519
uh remember Matt used to work with them

608
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,679
oh yeah okay he knocked it over and it

609
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,880
fell all over a shag

610
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,640
carpet oh dear God the is that why he

611
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,559
moved

612
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,278
away no it's not why he moved away it's

613
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:54,158
why he should have moved away he bounced

614
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:54,159
to California to work with Jeff at

615
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:59,278
aqualabs is that's where he ended up I

616
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,079
think so I if my memory serves me

617
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:05,960
correct I mean Jeff's probably watching

618
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:08,720
he can either correct me if I'm wrong or

619
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:12,399
confirm

620
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,480
oh hash Bean yeah someone's like it

621
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,479
reminds me of hash Bean doing gauntlets

622
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,159
with one of the hundred glass bongs he

623
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,038
has that that guy was nuts the the most

624
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:23,080
impressive one I saw hash Bean do is

625
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:26,319
where he built the little tent that he

626
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:28,359
sat inside and he turned on his volcano

627
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:32,000
until you couldn't see him in this tent

628
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:34,798
anymore and it was a clear tent it's

629
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,720
pretty wild miss that guy always had a

630
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:40,639
good time imitate the cynthian what's

631
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:43,440
that was he trying to imitate the

632
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,440
cynthian I mean honestly I think he

633
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,880
was you know hash Bean right he he's the

634
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,519
kid that oh yeah hash Bean he used to

635
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,399
light bongs at the Legends he sure did I

636
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:59,919
mean water pipes Hubbly Bubbies Hubbly

637
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:59,918
bubblies Hubbly bub

638
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:05,440
Dude tell you those Hubbly bubblies

639
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,120
those are special Legends needs to get

640
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,278
some Hubbly bubblies so if you're from

641
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,038
Afghanistan if you have access to Hubbly

642
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:14,079
bubblies Legends of hash needs to have a

643
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:16,599
couple of its own Hubbly bubblies for

644
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:19,960
the ritual because wherever Legends

645
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:22,278
happens it needs to have that aspect to

646
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,798
it I just don't think it would ever be

647
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:28,398
the same without that prop bubbly yeah

648
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:30,798
one year we even set up TVs with old

649
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,719
footage someone's footage from the 70s

650
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,038
of like puffing Hubbly bubblies in

651
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,679
Afghanistan so while we're in line in

652
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:40,638
the restaurant leading up to the Hubbly

653
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,559
Bubbly on the TVs there's like these

654
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:44,119
dudes doing the same thing just in

655
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,558
Afghanistan puffing these Hubbly

656
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:49,158
bubblies and it was a pretty pretty

657
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,759
pretty magical experience what what we

658
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:56,278
should also do is maybe get some sort of

659
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:59,119
a Le laser cider site so that we could

660
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:02,839
see how Flame the how high the flame

661
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:05,079
shoots up after you take a big draw so

662
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:07,599
does it shoot up one foot does it shoot

663
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:09,918
up two feet does it shoot up three feet

664
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,918
four

665
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,278
inches yeah exactly if hash Bean was

666
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:16,559
hitting it it was going to hit the full

667
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:20,398
two plus feet I'll tell you

668
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:22,599
that yeah well I used to watch the flame

669
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:25,079
from the Hubbly Bubbly and try to

670
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:28,240
estimate how many grams of hash was in

671
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,240
that flame

672
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:35,479
oh my God good

673
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,480
times very good

674
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:43,000
times I'm just trying to keep up with

675
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:46,558
the chat there's also uh I'm supposed to

676
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:52,880
in the next month or so get

677
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:58,319
thcb which is uh another uh uh isomer of

678
00:32:52,880 --> 00:33:03,240
THC but it it uh is weaker it's only

679
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:03,240
supposed to be about 25% as strong as

680
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:15,038
THC

681
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:15,038
thcv no TC b as in baby b as in baby ah

682
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,960
beta got

683
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:24,558
it that's the C6 is that right I believe

684
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,759
so yes it it was also discovered by the

685
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:29,158
Italian

686
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:32,119
group that found the

687
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:35,320
thcp yes also yes I think they even

688
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:35,319
found the B first I

689
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:46,000
forget here to our Italian Brethren yeah

690
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,320
the Italians always popping up you know

691
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,759
like for a country that's been so harsh

692
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:53,359
against herb for so long telling you

693
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:55,158
it's not like the most herb friendly

694
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:58,319
country or at least it was well but they

695
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:02,039
always they always had a very large

696
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:05,638
uh cannabis industry for hemp uh they

697
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:08,358
had the finest quality hemp in Europe

698
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:10,799
and then after they sort of the industry

699
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:12,559
died down in Italy the French sort of

700
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,440
took it over but they were really

701
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:20,679
producing seeds more than uh the the the

702
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,679
French weren't mass-producing fiber they

703
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,720
they were yeah yeah it was the Italians

704
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,639
that made that Gardella Machinery that

705
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:30,878
was uh it would take get straight off

706
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,519
the the take off the core and you'd be

707
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:37,239
left with wet green uh fiber hanging

708
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:39,639
straight I mean it's pretty amazing

709
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:42,078
stuff back in this is the early to mid

710
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,800
90s so uh I don't even know if they're

711
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,359
still around but they made some of the

712
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,399
finest decorticator and because it was

713
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:51,799
done wet like that they were able to

714
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:56,480
immediately comb it and have a nice uh

715
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:59,880
natural uh delated you know hemp it was

716
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,838
also had a fine weaving also had a

717
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,920
better golden color yeah it had a better

718
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:07,000
golden color when they would uh than

719
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,159
what we would get in Hungary and Romania

720
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,599
and the Czech Republic because out there

721
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:16,399
it's field red and it lays in the field

722
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,359
and uh molds get on it and it turns gray

723
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,800
well we actually we actually water

724
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:22,719
redded ours but yeah it's a lot of the

725
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,480
Polish definitely came out grayer

726
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,559
because they were field rating it and

727
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,559
it's just an actual bacteria eating the

728
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,239
lignan people that what kind tends to

729
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,719
cause it to go that gray color in the

730
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:36,719
field whereas we would take these large

731
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:38,679
cement baths and submerge our hemp in it

732
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,000
so that the ligan and the natural

733
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:42,679
bacteria would eat at the lignan and

734
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,838
then you would able to just peel it

735
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:47,759
right off the core whereas that Gardella

736
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:51,239
Machinery did that right out of the

737
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:56,480
field you know right into a truck so it

738
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:56,479
saved time money expense because

739
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:27,039
again

740
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,800
okay just just a minor hiccup there no I

741
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:38,599
got bounced and I'm recording it so I

742
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,640
can upload it to the podcast afterwards

743
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:43,160
and I guess now that I got bounced it'll

744
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:45,838
be two separate episodes or at least

745
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:49,799
part one in part two recording in

746
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:52,759
process imagine hearing that 25 years

747
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,640
ago what oh everybody would have shut

748
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,920
off he'd be like what happened to hasher

749
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:57,719
I don't know all of a sudden this thing

750
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,720
says recording and everybody turned off

751
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:01,759
and right away that happened all the

752
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:04,118
time at the dead

753
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,520
show I'll call you from a pay phone and

754
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:07,920
let you know what happened hey that must

755
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:10,239
have been what was keeping Alice and

756
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,358
John out or they just literally just

757
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,479
came in at that exact time but yeah I

758
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:16,239
think my computer was jacked up welcome

759
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,440
both of

760
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,799
you morning

761
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,720
everyone

762
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,839
mornings Miss I Haven been here in a

763
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,039
while yeah it's good to see you Alice

764
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:31,480
how are you

765
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:35,119
I'm good good to see you all too

766
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:37,760
yeah there's a question for Sam one

767
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,720
question does he feel there is one

768
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,319
mother variety to all cannabis or what

769
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:46,279
is his view on how it evolved I feel it

770
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:49,559
had it was one ver variety that migrated

771
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,560
from a central point

772
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:58,079
myself

773
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:58,078
Sam I'm not I'm not sure if

774
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,880
where he says it originated in Tibet

775
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:10,559
three million years ago but uh I I

776
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:13,480
honestly do not know because the oldest

777
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,880
cannabis remains they found are just

778
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,000
tens of thousands of years old other

779
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,880
words they don't have any seeds or

780
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,519
pollen or fiber or stocks of flowers

781
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:28,000
anything that's older than tens of

782
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:30,679
thousands of years so uh

783
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,039
I really don't know I'm very very

784
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:36,118
curious and I I I could speculate but

785
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:37,960
that's all it is just

786
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:39,680
speculation yeah a lot of us have

787
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,039
speculated it possibly goes back to

788
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:44,559
gondwana land when it was one land mass

789
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:46,400
but we can't find any you know and

790
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:50,318
certain as you know certain continents

791
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:54,639
just never had it uh you know for

792
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:57,679
example there is no cannabis remains in

793
00:38:54,639 --> 00:39:01,559
America older than 500 years pre

794
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:04,199
Colombian there uh there's no pollen No

795
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:08,639
Seeds no fiber no

796
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:10,318
flowers there is none in in the Americas

797
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:13,118
North or South

798
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:15,159
America that's crazy this is is this

799
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,358
like John mcpartland's work do is he

800
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:22,519
isn't he like John mcpartland did the

801
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:25,598
Tibetan where he he says that evidence

802
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:28,880
steers him towards Tibetan Plateau three

803
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:32,039
million years ago but does not have any

804
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,519
remains that are even uh 50,000 years

805
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:38,719
old it's a theory there's no concrete

806
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:42,679
proof correct absolutely correct and and

807
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:46,000
I like John a lot I like his work but uh

808
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:48,000
that all it is is a theory at this point

809
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,119
is that basically what we saw in Liden

810
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,440
that he presented with all the pollen

811
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:54,559
that is the same paper that where I

812
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,440
asked him some difficult questions

813
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:00,159
afterwards basically where he admitted

814
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,480
that there were no physical remains that

815
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:06,838
were 3 million years old or even 30 even

816
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,838
50,000 years old

817
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,318
inbet that's pretty

818
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,599
interesting hey Mark if you uh like to

819
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:19,800
invite John onto Church um I'm working

820
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,000
with him on a current project so I've

821
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,000
been in touch with him lately yeah of

822
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,559
course

823
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,800
anytime yeah so let's talk about that

824
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:29,799
and just give him some advanced noticed

825
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,240
because he does have medical practice

826
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:35,599
and is often committed to seeing

827
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:38,639
patients and uh like more than an

828
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,640
hour yeah and Well on Sunday I'm sure

829
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:43,920
he's not seeing patience so yeah let's

830
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,879
try to set him up to come on hash no

831
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,920
you're wrong he has been working on

832
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,519
Sundays he's been helping with the covid

833
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,440
doctoring uh in

834
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:58,318
Vermont

835
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:00,440
yeah crazy times anyway

836
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:04,318
awesome thank you Dr Mark I'll

837
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,318
definitely pick you up on that do it

838
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,318
up awkward

839
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,119
silence I'm gonna have bounce here in

840

842
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:23,039
San janaro which is one of the great

843
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:25,598
Italian festivals that happens in lower

844
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,759
Manhattan is happening this afternoon

happy hash church I'll have a sausage

849
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:42,640
peppers and onions for you yeah please

850
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:45,358
do um one topic I wanted to to touch on

851
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:47,239
is um that's kind of been on my radar

852
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:48,679
for the past few weeks I've been been

853
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:52,078
working with Kevin mccaran over

854
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:55,879
medicinal genomics to identify certain

855
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,560
plants that I was recently uh would you

856
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,318
just call them recently acquired from a

857
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:02,679
a clone provider that is a well-known CL

858
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:05,559
clone provider in in another state and I

859
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:07,598
think it should be known that we out of

860
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:09,119
the 12 samples that we sent in eight of

861
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,519
them hit hot for

862
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,160
hlvd which would be hop Laden viroids

863
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:15,599
and these are really well well-known

864
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:17,239
varieties that a lot of people are

865
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,160
growing and I know other people have

866
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:25,679
these same cuts from the same exact

867
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,679
Nursery um so we're really trying

868
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:36,519
um and agriculturists to uh to really

869
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:39,799
work together and bring everyone's Minds

870
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:41,679
together to find a way to not only rid

871
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,359
the plant of this thyroid but um to

872
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,799
better understand how this is happening

873
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:49,078
and how it's being passed along um so

874
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,359
we're in the midst of testing uh you

875
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:53,519
know everything from water to see if

876
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:55,039
it's carry if if water is a carrier

877
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:56,559
let's say you're using a cloner and

878
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,318
you're putting a clone in with other

879
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:59,760
several hundred other other varietals

880
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:02,358
and you're looking to go into production

881
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,359
with that how is that being passed along

882
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:07,119
at what stage is it being passed along

883
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:08,920
and how to uh to essentially move

884
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,760
forward and and do make the right choice

885
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,920
to either send it to you know through

886
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,319
the right sop or protocols to R you know

887
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,680
rid the plant um so we don't have to

888
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:20,558
start over and we don't lose these

889
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:23,159
amazing varieties that we've all kept

890
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:26,160
for so long um because I think it's a

891
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:28,639
big conversation um that is a silent

892
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:30,118
it's a silent killer to to a lot of

893
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,159
varieties and a lot of people that don't

894
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:37,800
know they have it you you you can do

895
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:41,719
simple things like uh flame torch your

896
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:45,519
cutting tools between every plant piece

897
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:48,838
that you cut and you can use instead of

898
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:52,838
a big bucket of water you could use

899
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:55,719
little tiny tall skinny pipets of water

900
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:59,318
for each individual Branch so that

901
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:00,598
they're not contaminating each other if

902
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:04,239
that's the

903
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:06,079
problem yeah I think it's you know and

904
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:07,879
also in the same breath you know there

905
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,240
were some things that were in in a

906
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,640
cloner with these other varieties um

907
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:14,598
that did not test positive so there

908
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:16,719
there's some there's there's a lot to

909
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:20,640
understand here and there isn't any

910
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:22,519
guidance really at all um so we we

911
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:24,719
really need to better understand what

912
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:28,039
what what's what's happening how this is

913
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:29,598
happening um and you know I know that

914
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:31,279
these clones are in other people's hands

915
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,440
like I know other Farms that are growing

916
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,200
these exact plants um they just don't

917
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,280
know it um it's really have they have

918
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:40,279
they expressed the

919
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:49,480
problem it's highly likely that it's

920
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:52,000
really hard to to trigger these

921
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,960
responses um I think that things like

922
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,480
fusarium and other things like that that

923
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,039
are coming into play actually trigger

924
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:02,358
the plant's immune respon response to to

925
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:05,480
show more of these traits um you know I

926
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:07,799
I again these are really we're really

927
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,920
far off in terms of of factual evidence

928
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,079
here but we really need to understand

929
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,960
and have this dialogue because it's it's

930
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:16,559
that's alarming to me the these are

931
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,119
these are really well-known varieties

932
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,680
I'm gonna I'm not even going to talk

933
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:22,680
about what varieties they are but they

934
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:25,719
are really well-known varieties that a

935
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:27,399
lot of people love and cherish and and

936
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:29,000
yeah we just we really need to come

937
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,599
together as a community and try to

938
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,880
figure this out because I know there's

939
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:35,318
there's things like chemotherapy there's

940
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,318
there's light therapy there's there's

941
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:40,558
some TC you know that we can do but

942
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,719
again there's no real guidance as a

943
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:44,240
community um that I've seen to date

944
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:46,159
unless someone here on this panel and

945
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,959
that's why I'm bringing it up has any

946
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:51,838
information to share um I know Kevin

947
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,960
mccurnin and myself are really over this

948
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:55,920
next week we're going to be doing some

949
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,920
some other types of tests um I'm going

950
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,639
to retest those same moms take cuts from

951
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,760
different uh different parts of those

952
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:06,519
plants and try to uh Zone the part Zone

953
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:10,599
the actual mom into specific zones so we

954
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:12,838
can see if if hey maybe the you know the

955
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:14,400
left side of the plant wasn't infected

956
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:18,039
but the right side was you know these

957
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,480
are things that because it's a virus um

958
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:22,558
these are all possibilities well you

959
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,079
know who's done a lot of work with this

960
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:25,079
is

961
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:28,920
SRA right

962
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,880
they say they can successfully clean up

963
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:40,640
that virus from Plants they can identify

964
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,039
it then clean it up then guarantee it's

965
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,239
eliminated well there's a place here in

966
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,558
abbottford and as we're talking about

967
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:49,558
this we have mother houses and places

968
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:51,400
that I'm in in the midst of going

969
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,079
through a place was just destroyed two

970
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,960
days ago when everything was tested

971
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:57,800
positive for this virus I've seen it

972
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,838
we've been dealing with it's rapidly

973
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,039
going through the West Coast here these

974
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,279
strains um you don't want to name but I

975
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:05,400
know the strains that are infected

976
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,400
they're coming up from the US they fit

977
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,400
houses up here it's actually being

978
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,039
transported through thrips too so if you

979
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,960
got thrips and different bugs and you

980
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,000
got the strain you got a problem because

981
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,240
it went through one through through

982
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,079
another through thrips so we're having

983
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,959
it tested here in the Fraser Valley I'm

984
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,359
actually having my strain tested because

985
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,960
I actually have something that might

986
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:24,598
have passed on to me which I talked to

987
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,720
Mark the other day about talking with

988
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:29,720
SRA because this is a major problem it's

989
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,759
it's a major virus that's being passed

990
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:33,799
throughout the community and it's also

991
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,200
coming in seed it's also coming from

992
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,440
cutting so they're passing they're

993
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,039
breeding with it and these seeds are

994
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,079
being popped and we're seeing seeds

995
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:42,358
being popped that have no resin I'm in

996
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,839
the midst of popping one right now four

997
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:45,799
weeks in three of them are showing

998
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:47,239
nothing but traits the fourth one I took

999
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,519
out of my room it's sitting outside it's

1000
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:51,519
got nothing it looks like cabbage and

1001
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:54,119
that would be a cookies and cream purple

1002
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:56,159
punch cross GMO and I mean I'm

1003
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:59,920
identifying it I'm seeing it right now

1004
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:02,519
it is a it is it's real guys and it's uh

1005
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,519
it's a it's we're sanitizing things we

1006
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:07,239
have scissors attached to every mother

1007
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:09,159
you only use that scissor to that mother

1008
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:10,959
nothing changes you're talking about

1009
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:13,118
water we've never talked about water

1010
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,599
that's a major I'm looking at right now

1011
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,039
cuz the water is staying the same so

1012
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,720
when I went through one place right now

1013
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:21,880
and all seven ones went through so it

1014
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:23,598
infected one other house so now we got a

1015
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,280
hole out here everybody's kind of like

1016
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,920
freaking out right now as you're talking

1017
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:33,119
about this we're right smacking for this

1018
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:37,200
and I I know of 27 viruses which attack

1019
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:40,160
cannabis okay most of them there are not

1020
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:42,799
uh negative symptoms in other words they

1021
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:45,679
can have the virus but they don't

1022
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,720
express any negative symptoms no

1023
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:52,639
economic they need the

1024
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:58,519
vaccine vaccine maybe yes but that would

1025
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:58,519
be the Delta 9 vaccine yes absolutely

1026
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:10,720
uh I'd say of these 27 about half of

1027
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:16,679
them can be transmitted by clones by

1028
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:19,358
seeds by pollen so yeah it once

1029
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:23,598
something spreads it's a [ __ ] to get

1030
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:27,440
rid of it yeah we we tested for tobacco

1031
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:30,760
uh streak tobacco ring spot hops mosaic

1032
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:34,000
uh uh arabis Mosaic and cucumber Mosaic

1033
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,839
and none of those hit so you know we did

1034
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,960
do a

1035
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:42,798
spread um but like you you know someone

1036
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,280
mentioned was the test was the test was

1037
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:48,358
a test that you

1038
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:51,280
used specifically for cannabis or was it

1039
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:53,960
just a general test for the industry for

1040
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,920
the vegetable industry or something so

1041
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,920
Kevin I believe uses qpcr to do this

1042
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,039
medicinal G genomics carried out the

1043
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:04,480
testing um I didn't personally do the

1044
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:07,558
testing but I contributed the samples um

1045
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:12,000
well I'm I'm pretty I'm pretty sure he's

1046
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:12,000
testing specifically for

1047
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:19,240
cannabis the virus in general because

1048
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,838
there are test kits for the virus in

1049
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:25,118
general which aren't as good when you

1050
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:27,000
test cannabis with it I see yeah so I

1051
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,880
would imagine Kevin's got I mean his

1052
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,920
array in his lab is really impressive he

1053
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,720
has all the right instrumentation to to

1054
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:37,079
get the job done and he has ample space

1055
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:38,558
there and a great team um so you know

1056
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,280
and we're also going to be sequencing

1057
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:43,559
all these varieties and sequencing the

1058
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:45,240
whole genome just because it I think it

1059
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:47,798
would be great to understand if if this

1060
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:49,598
is also affecting the genome and and

1061
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:52,119
what type of Expressions that are are

1062
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,838
coming off of that um so it' be really

1063
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:56,440
interesting just to tie all these things

1064
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:57,838
together have some dialogue provide some

1065
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,159
guide guidance for the community and

1066
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:01,558
better understand the things that we

1067
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:03,318
don't understand um it was extremely

1068
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:05,160
alarming like I called him immediately

1069
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:07,119
when I started seeing these traits from

1070
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:10,078
these new things that were sent to me or

1071
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:12,358
we acquired I should say um well that

1072
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:15,519
that's on the negative side on the

1073
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:17,920
positive side is in the last uh three

1074
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:22,119
months they have published several

1075
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:25,280
papers one is on several genes which are

1076
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:29,200
resistant to powdery mildew and the

1077
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:32,000
other one is uh a gene which shows

1078
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:35,679
susceptibility so if you have these

1079
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,639
genes uh the resistant one is dominant

1080
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:40,759
which meant even if you just had one

1081
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:44,199
copy of it it it should confer a

1082
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:47,240
resistance whereas the uh I'm not sure

1083
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:53,318
about the uh susceptibility one whether

1084
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:54,479
or not it uh is uh uh dominant or or not

1085
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:56,639
well that's interesting you bring that

1086
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,280
up because this exactly what Kevin and I

1087
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,318
we're talking about is like the gene

1088
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,880
response you know C some of these

1089
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:04,558
varieties you know some of them are

1090
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:07,720
getting PM that were quite frankly

1091
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:10,079
resistant to them all along for for I

1092
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:11,879
don't know I mean i' grown some of these

1093
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,240
for for around 10 years and I'd never

1094
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,760
seen that type of uh response from these

1095
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:19,519
these these cultivars so it's really all

1096
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,400
these things and all this stuff is tied

1097
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:24,199
together I do believe that we just again

1098
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,079
we don't really know how where it's

1099
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:28,159
where these things are crossing you know

1100
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,160
touching each other and getting it or

1101
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:33,039
it's it is the scissors it is an open

1102
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,679
wound or not just so much to to

1103
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:36,318
understand um so I just wanted to bring

1104
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:38,558
it up because it does affect resin

1105
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:42,239
production it does affect our our

1106
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:44,880
ability to to um to work with these

1107
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:47,078
chemicals in in postprocessing so you

1108
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,000
know I just want to try to bring it up

1109
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:50,559
and just have good dialogue on it I'm

1110
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,039
gonna say there's lots of information on

1111
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,839
it right now hops Lon thyroid this

1112
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:56,679
warning shot to the Canadian cannabis

1113
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,798
industry some new websites coming on

1114
00:52:56,679 --> 00:53:00,598
right now how it was infected where it

1115
00:52:58,798 --> 00:53:02,480
came from out of California the saying

1116
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:04,519
it might have came from hemp I've done a

1117
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,240
lot of research on the papers I just

1118
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:10,679
talking about I gave to a friend

1119
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:13,598
yesterday but um definitely it's it's

1120
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:16,399
kind of like it's after the the market

1121
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,039
in the S they they talk about that it

1122
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:23,039
was first discovered by darkart uh

1123
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:25,719
Nursery in Northern California but I had

1124
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:28,719
read about the exact same virus in

1125
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:30,919
hopfields Poland uh more than seven

1126
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:32,199
years earlier there you go see that's

1127
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,200
that's where we got to really trace it

1128
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:35,879
back to it's interesting finding out

1129
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:38,078
more about this disease because we Haven

1130
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,400
been really looking at it but and like

1131
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,119
you're were saying it shows up on one

1132
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,039
side of the plant and it's just like one

1133
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,599
side is infective but what we understand

1134
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,558
the whole it's kind of like it's in the

1135
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:48,559
DNA it's in the blood if that one part

1136
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,839
is infected the whole plant's infected

1137
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,480
there's a lot of people been trying to

1138
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:53,639
pass on cuttings okay okay you take this

1139
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,880
cut and save it for me well that's how

1140
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:57,000
it really screw this industry right now

1141
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,119
because that's what's been happening

1142
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,798
everybody's been packing around those

1143
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:01,200
Mac one cups and all of these Skittles

1144
00:53:59,798 --> 00:54:03,159
and all these things I'm saying these

1145
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:06,000
names because it's real guys these

1146
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:08,798
strains have this this this virus they

1147
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,358
have the disease it's there I mean and

1148
00:54:08,798 --> 00:54:12,759
it's being passed through like I said

1149
00:54:10,358 --> 00:54:14,519
you through thrips through cuttings

1150
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,319
through pinching you pinch one strand

1151
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:20,318
you go to another you're passing that

1152
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:22,318
along it's dangerous as hell it is

1153
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:24,159
extremely you guys got to really pay

1154
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:26,119
attention to it if you have it kill

1155
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:28,159
everything start from seed go back to

1156
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:29,440
your old seeds wash a allot of new seeds

1157
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:30,960
it's like that's what we've been doing

1158
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:35,039
we just got rid of everything because

1159
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,039
yeah but SE seeds are not free

1160
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:53,880
of they outgrow it so they grow

1161
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:56,679
it in vitro and it grows they take the

1162
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,559
tip of the tip of the tip and it's grow

1163
00:54:56,679 --> 00:55:01,440
faster than the virus spreads in the

1164
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,359
plant so therefore you get if you do

1165
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,000
that a few times in a row you get a

1166
00:55:04,358 --> 00:55:08,519
clean piece eventually now I know why

1167
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,760
thank you for explaining that to me Sam

1168
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:11,280
that's that's I was wondering how they

1169
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,240
would do that but that that would

1170
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,760
explain it that's that's really cool to

1171
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:18,719
understand

1172
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:20,720
that hey welcome to Wade w sauce is also

1173
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:23,919
in the

1174
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:26,399
house how's it going guys what's up

1175
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,920
how's it going it's going pretty good

1176
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,960
you know started the morning off with

1177
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,079
Sam holding up some thcp telling us it

1178
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,798
was so strong he couldn't walk after he

1179
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:39,039
dabbed it a couple of times wow so that

1180
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:40,759
was an interesting start to the day

1181
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:43,640
probably uh probably not going to be

1182
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:48,200
getting any thcp anytime

1183
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:48,199
soon I'm good with h just the regular

1184
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,318
dabs that sounds intense just regular

1185
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,798
devs are strong enough I think although

1186
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:59,119
imagine the booth at like a cannabis up

1187
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:01,400
and it just said so you think you can

1188
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:03,519
dab and you're just like you're just

1189
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:06,160
scooping out big quarter gram dabs of

1190
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:08,239
the thcp for these Young Bucks that are

1191
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:09,759
like hell yeah I can dab I can dab like

1192
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:13,519
two grams at a

1193
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,480
time well it's easy to dab but the

1194
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:19,079
trouble is what's going to happen to you

1195
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:22,358
10 15 minutes later that it it's easy to

1196
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:26,079
get it down I I I smoked two or three of

1197
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:26,838
them wham bam thank you ma'am and you

1198
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,680
know

1199
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:30,880
wasn't that impressed and then I started

1200
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:33,399
feeling

1201
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,519
it well maybe they should pair up with a

1202
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:38,680
mattress company so then there's a

1203
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:42,960
couple beds nearby everyone hammock

1204
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:42,960
company maybe yeah there we

1205
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:49,318
go yeah how are you doing

1206
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:53,759
Wade oh I'm doing all right I I'm really

1207
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:55,960
in uh intrigued at uh Sam's experience

1208
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,160
with thcp we've been reading about it

1209
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:01,079
for a while now since it was found in

1210
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:03,838
Italy um and this would be the first

1211
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:07,640
person I've heard who actually consumed

1212
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:11,599
some of it and meantime Sam is well

1213
00:57:07,639 --> 00:57:13,400
known for enjoying heroic doses so what

1214
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,599
what was it actually like Sam I'm sorry

1215
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:18,200
for being late but I'd love to hear

1216
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:21,200
it you were a day late and a dollar

1217
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:21,199
short I'm sorry

1218
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:29,480
Wade it it was very strong

1219
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:34,079
it kind of reminded me more of

1220
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:36,318
11 uh hydroxy in other words if you eat

1221
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:40,240
uh a gram of

1222
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:43,038
THC uh you'll get very very stoned from

1223
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:47,399
uh you know like a Hashi cookie that has

1224
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:51,400
a gram of THC in it 1,000 milligrams and

1225
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:54,519
uh it for some people that alone and if

1226
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:57,760
not a second gram for sure will make it

1227
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:59,079
so that uh they can't really walk they

1228
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,920
get the

1229
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:04,920
staggers and uh it's not from the THC

1230
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:08,599
it's from the first pass through the

1231
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:10,280
liver and it comes out as 11 hydroxy and

1232
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:12,400
that's what's actually giving you the

1233
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,960
staggers it's very similar to the

1234
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,200
effects of THC but it's actually

1235
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,838
stronger than

1236
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:22,719
THC by weight is it fair to say that you

1237
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:26,960
felt it more strongly in your body as

1238
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:29,439
versus in your brain is that fair I I I

1239
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,798
think that's probably true I'm not sure

1240
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:35,000
if it started that way but it certainly

1241
00:58:31,798 --> 00:58:35,000
seemed to end up that

1242
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:43,079
way so you weren't like G to go for a

1243
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:46,838
jog uh no I had no I I had trouble

1244
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:46,839
walking from one room to the

1245
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:55,639
next that's uh that's something I was

1246
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:55,639
afraid I was going to fall over

1247
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:59,719
yeah one of those thcp

1248
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,079
accidents yes so do you think that this

1249
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:09,640
should be a product and unregulated

1250
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:12,559
Market sold like Delta 8 and other uh

1251
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:14,239
you know TC acetate I kind of think

1252
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:18,480
those should be in a regulated market

1253
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:21,719
too myself I'm not sure THC THC acetate

1254
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:28,358
is sold in an unregulated Market because

1255
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:33,959
under the federal law uh CSA uh THC

1256
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:37,159
acetate I is uh semisynthetic it's

1257
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:39,838
illegal so listen you having Pinocchio

1258
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:42,279
up on the screen there instead of your

1259
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:43,798
Dr Seuss one is this like uh is this a

1260
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:46,880
metaphor that you're all pulling our

1261
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:52,798
legs here today or

1262
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:56,798
no it's because I I was uh to stoned

1263
00:59:52,798 --> 01:00:00,400
before and I didn't notice

1264
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:04,960
all right all right all right there he

1265
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:08,960
is I I honestly did not even

1266
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:11,519
notice see what thcp does to you folks

1267
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,358
stay away from it it starts rotting your

1268
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,358
brain sell by

1269
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:22,400
cell I'll take it so what's uh what's

1270
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,519
going on in California with uh with

1271
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,599
Alice and and W sauce you guys are just

1272
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:29,159
growing weed and processing weed and

1273
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:32,160
smoking weed and making hash and kind of

1274
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:32,159
living that life or

1275
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:38,559
what go ahead this week had H there was

1276
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:40,920
Hall of flowers was pretty interesting

1277
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,559
it was my first like industry event that

1278
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:45,838
was like B2B so it was pretty

1279
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:47,640
interesting to see uh how the industry

1280
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:50,358
became just like any other industry

1281
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:54,879
right events with like free samples of

1282
01:00:50,358 --> 01:00:58,199
everything uh high THC strains and

1283
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,519
people making a trend out of it bunch of

1284
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:02,318
fun designs of companies that you look

1285
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:06,440
the design is amazing but once you see

1286
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:09,358
the product is uh not that interesting

1287
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:12,119
so it was fun fun to see and a bunch

1288
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:14,159
of like real Mark real marketing just

1289
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:17,280
like all the other products out there

1290
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:17,279
this doesn't look like the

1291
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,039
picture well like I had a was actually

1292
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:24,039
interesting

1293
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:37,199
processing less Harvest uh cash um but

1294
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:38,680

what about you

1300
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:53,000
Flynn yeah no I mean obviously the same

1301
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:54,640
as far as all the gardening stuff goes

1302
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,559
um but yeah I thought Hall of flowers

1303
01:01:54,639 --> 01:02:01,318
was pretty interesting I definitely

1304
01:01:57,559 --> 01:02:03,559
see I don't know more big money openly

1305
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:06,079
coming into the field and spending a lot

1306
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:07,920
of money on you know marketing and stuff

1307
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,200
like that marketing that product it's

1308
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,079
definitely

1309
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:14,838
getting the race just to get a license

1310
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:16,720
and like have stuff on the shelves is

1311
01:02:14,838 --> 01:02:19,639
getting less and less in the race to

1312
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:21,639
like price points and hitting you know

1313
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:23,759
hitting lower price points and stuff

1314
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:26,038
we've definitely seen like the

1315
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,400
solventless market change a lot in

1316
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:31,240
California in the last like year so

1317
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:33,680
that's true got way bigger like they're

1318
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:35,798
Brands now has definitely increased a

1319
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:38,078
lot of brands have started moving into

1320
01:02:35,798 --> 01:02:41,679
the space and putting out

1321
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:45,359
very consumer friendly products I will

1322
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:50,239
say respectfully next year they will

1323
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:51,960
have a uh State Fair in Sacramento for

1324
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:53,639
the State of California and they're

1325
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:56,679
going to have cannabis in it for the

1326
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:59,719
first time yeah I saw that actually in

1327
01:02:56,679 --> 01:03:02,719
the paper so or I'm I'm one of the

1328
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:05,480
actual ambassadors for the actual event

1329
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:08,798
uh for for it so we'll be promoting it

1330
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:11,278
and making it aware as well as uh yeah

1331
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:13,719
there'll be uh you'll be able to get the

1332
01:03:11,278 --> 01:03:16,239
same Golden Bear that you can get from

1333
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:19,798
any other Agricultural Product at the

1334
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:21,519
State Fair it'll be in July of 2022 we

1335
01:03:19,798 --> 01:03:24,079
have submission information that will'll

1336
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:26,880
be letting people know that now it is

1337
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:29,519
only open to Legal GR Growers licensed

1338
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,200
Growers at this time we had to start

1339
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:35,519
somewhere so I understand there's a lot

1340
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:37,239
of uh underground Growers who definitely

1341
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,960
probably could throw their hat in the

1342
01:03:37,239 --> 01:03:43,000
ring quite well however the it is just

1343
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:45,798
open currently to Legal markets so

1344
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,880
producers although I I will be opening

1345
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:51,159
up a small legal business and everybody

1346
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,880
that wants to give me a

1347
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:56,920
thousand I'll be glad to enter yours

1348
01:03:53,880 --> 01:04:00,358
into the contest because I know yours is

1349
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:03,278
best love it that's is it gonna be just

1350
01:04:00,358 --> 01:04:06,318
flower or will there be hash as well

1351
01:04:03,278 --> 01:04:09,000
it's just flower this year so I think

1352
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:12,679
DHC and CBD again this is the first

1353
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,760
start of the first you know launch in so

1354
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:16,798
it it it's you know we couldn't throw

1355
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,839
everything in the ring out the gate

1356
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:20,759
however I would anticipate since the

1357
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:23,358
foot is in the door we're going to see

1358
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:25,480
some progressions but you know stay

1359
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:28,318
tuned we'll see how it goes again it's

1360
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:30,519
the first time and it's as first that

1361
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:33,278
I'm aware of it's the first state to

1362
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:35,880
actually include cannabis within their

1363
01:04:33,278 --> 01:04:38,480
State Fair competition so I believe

1364
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:40,640
that's true that's interesting I just

1365
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,199
went to my first state fair ever and it

1366
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:44,719
was very interesting to see um how is it

1367
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:46,239
going to be like people are going to try

1368
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:50,159
the flowers or they're just going to see

1369
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:52,078
it it's going to be like uh a way for go

1370
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:55,278
in a building and see all the different

1371
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:57,119
flowers I would anti I I am unsure I

1372
01:04:55,278 --> 01:05:00,159
have been to the California State Fair

1373
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:03,200
and they usually show uh the first

1374
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:05,920
second and third you know so the ribbon

1375
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:09,038
placers and then a couple of the others

1376
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:11,119
uh it's never been done before so uh I'm

1377
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:13,278
unsure of the judging when it's going to

1378
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:15,920
take place how it is going to be judged

1379
01:05:13,278 --> 01:05:18,519
Etc at this time so it is still uh

1380
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:20,119
information we are gathering uh but as

1381
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:22,358
ambassadors we're just initially

1382
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:24,480
promoting the event and making people

1383
01:05:22,358 --> 01:05:27,480
aware of the submitt times and

1384
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,278
informations uh so that if they want to

1385
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:32,559
you know get involved they they know

1386
01:05:29,278 --> 01:05:36,798
where to you know come play I wonder are

1387
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:38,720
they going to allow Canabis retailers to

1388
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:41,038
have booths there I guess like they

1389
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:42,439
would at a cannabis event and will it be

1390
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:44,880
like a permitted event where they could

1391
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,519
sell not sure if they don't the first

1392
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,400
year they will the second year because

1393
01:05:46,519 --> 01:05:51,480
they're going to realize how much money

1394
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,680
there is that advertisers willing to pay

1395
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,639
Farm to

1396
01:05:52,679 --> 01:05:57,639
Table yeah so so here it is I have my

1397
01:05:55,639 --> 01:05:59,480
fact sheet up so who can enter the

1398

1430
01:07:37,719 --> 01:07:43,639
division so submissions will open in

1431
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:48,119

1433
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:54,400
there will be a promotional tour in June

1434
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:59,358
and then the California State Fair award

1435
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:02,119
uh celebration so that is fact sheet

1436
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:05,759
we does it say how they're actually

1437
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:09,278
judged by smoking by analysis

1438
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:11,278
or t the testing is one it is not stated

1439
01:08:09,278 --> 01:08:15,000
if smoking will be part of it I think it

1440
01:08:11,278 --> 01:08:18,319
will most likely be by testing analysis

1441
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,039
at this time I could be wrong I'm open

1442
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:24,640
to knowing more uh because I am an Amal

1443
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:26,238
cup judge so I I'm I'm curious to know

1444
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,719
where it's going to go but as

1445
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:30,798
ambassadors this is what we've been

1446
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:33,880
tasked with at this time I I understand

1447
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:37,479
and we we both know because we both seen

1448
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:41,000
the results of many analysis tests of uh

1449
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:45,039
cups and uh the one that's the highest

1450
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:47,359
in TC or the one that looks the best

1451
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:50,399
isn't necessarily the one that people

1452
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:52,600
think is the best so correct and I would

1453
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:55,439
anticipate like with since this is the

1454
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:58,199
first time in a new competition that you

1455
01:08:55,439 --> 01:09:01,479
you know these types of uh discussions

1456
01:08:58,198 --> 01:09:03,519
will uh be fruitful in that as things

1457
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:06,919
proceed forward because again since it

1458
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:09,839
is new as we saw with the arml cup it it

1459
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:12,399
changed over time as things progressed

1460
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:15,600
and I would anticipate this potentiality

1461
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:18,479
because of that specific uh um

1462
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,960
connotation that you stated Sam and how

1463
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:22,678
uh even though it looks good and looks

1464
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:24,920
as sexi it doesn't mean it is the best

1465
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:26,838
cannabis uh but of course that's still

1466
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:30,920
individual

1467
01:09:26,838 --> 01:09:33,719
subjective and individuals as a group

1468
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:36,359
will tend to agree but they all have

1469
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:39,600
their own preferences Some Like It with

1470
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:43,079
CBD Some Like It with particular tpine

1471
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:44,920
Suites and uh if that's your favorite

1472
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:47,439
that's your favorite it's not a matter

1473
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:49,119
of right or wrong it's that you just

1474
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:52,919
like something

1475
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:55,039
different so you know it's this is the

1476
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:57,560
the guide point so other state fairs you

1477
01:09:55,039 --> 01:10:00,880
know we've got you know quite a few what

1478
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:02,840
18 legal states now so uh including

1479
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:05,199
Washington DC but DC doesn't have its

1480
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,640
own Fair because it's not a state uh but

1481
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:09,719
every state I've been

1482
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:11,640
to has a state fair and some are

1483
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:14,079
definitely smaller than others some are

1484
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,400
larger uh California has its own

1485
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:20,198
permanent Pavilion with display areas in

1486
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:22,479
multiple buildings so I'm not even sure

1487
01:10:20,198 --> 01:10:27,119
it'll it'll be in the agricultural

1488
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:27,119
section most likely um

1489
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:36,198
very interested to see what the display

1490
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:39,039
display area will look like as well as

1491
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:40,678
what we'll be able to see as well you

1492
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:43,279
know will there be the posting of the

1493
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:45,679
results with the flowers Etc you know

1494
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:46,840
for people to see to get a better

1495
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:49,560
understanding about how it is

1496
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:52,880
technically judged I don't think I've

1497
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:56,719
even ever been to the State Fair grounds

1498
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:59,159
in Sacramento you have well come on down

1499
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:01,679
in 2022 to the California State Fair and

1500
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:01,679
come see the

1501
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:09,199
Cannabis i' I've been to some of the

1502
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:11,439
other counties but not uh the state fair

1503
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:13,799
I've been to like the Santa Cruz County

1504
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:15,439
Fair and some of the other ones yeah I

1505
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,000
wonder if it you know if it's going to

1506
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:19,399
be a countywide situation as well so

1507
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,359
that you know some of the counties can

1508
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:23,759
recognize now the state fair is because

1509
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:25,359
usually it's a secession you get the Lo

1510
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,400
the local then the county then the

1511
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:30,839
Regional and than the state so it's be

1512
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:32,879
interesting to see as things progress as

1513
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:35,520
well since this is starting at this

1514
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:38,760
starting point humbo County Fair is

1515
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:41,920
gonna be a good one then once they allow

1516
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:45,199

01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,239
just uh every year in shoulder season

1590
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:11,119
and I remember when I didn't know about

1591
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:12,799
mushrooms how I used to be bummed out

1592
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:14,960
about shoulder shoulder season because

1593
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,560
it's just rain and it's like oh we just

1594
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,119
had an amazing summer but the rain

1595
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,960
hasn't turned into snow yet this is just

1596
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:23,399
go into the forest and have a beautiful

1597
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,480
hike and it was always fresh and whatnot

1598
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:28,158
but then I discovered the mushroom

1599
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:31,039
and that really changed uh everything

1600
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:34,559

1601

1608
01:15:47,158 --> 01:15:51,079
they're not very big but I made a couple

1609
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:53,840
of soups last year with those ones and

1610
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:56,198

1611
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:59,560

1612

hi Colin and thanks for the call out um

1687
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:08,319
it's been a pretty challenging summer

1688
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:13,479
actually um pretty vigorous Fire season

1689
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:17,639
here in California um we had uh four

1690
01:19:13,479 --> 01:19:19,479
fires in Nevada county in one month all

1691
01:19:17,639 --> 01:19:21,279
of them caused by

1692
01:19:19,479 --> 01:19:24,718
humans

1693
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:29,198
um the uh me personally I've been EXP

1694
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:34,158
experiencing a lot of uh turmoil uh

1695
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:37,638
Within Myself uh a lot about uh all of

1696
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:39,439
the effort and years of uh time I put

1697
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:40,960
into trying

1698
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:44,198
to

1699
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:46,960
create reasonable regulations uh both

1700
01:19:44,198 --> 01:19:48,638
locally and at the state level and to

1701
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,639
see how

1702
01:19:48,639 --> 01:19:52,760
disastrously the legal Market is

1703
01:19:50,639 --> 01:19:56,600
unfolding for the people who have done

1704
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:58,960
this work over the years is is really um

1705
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,679
it's hard because I care a lot about

1706
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,840
cannabis I care a lot about patient

1707
01:20:00,679 --> 01:20:08,440
access I care about quality product and

1708
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:11,239
all of those things are um not doing

1709
01:20:08,439 --> 01:20:14,919
very well in the legal can California

1710
01:20:11,238 --> 01:20:16,919
Cannabis Market these days and whenever

1711
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,399
I hear people getting excited about the

1712
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:20,719
idea of federal

1713
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:23,799
legalization I just think of how badly

1714
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:26,480
California did it and cannot imagine

1715
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:31,480
that the feds would do any better at it

1716
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:34,799
so for me I um I have a few plants in

1717
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:38,479
the garden I'm I'm enjoying uh how

1718
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:40,760
that's going just the Simplicity of

1719
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:42,799
doing something I love because I love it

1720
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:47,520
not because I'm trying to change the

1721
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:50,800
world or um or even in this case in my

1722
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:53,760
case uh trying to find specific versions

1723
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:55,600
of cannabis that might be of help to

1724
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:59,199
certain families for

1725
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:01,600
example uh that work has been uh taken

1726
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:04,678
on by our local cannabis Alliance we've

1727
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,400
created a a donation program that's very

1728
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:07,760
closely modeled on what we were doing

1729
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:12,079
with caladrius

1730
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:13,880
network and um I'm grateful to the legal

1731
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:15,920
farmers and manufacturers and

1732
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,480
Distributors and retailers that are

1733
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,119
involved in that

1734
01:21:17,479 --> 01:21:23,479
program

1735
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:25,279
um so that's a good that's good but uh

1736
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:28,119
yeah for me personally it's been a rough

1737
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:31,439
summer between fire and some health

1738
01:21:28,119 --> 01:21:34,238
challenges of my own and uh like I said

1739
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:36,960
what's the growing realization of how

1740
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:40,198
badly the California legal scheme is

1741
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:43,840
working um yeah it's been a rough summer

1742
01:21:40,198 --> 01:21:46,119
I mean I'll just say uh the department

1743
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,600
of cannabis control which is the new

1744
01:21:46,119 --> 01:21:50,840

1745
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:56,120

01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:38,639
I I often think of forest as well even

1782
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:41,319
when I saw you come in today I was like

1783
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:43,279
oh man I gotta like I spoke to him a few

1784
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:46,198
times on Facebook but I know he's also

1785
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:48,039
had some uh difficult times and be good

1786
01:23:46,198 --> 01:23:50,119
to get him on here and maybe just spread

1787
01:23:48,039 --> 01:23:52,560
the love a little bit because we have uh

1788
01:23:50,119 --> 01:23:55,238
the whole Community has a huge huge

1789
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,840
respect for for both you and forest and

1790
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:58,399
the the things that you've done for

1791
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:01,279
catastrophically ill

1792
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:05,479
children uh and in you know just being

1793
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:07,399
kind and being real in an industry that

1794
01:24:05,479 --> 01:24:09,198
has a whole lot and I think you know

1795
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:11,439
when you were talking about how Federal

1796
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:14,119
legalization and I I always have faith

1797
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:17,119
in cannabis we got through prohibition

1798
01:24:14,119 --> 01:24:20,039
but now we're getting into a new battle

1799
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:21,880
and this new battle is you know when you

1800
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:23,319
go mainstream not only are the

1801
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:25,440
mainstream people who are going to try

1802
01:24:23,319 --> 01:24:27,000
and get those paychecks and who mastered

1803
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:29,359
those systems so they'll get themselves

1804
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,039
into position right away the key people

1805
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:34,279
that you don't want in those positions

1806
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:36,880
that's one part of it but then you're

1807
01:24:34,279 --> 01:24:39,880
also expanding and bringing in this

1808
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:42,600
whole new group of people that now has

1809
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:45,118
changed the face of what makes up the

1810
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:47,480
Cannabis Community because it used to be

1811
01:24:45,118 --> 01:24:49,639
this very small kind of rootsy group and

1812
01:24:47,479 --> 01:24:51,519
now it's like everyone it's like oh

1813
01:24:49,639 --> 01:24:55,118
you're all you're all in the group now

1814
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:58,119
and so I think it's taking time for our

1815
01:24:55,118 --> 01:25:00,880
subset groups to channel within those

1816
01:24:58,118 --> 01:25:03,559
groups and to actually find our

1817
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:05,880
foundation and be like you know because

1818
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:08,039
listen I remember when people were going

1819
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:10,639
to prison and I swear there was nothing

1820
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:12,479
worse than that that that was the worst

1821
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:15,560
we all have to agree about that this

1822
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:19,279
sucks and hurts my heart as well because

1823
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:21,639
it doesn't quite get you the way locking

1824
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:24,439
up our friends for life did that really

1825
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:27,279
got under our our asses

1826
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:28,839
this is more subdued and more like no

1827
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:31,479
but you can grow a few plants like don't

1828
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:34,279
worry about it dude like so I feel you

1829
01:25:31,479 --> 01:25:36,599
it's still a battle but uh think of the

1830
01:25:34,279 --> 01:25:38,319
battle we just got through that most of

1831
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:41,239
us never thought we were ever going to

1832
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:43,319
get through uh and of course you know

1833
01:25:41,238 --> 01:25:46,678
we're in another battle now and and

1834
01:25:43,319 --> 01:25:49,799
hopefully we you know good people can

1835
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:51,880
continue to put their intention towards

1836
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:54,360
good things you know to making things

1837
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:56,440
work out in a way that I don't mind if

1838
01:25:54,359 --> 01:25:59,399
people come up with ways that make this

1839
01:25:56,439 --> 01:26:01,719
better and make them profit I just don't

1840
01:25:59,399 --> 01:26:04,839
want people who are parasitic to suck

1841
01:26:01,719 --> 01:26:06,920
the life force out of our culture while

1842
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:08,760
using terms like we're trying to build a

1843
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:11,000
better culture it's like we already have

1844
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:13,480
a culture you know why don't you come in

1845
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,079
and absorb our culture that the culture

1846
01:26:13,479 --> 01:26:19,839
actually created itself and and I still

1847
01:26:17,079 --> 01:26:22,479
have faith you know I'm in a federal

1848
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:24,520
regulated uh situation and it's it's

1849
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:27,559
been

1850
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:30,480
pretty intense the last couple of years

1851
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:34,159
it's gone ups and downs and it's been

1852
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:37,000
traumatic and it's still pretty rough

1853
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:39,559
out there like being a small fish in a

1854
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:43,399
in a ocean full of giant

1855
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:45,960
sharks um but you know what if it was

1856
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:47,920
easy you know everyone would be doing it

1857
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:51,800
and I think

1858
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:53,239
don't Eternal vigilance is the price of

1859
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:57,000
cannabis

1860
01:26:53,238 --> 01:26:59,000
freedom there you go true can't put our

1861
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,639
feet

1862
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,039
up I do like about the legalization

1863
01:27:01,639 --> 01:27:04,400
you're just talking about in the federal

1864
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:06,079
laws that you're jumping through the

1865
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:07,879
hoops and you're getting to those stages

1866
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:09,559
but we are starting to see some type of

1867
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:11,039
standardization when it comes to some of

1868
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:13,560
these products that really we've be

1869
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:15,079
looking for on the medical aspects like

1870
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:17,360
like I've been talking about these Nano

1871
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:20,238
shots and some of these drinks have been

1872
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:22,079
really like game changers I'm giving

1873
01:27:20,238 --> 01:27:23,919
might me my father is having these

1874
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:25,719
balanced drinks and he's seeing a change

1875
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,840
so it's nice to be able to offer these

1876
01:27:25,719 --> 01:27:28,719
products to people they can actually

1877
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:31,400
just go to the store and obtain some of

1878
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:33,679
these and be able to get a a benefit and

1879
01:27:31,399 --> 01:27:36,039
get that relief that they've now been

1880
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,679
looking for to me it's it's fabulous to

1881
01:27:36,039 --> 01:27:39,679
start seeing it some people don't like

1882
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,199
it but I think everybody here will

1883
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:42,840
concur that this is the greatest thing

1884
01:27:41,198 --> 01:27:45,039
that we've been fighting for and seeing

1885
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:46,480
these uh legal products that people can

1886
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:49,679
actually obtain and be able to get

1887
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:52,238
relief from is something that I've just

1888
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:55,000
I'm it's awesome to see lately I'm just

1889
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:57,638
so happy about it to be honest

1890
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:01,840
not me Johnny I can honestly say I've

1891
01:27:57,639 --> 01:28:01,840
been fighting for the last 50 years for

1892
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:09,839
thcp I need some of that TCP by the way

1893
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:12,238
it finally finally finally

1894
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:14,239
came but what you're speaking about

1895
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:16,678
about the cultural separation is

1896
01:28:14,238 --> 01:28:19,479
something that is an inherent problem we

1897
01:28:16,679 --> 01:28:22,520
have because you know marketers from any

1898
01:28:19,479 --> 01:28:25,198
other line of reality has created their

1899
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:28,199
own cultures in in the sense or try to

1900
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:30,719
create them around products around ideas

1901
01:28:28,198 --> 01:28:33,479
whereas the problem they find is that

1902
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:36,279
you can't cash in on cannabis culture

1903
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:38,198
it's about being you know real and and

1904
01:28:36,279 --> 01:28:40,439
marketing and all that isn't about being

1905
01:28:38,198 --> 01:28:43,719
real so they're trying to impose their

1906
01:28:40,439 --> 01:28:46,079
wills and ideas on something that they

1907
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:48,840
can't even quantify that they haven't

1908
01:28:46,079 --> 01:28:51,000
even bothered the time to immerse

1909
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:53,520
themselves into quantify they're coming

1910
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,719
at it from a product perspective as

1911
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:58,159
opposed to you know an understanding

1912
01:28:55,719 --> 01:29:00,118
that a lot of us here risked our lives

1913
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:02,638
and our freedoms to try to keep this

1914
01:29:00,118 --> 01:29:06,118
plant perpetuated against every way

1915
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:08,600
shape or form and out out of you know

1916
01:29:06,118 --> 01:29:11,359
persistence and dogged persistence we've

1917
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:13,760
actually realized these realities or as

1918
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:16,399
I say I don't like your reality I am

1919
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:18,920
going to substitute it with my own we

1920
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:21,920
have substituted cannabis into the

1921
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:24,440
reality of the world through hard work

1922
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:26,118
labor dedication brothers and sisters

1923
01:29:24,439 --> 01:29:28,678
are still going to jail here in in

1924
01:29:26,118 --> 01:29:31,880
America so you know the the the job

1925
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:34,279
isn't done here we don't have Federal

1926
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:37,279
legalization but the marketers in these

1927
01:29:34,279 --> 01:29:40,559
small little 10th Amendment experimental

1928
01:29:37,279 --> 01:29:42,279
realities where we are are completely

1929
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,920
off the rails they don't know what

1930
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:46,960
they're doing they're trying to

1931
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:49,480
encapsulate something they can't even

1932
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:52,920
grasp and they won't even take the time

1933
01:29:49,479 --> 01:29:55,678
to understand or immerse themselves to a

1934
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:58,039
point where they should know a Wade they

1935
01:29:55,679 --> 01:30:00,239
should know what's uh you know cedria

1936
01:29:58,039 --> 01:30:02,560
Network they should know what's going on

1937
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:05,039
they should be the ones funding it and

1938
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:07,920
promoting it as opposed to them being

1939
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:10,000
lost to the dust bin and and left to the

1940
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,520
side no offense in any way shape or form

1941
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,439
weight it's just how the um

1942
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:17,119
unfortunately the marketers don't know

1943
01:30:14,439 --> 01:30:18,599
how to Market it it's the same way why

1944
01:30:17,118 --> 01:30:19,920
you know it isn't sexy going around

1945
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,320
talking about giving free weed to

1946
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:24,039
everybody but we still had to go around

1947
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:27,079
and pass SD you know laws here in

1948
01:30:24,039 --> 01:30:29,399
California 45 to actually 35 pardon me

1949
01:30:27,079 --> 01:30:32,118
to actually still be able to give away

1950
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:34,198
free cannabis because that isn't and

1951
01:30:32,118 --> 01:30:36,920
wasn't established so even though things

1952
01:30:34,198 --> 01:30:39,319
have changed we still have to continue

1953
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:41,800
to do the change but cannabis culture

1954
01:30:39,319 --> 01:30:43,359
just needs to continue to just be itself

1955
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:47,119
[ __ ] all this marketing and all that

1956
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:49,039
other [ __ ] just do you and all the

1957
01:30:47,118 --> 01:30:51,399
marketing will be continue to be ignored

1958
01:30:49,039 --> 01:30:52,920
as they try to shaft it into oh this

1959
01:30:51,399 --> 01:30:54,599
that that way and the other it's going

1960
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:56,440
to be what it's going to be which is why

1961
01:30:54,600 --> 01:31:00,079
you know the emerald cups and all that

1962
01:30:56,439 --> 01:31:04,759
will continue to exist because the

1963
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:07,359
overregulation is a a whitewashing of

1964
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:09,360
cannabis whereas the culture still

1965
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:12,279
exists it's still in the traditional

1966
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:15,039
Market it's still ongoing people are

1967
01:31:12,279 --> 01:31:17,719
still going around with male scales and

1968
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:20,560
weighing out e and ounces and dealers

1969
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:22,639
are still doing well so you know the

1970
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:25,080
underground hasn't stopped it hasn't

1971
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:27,920
changed it's just being marketed

1972
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:27,920
differently and

1973
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:33,239
terrible United Nations actually

1974
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:36,000
recognizes culture and we're going to be

1975
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:37,759
working on cannabis culture as itself

1976
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:42,118
but not this marketed [ __ ] that we're

1977
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:42,119
being served sorry to get off my Sil

1978
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:50,920
boox and besides that I've already uh

1979
01:31:46,679 --> 01:31:54,440
copyrighted Canabis sculpture

1980
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:57,840
so oh that was a long lawsuit between uh

1981
01:31:54,439 --> 01:31:59,960
the owner of Friendly Stranger Robin and

1982
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,159
Mark Emery from Cannabis culture that

1983
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:05,039
went on for a long time that fight over

1984
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:08,479
the name cannabis

1985
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:10,760

01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:18,600

01:32:41,319 --> 01:32:45,439
when that was

1996
01:32:42,679 --> 01:32:47,679
cheap oh wait before I forget can we

1997
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:50,879

1998
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:53,279
beautiful the dog is that you guys have

1999
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:56,319
there oh yeah that Australian Shepherd

2000
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:59,880
is amazing dude that is a ridiculous you

2001
01:32:56,319 --> 01:33:02,158
just made it from Brazil it was my dog I

2002
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:03,719
just brought my two dogs from Brazil

2003
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:07,399
I've been two years away from them it

2004
01:33:03,719 --> 01:33:10,800
was super hard but thankfully I we made

2005
01:33:07,399 --> 01:33:12,920
it so this is Muki mooki say hi to them

2006
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,960
and he's actually uh oh I'm sorry

2007
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:17,399
there's a smoothie in front of the dog

2008
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,079
uh this is a Shetland Sheep dog he's not

2009
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:21,519
like an Australian Shepherd so he's this

2010
01:33:19,079 --> 01:33:24,079
size he will be this size forever he has

2011
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:25,600
seven years old actually

2012
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:28,039
wow

2013
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:31,239
unbelievable pretty looks happy to be

2014
01:33:28,039 --> 01:33:32,960
back with you he is for sure he's going

2015
01:33:31,238 --> 01:33:34,678
through some issues like skin issues and

2016
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:38,000
stuff but we're trying to trying to

2017
01:33:34,679 --> 01:33:39,880
solve it dogs with breeds I don't know I

2018
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,039
think that when you when you breed too

2019
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:43,760
much with the dogs and sometimes it's

2020
01:33:42,039 --> 01:33:45,800
hard like the other three dogs we have

2021
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:48,760
they're muts and no muts is that how you

2022
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:51,840
say it yeah none of them have any issue

2023
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:54,119
maybe the genetic variations and things

2024
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:56,679
like this make them like way stronger

2025
01:33:54,118 --> 01:33:58,599
for on life isn't that interesting that

2026
01:33:56,679 --> 01:34:00,239
we call them muts but then we call the

2027
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:02,560
pure breads but you're like here get

2028
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:04,399
this dog it's 10 grand it's like four

2029
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,520
years later the thing is like suffering

2030
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:09,439
terribly with hip dysplasia it's just

2031
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:12,639
like grinding its hips on it's like what

2032
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:16,039
what the [ __ ] are we doing in

2033
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:18,800
life yeah it is crazy and can we compare

2034
01:34:16,039 --> 01:34:21,039
that with cannabis too with the breeding

2035
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:25,400
people breeding crazy things or no what

2036
01:34:21,039 --> 01:34:26,920
do you think boys I don't know I think

2037
01:34:25,399 --> 01:34:29,519
Sam probably has more experience than

2038
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:32,079
anyone here but I think when you exhaust

2039
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:35,199
lines things you know bad things can

2040
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:37,719
happen if you start selecting you know

2041
01:34:35,198 --> 01:34:39,238
unknowingly you know I think well

2042
01:34:37,719 --> 01:34:41,600
cannabis is an

2043
01:34:39,238 --> 01:34:45,439
outcrosser which means when you use

2044
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:47,280
small population numbers and you only

2045
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:51,559
breed within a

2046
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:54,279
given small number of plants that uh it

2047
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:57,199
doesn't do as well it it

2048
01:34:54,279 --> 01:35:00,079
for really vigorous cannabis you want to

2049
01:34:57,198 --> 01:35:03,118
outcross it cross you know tie with

2050
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:03,118
Afghan for

2051
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:10,119
example create the real muts of the

2052
01:35:08,118 --> 01:35:11,799
Cannabis yeah and there's differences

2053
01:35:10,118 --> 01:35:14,599
too right because in cannabis we're

2054
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:16,960
looking to breed you know cultivars that

2055
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:20,159
probably get us very high or have a

2056
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:24,039
particular bouquet to them not

2057
01:35:20,158 --> 01:35:27,039
necessarily how they look whereas dogs

2058
01:35:24,039 --> 01:35:29,479
were were more like sure certain dogs

2059
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:32,118
were bred to do certain things but other

2060
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:34,559
dogs like the German Shepherd had a

2061
01:35:32,118 --> 01:35:37,759
really nice straight back and then the

2062
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:40,080
guy who bred it down who gave it that

2063
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:42,039
super humped out like so it just goes

2064
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:43,760
down at the back so the hips kind of go

2065
01:35:42,039 --> 01:35:45,319
way down and if you look at old photos

2066
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,840
of the German Shepherd and what it looks

2067
01:35:45,319 --> 01:35:49,880
like today and it's one of the dogs that

2068
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:51,840
ends up getting that hip dysplasia like

2069
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:53,279
the worst out of all the breeds because

2070
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,440
this guy just thought it looked super

2071
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:56,039
cool

2072
01:35:54,439 --> 01:35:58,118
like he was just like this is the this

2073
01:35:56,039 --> 01:36:00,198
this is how we should breed this and I I

2074
01:35:58,118 --> 01:36:02,198
think that's kind of a

2075
01:36:00,198 --> 01:36:04,919
bummer yes especially because we're

2076
01:36:02,198 --> 01:36:07,559
dealing with living animals right that

2077
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:10,039
feel and live like for

2078
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:12,840
years I don't know about you but my

2079
01:36:10,039 --> 01:36:15,920
cannabis is living

2080
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:17,840
also I know it's it's feeling different

2081
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:20,560
than a dog though I don't I don't know I

2082
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:22,360
don't eat I don't eat meat um but I eat

2083
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:24,840
salad I don't think I don't I don't mind

2084
01:36:22,359 --> 01:36:27,799
killing the salad to eat don't mind much

2085
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:31,319
about the can the that's you can't hear

2086
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:34,600
their screams yeah I I can hear their

2087
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:37,960
screams when I pull up the little

2088
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:40,280
carrots or the little baby corns or

2089
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:42,279
anything I hear them screaming like hell

2090
01:36:40,279 --> 01:36:44,759
man that's why I just go murder the

2091
01:36:42,279 --> 01:36:44,759
animals

2092
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:50,000
instead right yeah you know what it's

2093
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:53,079
get you can get into some pretty trippy

2094
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,760
philosophies there like in regards to

2095
01:36:53,079 --> 01:36:57,000
how you feel about breeding a plant

2096
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:59,600
versus breeding a dog or versus eating

2097
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,800
an animal versus eating a plant and I've

2098
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:03,719
definitely seen some pretty good

2099
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:05,840
arguments on both sides I say that

2100
01:37:03,719 --> 01:37:07,960
people should just be themselves and do

2101
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,480
what they need to do and the the only

2102
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:12,600
Innocents are the

2103
01:37:09,479 --> 01:37:15,599
aarian the AAR the breath

2104
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,600
arens

2105
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:21,960
bre exactly the breath arens aren't

2106
01:37:20,039 --> 01:37:24,359
bothering anyone they when they stay at

2107
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:26,560
your house they never eat eat anything

2108
01:37:24,359 --> 01:37:28,960
out of your fridge yes but when they

2109
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:32,600
take a breath of air they might be

2110
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:35,118
swallowing a few insects or viruses or

2111
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:37,840
something and that's

2112
01:37:35,118 --> 01:37:40,158
murder that's true that's

2113
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,719
true what are you gonna do probably not

2114
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:43,879
too many breath arens out there though

2115
01:37:41,719 --> 01:37:46,920
I'm guessing they have a short lifespan

2116
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:52,118
I've heard in India you probably saw Jan

2117
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:56,639
Jane temples and The Janes the really

2118
01:37:52,118 --> 01:37:59,799
really orthodox out ones they sweep the

2119
01:37:56,639 --> 01:38:02,039
the sidewalk before they walk on it to

2120
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:05,560
make sure that they don't accident step

2121
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:07,359
on any ants right sweeping ants is okay

2122
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:10,280
stepping on them is a huge no no in

2123
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:13,238
their culture yes

2124
01:38:10,279 --> 01:38:15,399
absolutely D I have a question for you

2125
01:38:13,238 --> 01:38:18,759
um you know I've been looking a lot and

2126
01:38:15,399 --> 01:38:21,039
thinking a lot about um mutations in

2127
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:23,840
leaf you know in in the way that leaf

2128
01:38:21,039 --> 01:38:26,158
leaf structure has has kind of formed in

2129
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:28,960
the plant morphology and I was wondering

2130
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:31,519
if when things like Australian bastard

2131
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:33,198
and duckfoot were kind of isolated you

2132
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,880
know historically we've kind of like

2133
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:37,079
we've bred these plants with these five

2134
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:38,679
finger these these these very

2135
01:38:37,079 --> 01:38:41,079
traditional Leaf

2136
01:38:38,679 --> 01:38:43,039
sets why have we not moved away from

2137
01:38:41,079 --> 01:38:45,039
these in in terms of resin production

2138
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:47,760
and do you think that's intentionally

2139
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:49,479
something that um certain breeders

2140
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:51,800
should start looking towards

2141
01:38:49,479 --> 01:38:53,638
because let's face it some of the some

2142
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:55,639
of these like plant cells and these

2143
01:38:53,639 --> 01:38:58,639
these these these water leaves are just

2144
01:38:55,639 --> 01:39:00,560
problematic so why could why wouldn't we

2145
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:02,920
just start breeding towards better you

2146
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:05,000
know morphology that kind of lends it

2147
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:07,279
toward lends itself towards extraction

2148
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,840
so you're not defoliating at week 21 and

2149
01:39:07,279 --> 01:39:12,920
then again going back I think people

2150
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:18,119
people are doing people are doing both

2151
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:19,960
people are doing it uh for uh the the

2152
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:22,519
what do they call them there's a whole

2153
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:25,560
name of them besides duckfoot and

2154
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:27,000
Australian B must well there's like Fern

2155
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:31,679
or

2156
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:34,158
um like yeah humbal seeds selling from

2157
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:37,639
the breeder

2158
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:42,920
guy but uh I don't

2159
01:39:37,639 --> 01:39:46,440
see I don't see any advantage

2160
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:49,079
ineds show yeah I don't see any

2161
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:52,479
advantage in growing them other than

2162
01:39:49,079 --> 01:39:52,479
they look trippy

2163
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:01,000
now I've just never seen like you know

2164
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:03,519
in terms of of population I've never

2165
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:06,520
seen traits in terms of resin production

2166
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:09,639
from any of these these types of you

2167
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:11,920
know morphologies that um that lend

2168
01:40:09,639 --> 01:40:14,440
itself to what you know we're talking

2169
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:17,239
about here in terms of resin but uh I

2170
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:20,158
know it just seems over time you know

2171
01:40:17,238 --> 01:40:22,238
there there there should be individuals

2172
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:26,158
looking at this at a deeper from a

2173
01:40:22,238 --> 01:40:27,759
deeper perspective and you know I know I

2174
01:40:26,158 --> 01:40:30,039
I've I've been playing around with it

2175
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:31,760
for the past couple years and I've been

2176
01:40:30,039 --> 01:40:34,679
some really interesting things so I I

2177
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:39,400
hope others are are doing it

2178
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:46,399
too I I used to be but uh I I sort of

2179
01:40:39,399 --> 01:40:49,319
gave up with uh World fot toxy and uh uh

2180
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:55,000
diploid and triy and things like that

2181
01:40:49,319 --> 01:41:00,079
but uh and there were differences but uh

2182
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:02,880
yeah uh the freak Show is I think really

2183
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:06,279
trippy looking but whether it has any

2184
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:10,039
practical application I'm not so sure

2185
01:41:06,279 --> 01:41:11,118
yeah no likewise I I I agree with that

2186
01:41:10,039 --> 01:41:12,920
but with that I think there's

2187
01:41:11,118 --> 01:41:16,759
opportunity for the right person to to

2188
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:19,840
Really Work the lines you know

2189
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:22,000
so I'm I'm to be honest I'm more

2190
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:26,800
interested in the cannaboid intering

2191
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,800
contents than anything else I

2192
01:41:29,158 --> 01:41:34,879
want and so that's that's exactly what

2193
01:41:32,279 --> 01:41:37,118
I'm after however what I what I'm what

2194
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:42,480
I'm trying to illustrate I guess is what

2195
01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:44,920
if we had less biomass around it and it

2196
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:48,959
was it was more focused on the resin

2197
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:52,480
rather than you you can do that with a

2198
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:56,039
with more of a what people called sativa

2199
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:58,559
narrow leaf drug variety you can do that

2200
01:41:56,039 --> 01:42:03,039
but with wide Leaf drug

2201
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:05,599
varieties uh like Afghans they often

2202
01:42:03,039 --> 01:42:07,560
have just as much resin on the leaves as

2203
01:42:05,599 --> 01:42:11,000
the flowers

2204
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:11,960
so reducing the leaf content isn't going

2205
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:15,238
to

2206
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:18,639
necessarily uh increase the resin

2207
01:42:15,238 --> 01:42:20,479
content true now from a contamination

2208
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:22,159
point of view just in water hash that's

2209
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:24,919
what I'm that's really where I'm

2210
01:42:22,158 --> 01:42:27,399
thinking know the contamination

2211
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:29,480
perspective um and trying to remove some

2212
01:42:27,399 --> 01:42:34,000
of

2213
01:42:29,479 --> 01:42:36,479
that material maybe it'd be good for for

2214
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,639
for sift I I don't know you know I think

2215
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:41,959
you're illustrating some really good

2216
01:42:37,639 --> 01:42:43,440
points but it's uh yeah no it's it's

2217
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:45,639
definitely something I think about a lot

2218
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:47,279
though and I I I appreciate your

2219
01:42:45,639 --> 01:42:49,560
perspective on it because it's as you

2220
01:42:47,279 --> 01:42:50,880
know it's uh it's just there's there's

2221
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:55,119
not a lot of people that are publicly

2222
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:56,840
talking about this this type of work

2223
01:42:55,118 --> 01:42:59,479
I I I think there's a lot of people

2224
01:42:56,840 --> 01:43:02,319
doing it now when we first started on it

2225
01:42:59,479 --> 01:43:04,118
20 years ago there was nobody but

2226
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:07,479
there's a lot of people breeding for

2227
01:43:04,118 --> 01:43:11,559
canabo and tpin the minor canabo are

2228
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:16,519
pretty easy to get I CBD obviously is

2229
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:20,800
easy to get CBG is easy to get thcv is

2230
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:22,920
fairly easy to get so CBC I don't think

2231
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:25,119
that's so easy to get but I bet you can

2232
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:25,118
get

2233
01:43:25,359 --> 01:43:31,359
it yeah no it's

2234
01:43:29,118 --> 01:43:33,399
fair with everything that's going on in

2235
01:43:31,359 --> 01:43:35,639
the in you know Afghanistan do you think

2236
01:43:33,399 --> 01:43:37,559
um Sam from your perspective seeing all

2237
01:43:35,639 --> 01:43:39,760
all these changes over the the decades

2238
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:42,000
that you've seen do you think cannabis

2239
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:45,400
farming will will be um will still

2240
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:48,118
Prevail you know in that region I I

2241
01:43:45,399 --> 01:43:50,719
honestly cannot predict what the Taliban

2242
01:43:48,118 --> 01:43:53,118
is going to do because uh they've been

2243
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:57,039
on both sides of the line of drug

2244
01:43:53,118 --> 01:43:58,598
dealing and taxing drugs and I mean they

2245
01:43:57,039 --> 01:44:00,960
they said they were suppressing the

2246
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:03,880
Opium growing but they were taxing the

2247
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:06,118
cultivators I mean I I I don't believe

2248
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:08,400
anything they say and I don't know how

2249
01:44:06,118 --> 01:44:10,000
anybody can rationally predict what

2250
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:13,638
they're actually going to

2251
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:17,520
do do any of you follow like Baba's work

2252
01:44:13,639 --> 01:44:20,440
Baba 87 you all follow him he's in

2253
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:22,320
Afghanistan and I got actually very

2254
01:44:20,439 --> 01:44:26,000
worried I was even talking to Kim mam

2255
01:44:22,319 --> 01:44:29,079
canoli too because since like Taliban

2256
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,439
got full on power in power uh he

2257
01:44:29,079 --> 01:44:32,000
actually hasn't posted anything on

2258
01:44:30,439 --> 01:44:34,198
Instagram and haven't said anything but

2259
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,238
this last week he answered for the first

2260
01:44:34,198 --> 01:44:37,960
time so I don't know if anyone here is

2261
01:44:36,238 --> 01:44:42,158
connected with him but looks like he's

2262
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:44,840
still here in the world with us and feel

2263
01:44:42,158 --> 01:44:47,118
like they're watching right social media

2264
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:50,000
so he didn't give much information on

2265
01:44:47,118 --> 01:44:52,559
like what's going on or like where is he

2266
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,319
or anything like that but um I don't

2267
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:57,239
know just what to share with yall

2268
01:44:54,319 --> 01:44:59,519
because if any of you like I've got I've

2269
01:44:57,238 --> 01:45:01,678
got a street address just ask me and

2270
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:03,960
I'll I'll send it to you actually

2271
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:09,000
Himalayan connection is in the chat

2272
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:12,158
right now saying Bubba is safe

2273
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:15,880
yay I was just answer it was like a very

2274
01:45:12,158 --> 01:45:18,118
it was very very happy so cheers to that

2275
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:19,239
and I was joking I don't have anybody's

2276
01:45:18,118 --> 01:45:21,759
street

2277
01:45:19,238 --> 01:45:24,279
address big shouts out to Indian land

2278
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:27,639
land uh RAC change that's uh the work

2279
01:45:24,279 --> 01:45:29,559
that all you are all doing collectively

2280
01:45:27,639 --> 01:45:32,039
is very important and I thank you very

2281
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:34,280
much for doing that work it's really

2282
01:45:32,039 --> 01:45:34,279
really

2283
01:45:36,359 --> 01:45:41,000
important well I'm glad to get together

2284
01:45:38,359 --> 01:45:43,679
on a Sunday afternoon while it's raining

2285
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:46,920
out for a couple of hours of hash church

2286
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:49,000
I got a stop at 11: today so we got

2287
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:51,279
about 15 minutes if there's anything

2288
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:54,039
anyone in particular wants to bring up

2289
01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:56,639
or talk about or we can just just let

2290
01:45:54,039 --> 01:45:59,238
the conversation organically evolve and

2291
01:45:56,639 --> 01:46:01,880
call it a day at

2292
01:45:59,238 --> 01:46:04,839
11:00 you go home I think everybody

2293
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:07,800
needs a blowtorch to stize their tools s

2294
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:10,440
was say we gotta use flame it's

2295
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:14,480
important that's one way you can do it

2296
01:46:10,439 --> 01:46:18,000
yes you can also put it in a uh a

2297
01:46:14,479 --> 01:46:19,319
peroxide or or bleach dip using a bleach

2298
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,599
dip is what we've been talking about

2299
01:46:19,319 --> 01:46:26,519
first re re both of those will destroy

2300
01:46:22,599 --> 01:46:29,520
virus verus on contact heat and bleach

2301
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:31,320
various dips so bleach and not

2302
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:33,760
isopropanol so a lot of people were just

2303
01:46:31,319 --> 01:46:36,559
using ISO dipping in their scissors and

2304
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:38,960
I honestly don't know what's better ISO

2305
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:41,800
or bleach but I've used bleach I've

2306
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:43,319
never used ISO so I can't speak for it

2307
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:45,719
I'm gonna say bleach because that's what

2308
01:46:43,319 --> 01:46:47,479
you said thanks sound appreciate you ISO

2309
01:46:45,719 --> 01:46:50,319
is not known to kill the virus from what

2310
01:46:47,479 --> 01:46:51,759
I understand um once again col that's

2311
01:46:50,319 --> 01:46:53,399
great yeah we got to talk about this

2312
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:55,400
this is important that people they're

2313
01:46:53,399 --> 01:46:57,399
trying to use ISO thank you for really

2314
01:46:55,399 --> 01:46:59,559
saying that it's not going to work let's

2315
01:46:57,399 --> 01:47:01,598
really reinforce this people got to use

2316
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:03,599
bleach they got to make sure their

2317
01:47:01,599 --> 01:47:05,520
scissors are clean and if possible keep

2318
01:47:03,599 --> 01:47:07,639
them tied to their strains until they

2319
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,840
know and what I'm reading what we're

2320
01:47:07,639 --> 01:47:13,800
saying you can have a PL that's infected

2321
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:15,360
but I might not see it for a while and

2322
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:17,639
and there's there's some Bad actors as

2323
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:20,039
well there they plants that um you know

2324
01:47:17,639 --> 01:47:22,118
like KMD has a variegation to it so it

2325
01:47:20,039 --> 01:47:25,079
may seem like it but you know we've

2326
01:47:22,118 --> 01:47:27,118
we've extensively tested those from uh

2327
01:47:25,079 --> 01:47:30,000
other sources around and and we haven't

2328
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:33,319
found it on that variety quite yet but

2329
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:35,479
um I would say also um make sure you

2330
01:47:33,319 --> 01:47:38,279
you're you're you're using clean water

2331
01:47:35,479 --> 01:47:41,039
to to just water your plants ferium is a

2332
01:47:38,279 --> 01:47:43,880
big problem right now um and other other

2333
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:45,840
types of things like that um and that

2334
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:49,279
will actually uh that could actually

2335
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:50,599
produce and bring out uh plants bring

2336
01:47:49,279 --> 01:47:53,399
out the virus in plants that are not

2337
01:47:50,599 --> 01:47:54,880
showing the traits um there plants that

2338
01:47:53,399 --> 01:47:57,719
are you know for instance we have a

2339
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:59,639
plant that was that was uh that was

2340
01:47:57,719 --> 01:48:01,520
brought into us and and it didn't show

2341
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:02,960
any traits of it like you grew it out it

2342
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:04,560
looked awesome it smelled great you

2343
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:06,960
extract everything extracted fine and

2344
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:10,719
then you tested a sample and it it it

2345
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:12,840
came hot came back hot so so these are

2346
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:14,520
the things we've got to work through and

2347
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:17,199
there's other plants that are actually

2348
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:19,080
resistant to this and we then that I

2349
01:48:17,198 --> 01:48:20,638
think that's the next step is to start

2350
01:48:19,079 --> 01:48:23,079
isolating and understanding interesting

2351
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:25,880
to know what plant which plants are

2352
01:48:23,079 --> 01:48:28,639
resistant and then how long are they

2353
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:32,279
resistant one way you can tell is for

2354
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:35,440
example in the grape industry when you

2355
01:48:32,279 --> 01:48:38,880
buy grape stocks for to plant a new

2356
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:42,879
grape vineyard it's all certified virus

2357
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:45,719
free and the same thing with strawberry

2358
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:48,920
clones strawberry starts from dzo

2359
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:51,520
they're all guaranteed virus free so in

2360
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:54,158
the future that will be the case with

2361
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:57,440
cannabis when people buy you know if

2362
01:48:54,158 --> 01:48:59,598
they're buying 50,000 or 100,000 clones

2363
01:48:57,439 --> 01:49:02,439
each year they want to get the same

2364
01:48:59,599 --> 01:49:05,319
clone and they want it certified virus

2365
01:49:02,439 --> 01:49:08,399
free yeah s is the only one selling

2366
01:49:05,319 --> 01:49:10,759
virus free currently that I'm aware of

2367
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:14,079
uh and there will be more in time it's

2368
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:16,360
just it takes a long

2369
01:49:14,079 --> 01:49:19,118
time logical

2370
01:49:16,359 --> 01:49:21,679
supposedly uh issues that can you know

2371
01:49:19,118 --> 01:49:23,880
infect plants through cloning so we've

2372
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:26,960
been perpetuating clones in these

2373
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:29,000
problems for decades uh which is why it

2374
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,599
also takes so long for them to pull

2375
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,079
these things out because they're so I

2376
01:49:30,599 --> 01:49:34,880
think embedded and it's in the tissue

2377
01:49:33,079 --> 01:49:36,800
culture so they have to pull it out even

2378
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:38,920
before it's in the tissue culture I

2379
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:42,960
think there's even more than that at and

2380
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:46,359
because i' I found 27 viruses that have

2381
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:49,439
been ided in cannabis not all of them

2382
01:49:46,359 --> 01:49:52,279
caus symptoms but they were

2383
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:54,000
transmittable and there was 27 of them

2384
01:49:52,279 --> 01:49:57,479
and then I know that there's a whole

2385
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:59,960
bunch of other bacteria and fungus and

2386
01:49:57,479 --> 01:50:01,439
uh you know so it it's got to be a

2387
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:03,920
little bit bigger than the number you

2388
01:50:01,439 --> 01:50:06,039
said yeah I'm that that's just what's

2389
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:08,039
being Quantified currently that's all

2390
01:50:06,039 --> 01:50:10,920
someone in the chat more knowledge more

2391
01:50:08,039 --> 01:50:14,039
experience more expansion someone in the

2392
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:17,079
chat just said uh doesn't most nurseries

2393
01:50:14,039 --> 01:50:21,000
have a lab testing for this um no they

2394
01:50:17,079 --> 01:50:22,719
don't um not most Labs do not I mean

2395
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,679
most nurseries do not have a lab that

2396
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:27,920
works with them for these types of

2397
01:50:24,679 --> 01:50:29,679
viroids um and that's problematic so

2398
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:31,719
again that's why we all need to bring

2399
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:35,199
better guidance to the community so we

2400
01:50:31,719 --> 01:50:39,158
all have some sort of ideology around

2401
01:50:35,198 --> 01:50:42,039
what to do when this pops up most n most

2402
01:50:39,158 --> 01:50:45,519
nurseries honestly don't even know the

2403
01:50:42,039 --> 01:50:48,479
27 viruses that have been found in

2404
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:50,360
cannabis so far even how to identify

2405
01:50:48,479 --> 01:50:52,399
those viruses and what to look for and

2406
01:50:50,359 --> 01:50:54,359
even really what you're growing and it

2407
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:56,198
like this this hop plate you really got

2408
01:50:54,359 --> 01:50:59,679
to look for it then you start noticing

2409
01:50:56,198 --> 01:51:01,759
it and then there there are yeah it's to

2410
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:03,359
identify it's the next step even we know

2411
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:04,800
that they are there's these viruses not

2412
01:51:03,359 --> 01:51:07,639
being able to identify them and which

2413
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:09,760
ones are going to affect yields or resin

2414
01:51:07,639 --> 01:51:12,920
production yeah and when they they have

2415
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:15,599
no symptoms it's really hard to identify

2416
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:18,319
them but sometimes there can be three or

2417
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:21,599
four of them that that are symptomless

2418
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:23,359
but combined they do have symptoms and

2419
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:25,639
it won't be until they hit a growth

2420
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:28,920
threshold that they actually trigger and

2421
01:51:25,639 --> 01:51:30,920
those viruses activate so you can have

2422
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:33,599
different ones activate across the

2423
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:35,440
spectrum of your garden depending on

2424
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:38,360
where it is and the isolation that's

2425
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:41,799
actually taking place so I mean it's

2426
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:43,519
it's back too you know like you can rid

2427
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:44,800
the plant and and there's a lot of

2428
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:47,599
studies showing that it's actually

2429
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:50,520
showed back up and that's that's the

2430
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:54,520
that's the deeper thing for me that I'm

2431
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:54,520
that just get get you know look

2432
01:51:54,880 --> 01:52:02,159
when you if you eliminate it it's gone

2433
01:51:58,439 --> 01:52:05,078
unless it's reinfected by a contaminated

2434
01:52:02,158 --> 01:52:08,799
tool or an insect or something else

2435
01:52:05,078 --> 01:52:11,238
reinfect it you know there could be a

2436
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:13,079
nematodes that are infected there could

2437
01:52:11,238 --> 01:52:16,839
be various things that are infected it

2438
01:52:13,078 --> 01:52:19,840
but if you truly get rid of it it's gone

2439
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:22,000
until it is

2440
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:24,800
reintroduced interesting do you believe

2441
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:27,039
that it's it has to be reintroduced it

2442
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:30,199
had been suggested to me before Sam that

2443
01:52:27,039 --> 01:52:32,118
it could come back from the tissue um

2444
01:52:30,198 --> 01:52:35,158
because it's a virus right I mean in

2445
01:52:32,118 --> 01:52:37,118
theory I guess that makes sense then if

2446
01:52:35,158 --> 01:52:39,679
it comes back that means you didn't get

2447
01:52:37,118 --> 01:52:42,679
rid of it in the first place exactly

2448
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:44,880
that's exactly right so so there's yeah

2449
01:52:42,679 --> 01:52:46,760
so there you go so it's so again even

2450
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:51,199
more there's lay you know more layers on

2451
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:53,880
layers right so um it's uh I I hope that

2452
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:55,839
we can you know go through the process

2453
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:58,760
is it going to be a 12-month process to

2454
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:01,199
understand all of this or any of this so

2455
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:03,480
we I'll keep you updated as I as I go

2456
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:05,399
and if if there's someone at Serra you

2457
01:53:03,479 --> 01:53:08,078
guys can introduce me to and they're

2458
01:53:05,399 --> 01:53:10,519
open to talking about this to same page

2459
01:53:08,078 --> 01:53:12,319
here I would love to just chat with

2460
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:15,280
someone about understanding what they

2461
01:53:12,319 --> 01:53:17,719
found and and you

2462
01:53:15,279 --> 01:53:19,599
know probably Ian would be the best

2463
01:53:17,719 --> 01:53:21,599
person for you to talk to and then if

2464
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:24,400
and then he would you know yeah but the

2465
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:27,239
problem with problem with SRA is they

2466
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:29,479
have uh a lot of time money and energy

2467
01:53:27,238 --> 01:53:31,039
devoted to this so they don't want to

2468
01:53:29,479 --> 01:53:34,799
share their

2469
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:38,118
Insider uh tricks so freely I mean they

2470
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:38,119
will share some of their

2471
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:51,199
information about understood I get it

2472
01:53:48,359 --> 01:53:53,759
still worth chatting with them at least

2473
01:53:51,198 --> 01:53:56,479
you have access to a that can clean your

2474
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:59,400
cultiv ours well yeah even even at all

2475
01:53:56,479 --> 01:54:01,839
else guys like yeah you know I'm GNA

2476
01:53:59,399 --> 01:54:04,479
have some stuff dropped off on Monday at

2477
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:06,199
a place over here in the Fraser Valley

2478
01:54:04,479 --> 01:54:08,000
to start getting some strains tested and

2479
01:54:06,198 --> 01:54:09,879
start identifying some of the symptoms

2480
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,599
we might be seeing and then talk more

2481
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:13,359
with you guys about some of these

2482
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:15,599
viruses that are really infecting some

2483
01:54:13,359 --> 01:54:17,279
of the strains that are helping a lot of

2484
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:19,159
medical patients and that's really the

2485
01:54:17,279 --> 01:54:22,599
Killer is that a lot of these strains

2486
01:54:19,158 --> 01:54:24,238
that are being infected are really the

2487
01:54:22,599 --> 01:54:26,199
lot of the main strains that are being

2488
01:54:24,238 --> 01:54:28,039
used out here right like like everybody

2489
01:54:26,198 --> 01:54:29,559
else has their main key strains that's

2490
01:54:28,039 --> 01:54:31,840
what's actually being hit here as the

2491
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:33,440
main houses but the main strands so kind

2492
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:35,639
of

2493
01:54:33,439 --> 01:54:37,559
sucks yeah and the other thing is most

2494
01:54:35,639 --> 01:54:39,480
people are just going to call it because

2495
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:41,920
you know the the if you're if you're in

2496
01:54:39,479 --> 01:54:43,559
the regulated markets you're you know

2497
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:45,078
it's the it's the single of the week in

2498
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:47,520
the music world but it's the flavor of

2499
01:54:45,078 --> 01:54:50,479
the week in the Cannabis world right so

2500
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:53,920
you know you're you're constantly

2501
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:53,919
playing that

2502
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:04,000
things that are being passed around but

2503
01:55:01,639 --> 01:55:06,239
uh some of these these you know some of

2504
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,439
these plants have been around for 30

2505
01:55:06,238 --> 01:55:10,198
plus years I

2506
01:55:07,439 --> 01:55:13,039
mean I would hate one day to find out

2507
01:55:10,198 --> 01:55:15,039
that California Orange has hotlad virus

2508
01:55:13,039 --> 01:55:17,960
and I can't fix it right that's my

2509
01:55:15,039 --> 01:55:20,238
biggest concern Sam I it's it's I don't

2510
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:25,198
care about these newer things

2511
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:28,718
that fix will grow it take tips from the

2512
01:55:25,198 --> 01:55:31,279
tip tip tip Tippy part grow it again do

2513
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:33,239
that several times in a row and it comes

2514
01:55:31,279 --> 01:55:35,559
out clean and virus

2515
01:55:33,238 --> 01:55:37,238
free well for me that's my big thing

2516
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:40,199
I've been running my same strain since

2517
01:55:37,238 --> 01:55:41,919
2005 it's my medicine and I fear that I

2518
01:55:40,198 --> 01:55:43,479
might actually have that disease because

2519
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:46,480
it was spread through somebody that I

2520
01:55:43,479 --> 01:55:48,799
know I have maybe and now I'm like

2521
01:55:46,479 --> 01:55:50,919
freaking out and and yeah I don't want

2522
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:52,719
to lose something that's my medicine and

2523
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:55,039
a lot of other people have those that

2524
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:57,279
they rely on and that they use every day

2525
01:55:55,039 --> 01:56:00,639
and if they get this disease they might

2526
01:55:57,279 --> 01:56:01,759
lose what they value so much for what

2527
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:04,960
they

2528
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:08,320
need that's

2529
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:09,920
it so keep it clean keep it safe keep

2530
01:56:08,319 --> 01:56:12,439
your grow room clean keep everything

2531
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:15,359
clean don't pass around dirty cuts and

2532
01:56:12,439 --> 01:56:17,879
try to use qpcr when you can kids it's

2533
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:21,439
cheap it's not very expensive to get

2534
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:23,480
these tests done look it up get it done

2535
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:25,919
make sure you test through stuff and

2536
01:56:23,479 --> 01:56:29,359
don't uh unsuspectedly pass things

2537
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:32,239
around 30 bucks or $35 to get 30ck yeah

2538
01:56:29,359 --> 01:56:34,880
30 bucks to get leaf and else there you

2539
01:56:32,238 --> 01:56:37,559
go all right well I'm gonna end it with

2540
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:39,800
a small video that I put up on Instagram

2541
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:42,560
the other day someone was just asking

2542
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:45,800
about it in the chat room and this is

2543
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:47,960
this is verdant down in California you

2544
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:50,639
can check them out on Instagram and they

2545
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:52,520
grabbed one of our craft units from

2546
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:55,279
Whistler Technologies this like like

2547
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:57,239
little compact not super little but much

2548
01:56:55,279 --> 01:56:58,759
smaller than the most of the hash making

2549
01:56:57,238 --> 01:57:00,678
equipment we make at Whistler

2550
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:02,920
Technologies and I just thought it was a

2551
01:57:00,679 --> 01:57:05,679
tight video shout out to karolina who uh

2552
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:08,560
went down there and filmed it and I am

2553
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:11,920
going to share my screen it's just a 40

2554
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:15,199
second video very short but worth

2555

[Music]

2559
01:57:30,158 --> 01:57:33,799
they're crushing it over there at

2560
01:57:34,279 --> 01:57:39,158
verdant literally and

2561
01:57:36,679 --> 01:57:41,520
fig Demarcus walk us through this

2562
01:57:39,158 --> 01:57:42,939
machine what so that's that's the

2563
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:48,599
filtration there

2564

2565
01:57:48,599 --> 01:57:53,319
e looks clean to me

2566
01:57:56,279 --> 01:58:02,359
don't we all know that sound so well the

2567
01:57:59,078 --> 01:58:06,238
spoon hitting the freeze dryer tray tap

2568
01:58:02,359 --> 01:58:08,158
tap tap tap tap I can't hear you Colin

2569
01:58:06,238 --> 01:58:09,759
do one last dab before we go I was gonna

2570
01:58:08,158 --> 01:58:11,598
ask you to walk us through the machine

2571
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:13,520
because I I feel like I know what I'm

2572
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:15,000
looking at but then I all of a sudden

2573
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:16,719
said to myself maybe I don't you know

2574
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:19,599
what I'm gonna bring like Daniel and

2575
01:58:16,719 --> 01:58:21,000
maybe one of the engineers on here soon

2576
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:23,000
like in the next couple of weeks and

2577
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:25,198
they can they can talk about about it

2578
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,399
