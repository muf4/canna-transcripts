1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,599
Howdy.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,439
I I I just wanted to mention too I I

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:10,160
think it was Marcus that was talking

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,759
about the the cannabis being grown at

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:18,000
Mississippi State. Two points. Number

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:21,439
one is Dr. Oullie believed in medical

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,600
cannabis. Absolutely. Uh point number

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,039
two was

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:29,320
that they were given a contract by the

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:34,000
NIDA and they had to fulfill their

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:36,960
contract. The NID wanted uh XYZ amount

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,238
of cannabis of a certain variety with

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,520
certain potency and blah blah blah. So

14
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:46,959
uh it wasn't up to Dr. Sole to decide

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,320
what to give them. It was you know by

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:56,000
contract. uh he personally developed a

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:01:00,719
uh THC uh deposit suppository and uh he

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,319
tested it on himself and uh he he he

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,359
believed in it. He knew it worked and uh

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,798
I I think he really did want to do a

21
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:15,239
better job but it was it was beyond what

22
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,240
he was contracted to do.
