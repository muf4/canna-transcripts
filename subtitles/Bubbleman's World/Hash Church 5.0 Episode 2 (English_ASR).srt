I uh I spent uh yesterday Monica and I

84
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:10,840
made a big exibition and went down to

85
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:14,000
the Bay Area for the emerald cup they're

86
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,478
uh still trying to still doing that and

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,478
um boy the California Market the

88
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:24,599
business side of it has FY Bare Bones at

89
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,758
this point um it was lovely to see a

90
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,039
bunch of people that I knew a bunch of

91
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,960
people stopped

92
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:33,319
by um

93
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,198
but yeah lots and lots of people are

94
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:38,000
realizing that the California Market as

95
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,240
it's currently structured is a disaster

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,519
and are dropping out of it and it's kind

97
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,918
of a shame to see some of the Legacy

98
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:48,839
operators that I know who are

99
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:51,560
extraordinary cultivators and uh richly

100
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,959
compassionate medicine makers that

101
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,240
really just there's no way in the

102
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,198
business world to make it in California

103
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,000
right now without L Comm unless you're

104
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,960
willing to stretch the rules or ignore

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,839
them and that's a whole different

106
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:07,319
conversation anyway it was a really

107
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,918
lovely day for me um took a lot out of

108
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,319
me I'm pretty exhausted today but I'm

109
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,758
really looking forward to our

110
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:15,879
conversation and uh some of the

111
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,879
brilliant people who show up here my

112
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:21,000
thank you

113
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:23,680
again yeah well shout out to Tim Blake

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,319
for 20 plus years now of the emerald cup

115
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,439
I was thinking about that the other day

116
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,960
he must have started that just right

117
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:34,000
around when we started uh Legends of

118
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:36,279
hash Sam because it's been 20 to 21

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,439
years of Legends of hash as well so kind

120
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:42,519
of neat that those two I think the first

121
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:45,918
year Legends of hash was 2003 is that

122
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:48,159
correct when we had the

123
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,359
balloons I don't know if it was I don't

124
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,759
know if the balloon was the first year

125
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,199
it's so hard to remember [ __ ] as you get

126
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,520
older but I do definitely remember the

127
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,160
balloon year I wasn't there the balloon

128
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,758
year so I think that was a couple years

129
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,960
later but I think you're right in the

130
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,319
sense that the first one we did was

131
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:09,839
either an 02 or 03 which would put us

132
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:13,319
around 21 22 years uh of of doing them I

133
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:16,318
I saved an extra balloon if you need

134
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,039
one nice yeah I never I never got a

135
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,598
balloon that was a neat kind of way to

136
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:21,240
get a ticket to just someone's like

137
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:23,399
let's just put the ticket on the balloon

138
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,879
if you have the balloon you can come in

139
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,719
and if you don't have the balloon well

140
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm sure would probably still let you in

141
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,759
but uh yeah crazy

142
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,038
crazy times yeah yeah yeah see what's

talking about the sphere shows that they

201
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,039
were going to do and how serious they

202
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:07,838
were taking it and how they were like no

203
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:10,319

212
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:34,359
behold even all the dead company stuff

213
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,519
you know

214
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,079
imagery you know they show like

215
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:42,879
neighborhoods San Francisco and you know

216
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:45,359
venues where they've

217
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,919
played dude the neb the neighborhood in

218
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,120
San Francisco with the Drone where it

219
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,000
all lifts up and they go up that was

220
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,879
absolutely incredible I of course did

221
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,559
not make it to the sphere for any of the

222
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,838
shows but I've had many of friends go my

223
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:02,239
friend Allison has been to I even know

224
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,600
how many of the shows so she sends me

225
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,200
little videos and stuff where I get to

226
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:11,440
live vicariously through her I'm sure

227
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:14,879
you saw that uh guy who posted his bong

228
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,880
hit that he took on Instagram right and

229
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,360
then uh the

230
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,958
uh the people who run the sphere the

231
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,159
same people who run Madison Square

232
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:27,639
Garden right the DOL family and um they

233
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:30,000
use facial recognition software as it

234
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,799
turns out you know so when you go to

235
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,600
Madison Square Garden you go to any of

236
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,799
their venues they'll

237
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,959
actually use facial recognition to say

238
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:42,399
hey was this guy ever a problem at a

239
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:45,559
previous event because if so they'll

240
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,519
pull you out of line but uh yeah so he

241
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:51,518
he originally I think he got banned from

242
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:54,679
those venues but then there was such a

243
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,240
public outlash of support for

244
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:59,838
him the bong rip dude yeah you got to

245
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,839
think a lot of bad [ __ ] happens concerts

246
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,920
you know there's some aggressive people

247
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,120
and this that and the other thing but

248
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:08,039
taking a bong rep at a concert would be

249
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,879
uh especially one like like fish at the

250
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:15,480
sphere where like bong rips have been

251
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:18,519
involved in the creation of the entire

252
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,800
the music the visuals probably the

253
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:24,278
building of the sphere um I would I

254
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:26,479
think bong rips were present all the way

255
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:29,759
through and so what a silly thing to

256
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,959
kind of you know what the whole I was

257
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,720
just going to say they have they have a

258
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,799
pretty strict policy just on those

259
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,519
smoking in general I think that's try to

260
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,399
keep tobacco and all that kind of stuff

261
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,399
out but you know people are still

262
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:46,039
hitting vape pens but I guess the point

263
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:49,200
of having actually fire and combustion

264
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:51,639
inside an event where you have some big

265
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,440
glass bong it's kind of like okay you're

266
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,200
already you snuck the bong in you're

267
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,120
smoking you're recording it you're

268
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,320
putting it up to the internet I mean how

269
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,000
are you not going to get in trouble

270
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,399
trouble I still support it civil

271
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,519
disobedience man just like uh Wade was

272
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,440
saying earlier with the disaster that is

273
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,000
the California legal cannabis scene

274
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,839
unless you're willing to stretch Or

275
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,639
Break The Rules which is like wow isn't

276
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,519
that how we got the rules in the first

277
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,879
place I mean I know it is here in Canada

278
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,039
for sure we just like Civil Disobedience

279
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:27,000
all day long took them to court one

280
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:28,519
gained this whole scene and now all the

281
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,958
people that are involved in it because

282
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,799
they have like licenses that they're

283
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:36,078
trying to protect are terrified to step

284
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,719
out of line and do you know practice any

285
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:41,159
more Civil Disobedience so it's kind of

286
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,959
uh kind of a weird little corner we've

287
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:47,240
painted ourselves into with these uh

288
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:50,679
with these with this legal LIC last week

289

329
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:36,919
[ __ ] Falls so hard smashes himself so

330
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:39,120
bad like I I was just like oh my God

331
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,399
like he's going to be dead like he's

332
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,120
we're going to be going to the hospital

333
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,958
right now he shook that [ __ ] off came to

334
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,399
the concert with us that we were walking

335
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:51,159
to hung out and danced and puffed all

336
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,078
night and had like a little bump on his

337
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:55,039
forehead from where he smacked his head

338
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:57,559
when he fell but otherwise I was just

339
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:00,039
like Tony was actually there as well and

340
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:02,479
even Tony said I would have been in the

341
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:05,719
hospital for a month if because he was

342
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,680
behind ktis watching him fall and it was

343
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,120
just a it's truly a testament to the

344
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:13,078
strength of of of the Jamaican people

345
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,159
and how hard they work there's something

346
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:18,319
to be said for that and how active they

347
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:22,799
stay uh as they get older because holy

348
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:27,360
[ __ ] even if he did get all mashed up uh

349
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,359
he could have just uh joined Israel

350
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,240
vibrations oh

351
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,079
that's some low brow humor but you're

352
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,799
right I will be honest the first time

353
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:40,198
the first time I saw Israel Vibration

354
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,919
and I guess it was Scully and whis who

355
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:45,198
both had uh polio who have the canes I

356
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:48,479
believe Apple was the dude that did not

357
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:51,399
have it um and they came out and were

358
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,440
dancing on these canes it was pretty

359
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:57,240
inspirational to to see I I really was

360
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,639
blown away at

361
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,198
that oh Colin's just hitting me up like

362
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,799
crazy oh he says he's in the waiting

363
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:06,198
room that's weird um I don't see anyone

364
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,719
in the waiting

365
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:11,599
room huh I think he's in the waiting

366
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,759
room of a different room so let's see if

367
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,199
we can figure out sending him the link

368
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,199
to

369
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:21,318
this oh

370
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:23,240
goodness too much thinking too much

371
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:25,799
thinking

372
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,799
um someone else talk while I do some

373
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:28,799
work

374
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:33,198
hey Wade what's

375
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,839
up oh probably the most exciting thing

376
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:43,919
that's going on these days for me Sam is

377
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:46,279
uh I came across a paper that was

378
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:49,639
published in a journal called biofactors

379
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:52,879
I talked about it a little bit last week

380
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:56,879
specifically um a group of researchers

381
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:59,519
took three different multiple Myoma cell

382
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:03,120
lines and tested

383
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:07,078
the efficacy of minor phyto canono

384
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,880
against those multiple myom cell line

385
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:10,359
and the fascinating thing is it turns

386
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:16,880
out that

387
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:21,438
CBG as in George or Golf and CB in as in

388
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,079
Nancy are both remarkably effective at

389
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,679
suppressing the growth of multiple my at

390
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:31,038
least these three multiple my cells cell

391
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,880
lmes and um at the right though seems to

392
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:37,000
trigger cell death and it's always been

393
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,240
fascinating to me how is it I'm dealing

394
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,880
with cancer given the amount of cannabis

395
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,880
that I consume and I realized that at

396
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,200
least for one possibility is I don't

397
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:53,320
usually consume much cbv or

398
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,960
CBM in my cannabis so it's likely that

399
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:58,439
I'm missing out on that

400
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:03,000
opportunity and um I've since secured a

401
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:08,240
bunch of CBG oil comes in at about 52%

402
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,359
CBG and I'm working on sourcing some CBN

403
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,798
got a little bit of it delivered to me

404
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:17,519
yesterday at the emerald cup and uh per

405
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:19,440
Mark Sheldon suggestion last week I'm uh

406
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,158
working on

407
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,279
um finding some manufacturers who are

408
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:29,880
willing to do a special batch of oil for

409
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:32,879
me based on your recommendation much of

410
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,760
uh heat oxygen and

411
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,400
time that's all I got for the moment Sam

412
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,558
I'm I'm pretty excited about that I

413
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:43,679
would love to feel like I

414
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:46,038
can get on board with personal

415
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:50,440
experience

416
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:54,200
of handling and perhaps

417
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:57,159
even controlling the cancer that is

418
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,720
eating up my bones uh with the use of

419
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:03,320
cannabis I'm in canab Advocate and a

420
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,519
patient advant for hell going on 20 some

421
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:08,038
years

422
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:10,119
and uh yeah I would love to be able to

423
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:12,599
talk about my own personal example in

424
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:16,158
this realm anyways that's that's the

425
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:18,359
news from Nevada County California and

426
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,039
uh much love and really a to see you

427
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:24,959
toing welcome the

428
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:26,960
board well uh I wish all the best for I

429
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,640
wish all the best for you

430
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,600
also thank you Sam

431
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,720
that's that means a lot from you I care

432
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,719
a

433
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:41,000
lot you're welcome Colin thanks man

434
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
thanks for having me um great to be here

435
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,079
again with you all lovely to see Mark

436
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,440
and Wade awesome to see you and David

437
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:53,558
awesome to see cat and hat again and of

438
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,038
course Marcus um you know Wade the the

439
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:57,240
I've been dealing with a family member

440
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,079
who has Parkinson's and we're going

441
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,000
through the gamut of cannaboid therapy

442
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:03,918
and we have in the past call a decade um

443
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,279
we've been dealing with around 13 years

444
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,440
now um as a family and um I'm seeing a

445
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,879
lot of success with CBN for pain

446
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,279
management which is actually very

447
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,559
interesting to me um not so much with

448
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,200
sleep to be honest

449
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:21,839
um C what I found with CBN is it gets

450
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,519
you to sleep but doesn't help you stay

451
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:27,399
asleep so you need other constituents

452
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:29,918
and that was part of the work I did um

453
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,200
with tpine formulation to to have other

454
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,120
constituents help you stay asleep um so

455
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,919
I don't know if that's another Avenue

456
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:41,439
maybe Mark can speak on the chemistry of

457
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:44,240
that but um there's there's been um you

458
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,558
know I worked with a toxicologist um to

459
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,319
really better understand how our body's

460
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,200
interacting with with tpin and and the

461
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:54,000
the best way to approach it in terms of

462
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,038
percentage points um so there's a lot

463
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,720
more to be uncovered there but you know

464
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:59,960
that that was one thing that we I spent

465
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,839
the last call it 18 months just doing

466
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,360
that that type of work so it's um it's

467
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:06,439
been really eye openening to me I don't

468
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:08,798
know Mark if you've seen anything

469
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,960
that's you know compelling on your end

470
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,918
in terms of the chemistry of how these

471
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,558
constituents are coming together and and

472
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:17,240
how they interact with one another or

473
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,278
coexist together but well what what what

474
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,919
what I do know I think since the last

475
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:25,278
time we've talked about this on hash

476
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:29,278
Church anyway um is that there's now

477
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:32,880
published work uh in PE reviewed

478
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:35,319
journals on a double blind Placebo for

479
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,159
CBN and sleep it was always sort of

480
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:41,599
anecdotal and sort of suggested and I

481
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,520
think there was a a study a Japanese

482
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,558
study from like I don't want to say the

483
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,519
70s or the 80s where they were looking

484
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:50,440
at CBN

485
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:53,759
analoges and they looked in a sleep

486
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:57,720
model and that was always interpreted as

487
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,319
these things were you know had um

488
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,919
hologen

489
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:04,519
like chlorine and Florine and bromine

490
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,200
and stuff like that decorating the rings

491
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:08,798
of the molecules so these weren't

492
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,798
natural compounds at all but they just

493
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:15,599
looked at like how it it made these mice

494
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:18,200
behave in a sleep study but it wasn't a

495
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,798
so-called sleep study the the study that

496
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,519
just came out I think it was it came out

497
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:27,960
earlier this spring and um yeah the data

498
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:30,319
is pretty compelling I mean even at low

499
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:34,000
dose and you know I guess there is an

500
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:37,079
effect on CVN like you said of of CBD

501
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,960
and the other canono are in there and I

502
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:42,558
think if I remember the efficacy from

503
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,919
the study correctly it was you know that

504
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:48,918
were um full spectrum oils were were

505
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,840
more effective than the isolates on

506
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:53,759
their own and they just attribute that

507
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:56,038
to yeah there's there's just something

508
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,038
else in the mix that's making this stuff

509
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:01,679
work more effectively we don't really

510
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:03,519
understand what is but um but yeah it's

511
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,000
good to know that you know what was

512
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:09,879
always sort

513
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,159
of uh suspected anecdotally um that

514
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,039
there's now

515
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,880
published double

516
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:20,000
blind evidence to prove what we in the

517
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,360
Cannabis Community knew a long time ago

518
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,359
which is that cbn's good for

519
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,038
sleep yeah yeah it's it's also you know

520
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:32,879
I think there's more to be uncovered in

521
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:35,359
terms of the pain management aspect of

522
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,080
that compound I do feel like there's

523
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,558
some something there um based on not

524
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:42,678
just my own like I have two herniated

525
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:45,158
discs for instance I have one in my my

526
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:48,480
neck and then I have a a tear in my

527
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:51,000
thumb right when I take large amounts of

528
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,240
it my thumb feels

529
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
normal and I don't know if that's you

530
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,798
know in Mark you can dispel maybe that's

531
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,519
Placebo or maybe that's you know but I

532
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:05,038
do I do this is you know thousands of

533
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:07,000
times high dose of that same molecule

534
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:10,240
yeah I mean there's an anti-inflammatory

535
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,440
effect that's sort of peripheral yeah it

536
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,759
could just it could just be that kind of

537
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,440
like the way that you know if you feel a

538
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:18,440
headache coming on and you take some

539
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,480
ibuprofen and all of a sudden it's like

540
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:24,000
no more

541
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:26,360
headache um what it what's super

542
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,240
interesting here Colin is that there's a

543
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:33,000
company called inmed with is actually

544
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:35,519
taking CBN through I think phase three

545
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,919
clinical trials and I think I want to

546
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,798
say it's for Alzheimer but I don't know

547
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,360
maybe that's maybe that's another study

548
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,278
and it might be a different molecule

549
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:49,479
because they have a you know proprietary

550
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:52,720
code but I think it's CBN or a CBN

551
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,000
derivative and um yeah I mean could

552
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,440
these things actually be like the

553
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,679
Pharmaceuticals of the future you know

554
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,360
inspired by the molecules and the plant

555
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,759
that's that's kind of cool and being

556
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:07,278
able to have access to it like here's

557
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:10,558
Wade you know I need CBN and I needed

558
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:13,359
CBG that should just be a formula that

559
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:16,079
they should already have available for

560
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:18,119
you specifically for this treatment

561
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,720
dosed at the right level and the

562
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:22,639
products that you like th this is a

563
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,120
no-brainer I mean we already know that

564
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,960
these molecules are active and more

565
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,639
importantly they're safe right it's not

566
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,519
like you know you're going to die from

567
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,000
taking is a lot of these medications

568
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:36,398
that they use to treat disease are

569
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,319
themselves deadly and that's what you

570
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:41,239
end up dying from is the Toxic effect

571
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,398
from all these other things we know that

572
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,319
cannaboids aren't going to do that so

573
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:50,119
it's like there should actually be at

574
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:53,200
the pharmacy right now the 3 to one

575
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:54,959
tincture that Wade needs or whatever I'm

576
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,120
just making three to one up I don't know

577
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,558
what the right ratio is but he should be

578
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:03,398
able to say look these are both non-thc

579
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,839
canono I'm not taking this to get high

580
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:08,038
I'm not going to get behind the wheel

581
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:10,038
and crash my car I'm taking this to stay

582
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:13,440
alive

583
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:16,158
okay why is that not available right why

584
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,080
is there not Rel of why is that not Rel

585
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,120
of it's it's it's definitely stunted in

586
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,639
the sense that you would have thought 10

587
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,918
years ago when we were having this

588
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,759
conversation further down the line it

589
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:33,960
seems like medical was used as a shield

590
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:35,798
to protect a lot of um recreational

591
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,519
people because and and in their defense

592
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:41,038
like you're living in a country where

593
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,079
you are a pothead you always want to

594
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:46,200
have cannabis you love to smoke weed you

595
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:50,240
love to smoke cash you love to get high

596
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,960
you're going to um you know want to

597
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,399
protect yourself if some way of

598
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,000
protection comes up especially if you're

599
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:56,959
in a prohibitive country that's like you

600
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,038
could get years in prison or have like

601
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,558
your life destroyed and all you're like

602
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,240
well or you could go get a license yeah

603
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,359
this doctor will get you a license I

604
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,200
think it's like 50 bucks or 150 bucks

605
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:08,359
and suddenly everyone's got these

606
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,679
licenses it seemed innocent enough

607
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:12,319
although I will say it always left a

608
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,759
little bit of a bad taste in my mouth

609
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:17,119
from a patient perspective it's why with

610
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:19,960
hash church I always loved to Showcase

611
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:22,839
real patient perspectives and and you

612
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,558
know I always hear Sam's words as well

613
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:27,278
in the sense that it's all of value you

614
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:29,480
know someone who wants to get high

615
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,200
someone who wants to use cannabis as a

616
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,558
medicine like everyone should be allowed

617
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,840
to have that totally agreed at the same

618
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:37,918
time I do believe that patients should

619
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:41,038
probably take precedence and not line up

620
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,919
behind recreational users and so it is a

621
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,398
little bit hard that um yeah I mean here

622
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,720
in Canada this is exactly what happened

623
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:47,918
Shoppers Drug Mart all these big

624
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,159
companies got on they were like we're

625
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,960
going to get cannabis we're going to

626
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,000
dispense it because we are the people

627
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,640
who dispense medicine in Canada and

628
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,398
medical was this big thing people were

629
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,640
paying huge for their licenses and

630
00:27:57,398 --> 00:28:01,319
Facilities

631
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,799
and the minute recreational came in the

632
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:07,398
door I would say 80 to 90% of the

633
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,079
companies just like dropped right out of

634
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:13,239
the medical

635
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:16,199
um uh regulated um scene and just popped

636
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,038
right into recreational and it was a lot

637
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,440
and to the point where even Shoppers

638
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:23,599
Drug Mart I mean that's part of lbls a

639
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,360
55 billion doll company they are not

640
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,639
doing cannabis in Canada anymore they're

641
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,839
just like why would we try and sell

642
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,600
because cannabis just it doesn't fit in

643
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:32,959
the way they want it to fit in you know

644
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:35,079
it's like well we want to control it and

645
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,519
sell it as a medicine it's like okay but

646
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:38,278
like eventually like we were talking

647
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,759
about last week it's probably going to

648
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:42,599
end up at gas stations you know maybe

649
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:44,440
it'll be that Delta 8 maybe it'll be

650
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:46,038
something different but people are

651
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,278
simple in their cannabis in the sense

652
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:48,679
that they want to get high and they want

653
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,319
it to be inexpensive and they want it to

654
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:54,399
be convenient and even my own mother who

655
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:56,480
was buying from Shoppers Drug Mark at

656
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,239
one point was just like this isn't they

657
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,960
they don't have the flavors they don't

658
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,359
have the the options for me and they run

659
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,200
out of what I do need and suddenly she

660
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:08,240
ended up you know going to you know

661
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,000
another sort of medical platform and

662
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,599
then I think eventually recreational so

663
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,159
it's a bit of a bummer for The Med

664
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:18,678
patients how the recreational um just

665
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:22,960
use them as a platform

666
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:24,159
to get to get to where where it is yeah

667
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,038
I think it's a good point you're

668
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,120
bringing up because you know here in the

669
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:30,200
States you know medical was applo to get

670
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:33,319
the recreational to then not have to pay

671
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,278
your doctor that you know let's not

672
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:36,678
blanket everyone you know pharmacologies

673
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,240
come a long way in terms of

674
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,880
understanding the plant and where things

675
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,480
are at but a lot of these people are

676
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,760
just here for a cash grab and that's

677
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,558
another problem right so I think there's

678
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:50,679
a dichotomy here that we have where we

679
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:54,079
have us on Legacy and Enthusiast slash

680
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:56,679
you know researchers slash you know

681
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,759
activists I I think you you don't you

682
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,320
don't a lot of these things don't get

683
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:03,158
Broad into the world of you

684
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:06,319
know of of called the corporate

685
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:09,320
corporate cannabis or regulations and as

686
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,918
regulations get instilled into these

687
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:14,000
these markets you know there's not

688
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,000
really a um a bunch of there's not a

689
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,798
group of of experts talking to the

690
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,079
constituents around them to say hey guys

691
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:21,038
these are the good rules and regs that

692
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:23,398
are going to allow this to work it's

693
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,919
it's very much they keep trying and

694
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:28,639
trying and trying I mean New York is a

695
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,919
great example of that um

696
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,679
you know there's there's a lot there's

697
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,120
so many examples of of of this and

698
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,440
medical for some reason is at the back

699
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,038
end of

700
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,840
recreational but that's what got us here

701
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:44,000
so I think it's it's really interesting

702
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:47,000
how we're you know I think about what

703
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,119
Sam did when he went to Europe to try to

704
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
figure out what his version of of all

705
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:53,639
this was you know I often think about

706
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,638
that and think about when you started

707
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,240
you and and Rob you know started your

708
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:01,000
your projects over there and in

709
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,200
Amsterdam we I actually moved over here

710
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,599
because I knew I could not continue in

711
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,798
California and the United States they

712
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:11,719
just were not g to let it happen it was

713
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:14,038
too early yeah so I I honestly like I

714
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,759
think it's weird to say this to you as

715
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:19,000
as we're on on this together but I think

716
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,798
about that a lot when I try to nav as we

717
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,319
navigate here in the states and navigate

718
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:26,558
even what's considered a mature you know

719
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:28,278
I don't even even want to call it a

720
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,000
market it's not even mature it's it's

721
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:31,638
very infant and we really don't no one's

722
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,558
got it right so we all have to come

723
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:34,839
together to better understand what the

724
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:38,158
right path is and when we're talking

725
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:40,720
about medical and Recreation it's often

726
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,440
so heavily weighed towards recreational

727
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,278
and I I start I go back to one thing and

728
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,399
I keep thinking about patient access and

729
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,079
I think that's the only real reason like

730
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:50,839
you don't have to go to a doctor to pay

731
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:54,480
him 100 bucks to say hey can I go get an

732
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:55,638
Aether herb like that's that sounds off

733
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,960
that's that was kind of my comment

734
00:31:55,638 --> 00:32:00,719
earlier about pharmacology and

735
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,079
pharmacology yet yes there s it's it's

736
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,038
very important however those individuals

737
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:06,918
need to understand the plant and all the

738
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:10,599
constituents around it and what what

739
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:13,080
truly matters um and then help push that

740
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:15,119
forward you know maybe um ask better

741
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:18,199
questions or or your know problem solve

742
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,278
in new ways because as I look around the

743
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,278
you know where we've been and where

744
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:25,319
we're going there's just a glaring open

745
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:27,079
hole of confusion as to what is

746
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:29,119
Therapeutics you know I think we're

747
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:32,638
we're constantly talking about pop

748
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:35,319
culture within medicinal cannabis hand

749
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:38,119
over fist and it's almost to the point

750
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:41,079
where that's what runs you know every

751
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:42,398
single state you know so um I think

752
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:44,278
that's part of the problem is that we

753
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,000
don't really have constituents that are

754
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:50,798
fighting for medical they just fall into

755
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,558
this like generalized you know World um

756
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:55,440
so it's it's really interesting to me

757
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,038
because I you know I I'm you know have

758
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,240
this license in New York state and it's

759
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,398
the wreck license

760
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,839
but most of the individuals that I've

761
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:06,398
historically serviced have been medical

762
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,879
patients so you know it's really

763
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:10,879
interesting to me how this is all kind

764
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:16,000
of shifted um now do now Sam do you

765
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:18,600
think um when you went to Europe that

766
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,240
you know the idea of medical was the

767
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:24,038
only modality that was in front of you

768
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,960
or was it was there a glimpse of what

769
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:29,480
could come I could have worked on IND I

770
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,399
could have worked on Industrial Hemp but

771
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,960
you know there's not as much joy in that

772
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:38,479
um I I did work a little with Industrial

773
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,399
Hemp but it was always a medical

774
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,480
cannabis that allowed you to explore the

775
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:46,918
genetics The Inheritance the

776
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:51,480
cannabinoids the turbines and that was

777
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:54,720
my real real interest in this so uh yeah

778
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:57,759
I in America I just plain could not do

779
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:01,200
it even when I got here they appro

780
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:04,319
proved me but a lot of people in the

781
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,720
Ministry of Health said cannabis is not

782
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:11,199
a medicine it is a drug of abuse and uh

783
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:14,000
I said well at least you have an open

784
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,000
mind on the

785
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,320
subject holy [ __ ] that's frightening

786
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:21,759
that those you know it's not like it was

787
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,240
just some random sort of a little

788
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,839
ignorance group that was like well we're

789
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,398
afraid of this and then you could sit

790
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:28,878
down with them and be like no look it's

791
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,159
actually like a really good thing and

792
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,679
then they could be like oh my God look

793
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,200
at that it really is but they're not a

794
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,079
lot of the people on the other side of

795
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,799
this aren't like that here in Canada

796
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:42,359
Health Canada still does not acknowledge

797
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,480
that cannabis is has medical benefit and

798
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:48,000
they have like Health Canada that's like

799
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,679
our FDA they a legal medical platform

800
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,878
that Services Canadians and and yet they

801
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:54,559
all have come out and quoted not all

802
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,960
every single person that works there but

803
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,199
the the higher ups have come up multiple

804
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,800
times in quote

805
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:03,000
we don't believe there's any medical

806
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,039
value to cannabis we beat them in court

807
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and we force their hands so anyone

808
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:11,480
that's worried about um Civil

809
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,679
Disobedience yes you can end up in court

810
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,079
but it can be some of the best courts

811
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,719
that you've ever ended up in especially

812
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,680
if the timing is right uh and it was

813
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:23,519
here in Canada for all of the people and

814
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:26,919
there's too many to name but obviously

815
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:29,000
John Conroy sort of leading the uh the

816
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,880
fight with so many wonderful people

817
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,719
behind them that it was uh I went to

818
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,838
some of those court cases and it was

819
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:39,358
unbelievable to see the unraveling of a

820
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:41,199
system that had been in play for so long

821
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:43,559
and then to hear like oh it's going to

822
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:45,199
descent it's like descent what's that

823
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:47,400
it's like well you know it goes to the

824
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,279
queen it goes to the royal family and

825
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,400
through this descent process it's like

826
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,280
wow like I'm Canadian I didn't even

827
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,559
realize just how deeply intertwined the

828
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,440
Commonwealth you know Canada is I mean

829
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,679
obviously she's on our m

830
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,358
but uh it's beyond intertwin they make

831
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:05,960
decisions in in in London for if

832
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:08,279
something's going to become legal as a

833
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,079
medicine in Canada Canada was just at

834
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,599
the breaking point there was no way

835
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,200
anyone was going to put it back in the

836
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,280
box and now after so many years I see oh

837
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:17,799
they didn't need to put it in the Box

838
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,240
they had this other plan where they

839
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,000
would just be like well we'll just bring

840
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:25,719
out recreational and then we'll just uh

841
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,639
you know make sure that they can have

842
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:30,679
the worst packaging you know like this

843
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:33,400
these are two totally different products

844
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:38,199
in the Canadian Market you know this is

845
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:40,720
the the US version of this is it and so

846
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:42,879
it's like just a much nicer packaging

847
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,439
and you can't have any packaging here

848
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,599
you can't have any anything that really

849
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,440
makes you look too too different a lot

850
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,599
of it is just so similar and even myself

851
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,838
as a head I'll walk into one of these

852
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:58,119
shops and I have a hard time like my

853
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:01,318
brain doesn't want to connect that this

854
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:05,358
myar bag is gummies and this myar bag is

855
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:07,599
traditional hash and this myar bag is

856
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,920
you know some bubble hash or whatever

857
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,160
it's just like come on man we could do

858
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,880
this so good if you let

859
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:17,118
us yeah I think it's it's it's

860
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,000
interesting you say that because there

861
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,559
you know Connecticut was a market that

862
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,400
kind of took that stance in the United

863
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:25,960
States there's a couple others that did

864
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,639
that Pennsylvania tried to and then it

865
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,519
kind of fell apart New York took took

866
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:32,960
the stance and then it just exploded but

867
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:35,599
you know to your point yeah we can do a

868
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,838
lot better you know there's there's not

869
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,960
only from a preservation P perspective

870
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,799
for the for the actual material because

871
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:46,000
you know chemistry is happening is until

872
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,039
you use it um and you know it it's not

873
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,599
just that but also like these single use

874
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:52,960
cpgs you know we've fallen into the cpg

875
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:56,240
world for a product that is just so

876
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:59,760
heavily guarded like you know I talked

877
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:01,318
to you even people that can't open the

878
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,119
child say this ripped the package and

879
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:05,318
it's just trash you know like there's

880
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,160
it's literally you know what I mean so

881
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:10,838
it's it's really um you know it it's an

882
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:12,399
opportunity I think for designers and

883
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:14,159
young designers and young engineer

884
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,318
designers to come and make really

885
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:18,838
interesting you know artwork and

886
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:22,279
packaging that other other people can

887
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:24,519
grab on to and use at scale um you know

888
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,880
sustainability is a big driving force

889
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:30,679
behind a lot of what I see around what

890
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:33,800
we need but there's really no perfect um

891
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:36,559
you know material because plastic so

892
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:40,039
it's so woven into the world right like

893
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:42,039
it's oil is just it's just the backbone

894
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:44,519
so we got to get away from that and then

895
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:48,279
someone has to engineer a

896
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:50,800
cpg CR top that that doesn't utilize

897
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,680
plastic you know and that's I think

898
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,079
that's our biggest as a

899
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:58,799
material um you know what my partners do

900
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,240
Colin and and see here my partners Ted

901
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,119
and Andy they're cpg manufacturers from

902
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,919
China so that's kind of what they do

903
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,200
they build machines and they're they're

904
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,760
really good at it they've been helping

905
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:11,078
us uh do a bunch of different projects

906
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,800
and uh so they've got this machine and

907
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:18,079
it's the old it's the old tuna cans but

908
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,960
they have a ceramic but but it's ceramic

909
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,079
on the inside of the can so it's not

910
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,838
even really it's not touching metal but

911
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,960
they have this crazy machine that seals

912
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:30,880
these cans up and they're all ceramic on

913
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,559
the inside it's pretty wild to witness

914
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,960
this thing going just for me I mean I

915
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:35,719
don't know how many of you ever saw weed

916
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,440
in the tuna can I thought it was pretty

917
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:39,399
standard there's always one group that

918
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,760
was doing it in in some Market but here

919
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:45,559
in BC back in they used to have the the

920
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,839
tuna can and they the the flower was

921
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:50,799
called the tuna that went into it and so

922
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:52,838
it was like easy to ship moved around

923
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,640
real good preserved it really nice you

924
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:57,559
could crack the top and then obviously

925
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:59,598
you would end up having like a plastic

926
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:02,358
top after that if you wanted to make it

927
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,318
reusable but kind of a cool concept

928
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:06,719
probably could do a silicone top at this

929
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,559
point in time but yeah not so easy to

930
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,439
escape plastic these days a lot of

931
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,679
people are wearing it on their bodies

932
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,400
like all of those Lululemon pants and

933
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:16,879
all of those yoga pants that's all like

934
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,318
forever chemicals leeching into your

935
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,880
body through basically like synthetic

936
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:23,639
woven

937
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,480
materials yeah no it's well said man

938
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,078
because it's I've been going through it

939
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,039
myself like you know I've been working

940
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:32,000
on packaging and it's there's just not a

941
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:34,519
lot of great Solutions you have to

942
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
either spend a lot of money on it or to

943
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:37,639
be willing to get in line and just do

944
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,838
whatever even these like I have these

945
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:43,279
jars here which are the pop packs right

946
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,799
some blueberry banana in here and

947
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,760
there's just you know this is a plastic

948
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,680
top with a metal piece here sure it

949
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,240
sucks the air out of it and it keeps it

950
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:55,318
preserved but you know this this at the

951
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:59,559
heart of everything this is glass with

952
00:40:55,318 --> 00:41:03,639
I'd say 70% of materials that are going

953
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:06,440
to break down over a long set point so I

954
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:08,318
think that's a it's an opportunity I

955
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,679
think for everyone around us to to think

956
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:12,400
about that you know because every single

957
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:15,559
time someone you know like blast through

958
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:19,680
these jars like nothing you know boxes

959
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:21,759
full of empty jars so you know I think

960
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,879
the biggest problem we have is that and

961
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,359
then you know Mark I wanted to ask you

962
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,440
this I've been looking at asilis um

963
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:32,239
quite a lot and I was starting to look

964
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,280
at tobacco not to change subjects here

965
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:38,239
too much and I was

966
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:41,040
wondering there's no evidence whatsoever

967
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:42,679
in tobacco that those dried leaves have

968
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,679
been tested for

969
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:47,598
asellus

970
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:50,239
so in your opinion or anyone's opinion

971
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,480
here has anyone ever looked at this

972
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:53,679
because I'm starting to look at it

973
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,480
because I'm starting to ask questions

974
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:58,199
why are we held to such a

975
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,079
flame if things around us this or not

976
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:01,879
and what are we doing to better

977
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,400
understand it and the actual

978
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,559
constituents that are harmful versus

979
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,280
this blanketed statement that it's all

980
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:11,078
harmful and what are your thoughts on

981
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,319
that because I I

982
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:16,480
feel I feel like certain markets are

983
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:18,719
being suppressed of great material based

984
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,920
on unknowns that aren't

985
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:21,919
defined in

986
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:30,800
testing yeah I mean uh so the question

987
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:34,679
is what like um is tobacco tested for

988
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:37,839
for asilis and yeah and yeah can it

989
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:43,318
succumb I I think it can't there's so

990
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:46,719
there is uh uh fungicides that are

991
00:42:43,318 --> 00:42:50,440
used uh to

992
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:54,838
treat fungus on on

993
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:57,280
Tobacco and it's you know again super

994
00:42:54,838 --> 00:43:00,000
interesting to think about you know what

995
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,319
was required for that company to be able

996
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,318
to register products to be able to be

997
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:07,599
applied to Tobacco right because

998
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:10,119
supposedly you have to show you know low

999
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:14,880
environmental impact at the use rates

1000
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:17,720
you have to show you know safety in all

1001
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,800
kinds of studies including you know

1002
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:24,519
again just

1003
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:27,440
efficacy safety uh studies on all the

1004
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:29,440
metabolites but it's just really

1005
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,440
difficult I guess to think about doing

1006
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,159
that for cannabis because they'd have to

1007
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,800
show all that

1008
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:38,838
data um on cannabis which is schedule

1009
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,519
one right and so how do

1010
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:45,119
you yeah so it's not a Level Playing

1011
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:47,800
Field and tobacco in and of itself so

1012
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,440
the the nicotinamides and all those

1013
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,359
things those things are potent

1014
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,559
insecticides as they are in fact yeah I

1015
00:43:52,358 --> 00:43:57,759
mean a

1016
00:43:53,559 --> 00:44:00,720
homemade uh you know little recipe to

1017
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,359
control flying insects on the farm was

1018
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,000
always just take a little bit of chewing

1019
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:07,920
tobacco soak it in water and then use

1020
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,358
that to spray down dumpsters and [ __ ]

1021
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,960
like that where you have flies in the

1022
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:15,799
summertime but you know at the end of

1023
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,760
the day col it's like a whole different

1024
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,680
thing because as Marcus will tell you

1025
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,960
there's 10 other things in cigarettes

1026
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:27,199
that'll kill you it's like how do you

1027
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,280
determine whether or not the the the

1028
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:33,318
application of a fungicide or any kind

1029
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:36,680
of pesticide to the crop has some impact

1030
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:41,599
on human safety when the product itself

1031
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:44,598
is deadly it's right so think I I think

1032
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,920
I think it's easy to know that radium

1033
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:50,318
226 is very very dangerous I've been

1034
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,880
talking about it for 30 plus years in

1035
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:55,880
the production of

1036
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:58,318
tobacco and just but it goes down really

1037
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,720
smooth yeah it goes down really smooth

1038
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:03,880
all right while it's mutating all your

1039
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:07,399
DNA um no it's on health Canada's

1040
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:09,838
website they actually have radium 226

1041
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,519
they have the breakdown of polonium 210

1042
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:14,599
and Lead 210 which are kind of two of

1043
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:16,838
the many thousands of different things

1044
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:18,280
that are created when you burn it and

1045
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:20,078
they talk about that they are

1046
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,760
radioactive nucleotides and that they

1047
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,800
mutate DNA and I I just couldn't believe

1048
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,520
that they actually have that on a health

1049
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,920
Canada website because for the last 3

1050
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:33,759
year David Malmo LaVine has written

1051
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:36,920
extensive articles on the use of radium

1052
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:40,160
226 uh in the production of tobacco and

1053
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,720
how how very very very bad it is you

1054
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:44,239
know just if you were if you had to get

1055
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:46,799
rid of one that would be a good

1056
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,799
one yeah that would be a really good one

1057
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,680
you know the reason I bring it up Marcus

1058
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,800
and and Mark and everyone else is it's

1059
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:57,159
it's really I feel like there's a lot of

1060
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:00,400
um you know terraa is a is a product out

1061
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:03,639
that people have used it's um it's a a

1062
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,240
bacteria that that eats the the asilis

1063
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:06,679
appar Apparently and I don't know enough

1064
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:09,598
about it I've never used the product

1065
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:12,719
although we've spoken to four or five uh

1066
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,480
Farmers that have sworn by this product

1067
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,639
and said that this is what works for

1068
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,440
them um I just I'm weary of products you

1069
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:22,159
know I'm weary of the idea of this

1070
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,318
product works Tira Vera right it's a

1071
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:25,719
fungus what is it apparent I don't I

1072
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,039
think we should do some research before

1073
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:30,439
I blurred out what it is because I don't

1074
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:33,039
exactly know what it's made of but we'

1075
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:35,079
spoken to a bunch of a bunch of Growers

1076
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,719
that are in New York and other states

1077
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:39,760
that have been growing outdoors and they

1078
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:42,838
swear by this product um they say that

1079
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,920
they're able to pass um they ask

1080
00:46:42,838 --> 00:46:48,639
the the labs to Plate their material

1081
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,240
rather than just run based you know the

1082
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:54,719
the the the normal way that they run the

1083
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:58,199
the samples so um I'm not

1084
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,399
sure you know over I'm not what I'm

1085
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:01,960
after is everyone's opinion on this

1086
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,200
product and and

1087
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,000
what what do we you know how do we

1088
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:08,039
approach this and as we move forward

1089
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,920
because this is not help me understand

1090
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:12,279
for a second so it's like a nutrient

1091
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,519
it's not is it a soil or what what

1092
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,960
exactly is it it's a spray apparently

1093
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:20,519
you spray on the plant and it's like a

1094
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,519
it's a folar spray and you spray it you

1095
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:25,079
know I think it's a you put it a part of

1096
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:27,679
your IPM management and you know as a

1097
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:29,400
hash maker I'm extremely weird of anyone

1098
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:32,199
that tells me that they're like yeah you

1099
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:35,119
know we get in there and put this on our

1100
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:36,759
stuff you know it's going to come out

1101
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,838
fantastic the resin's going to be great

1102
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:43,240
because usually the resin is not great

1103
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:46,759
and it's it's contaminated and nasty so

1104
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:48,639
um it's a you know it's something I

1105
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,480
think for just the general conversation

1106
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:52,558
to kind of research and look into but I

1107
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,639
do think it's a it's an ongoing problem

1108
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,440
that is

1109
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:57,960
just everyone I speak to in Oregon is is

1110
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,599
dealing with with this everyone I speak

1111
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,119
to on the east coast is dealing with

1112
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,519
this um and it's not going away um so I

1113
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,000
think we just need to problem solve and

1114
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:08,358
start talking to each other about what

1115
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,280
the solutions are if there are any is it

1116
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:14,759
genetics do we need to start looking at

1117
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:17,359
certain pools is it this product that

1118
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:21,000
I'm mentioning um or is it something

1119
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:24,279
else um how do we or is it testing do we

1120
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,199
need to go back yeah let's let's go

1121
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,880
there for a second so like like the way

1122
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:31,519
that they're t now which is for PCR

1123
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,599
right they're just basically finding

1124
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:37,119
finding the DNA right and that doesn't

1125
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:40,079
tell you that that the fungus is alive

1126
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:43,240
and well and I remember I think this was

1127
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:46,200
maybe 2019 or maybe 2020 right before

1128
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:48,799
the pandemic we were looking at all of

1129
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:51,480
these failures for aspergilus they were

1130
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,839
all hemp crops and all of them were

1131
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:58,318
actually grown uh organically and some

1132
00:48:54,838 --> 00:49:00,440
of them on Amish farms in the New York

1133
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:03,400
Pennsylvania Maryland

1134
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:06,679
area and I could tell you the the

1135
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,838
material itself looked proper but we

1136
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:11,679
wondered again or like oh look at these

1137
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:14,719
hits for Asis what does actually this

1138
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:18,000
mean you know and it's like yeah it's

1139
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:20,959
after the fact it doesn't actually mean

1140
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,199
that aspergillis is alive it just meant

1141
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:27,280
at some point in time during that plant

1142
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:32,358
sample life

1143
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:34,960
Aspirus live there um it's you know I

1144
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:37,639
don't know like how much is that's what

1145
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,599
I'm getting at that that you know that

1146
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:41,480
we need to better understand better

1147
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,119
understand and Define at what point is

1148
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:48,000
it harmful and is it harmful because

1149
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:51,720
yeah I get on on there's certain

1150
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,119
patients or certain consumers that have

1151
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:56,239
you know autoimmune disease so they're

1152
00:49:54,119 --> 00:50:00,039
at risk right but have we actually

1153
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:03,679
proven that they are at risk and why are

1154
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:06,920
we taking whole lots of of material and

1155
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:09,798
saying yo this isn't fit for human

1156
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:11,960
consumption based on this small window

1157
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:14,679
of information that we quite frankly

1158
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:16,519
don't understand right and like that's

1159
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:18,118
what I'm kind of asking is like well is

1160
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:20,559
there a better

1161
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:22,358
way I think there has to be a better way

1162
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,000
is what I'm getting at I know that

1163
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:29,078
there's got to be some people together

1164
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,679
that can figure out the the right rules

1165
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:32,839
and rags and then on top of that the

1166
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:35,118
right protocols and right IPM to man

1167
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:36,920
manage the plants and the the

1168
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,798
cultivation aspect because all of it has

1169
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:43,599
to work together you got to remember

1170
00:50:39,798 --> 00:50:49,039
that aspergillis is found in the

1171
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:51,240
air right everywhere worldwide and uh so

1172
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:54,440
you know if you're growing Outdoors

1173
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:57,239
you're go if they can't find a sporx

1174
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,159
regillus on your plants it's probably

1175
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:01,719
because they haven't looked hard enough

1176
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:04,199
they're Airborne they're everywhere

1177
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:06,558
right so for me it just begs the

1178
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:09,838
question are we going too far on the

1179
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,920
parts for million are we because like

1180
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:13,358
all right let's let's bring it real back

1181
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,280
outside the industry we've all been

1182
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:18,400
growing before any of the these these

1183
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,798
data points right any of this under what

1184
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,920
we understood right so I know I've

1185
00:51:21,798 --> 00:51:27,039
smoked moldy cannabis in my time I know

1186
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,519
all of us have right we we seem to be

1187
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:32,798
okay um sure there's a threshold whether

1188
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,119
or not it's you know healthy or not we

1189
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:37,838
understand you're not supposed to do

1190
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:39,519
that but there is a small window and a

1191
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:43,759
possibility that at certain times you're

1192
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:45,679
ingesting it so what if that's the

1193
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,680
narrative or the the you know the theme

1194
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:51,000
here in at what

1195
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:52,318
point what is the parts per million you

1196
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,119
know because I think about this a lot

1197
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,440
because there's huge lots of material

1198
00:51:54,119 --> 00:52:01,039
that you just can't work with because

1199
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:02,119
it's just it's failed you know so um and

1200
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:04,199
then it has to go through this

1201
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:07,079
remediation process and then I wonder if

1202
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:09,719
that remediation radiation process which

1203
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:11,039
then goes back into someone's body how

1204
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:13,039
does that you know what I'm saying like

1205
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:15,639
we're we're going through radiation and

1206
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:19,440
then we have dead we have dead material

1207
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:19,440
now sitting on organic

1208
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:25,280
material so I'm just I'm just kind of

1209
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:28,480
drum up the the thought process from

1210
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,880
Mark and others that you know we're

1211
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,679
we've got we've gotten ourselves into

1212
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,318
sort of this weird dichotomy where we're

1213
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:34,679
like well let's kill it but then okay

1214
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:38,119
you can actually smoke it because it's

1215
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:39,879
dead now you know and but we're ruining

1216
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:41,599
the material and the experience for the

1217
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,318
consumer and then all of a sudden people

1218
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,519
think this is what cannabis is right so

1219
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:48,400
it just it's kind of it's nuts you know

1220
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:50,599
what I mean so I just wanted to bring

1221
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,440
that up because it's something we're all

1222
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:54,519
dealing with right now

1223
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,280
today and you know we know that's not

1224
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:59,639
what good herb is well we live in a

1225
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,798
microbial world and ra actually without

1226
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:04,279
microbes I don't think the plant would

1227
00:53:01,798 --> 00:53:07,559
exist as we know it today right because

1228
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:12,079
the plant the plant doesn't fix nitrogen

1229
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:16,359
right but the microbes in the soil do

1230
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:19,240
and it needs nitrogen for amino acids

1231
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:20,199
and proteins and you know those enzymes

1232
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:23,719
all those

1233
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:26,199
syntheses those are made of you know

1234
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:28,039
nitrogen and amino acids but to go back

1235
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:31,358
to something you were saying earlier I

1236
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:35,358
mean it's like kind of like have we gone

1237
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:37,960
too far well um just in terms of like

1238
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:41,078
analytical instrumentation yeah I mean

1239
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:45,720
we have the ability to see down to the

1240
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:48,119
part per trillion level is amazing if

1241
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:51,199
you think about it I mean this is like

1242
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:53,920
Space Age kind of Technology but you

1243
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:57,399
know if you're applying that to to

1244
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,240
cannabis or any you know agriculturally

1245
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:02,318
produced product you're going to find

1246
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:03,879
all kinds of [ __ ] in there just because

1247
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:06,239
it's in there doesn't mean it's

1248
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:10,640
dangerous at the level that it's in

1249
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:14,279
there and um yeah like we were looking

1250
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:16,239
uh Richard Rose uh couple weeks ago made

1251
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,559
reference to something that was posted

1252
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:23,078
on LinkedIn about a

1253
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:25,599
Japanese um uh referendum that they were

1254
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:28,240
trying to push forward where they were

1255
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:31,160
going to legalize CBD but it had to be

1256
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:34,078
able to be shown to be Point let me get

1257
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:38,239
this right

1258
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:41,839
o one two three four

1259
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:45,078
1% or less

1260
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:47,639
THC so a couple analytical chemists you

1261
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:50,400
know we're like looking at this going my

1262
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:56,318
God so something that's

1263
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:56,318
Point okay let me count one two three 02

1264
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:04,280
would fail or even three or four zeros

1265
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,440
0.002 would fail so it's like how are

1266
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,640
you GNA

1267
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:12,280
distinguish between something that's you

1268
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:14,598
know just a hair over such a it's like

1269
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,480
in the noise of the data it's ridiculous

1270
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:21,680
it's it's it it you basically you can't

1271
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:23,400
do it but you know like in prob bition I

1272
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:26,199
I don't know if it's I don't know Sam

1273
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:28,880
what do you think man like you know even

1274
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:32,078
like like when

1275
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:35,039
michul analytical data like most like

1276
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,798
what he was doing is he was looking at

1277
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:41,880
the different compounds that were in the

1278
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:45,079
plant he was able to look down at say

1279
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:47,358
0.01 percent but to be able to get down

1280
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:47,359
to

1281
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,520
0.001% is not only an analytical

1282
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:56,000
challenge it's just it's ridiculous to

1283
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:59,079
think that you'd be able to commercially

1284
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,960
like test at that level and be able to

1285
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:06,960
determine a winner from a loser Dre

1286
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:09,119
dread dread is in the uh chat right now

1287
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,960
he grew for DNA for years and is a

1288
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:14,079
really exceptional indoor grower he's

1289
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,119
saying that in Illinois right now the

1290
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,480
the cfu limits are

1291
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:20,480
1,000 and so to give you an idea

1292
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,000
Michigan is

1293
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:25,480
100,000 for the same test so

1294
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,519
everything's failing in Illinois and

1295
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:30,000
then get cooked like radiated or you

1296
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:31,719
know whatever the process is I guess

1297
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,599
there's a couple of different processes

1298
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:40,679
for um cleaning out to these

1299
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:41,599
fails it's shocking one really red is a

1300
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:46,358
good

1301
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:48,519
dra um so yo that that's also the

1302
00:56:46,358 --> 00:56:50,920
interesting thing I think about the

1303
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:54,559
markets were that we are in in the

1304
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:56,280
states is that you know a lot of us

1305
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,798
moved around from Market to Market and

1306
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:01,440
seen the shift in the requirements that

1307
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,838
they ask of us and you know like I

1308
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,639
learned in mass that it was nearly

1309
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:07,880
impossible to do a certain style of

1310
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:09,358
growing that I wanted to do just based

1311
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,960
on the rules and Rigs and then you have

1312
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:15,759
to rejig what you once thought was the

1313
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,838
way and you have to adapt and that's

1314
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,720
it's really tough to deal with that

1315
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,558
because it's not smoke sense makes it

1316
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:23,199
smoke sensense makes a good point in the

1317
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:25,480
chat col and he saying how does the

1318
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:27,159
tobacco industry deal with aspergillis

1319
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,599
because that's where the msos are

1320
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:31,038
probably going to look for ways to

1321
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:34,318
mitigate aspergillis

1322
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:37,640
unfortunately pay off the politicians

1323
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:41,000
dude they apply a fungicide they they

1324
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:43,639
apply this stuff called manm and a a few

1325
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,639
other Pro there are a few products that

1326
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:50,480
are ETA registered that they can

1327
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:52,279
apply uh to control fungus but I'll tell

1328
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,679
you what I don't know if if anyone has

1329
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:56,960
ever been to like a tobacco farm when

1330
00:57:54,679 --> 00:58:00,440
they hang that tobacco

1331
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,920
in the in the Barns and they hang it in

1332
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:05,559
these barns that actually have wings

1333
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:08,559
that can fold out so like could they

1334
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:12,280
could let air in there my God if you

1335
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:15,359
walk up to the edge of that Barn it is

1336
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:17,640
intoxicating the air that's in there oh

1337
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:20,400
my God like it's if you're a non-tobacco

1338
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:23,078
user non-cigarette smoker you could

1339
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:26,960
seriously you could faint just from the

1340
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:31,519
the effl coming from a tobacco farm it's

1341
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:34,199
toxic so Ryan Ryan craer yeah massed is

1342
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:37,358
weird I've I've actually yet to find

1343
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:41,199
jarble flour in the state that that

1344
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:44,078
smokes with any flavor it's really tough

1345
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:47,318
um it's really insane because you would

1346
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:49,079
think our friend Greg is working for um

1347
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:52,000
for Mass Provisions there aren't they

1348
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:54,599
growing good weed where Greg's at

1349
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,480
sometimes I think I think scale is hard

1350
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:58,079
you know even with the best people at

1351
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,159
the at scale because it once it leaves

1352
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:02,160
your hands another department takes it

1353
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:04,960
and that department you maybe talk to in

1354
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:07,239
the hallway but you're not running that

1355
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,240
team right and then it goes to a trim

1356
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:13,519
team and that trim team does a thing and

1357
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:16,199
then it goes to a bin and then it's like

1358
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:18,400
below the wind it's really hard I think

1359
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:20,759
listen I think no matter where you are

1360
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,000
and my just my just talking personal

1361
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,680
experience it really it's everyone has

1362
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,119
to synergistically be working together

1363
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:31,078
and really want that same goal to have

1364
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:32,599
that make it make sense and it's as I've

1365
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:35,200
gotten in bigger and bigger and bigger

1366
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:37,920
scenarios it just it it falls the black

1367
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:40,399
after certain you know at certain scale

1368
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:43,760
because it's hard to keep everybody you

1369
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,760
know chasing the same Dragon you know

1370
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,680
like everyone chasing that quality and

1371
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:53,440
like like wanting that the best is you

1372
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:55,078
know it's it's hard man you know I wish

1373
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,519
I wish I could say that that it was

1374
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:59,760
easier but but I do think that there

1375
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:01,920
Greg's growing some phenomenal weed over

1376
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,680
there I I will I will give him props big

1377
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:08,119
time because he's one of the that's Meg

1378
01:00:04,679 --> 01:00:12,159
Sanders who I know from 10 years ago

1379
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:14,240
used to do the mindful which was the um

1380
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:16,838
the grow right across the street from

1381
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:19,439
the Denver Police Station it was always

1382
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:21,400
great to see the Denver Police Station

1383
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:24,240
this huge three-story building with all

1384
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,639
these cop cars and it just stunk like

1385
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:29,439
weed there like there was no tomorrow

1386
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:32,358
and their grower there was Philip tiar

1387
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:35,760
Rojo uh who I don't know where he is

1388
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:38,639
these days but uh that's where K bill

1389
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,880
and the K Bill crew was first making

1390
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:42,199
live resin yeah about 10 years ago if I

1391
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,119
remember

1392
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:48,679
correctly yeah that's Brewer um yeah I

1393
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:51,240
think you know BK Brewer is commenting

1394
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:52,639
on Smash Hits he saying he didn't have a

1395
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:55,078
great experience but I think you know

1396
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:57,199
like I've had I I've had good experience

1397
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:59,760
with his chem 4

1398
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:00,838
um his chem DS1 that he ran over there

1399
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,319
was really

1400
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:04,880
good um but I haven't really paid

1401
01:01:03,318 --> 01:01:06,558
attention so much but there's some great

1402
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,358
growers in the state and I don't I think

1403
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:11,359
again it's just hard to hit every batch

1404
01:01:08,358 --> 01:01:14,759
every time um so I commend everyone when

1405
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:17,480
they can do that well you know it's a

1406
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,559
tough one but uh but there's some you

1407
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:22,519
know I think there's some amazing

1408
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:24,200
Growers on the East Coast that are um

1409
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:26,719
you know coming back home from the West

1410
01:01:24,199 --> 01:01:30,038
Coast you know so it's uh

1411
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:32,318
it's good to see it time in time we'll

1412
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:35,480
see we'll see better and

1413
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:37,719
better so yeah we got

1414
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:40,480
some I think it's coming I think we're

1415
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:42,558
in a big shift right now I think

1416
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,960
there's I think there's a big shift

1417
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:45,359
happening I think there's going to be

1418
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,559
it's going to take a little time but I

1419
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:49,558
think you

1420
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:52,039
know I'm building a grow right now I

1421
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:54,839
know others are building grows that are

1422
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:56,760
meant to crank out quality herb you know

1423
01:01:54,838 --> 01:01:58,880
I think it'll happen it's just it's just

1424
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:02,079
time right now we gotta we got to be

1425
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,640
patient um and it's never been easier to

1426
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:06,079
grow your own herb that's the other

1427
01:02:03,639 --> 01:02:08,440
thing I say to everybody out here is

1428
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:11,240
it's literally never been easier I mean

1429
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:12,920
I used to be on the forums trying to

1430
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:15,159
trade clones just to get something worth

1431
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,358
growing now you could just go buy a pack

1432
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:19,078
of seeds

1433
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:22,038
and within those 10 seeds or even six

1434
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:23,839
seeds you'll find something amazing so I

1435
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:26,278
think that's you know bring it back to

1436
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:28,318
yourself I think that's where I

1437
01:02:26,278 --> 01:02:30,278
encourage everyone to go and same with

1438
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:31,759
you know grow it wash it you know learn

1439
01:02:30,278 --> 01:02:34,278
about it I think that's the other

1440
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,640
narrative that you know everyone's

1441
01:02:34,278 --> 01:02:38,519
looking for someone to just like sell

1442
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:40,400
them good herb well it's not that

1443
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:43,278
difficult to grow your own good herb if

1444
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:46,079
you just spend a little time you know

1445
01:02:43,278 --> 01:02:49,000
get some good lights like the LED uh

1446
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:51,720
Grandmaster LED you know those guys make

1447
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,559
some of the best elights I've ever seen

1448
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:56,358
get one of those get some HPS if you're

1449
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:59,160
a traditionalist

1450
01:02:56,358 --> 01:03:01,440
you know dude the the Borg that I have

1451
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:04,078
does the HPS

1452
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,720
Spectrum there you go and and it's an

1453
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:09,400
LED light it's pretty wild there's 500

1454
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:12,439
spectrums in it it's actually Beyond too

1455
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:14,680
much many many many many many people

1456
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:17,240
need to get these lights because the

1457
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:20,719
data points are going to come from all

1458
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:23,679
the people who use it totally you know

1459
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:25,439
PK Brewer how can you understand yeah no

1460
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:27,318
I think that's the most important thing

1461
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,480
to get across with LEDs right now it's

1462
01:03:27,318 --> 01:03:32,278
like most people are like oh LEDs aren't

1463
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,960
don't aren't as good well I don't know I

1464
01:03:32,278 --> 01:03:35,880
think it's really about you can't just

1465
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,358
expect you to change your lighting

1466
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,240
spectrum and then not change your

1467
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:40,798
nutrient and your regiments and things

1468
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:43,118
that go along with that and expect it

1469
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:45,480
all to be the same you have to kind of

1470
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:47,440
take a look at you know the the lights

1471
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,278
and then there's certain things that you

1472
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,760
might need to do differently such as

1473
01:03:49,278 --> 01:03:53,960
feeding um or temperatures might need to

1474
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,640
be different U or humidity might need to

1475
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,838
be different due to the Spectrum so that

1476
01:03:56,639 --> 01:03:59,960
that's one of the biggest learning

1477
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:03,159
curves that we went through when we were

1478
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:06,440
switching from HPS to LED and then doing

1479
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:08,639
ultimately running rooms that were both

1480
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,039
um one was HPS one was led and just kind

1481
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:11,798
of pitting it against each other for

1482
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:13,640
data points and trying to learn what

1483
01:04:11,798 --> 01:04:16,358
varietals responded best to what

1484
01:04:13,639 --> 01:04:17,759
spectrums that's that was the whole I

1485
01:04:16,358 --> 01:04:20,159
spent three years trying to figure that

1486
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,119
out and that's one thing that I

1487
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:24,639
encourage everyone to do is don't just

1488
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:26,519
listen to what everyone says try it for

1489
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:27,798
yourself and see what works for you

1490
01:04:26,519 --> 01:04:30,318
because you you might be holding a

1491
01:04:27,798 --> 01:04:32,719
varial that for whatever reason might

1492
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:35,239
respond in a way that that what

1493
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:37,759
everything in my stable doesn't you know

1494
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:41,239
so I think it's really important to to

1495
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:46,079
not be so rigid about um what you're

1496
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:50,000
told um go and try it um you know break

1497
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:54,079
stuff and then try again

1498
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,880
um so but uh yeah I mean you know New

1499
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,240
York someone said in the chat New York

1500
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,920
there's a bunch of hemp Growers yeah

1501
01:04:57,239 --> 01:05:01,358
they they were a bunch of hemp Growers

1502
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:04,240
but I think you have to understand that

1503
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:06,719
New York if we had just allowed it to

1504
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:09,118
kind of go with just the r yeah it

1505
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:12,439
probably would have had some some

1506
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:14,519
structure there that that uh that would

1507
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,318
have you know allowed things to be a bit

1508
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:17,759
bit smoother but I honestly don't

1509
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:20,400
believe that anyone would even have an

1510
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,000
opportunity other than them so those

1511
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,760
that are in the chat talking about that

1512
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,798
just remind yourself that New York is

1513
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:29,480
filled with the big of the biggest

1514
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:32,239
capitalists so you got to got to

1515
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,760
understand that it's uh it's only going

1516
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:37,838
to get more and more uh more

1517
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:39,640
crazy but uh but you know keep in mind

1518
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:42,519
we you know it's going to shape up to be

1519
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:46,719
a great a great Market I I was looking

1520
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:49,318
for this this um picture that I think it

1521
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:52,439
was muton muffin mittens or Mitten

1522
01:05:49,318 --> 01:05:54,798
muffins I can't remember his name uh he

1523
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:56,599
was growing with the Borg and he just

1524
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:59,519
used different

1525
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:02,880
spectrums and it was the same cut in the

1526
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:07,400
same room with all being fed the same

1527
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:10,760
[ __ ] and this is what they looked

1528
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:13,680
like that's the same

1529
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:14,799
cut in in in different uh different

1530
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:19,480
Spectrum

1531
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:22,719
right yeah in the same room yeah yeah

1532
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,519
it's it's exactly this is exactly what

1533
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:26,318
we exactly what I was talking about kind

1534
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:28,199
of blew my mind man like you could play

1535
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:30,079
around and really get the plant to

1536
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:31,639
express itself I mean first of all 500

1537
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:34,440
spectrums I'm not sure what Thomas was

1538
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:37,480
thinking that is so absolutely insane

1539
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:40,920
but it's nice to be able to play around

1540
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:43,599
and have that sort of flexibility in

1541
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:46,119
your own little tent or or grow where

1542
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:48,960
you just I think it's a great idea from

1543
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:51,318
an R&amp;D standpoint even at the most basic

1544
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,278
basic like in Canada for instance if you

1545
01:06:51,318 --> 01:06:55,838
grow a cultivar that's under

1546
01:06:53,278 --> 01:06:58,519
20% um it it you'll have a hard time

1547
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:02,318
selling it so if you had a cultivar that

1548
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:03,880
came out in like 17 or 18% it's very

1549
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:07,199
likely that you could play around with

1550
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:09,798
the Spectrum in an R&amp;D room and bump

1551
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:12,679
that up to like that 20% now that's a

1552
01:07:09,798 --> 01:07:14,679
very basic sort of story um but when you

1553
01:07:12,679 --> 01:07:16,879
get into the actual volatile organic

1554
01:07:14,679 --> 01:07:18,879
compounds and the flavor profiles and

1555
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,480
the different ratios of those flavor

1556
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:24,318
profiles then it becomes

1557
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,679
like you know incredibly interesting and

1558
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:29,079
a very unique rabbit hole to go down in

1559
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:31,000
the sense of like yeah I'm going to I'm

1560
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:32,200
going to play with these spectrums and

1561
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,278
and it's not like you're just going to

1562
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:35,838
grow one spectrum light right like in

1563
01:07:34,278 --> 01:07:37,519
the in the early part of your crop

1564
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:40,239
you'll have a lot of blue to keep it

1565
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:42,278
from stretching now if you have say a

1566
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:44,879
part of your crop that maybe it gets

1567
01:07:42,278 --> 01:07:46,960
[ __ ] up in some way it gets affected

1568
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,838
there's always you know it's great to

1569
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,358
have an even canopy but sometimes you

1570
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:53,358
don't have an even canopy and you've got

1571
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:56,199
that little dip and now you can bring in

1572
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:57,880
that 730 far red and just turn it on in

1573
01:07:56,199 --> 01:07:59,519
that section and get those plants to

1574
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,440
stretch up a little bit and catch up to

1575
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:03,759
the rest of the canopy you could use

1576
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,599
that HPS Spectrum throughout the middle

1577
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,319
of the grow you could there's just so

1578
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:10,760
many different endless things that you

1579
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:14,079
could do when you have even just 10 or

1580
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:15,239
20 spectrums let alone I mean 500 just

1581
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:18,920
makes it

1582
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:20,920
like an impossible Road for one person

1583
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:22,359
to deal with it's going to be like a 100

1584
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:27,679
thousand people that figure out those

1585
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:30,480
data points yeah we I mean we saw um I

1586
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:32,560
mean I saw a lot of different canono

1587
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:35,959
spikes in terms of just the spread on

1588
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:39,960
testing like high numbers of

1589
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:43,679
thcv um upwards to 6% it was nuts like

1590
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:47,000
you know the LEDs produced we had a run

1591
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:51,960
that was like CBG was like

1592
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:53,640
3.7% with um thcv in the 6.8% range and

1593
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,960
then when I made a vape card out of it

1594
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,560
it was in the the thcv popped at like

1595
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:00,759
10

1596
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:04,120
12112 or something like that and it was

1597
01:09:00,759 --> 01:09:05,798
just a stacked like the extracts the the

1598
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:07,158
the hash that I made was just stacked

1599
01:09:05,798 --> 01:09:10,158
with all these miners that i' had never

1600
01:09:07,158 --> 01:09:12,358
seen before um and that was in that was

1601
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:14,278
actually from Rosetta Stone and it made

1602
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:17,679
me think it was the genius that held a

1603
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:19,000
lot of those miners um but you know I

1604
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:21,600
don't know if anybody on here has grown

1605
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,000
genius but um genius is one of those

1606
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:27,880
ones that has a lot of minors that are

1607
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:32,079
um just not present a lot of um like

1608
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:34,880
contemporary Cult of ours it's really

1609
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:36,719
interesting yeah the our love of THC

1610
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,440
really washed a lot of those miners

1611
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:41,679
right off the board didn't it yeah it's

1612
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:44,759
kind of been our lack of understanding

1613
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:47,000
too yeah and like the different the

1614
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:49,158
different um experiences you have from

1615
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:52,158
all these varietals you know like I a

1616
01:09:49,158 --> 01:09:55,439
lot of the stuff I've I've kept in my my

1617
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:57,439
clone stable like like the genius

1618
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:58,799
like I I even when I pop new stuff I

1619
01:09:57,439 --> 01:10:00,198
don't see the same spread of

1620
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:03,360
cannabinoids at

1621
01:10:00,198 --> 01:10:05,000
all um so I was telling you Marcus I was

1622
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:06,759
starting to pop some of those old those

1623
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,600
older varietals that I have even stuff

1624
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:12,119
from Shanti have like the mango Haze

1625
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:14,719
times skunk one and um a bunch of like

1626
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:17,039
Afghan one times skunk one and that's

1627
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:18,880
all the all original Shanti stuff in the

1628
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:20,719
like when you used to um pack them all

1629
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,679
in the little straw tubes and then like

1630
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:25,119
seal them you know and put the little

1631
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:27,000
sticker on them so I don't know Sam I

1632
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:29,319
don't Sam I don't know if you remember

1633
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,760
this the because you you were you knew

1634
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:34,639
Shanti fairly well um I don't know if

1635
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:38,079
you knew what stocky use but some of

1636
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:41,039
that stuff is um is really viable like

1637
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:43,238
I'm I'm popping like 15 seeds at a time

1638
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:46,679
and all 15 are still

1639
01:10:43,238 --> 01:10:48,678
popping so um it's pretty big I've

1640
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:53,840
gotten seeds that I had under

1641
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:55,520
Refrigeration for more than 30 years 96%

1642
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,880
germination

1643
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,239
yeah that's kind of what I'm seeing

1644
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,319
that's

1645
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:04,279
awesome yeah so I'll keep you guys up I

1646
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:08,599
had a Jamaican a Jamaican one actually

1647
01:11:04,279 --> 01:11:11,039
Johnny B grew it and he put it in a

1648
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:15,440
frame it's an old Bud now but yeah this

1649
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:17,158
is a Johnny B Bud of the some Jamaican

1650
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:18,519
seed that I had brought back it was like

1651
01:11:17,158 --> 01:11:20,679
a lamb's bread you know they were

1652
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:23,520
calling it Lamb's bread meaning it was

1653
01:11:20,679 --> 01:11:25,719
um it had that those those sativa

1654
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,640
flavors doesn't look sativa at all looks

1655
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:31,679
cushy the way John grew it here in

1656
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:35,039
Canada but uh this was 25 years old this

1657
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:37,039
seed I collected it in 95 when I finally

1658
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:40,920
popped it it was 25 years later and it

1659
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:43,920
was the only one of eight I had about a

1660
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:45,359
7% germination ratio from the seed I

1661
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:48,319
collected but I didn't keep them in a

1662
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:51,079
fridge for at least like 10 years

1663
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:55,238
so yeah if you want to keep them safe

1664
01:11:51,079 --> 01:11:58,960
you keep them at uh maybe plus 4 degre

1665
01:11:55,238 --> 01:12:01,959
Cade you know I mean that's cool but

1666
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:03,920
it's not freezing yeah no that's the

1667
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:06,239
fridge that's where they've spent that's

1668
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,719
where it spent you know 15 years of its

1669
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:11,399
life after kind of being at room

1670
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:12,639
temperature for almost 10 someone asked

1671
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:14,920
me

1672
01:12:12,639 --> 01:12:17,319
yesterday Sam what do you think about

1673
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:19,880
refrigerators versus freezers someone

1674
01:12:17,319 --> 01:12:21,559
asked me yesterday um do they put it in

1675
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:24,480
a fridge is there if you're going to

1676
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:27,600
keep your seeds for really really long

1677
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:30,799
times yeah freeezing them seems to last

1678
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:34,440
longer if you're going to use them in

1679
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:38,840
your lifetime you can keep them at a

1680
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:41,479
plus 4 degre centigrade in in a dry if

1681
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:44,199
the ultimate container is like a

1682
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:47,959
container which you flush to remove the

1683
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:52,039
oxygen so it's in like Argon gas or or

1684
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:54,239
nitrogen or something like that it that

1685
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:58,198
getting rid of oxygen for long-term

1686
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:58,198
storage of seeds helps them a

1687
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:05,440
lot

1688
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:06,399
so yeah I wonder the the modern packs

1689
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:08,638
that are

1690
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:11,119
sealed have that little bit of air in

1691
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:13,719
there wonder if that's working against

1692
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:16,719
it you

1693
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:20,198
know dread was asking uh about your

1694
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:22,520
thoughts uh Sam in regards to uh the

1695
01:13:20,198 --> 01:13:27,158
seeds that Todd McCormick has been

1696
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:31,040
selling the skunks Etc he he got the

1697
01:13:27,158 --> 01:13:35,759
mothers and fathers he picked out from

1698
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:38,319
uh uh from me and

1699
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,920
uh I have nothing to do with his

1700
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:44,679
business other than uh he seems to be

1701
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:47,158
doing a good job of it and uh keeping

1702
01:13:44,679 --> 01:13:48,359
skunk number one available to the masses

1703
01:13:47,158 --> 01:13:52,198
that want

1704
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:54,519
it nice that's

1705
01:13:52,198 --> 01:13:57,119
awesome you got to keep skunk number one

1706
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:58,639
available the masses that want it I mean

1707
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:01,279
there's a bunch that don't even that

1708
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:03,480
want it so they should probably uh keep

1709
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:06,719
circulating the

1710
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:08,479
globe is Greg mallister the Greg the

1711
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:14,079
Northern Light

1712
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:18,198
mallister yes he is okay hi Greg thanks

1713
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:22,559
for your cont contribution to the GLE my

1714
01:14:18,198 --> 01:14:26,759
man it's a it's a beautiful

1715
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:28,600
plant I know a lot of us have grown it

1716
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,400
um I'm actually starting to go through

1717
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,280
some of the old norn light seeds right

1718
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:35,079
now that I've gotten there a lot of them

1719
01:14:32,279 --> 01:14:36,960
are reproductions but I'm curious to see

1720
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:39,760
how they all turn out and how they look

1721
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:42,239
similar or different just started like

1722
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:45,880
cataloging um we're going to populate

1723
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:48,718
probably like 13 different breeders that

1724
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:52,719
have their Northern Lights and one

1725
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:56,119
is Todd has Northern Lights directly old

1726
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:58,198
seeds from Greg so

1727
01:14:56,119 --> 01:15:01,158
we just got those from him like a I

1728
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:05,678
think okay a few months ago that was I

1729
01:15:01,158 --> 01:15:09,599
think he's got maybe uh

1730
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:11,880
Murphy's from from up in Washington was

1731
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,159
like one of the first afghanis on the

1732
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,159
west

1733
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:18,439
coast got it and then we have the Afghan

1734
01:15:17,158 --> 01:15:21,559
one from

1735
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:26,198
Mel that's a really interesting one it's

1736
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:27,719
it's hard it's got much dark green

1737
01:15:26,198 --> 01:15:30,559
leaves

1738
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:32,520
yeah that one I want I'm curious to see

1739
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:35,560
the difference between that varietal and

1740
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:38,600
some of the other Afghans that are out

1741
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:40,480
there to me it's quite similar to some

1742
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,360
other Afghans I've

1743
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:45,119
seen

1744
01:15:42,359 --> 01:15:46,799
interesting so interesting flavor

1745
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:49,158
profile and it it's

1746
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,679
very you know depending

1747
01:15:49,158 --> 01:15:54,359
on how you run it but it's got like a

1748
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:57,760
sweet musky skunk to it it's interesting

1749
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:59,960
yeah to me almost smells narcotic but

1750
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:02,600
whatever I like

1751
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:05,359
it a lot of people like the hash from it

1752
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,880
makes gray hash go going back to that

1753
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:10,279
Northern Lights the first seeds I bought

1754
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:13,199
in Amsterdam were actually the Northern

1755
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:15,719
Lights number five the closet Queen I

1756
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:18,960
brought those back and grew them in a

1757
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:20,639
little false wall growroom in our house

1758
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:23,239
in Winnipeg

1759
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:24,679
Manitoba the Northern Lights number

1760
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:27,839
number five I'm pretty sure it was

1761
01:16:24,679 --> 01:16:30,639
number number five closet

1762
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:32,480
Queen yeah that was my first experience

1763
01:16:30,639 --> 01:16:35,880
with no light with number five someone

1764
01:16:32,479 --> 01:16:39,079
sent me a a clone named

1765
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:40,600
crippy and it was clearly you know there

1766
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:42,559
Northern you could see when it grew the

1767
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:44,960
leaves are huge man it was like Jurassic

1768
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:48,480
Park it was like the biggest leaves I've

1769
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:50,520
ever seen in my life and yeah it was

1770
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:52,079
really good herb it was like they called

1771
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:55,280
it the

1772
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:58,238
crippy was the crippy

1773
01:16:55,279 --> 01:17:01,759
lights you

1774
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:03,599
know good memories man I I do I do miss

1775
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,039
the days that like rolling up to

1776
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:09,520
Amsterdam when it was the only game in

1777
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:12,359
town in the world for cannabis people to

1778
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:15,639
just kind of feel a little whether it

1779
01:17:12,359 --> 01:17:17,319
was partial ignorance partial whatever

1780
01:17:15,639 --> 01:17:19,560
going into the Cannabis Cup right next

1781
01:17:17,319 --> 01:17:21,079
to the Pack's party house where the the

1782
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:23,320
Pack's party house right next to the

1783
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:25,800
police station so it's just all cop cars

1784
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:29,679
and cops coming and going in the same

1785
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:34,760
building so they were closer than next

1786
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:38,480
door yeah yeah exactly oh my God what a

1787
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:41,600
time what a time it's awesome though I

1788
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:44,319
mean so Sam like you know when you when

1789
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:46,360
you started going over to Amsterdam you

1790
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:48,399
was Ben donkers like one of the first

1791
01:17:46,359 --> 01:17:51,279
people you'd spoken to who was selling

1792
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:54,198
seeds or who was who was one of the well

1793
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:55,920
Ben had just started because when I came

1794
01:17:54,198 --> 01:17:59,799
over it was was in

1795
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:03,119
85 and there was one or two sort of

1796
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:08,320
amateur seed companies it was Ben was

1797
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:10,238
not publicly selling seeds yet got it so

1798
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:11,880
who who were the guys like when you

1799
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:15,959
rolled into town like who is like

1800
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:22,039
someone you're like yo that there was uh

1801
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:24,800
the uh the boat down on the on the in

1802
01:18:22,039 --> 01:18:27,719
front of the uh Harbor there and

1803
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:30,239
Amsterdam and what were they called the

1804
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:34,800
lowland Seed

1805
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:38,359
Company nice but they didn't have any

1806
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,600
truly great varieties and also there was

1807
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:44,119
a

1808
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:47,560
uh uh a gay lady called Dr Weed who used

1809
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:51,158
to sell seeds and here in harand this

1810
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:54,760
was you know before uh they were being

1811
01:18:51,158 --> 01:18:56,039
done by Vernard at positronics or and

1812
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:58,039
anybody

1813
01:18:56,039 --> 01:19:00,719
else that's what I was going to ask

1814
01:18:58,039 --> 01:19:03,800
about Bernard and where where he was at

1815
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:07,239
in that but I guess he came a little

1816
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:09,840
later the the end effect of it

1817
01:19:07,238 --> 01:19:13,119
was none of the varieties they were

1818
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:17,239
growing were truly truly outstanding

1819
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:22,399
great cannabis they uh they made THC a

1820
01:19:17,238 --> 01:19:26,479
little bit but and uh yeah it it changed

1821
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:29,839
a lot once they got really good seeds

1822
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:32,000
you know that performed really well the

1823
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:35,319
only problem is here in Holland is we

1824
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:39,359
have a fairly early winter with cold and

1825
01:19:35,319 --> 01:19:41,920
wet so you got to have a solution for

1826
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:44,158
that so is that where like early girl

1827
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:47,359
and early Pearl and all those like early

1828
01:19:44,158 --> 01:19:49,158
varietals kind of that concept of like

1829
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:52,279
well they need to finish

1830
01:19:49,158 --> 01:19:55,519
sooner uh yes there was also a bunch of

1831
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:58,960
Dutch varities very early so sometimes

1832
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:01,840
people would cross a skunk or some other

1833
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:03,800
higher THC variety with early Dutch

1834
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,960
varieties to try to get something you

1835
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:09,000
know that like some

1836
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:11,960
freezeland yeah because the freezeland

1837
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:16,639
there was that stuff purple pars a bunch

1838
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:20,399
of Dutch varieties actually and uh but

1839
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:22,119
you know their TH levels I I would

1840
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:25,359
presume were below

1841
01:20:22,119 --> 01:20:27,158
10% got it interesting

1842
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:30,399
so really I mean when you guys rolled

1843
01:20:27,158 --> 01:20:34,359
into town you brought the goods that

1844
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:37,158
kind of allowed everyone to

1845
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:39,479
outcross with better genetics whatever I

1846
01:20:37,158 --> 01:20:42,439
I never cared what people did with my

1847
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:44,799
seeds I just wanted to give them a good

1848
01:20:42,439 --> 01:20:48,319
product that they could run with if they

1849
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:51,520
wanted to and uh if they made hybrids

1850
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:54,880
you know that's fine and dandy with me

1851
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:58,199
and uh you know

1852
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:02,279
it helped a lot of varieties worldwide

1853
01:20:58,198 --> 01:21:04,158
in the early 80s and 90s and then other

1854
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:05,559
varieties started coming up strong and

1855
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:09,039
heavy and you

1856
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:13,480
know but Greg's a good friend of mine

1857
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:17,238
Northern Lights uh yeah his was probably

1858
01:21:13,479 --> 01:21:19,359
right up there with skunk and uh maybe

1859
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:22,559
original Haze which a lot of people

1860
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:25,198
really liked he's asking you if it was a

1861
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:29,920
crime what Neville did to Ed Rosen seed

1862
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:31,279
collection Greg is when Neville did what

1863
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:34,199
to Ed

1864
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:37,039
Rosenthal I'm not sure Sam Greg is

1865
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:39,759
saying Sam was it a crime what Neville

1866
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:42,158
did to Ed rosenthal's seed

1867
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:45,119
collection I I don't know what Ed

1868
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:47,839
rosenal seed collection

1869
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:49,639
was yeah I I'm not sure either maybe

1870
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:52,440
he'll hear you say that and he'll be a

1871
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:55,920
little bit more specific on the question

1872
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:59,719
yeah May is he talking about old Ed or

1873
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:02,600
is he talking about uh Ed no no CU he he

1874
01:21:59,719 --> 01:22:07,079
said Ed Rosenthal so not old

1875
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:10,840
Ed well I I never knew of Ed roseval

1876
01:22:07,079 --> 01:22:10,840
having his serious seed

1877
01:22:11,479 --> 01:22:17,359
collection yeah I don't know yeah

1878
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:19,039
neither did I but perhaps we're we don't

1879
01:22:17,359 --> 01:22:21,519
know maybe he knows

1880
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:23,960
something I always thought Ed

1881
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:26,600
was I don't know I thought I always

1882
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:28,359
thought he was a writer

1883
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:31,719
that an

1884
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:36,799
educator but all you need to do is ask

1885
01:22:31,719 --> 01:22:40,359
Ed yeah true I you can I like that pond

1886
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:43,119
man that was funny um I bought I

1887
01:22:40,359 --> 01:22:46,960
actually have some seeds from Ed that he

1888
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:50,519
sent me um I have I got them last year

1889
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:52,719
from him so he is making seeds I guess

1890
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:55,000
but uh I remember years ago he had

1891
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:58,840
cultivars I can't remember like J

1892
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:01,520
something or p41 they were all you know

1893
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:05,239
names like that that was quite a while

1894
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:08,159
ago maybe 25 years or 20 years ago shout

1895
01:23:05,238 --> 01:23:10,000
out to rotten skateboards Lobster Farms

1896
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:14,158
what's up

1897
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:17,399
buddy the Durban Poison that I used to

1898
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:21,238
grow starting in the mid 70s in

1899
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:26,599
California before I brought it over here

1900
01:23:21,238 --> 01:23:29,799
uh it actually originated at the transy

1901
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:33,800
coffee shop in Amsterdam Ed Rosenthal

1902
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:40,000
was there in maybe 1980 or 81 or

1903
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:43,239
something he got the seeds from uh a

1904
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:47,039
uh package of weed South

1905
01:23:43,238 --> 01:23:51,158
African Durban Poison and uh brought him

1906
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:52,560
back and gave him to uh his writing

1907
01:23:51,158 --> 01:23:55,519
partner at the

1908
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:59,360
time uh m

1909
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:03,520
Franks and uh Mel Franks shared him with

1910
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:06,479
me and uh when I got him from n every

1911
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:10,000
plant was intersect so it took me three

1912
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:13,959
or four or five years to clean it up and

1913
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:19,000
then uh it was my earliest drug ride

1914
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:21,198
sativa that I had uh up up until the 80s

1915
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:25,960
or 90s

1916
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:28,439
so South African I did get indirectly

1917
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:31,840
from Ed even though I got the seeds

1918
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:34,119
themselves from from

1919
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:35,760
Mel nice to hear those stories right

1920
01:24:34,119 --> 01:24:38,079
from your mouth dude because you would

1921
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,039
not believe how many reiterations there

1922
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:42,760
are of that

1923
01:24:40,039 --> 01:24:46,158
story I was gonna ask about the derin

1924
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:48,840
like so you're saying if I'm just gonna

1925
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:52,238
recap this so it's so you work the line

1926
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:54,440
to make sure it didn't it didn't Herm

1927
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:57,799
and you st

1928
01:24:54,439 --> 01:25:00,599
what had happened is uh Mel Frank had

1929
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:04,159
reproduce them or I think he gave some

1930
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:08,159
to a friend who reproduced them before I

1931
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:11,759
got them and uh he said he accidentally

1932
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:15,319
gave me the ones that were interex and

1933
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:19,360
uh because he didn't know and his friend

1934
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:21,079
wasn't very uh you know literate on the

1935
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:24,719
subject so he didn't understand either

1936
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:27,800
but a few years of work I I would have

1937
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:31,600
to grow large numbers out select the

1938
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:34,480
ones that with were least uh intersex

1939
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:37,520
and then uh I did that a few years and

1940
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:42,519
used the progeny that uh had the lowest

1941
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:44,679
incidents and I I almost got rid of it

1942
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:47,520
completely that's it's interesting you

1943
01:25:44,679 --> 01:25:49,719
say that I I've actually only had with

1944
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:51,480
true Durban lines I've only I've had

1945
01:25:49,719 --> 01:25:53,639
such terrible luck with them like I've

1946
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:55,000
had only when they're outcrossed a

1947
01:25:53,639 --> 01:25:57,239
couple times

1948
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:01,439
have they been something I can go all

1949
01:25:57,238 --> 01:26:04,319
the way through but yeah well SE a lot

1950
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:07,479
of durans that were different than the

1951
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:10,799
ones that Ed brought back the ones that

1952
01:26:07,479 --> 01:26:13,879
I'm talking about are extremely early

1953
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:16,239
like you can Harvest at the end of

1954
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:19,279
August interesting in

1955
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:23,319
California so uh they were very very

1956
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:27,279
early and they had a very strong anosy

1957
01:26:23,319 --> 01:26:28,880
licoricey taste and smell but they were

1958
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:30,599
they really resinous because the ones

1959
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,079
that I grew were super resinous but they

1960
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:36,480
were just really the ones they they were

1961
01:26:33,079 --> 01:26:41,600
fairly resinous yes I I never considered

1962
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:44,718
it super a quality but uh it it was very

1963
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:47,320
good and it was early as [ __ ] I mean I

1964
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:50,560
could pull a skunk plant out of the

1965
01:26:47,319 --> 01:26:53,359
ground I mean excuse me a South African

1966
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:55,119
plant when it was done in California in

1967
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:57,479
my little Greenhouse

1968
01:26:55,118 --> 01:27:00,039
then I could stick a skunk plant in

1969
01:26:57,479 --> 01:27:03,359
there a month or two later it would be

1970
01:27:00,039 --> 01:27:05,840
done and then I could stick a haze plant

1971
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:08,479
in so I could use the same hole three

1972
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:12,760
times in a row with just natural Sun

1973
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:15,959
photo period nice that's

1974
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:17,719
cool wellow yeah that's I I've yeah like

1975
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:20,319
I said I've I've been I've over the

1976
01:27:17,719 --> 01:27:22,118
years had trouble with durans um low

1977
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:23,359
potency is one of the main themes that

1978
01:27:22,118 --> 01:27:26,399
I've gotten but like they look

1979
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:28,559
incredible on the resin looks insane um

1980
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:31,000
and but they're finicky and then they

1981
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:33,600
Herm a lot so we've always kind of

1982
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:36,840
stayed away from them well I I I don't

1983
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:39,400
know if it's the same or somebody else's

1984
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:42,880
because I've seen three or four

1985
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:46,000
different versions of uh of Durban

1986
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:49,359
Poison and none of them were as early as

1987
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:52,960
the the stuff that uh I

1988
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:56,759
was I mean I could grow a crop of 20,000

1989
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:58,719
plants outdoor in the Netherlands it it

1990
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,520
was really

1991
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:03,840
early that's pretty cool um so this this

1992
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:05,679
guy in chat is saying that uh it's

1993
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,360
purple Hindu that you're talking about

1994
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:10,279
Sam not Durban Poison he says Durban

1995
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:11,920
Poison doesn't have that turpine that

1996
01:28:10,279 --> 01:28:14,479
you mentioned he

1997
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:17,639
also a couple other little things he he

1998
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:20,158
can think whatever he wants but uh as

1999
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:23,400
you know I've worked I know my tpes

2000
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:26,000
pretty well we had our own gas cograph

2001
01:28:23,399 --> 01:28:28,279
lab with their ID and we could identify

2002
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:31,039
a turpine in a blink of an

2003
01:28:28,279 --> 01:28:33,238
eye yeah yeah no I just love to see

2004
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,719
people like not realize who you are and

2005
01:28:33,238 --> 01:28:38,000
like he's he's still going he's like

2006
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:38,000
land races won't be

2007
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:47,118
early okay well I'm I'm happy for for

2008
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:49,960
his opinion on life but uh my version of

2009
01:28:47,118 --> 01:28:51,000
The Facts aren't going to change what

2010
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:52,800
are you guys smoking on well your

2011
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:56,479
versions on the facts are based on

2012
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:58,920
reality and his based on reading and so

2013
01:28:56,479 --> 01:28:58,919
there's a

2014
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:05,279
difference well there are a lot of uh

2015
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:08,840
you know land race varieties especially

2016
01:29:05,279 --> 01:29:11,039
Ecuador ones that are extremely late

2017
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:15,119
look at Hayes which originated in

2018
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:16,840
Colombia I mean it's late as hell yeah

2019
01:29:15,118 --> 01:29:20,158
it's

2020
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:20,159
true it's

2021
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:29,079
true so Sam the Su uh the super to TAA

2022
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:32,760
Club Hayes you'd be the one to ask where

2023
01:29:29,079 --> 01:29:35,719
do you believe that came

2024
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:38,199
from because I I've been told so many

2025
01:29:35,719 --> 01:29:40,679
different things and they they I don't

2026
01:29:38,198 --> 01:29:44,638
know what to believe they were doing

2027
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:47,880
growing and then they shifted into seed

2028
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:52,199
production must have been uh I don't

2029
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:55,520
know in the mid 80s okay so basically

2030
01:29:52,198 --> 01:29:58,799
used your stock and others and bl they

2031
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:02,199
used any good stock they could find from

2032
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:04,600
themselves from any friends or uh I was

2033
01:30:02,198 --> 01:30:07,479
happy to sell them all my varieties

2034
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:10,000
because yeah didn't reproduce them pure

2035
01:30:07,479 --> 01:30:13,638
what they did was they made hybrids with

2036
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:17,039
them so I felt you know he was

2037
01:30:13,639 --> 01:30:17,039
responsible for freezin

2038
01:30:17,198 --> 01:30:23,000
right I think freezeland might have been

2039
01:30:20,158 --> 01:30:24,559
even here before him but you you can

2040
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,760
clarify it with him

2041
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:31,239
he's he's still selling organic tab

2042
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:33,000
stuff so uh I noticed his son's

2043
01:30:31,238 --> 01:30:36,319
restarted the seed company and I was

2044
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:39,439
just it was it's in Amsterdam someplace

2045
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:43,599
I I've never been there but uh I don't

2046
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:45,399
go out very much and uh yeah I get I get

2047
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:48,119
to see them I get to see them every once

2048
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:51,519
in a while I I bump into I've seen them

2049
01:30:48,118 --> 01:30:54,439
in Spain was the last time I saw them

2050
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:58,040
yep that's the last time I saw the dad

2051
01:30:54,439 --> 01:31:02,198
but the last time I saw the son was in

2052
01:30:58,039 --> 01:31:05,920
Berlin at the Mary Jane uh conference or

2053
01:31:02,198 --> 01:31:05,919

2057
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:18,600
guy he's got the

2058
01:31:15,399 --> 01:31:21,799
quality seemed like a good good group of

2059
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:25,600
people I just was curious the lineage I

2060

the competition for Neville and his uh

2062
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:33,279
seed

2063
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:42,079
uh yeah his distribution they've been

2064
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:44,118
around as long as him got it that's cool

2065
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:46,600
and did they both get their like some of

2066
01:31:44,118 --> 01:31:49,000
their seeds from you abely yeah that's

2067
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:51,679
what I'm trying to get at no of course

church was at its PE

2109

I think it was around like 1100 so I

2110
01:33:57,319 --> 01:34:00,679
think last week we had maybe

2111
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:06,279
225 nice to see there's this Core group

2112
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,238
of people that kind of want to

2113
01:34:06,279 --> 01:34:11,118
hear you know specific things and

2114
01:34:09,238 --> 01:34:11,959
conversations that we seem to just love

2115
01:34:11,118 --> 01:34:14,920
to

2116
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:16,560

2140
01:35:18,359 --> 01:35:24,479
would be to someone starting their first

2141
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:27,679
indoor grow holy [ __ ] that's uh

2142
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:30,759
I to be honest I'm the wrong person to

2143
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:35,359
ask because that's what I was thinking I

2144
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:39,920
use the Sun or I use the sun through a

2145
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:42,439
greenhouse glass but uh yeah I I I

2146
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:44,840
wouldn't want to give advice because I'm

2147
01:35:42,439 --> 01:35:47,879
not current with lights I'm not current

2148
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:50,639
with a a lot of things that uh are

2149
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:53,359
required for and I never really liked

2150
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:57,639
indoor growing because I like putting my

2151
01:35:53,359 --> 01:36:00,519
hand in the earth and my head under the

2152
01:35:57,639 --> 01:36:03,840
sun yeah makes sense plus you're very

2153
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:05,320
far down the road it's like uh you know

2154
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,119
sometimes if you want to ask kind of

2155
01:36:05,319 --> 01:36:09,079
like a question like that you'd be like

2156
01:36:07,118 --> 01:36:11,439
well let just we don't need to ask an

2157
01:36:09,079 --> 01:36:13,880
expert by any means just ask someone who

2158
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:15,599
has like a who's had a small grow or

2159
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:17,159
whatever which I'm sure there's many

2160
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:20,639
people here in the chat room who can

2161
01:36:17,158 --> 01:36:22,599
help that gentleman answer his uh his

2162
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:24,440
question how would he go about his first

2163
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:26,960
grow I personally would say get a small

2164
01:36:24,439 --> 01:36:29,198
tent you know do some research on lights

2165
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:31,439
figure out if you want HPS or LED feel

2166
01:36:29,198 --> 01:36:33,118
free to reach out to me uh and I can

2167
01:36:31,439 --> 01:36:34,839
have a discussion with you about lights

2168
01:36:33,118 --> 01:36:37,719
BC bubbleman

2169
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:40,119
icloud.com and just uh start slow and

2170
01:36:37,719 --> 01:36:41,960
and you know get get some some good

2171
01:36:40,118 --> 01:36:43,559
genetics that's kind of the hard part

2172
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:45,198
like I would say like make sure that

2173
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:48,560
what you're going to spend your months

2174
01:36:45,198 --> 01:36:50,399
on growing are like really good genetics

2175
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,960
not just someone's version of like they

2176
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:53,719
said these were really good genetics

2177
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:55,920
make sure like the reviews are there

2178
01:36:53,719 --> 01:36:58,198
make sure the source is correct and that

2179
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:59,800
you're not getting scammed on your seeds

2180
01:36:58,198 --> 01:37:03,238
or your clones or however you're going

2181
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:05,159
to get your um genetics and then I would

2182
01:37:03,238 --> 01:37:07,238
say as a firsttime grower and if you're

2183
01:37:05,158 --> 01:37:09,799
in the US in particular definitely look

2184
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:12,279
at those tarantula Predators from

2185
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:14,880
Grandmaster because that UVC light just

2186
01:37:12,279 --> 01:37:16,399
as a preventative for five minutes a day

2187
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,880
when the light when the lights are all

2188
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:21,439
off and you're not in there and the

2189
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:23,600
tents all closed up um that's a huge

2190
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:25,399
advantage to a beginner grower you know

2191
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:30,199
when you're a beginner grower if you can

2192
01:37:25,399 --> 01:37:32,839
kind of just keep bugs and mildew at Bay

2193
01:37:30,198 --> 01:37:34,879
that is going to give you a pretty large

2194
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:38,760
Advantage I know

2195
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:40,480
that what's that grant grant waiter said

2196
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:42,400
LOL grow big bud you know what that

2197
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:44,158
generally made me laugh because I'll be

2198
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:46,279
honest I'll raise my hand here I've

2199
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:49,559
grown big bud literally when I was a

2200
01:37:46,279 --> 01:37:51,840
teenager I grew big bud and dude I grew

2201
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:54,599
fat coal is the size of 2 lit bottles

2202
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:58,159
literally it looked like big fat

2203
01:37:54,599 --> 01:38:00,679
2 lit bottle colas man so if that's your

2204
01:37:58,158 --> 01:38:02,279
first experience growing weed that'll

2205
01:38:00,679 --> 01:38:04,520
that'll let your light your world on

2206
01:38:02,279 --> 01:38:06,479
fire man because it certainly did to me

2207
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:09,560
it definitely gets you excited I I'll

2208
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:11,638
tell you the I I remember in 99 or 2000

2209
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:13,360
I took Gypsy Nirvana to the Sunshine

2210
01:38:11,639 --> 01:38:16,719
Coast to my buddy's place who was

2211
01:38:13,359 --> 01:38:18,559
growing the BC hash plants and you know

2212
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:21,198
the the top buds on that plant are

2213
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:24,119
literally like bigger than a 2 L pop

2214
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:26,279
bottle the bottom buds I pictures of

2215
01:38:24,118 --> 01:38:29,039
gypsy leaning his head in and the bottom

2216
01:38:26,279 --> 01:38:34,039
buds of these plants are about the size

2217
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:37,319
of his head it was like a 10 by 10 room

2218
01:38:34,039 --> 01:38:39,279
that the guy pulled out like 23 LBS or

2219
01:38:37,319 --> 01:38:41,279
something like it was absolutely insane

2220
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:44,118
weed but that was also the cut if you

2221
01:38:41,279 --> 01:38:46,039
ever remembered that this that you could

2222
01:38:44,118 --> 01:38:48,039
get in trouble if you weren't supposed

2223
01:38:46,039 --> 01:38:50,519
to have it and you started posting it

2224
01:38:48,039 --> 01:38:52,198
online that you had it so it was like it

2225
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:54,679
came from a very specific group of

2226
01:38:52,198 --> 01:38:56,719
people uh and if you were growing it and

2227
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:58,920
they didn't want you to be then that

2228
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:01,560
could that could bring you the wrong

2229
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:04,760
attention yeah that was it's it's

2230
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:07,719
impossible to spread to stop the spread

2231
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:10,560
of cannabis because it works by the

2232
01:39:07,719 --> 01:39:12,719
Cannabis osmosis Theory you know

2233
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:17,320
wherever it's needed it

2234
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:17,319
goes yeah and it seems to be needed

2235
01:39:17,639 --> 01:39:22,000
everywhere Hey listen even the first

2236
01:39:19,639 --> 01:39:24,639
time I went to Jamaica and I made bubble

2237
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,399
hash every I make this hash with this

2238
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:28,039
group I'd be all stoked and then you

2239
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:31,079
know after about five or 10 minutes

2240
01:39:28,039 --> 01:39:33,519
they'd be like you can't show anyone

2241
01:39:31,079 --> 01:39:36,679
else and I was like oh dude I'm

2242
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:39,360
literally going to show everyone else

2243
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:41,760
and there was a lot of people that asked

2244
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:43,799
me that not to show anyone else in

2245
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:45,880
particular places but Jamaica was like a

2246
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:47,760
high there was a high percentage of

2247
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:49,840
people it's the more difficult time

2248
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:52,159
there's less opportunity you know people

2249
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,880
have it rough uh in certain places and I

2250
01:39:52,158 --> 01:39:56,399
was showing some people that really did

2251
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:57,880
have it rough uh but I I always said you

2252
01:39:56,399 --> 01:39:59,799
know what no don't worry about that I'm

2253
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:02,319
going to show everyone you just hone in

2254
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:04,279
on the best that you can find and grow

2255
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:06,439
and and make the best that you can and

2256
01:40:04,279 --> 01:40:10,039
that's how you'll stand out with it and

2257
01:40:06,439 --> 01:40:12,919
uh to my word I did keep showing people

2258
01:40:10,039 --> 01:40:17,800
and boy I damn near did show everyone

2259
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:21,399
Mar Marcus in the in the mid 80s people

2260
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:25,320
said to me you know just sell me your

2261
01:40:21,399 --> 01:40:25,319
skunk number one nobody

2262
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:30,479
El that's I think it's just the fear and

2263
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:32,359
scarcity Vibe we all fall victim to it

2264
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:35,238
sometimes I I'm certainly not judging

2265
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:38,598
people for having the fear and scarcity

2266
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:41,959
it's uh it's a good vibe to to to to

2267
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:43,719
change and and convert or transfer into

2268
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:48,079
love and abundance if you can figure it

2269
01:40:43,719 --> 01:40:48,079
out but uh

2270
01:40:48,439 --> 01:40:55,118
yeah that's what I'll say about

2271
01:40:51,399 --> 01:40:58,000
that don't grow it just me I'm the only

2272
01:40:55,118 --> 01:41:01,079

01:41:01,079 --> 01:41:05,719
sell it to everyone sorry

2275
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:08,159
everyone and then we all have our

2276
01:41:05,719 --> 01:41:12,039
stories like skunk number one that was

2277
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:15,079
like the first weed I bought in a Dutch

2278
01:41:12,039 --> 01:41:16,319
coffee shop on the dam Rock like

2279
01:41:15,079 --> 01:41:19,359
literally

2280
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:22,559
like got off the out of the train

2281
01:41:19,359 --> 01:41:25,839
station walked up turned left bam

2282
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:28,280
sitting down 1995 for me and we went and

2283
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:33,119
bought some skunk number one and we were

2284
01:41:28,279 --> 01:41:36,559
just uh just loving it just this fruity

2285
01:41:33,118 --> 01:41:39,319
explosion of flavor and smell and just

2286
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:41,039
it was just lovely really really really

2287
01:41:39,319 --> 01:41:43,399
lovely especially coming from Winnipeg

2288
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:44,800
Manitoba and kind of growing weed

2289
01:41:43,399 --> 01:41:46,960
already where it was like you could

2290
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:49,000
really get in trouble and end up in

2291
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:52,520
prison with like hardened criminals if

2292
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,880
you got caught which was uh I mean it

2293
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:57,719
goes to show about that cannabis osmosis

2294
01:41:54,880 --> 01:42:00,319
and how it really almost infects the

2295
01:41:57,719 --> 01:42:02,198
soul in the way that it's like we're

2296
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:05,759
we're a part of each other now like

2297
01:42:02,198 --> 01:42:07,559
willing to like just the the risk at

2298
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,920
that time in my life I would not have

2299
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:11,400
taken that risk for anything else the

2300
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:14,239
risk of like getting in trouble and

2301
01:42:11,399 --> 01:42:16,479
ending up in in a prison not a jail a

2302
01:42:14,238 --> 01:42:17,879
prison with like the most hardened

2303
01:42:16,479 --> 01:42:20,039
criminals that you could possibly

2304
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:22,239
imagine we'll get my old Mentor Ron

2305
01:42:20,039 --> 01:42:24,439
hickey in here one of these days and get

2306
01:42:22,238 --> 01:42:26,079
him to tell some stor of his experience

2307
01:42:24,439 --> 01:42:28,839
at the Stony Mountain Penitentiary

2308
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:31,000
because it is absolutely Bonkers that

2309
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:34,840
they put someone who just loves flowers

2310
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:36,880
in a prison like that for 11 years it's

2311
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:38,800
Bonkers and I know that there's worse

2312
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:41,960
stories I know Rick delisi's father was

2313
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:43,800
away for oh God I think it was 37 years

2314
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:47,520
we'll have to get them uh to come on

2315
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:50,880
hash church for sure Rick and uh his his

2316
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:52,320
father uh to tell those stories and I

2317
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,079
mean I've heard them from Rick and I've

2318
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:56,158
seen Rick tell them and been in rooms

2319
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:58,920
when he's been interviewed but uh I've

2320
01:42:56,158 --> 01:43:00,279
never met his his father so um and I was

2321
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:03,199
definitely like one of the early

2322
01:43:00,279 --> 01:43:05,319
adopters of the free delisi promoting it

2323
01:43:03,198 --> 01:43:06,759
as much as I could giving it exposure

2324
01:43:05,319 --> 01:43:08,639
the best that I could because I just

2325
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:10,560
thought it was one of the most

2326
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:12,840
nightmarish stories you know when he

2327
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:15,960
told me I haven't seen my dad without

2328
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:18,400
plexiglass like since I was 11 years old

2329
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:20,158
like that is if he would have been

2330
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:22,479
sentenced if he would have been

2331
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:24,479
sentenced federally he would have been

2332
01:43:22,479 --> 01:43:27,718
released early earlier but because he

2333
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:30,479
was in the State of Florida and uh it

2334
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:33,760
his sentencing was controlled by the

2335
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:35,598
Florida Judicial System uh they were

2336
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:39,639
never going to let him go

2337
01:43:35,599 --> 01:43:43,159
until I guess finally they did during

2338
01:43:39,639 --> 01:43:46,118
covid yeah I I have a friend I grew up

2339
01:43:43,158 --> 01:43:49,598
with that was let out in Co she ran an

2340
01:43:46,118 --> 01:43:52,399
incredible she was a I consider her gret

2341
01:43:49,599 --> 01:43:54,119
I'll just say gret she was a Visionary

2342
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:56,439
she

2343
01:43:54,118 --> 01:43:59,118
we had the whole East Coast unlock it

2344
01:43:56,439 --> 01:44:02,799
was just incredible she was a Visionary

2345
01:43:59,118 --> 01:44:04,880
and Gretch taught me a lot and you know

2346
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:07,760
she was a Visionary for where we're at

2347
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:09,719
today in terms of logistics and how herb

2348
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:11,719
moved around and who grew it and how it

2349
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:14,158
was grown and respect behind the herb

2350
01:44:11,719 --> 01:44:15,840
and how she aggregated it and allowed it

2351
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:18,759
to get to the people it was really

2352
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:21,039
interesting um so I think those are the

2353
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:23,719
people that paved the way for where

2354
01:44:21,039 --> 01:44:26,760
certainly I think we all sit today

2355
01:44:23,719 --> 01:44:29,439
um in a lot of respect um it's it's how

2356
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:31,840
traditionally we all called our our

2357
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:34,359
buddy to get a get a get a good bag of

2358
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:36,440
herb or in some of us how we

2359
01:44:34,359 --> 01:44:39,559
communicated with one another to trade

2360
01:44:36,439 --> 01:44:42,439
cuting or to grow herb to get it out to

2361
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:44,599
people and I think that was also a like

2362
01:44:42,439 --> 01:44:47,598
the Underground Railroad if if you will

2363
01:44:44,599 --> 01:44:49,800
of of our community and I think we all

2364
01:44:47,599 --> 01:44:51,719
protected one another in ways that um

2365
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:55,360
allowed us to get you know do what we're

2366
01:44:51,719 --> 01:44:57,399
doing today and she was definitely um

2367
01:44:55,359 --> 01:45:01,118
someone that I looked at as an

2368
01:44:57,399 --> 01:45:03,319
inspiration um and I think the deli is

2369
01:45:01,118 --> 01:45:05,359
also in in in that way in that same

2370
01:45:03,319 --> 01:45:08,319
light he's he was a Visionary he had a

2371
01:45:05,359 --> 01:45:10,799
vision for um what he was doing in a

2372
01:45:08,319 --> 01:45:13,359
different way much like Dave you know

2373
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:16,719
David you with your genetics and what

2374
01:45:13,359 --> 01:45:19,439
you did in Amsterdam you know very much

2375
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:23,118
Visionary um and how that shaped what

2376
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:25,000
we're doing now you know I'm very my God

2377
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:26,238
thankful for all of it you know it

2378
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,960
really helps

2379
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:31,399
me because I get to have you know

2380
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:35,840
something to to look back to and I know

2381
01:45:31,399 --> 01:45:39,399
all of us here um share that same common

2382
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:41,679
threat you know like Mich for Mark

2383
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:44,519
scalone you know Dr Mark you know you

2384
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:46,399
you have certainly taken that work and

2385
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:49,719
created your own world and in which you

2386
01:45:46,399 --> 01:45:53,839
occupy and continue to push it you know

2387
01:45:49,719 --> 01:45:57,319
well my longest goal has been that every

2388
01:45:53,840 --> 01:46:00,119
person in every country should be able

2389
01:45:57,319 --> 01:46:03,759
to grow for any purpose if they want to

2390
01:46:00,118 --> 01:46:06,238
sell it for profit then I it should be

2391
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:11,400
somehow regulated so the consumer is

2392
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:14,479
safe but except for that uh yeah this is

2393
01:46:11,399 --> 01:46:16,960
all slowly but surely crumbling in front

2394
01:46:14,479 --> 01:46:20,439
of our eyes some some places will take

2395
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:21,920
longer but uh already they can't go back

2396
01:46:20,439 --> 01:46:26,638
it's too late you can't put the

2397
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:28,480
toothpast back in the tube yeah and like

2398
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:30,359
in the chat like bear grows it if you've

2399
01:46:28,479 --> 01:46:31,638
been growing since 92 then you

2400
01:46:30,359 --> 01:46:33,439
understand what I've been through in New

2401
01:46:31,639 --> 01:46:35,520
York and you understand what others like

2402
01:46:33,439 --> 01:46:37,678
us have been through on the East Coast

2403
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:40,679
especially in and in Vermont and other

2404
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:42,158
space other states you know it's it was

2405
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:45,199
really

2406
01:46:42,158 --> 01:46:47,638
tough um and it must be a trip just like

2407
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:50,479
it is for for for me for you to walk

2408
01:46:47,639 --> 01:46:53,319
around and see how open it is especially

2409
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:56,319
in New York it's nuts

2410
01:46:53,319 --> 01:47:00,920
latest thing that opened in uh Amsterdam

2411
01:46:56,319 --> 01:47:05,920

so I have nothing against him I more

2436
01:48:23,118 --> 01:48:30,639
power to him I'm for anybody who can be

2437
01:48:26,238 --> 01:48:33,158
successful at cannabis uh I'm happy for

2438
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:35,520
them well he's definitely a spokesman

2439
01:48:33,158 --> 01:48:39,319
for it in the sense that he's helping

2440
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:43,560
normalize the mainstream use of

2441
01:48:39,319 --> 01:48:47,759
it yeah I think that's that's well well

2442
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:50,360

saying I'm not smoke or whatever the ad

2444
01:48:50,359 --> 01:48:54,238
was I can't remember but he was talking

2445
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:58,399
about how he going to quit

2446
01:48:54,238 --> 01:49:02,598

Ian the whole crew over

2470
01:50:06,118 --> 01:50:12,238
there yeah's asking us to Dre Dre's

2471
01:50:10,399 --> 01:50:14,759
asking us to talk about our thoughts on

2472
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:17,678
hlvd epidemic but I think we should do

2473
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:19,560
an episode on that and I'll get like Ian

2474
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:22,480
uh from high Labs who used to be over at

2475
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:24,360
segra and some other people maybe we can

2476
01:50:22,479 --> 01:50:26,158
get Kevin mccurn in I have been trying

2477
01:50:24,359 --> 01:50:28,079
to get him in for a like the last two

2478
01:50:26,158 --> 01:50:29,719
weeks I've been sending him messages so

2479
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:31,880
hopefully he sees one of those and we

2480
01:50:29,719 --> 01:50:34,158
can get him in and then anyone else that

2481
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:37,239
you guys in the chat or in the panel

2482
01:50:34,158 --> 01:50:39,118
think that would be great for a

2483
01:50:37,238 --> 01:50:44,039
conversation

2484
01:50:39,118 --> 01:50:47,880
hlvd just tell our thoughts on the hlvd

2485
01:50:44,039 --> 01:50:51,238
epidemic I mean I've been do I forget

2486
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:54,078
who I forget who did the paper but

2487
01:50:51,238 --> 01:50:58,519
recently a paper came out out that uh

2488
01:50:54,078 --> 01:51:02,599
showed that uh maybe it was the guy at

2489
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:06,119
gelf University I'm not sure and uh it

2490
01:51:02,599 --> 01:51:09,639
showed that it's transmitted by not only

2491
01:51:06,118 --> 01:51:13,639
insects and tools and people but it can

2492
01:51:09,639 --> 01:51:19,279
be spread by pollen it can be spread by

2493
01:51:13,639 --> 01:51:22,118
seeds so you know this is and one of the

2494
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:25,439
biggest warnings is if you're using any

2495
01:51:22,118 --> 01:51:28,319
sort of aquaponics thing it can spread

2496
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:30,359
in aquaponics totally easy if one of

2497
01:51:28,319 --> 01:51:32,319
them's got it it can spread through

2498
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:34,880
water we didn't real we didn't realize

2499
01:51:32,319 --> 01:51:38,118
that before so I I started with Kevin in

2500
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:40,800
20 late 2018 when I got a sample and

2501
01:51:38,118 --> 01:51:43,598
that's what started the whole he built

2502
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:46,679
the whole assay off of that one sample

2503
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:49,199
yeah so he collected more samples and

2504
01:51:46,679 --> 01:51:51,440
then built more um so I think it would

2505
01:51:49,198 --> 01:51:53,479
be great to have him on so you could go

2506
01:51:51,439 --> 01:51:55,678
through the data like I actually have

2507
01:51:53,479 --> 01:51:57,279
full spreadsheets with the data but I

2508
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:59,319
think it would be better for him to

2509
01:51:57,279 --> 01:52:02,439
break it down because there's certain

2510
01:51:59,319 --> 01:52:06,599
things I don't understand about the data

2511
01:52:02,439 --> 01:52:10,359
um but we we learned a lot I did a hop

2512
01:52:06,599 --> 01:52:13,239
um I did a a leaf Hopper study where I

2513
01:52:10,359 --> 01:52:15,960
put plants in one Greenhouse that were

2514
01:52:13,238 --> 01:52:18,919
closed off and sealed and one that was

2515
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:22,039
open in a plant that was close to that

2516
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:23,960
greenhouse and the leaf Hoppers tested

2517
01:52:22,039 --> 01:52:27,078
positive for for hot blade and vroid so

2518
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:28,960
we'll I think Kevin can go through a lot

2519
01:52:27,078 --> 01:52:31,679
of the I can I can go through my data

2520
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:34,239
points and explain it all but pretty

2521
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:37,078
much every Vector that you can think of

2522
01:52:34,238 --> 01:52:39,879
that is transmittable by

2523
01:52:37,078 --> 01:52:42,559
touch is it is possible and then

2524
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:46,520
furthermore water is another carrier

2525
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:51,199
that we didn't at first believe was

2526
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:53,079
real tools W you know Roots soil touch

2527
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:56,000
gloves I mean

2528
01:52:53,078 --> 01:52:59,559
I mean any you name it everything it's

2529
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:02,800
nuts it's a virus all of reality you're

2530
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:05,360
gonna die you're gonna VAP R and hldd

2531
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:07,079
you know but no it's not you can't treat

2532
01:53:05,359 --> 01:53:09,679
it like that you can't look it's not

2533
01:53:07,078 --> 01:53:12,118
doomsday it's just you have to be aware

2534
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:15,319
of your surroundings and just bake it

2535
01:53:12,118 --> 01:53:18,920
into your Sops now and just wash your

2536
01:53:15,319 --> 01:53:20,920
hands use you know bleach you know um

2537
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:24,679
ISO will not kill the virus you have to

2538
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:27,719
bleach it um test your plants and just

2539
01:53:24,679 --> 01:53:29,520
continue to be a good Steward and check

2540
01:53:27,719 --> 01:53:31,840
all those boxes for yourself and you

2541
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:34,639
shouldn't have any problems but if you

2542
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:36,520
taking clones from other people you

2543
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:38,840
should have a protocol that that first

2544
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:41,920
goes out to sampling and get that tested

2545
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:44,360
for that and then test for all 12 of the

2546
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:47,679
viroids that we know the Cucumber vroid

2547
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:51,118
there's others besides hopl and vroid um

2548
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:54,000
I have a list of 29 viruses that have

2549
01:53:51,118 --> 01:53:57,319
been recorded in cannabis

2550
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:59,479
wow so I recommend just like everything

2551
01:53:57,319 --> 01:54:01,118
quarantine everything and and also get

2552
01:53:59,479 --> 01:54:03,839
it it tested with

2553
01:54:01,118 --> 01:54:05,920
qpcr and and that's the best you're

2554
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:07,279
going to do and just constantly keep the

2555
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:09,920
your stuff

2556
01:54:07,279 --> 01:54:11,599
clean um well I think we should try and

2557
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:13,158
get a conversation going in the next

2558
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:15,719
couple of weeks if you want to help me

2559
01:54:13,158 --> 01:54:18,439
col and organize some names and stuff I

2560
01:54:15,719 --> 01:54:20,679
I obviously Kevin's on there maybe Dr uh

2561
01:54:18,439 --> 01:54:24,879
someone wrote in the chat Dr Joe ramahi

2562
01:54:20,679 --> 01:54:26,599
and Dr Gupta at IAL genomics as well so

2563
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:28,560
could get a whole crew of some

2564
01:54:26,599 --> 01:54:30,760
interesting folks to discuss it I'd like

2565
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:33,119
to learn more about kind of The Cutting

2566
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:35,159
Edge and what's going on right now I'll

2567
01:54:33,118 --> 01:54:38,439
look for that recent paper I'm thinking

2568
01:54:35,158 --> 01:54:39,839
about and uh I'll I'll include the names

2569
01:54:38,439 --> 01:54:43,359
and send them to you

2570
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:45,078
Marcus oh thank you that'd be great yeah

2571
01:54:43,359 --> 01:54:47,960
there's a there's a few people that are

2572
01:54:45,078 --> 01:54:49,439
really taking this on um with some

2573
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:51,679
really great studies and there's also

2574
01:54:49,439 --> 01:54:54,359
some really great existing stuff that's

2575
01:54:51,679 --> 01:54:58,279
out there um that that

2576
01:54:54,359 --> 01:54:59,559
predates you know all of us so um

2577
01:54:58,279 --> 01:55:01,118
there's a lot to dig into I think it

2578
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:03,920
would be great so I'll put together a

2579
01:55:01,118 --> 01:55:05,519
list for you guys of names and we'll

2580
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:08,800
it'll be a great conversation because

2581
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:12,000
it's it's such a deep one it's it's kind

2582
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:13,719
of it's fascinating what we're learning

2583
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,359
it's just at first we kind of thought

2584
01:55:13,719 --> 01:55:17,399
this was like maybe not real and then

2585
01:55:16,359 --> 01:55:20,279
all of a sudden it just kind of

2586
01:55:17,399 --> 01:55:23,158
snowballed into okay this is real

2587
01:55:20,279 --> 01:55:25,000
but what do we do to

2588
01:55:23,158 --> 01:55:28,799
I better understand how it's actually

2589
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:31,319
happening because no one R mites were

2590
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:34,560
bad that's another topic I'd love to get

2591
01:55:31,319 --> 01:55:36,880
on um actually because to be honest I've

2592
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:38,679
in my whole career of growing I've never

2593
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:40,279
been able to eradicate russed mites I

2594
01:55:38,679 --> 01:55:41,679
know people have told me they have but

2595
01:55:40,279 --> 01:55:44,359
I've never seen it I've never

2596
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:45,840
experienced it in my career all the best

2597
01:55:44,359 --> 01:55:48,598
I've done is walk into a room with a

2598
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:52,679
flamethrower and take everything out and

2599
01:55:48,599 --> 01:55:56,279
then shut it down and we just there's no

2600
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:59,239
there's no fighting it um they are

2601
01:55:56,279 --> 01:56:01,920
absolutely what you can do is you can

2602
01:55:59,238 --> 01:56:05,519
control the economic damage they're

2603
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:07,840
causing enough that uh you can still

2604
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:12,199
Harvest your crop without it being

2605
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:15,480
severely damaged sure but but uh yeah

2606
01:56:12,198 --> 01:56:18,799
I've never been able to even completely

2607
01:56:15,479 --> 01:56:21,959
eliminate two spotted spidermite from a

2608
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:22,800
large Greenhouse once you get it good

2609
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:25,920
luck

2610
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:30,639
I mean you can control it absolutely you

2611
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:34,118
know with uh Predators but uh yeah you

2612
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:37,440
don't get them on yeah I mean I and

2613
01:56:34,118 --> 01:56:40,000
we're really to be honest like

2614
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:42,238
extremely just on top of everything so

2615
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,840
it's you know we experienced it three

2616
01:56:42,238 --> 01:56:46,638
years ago and I'll never forget it

2617
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:48,199
because it was like it was a burn it was

2618
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:50,599
really it was to the point where I'm

2619
01:56:48,198 --> 01:56:54,198
like we just we can't we just have to

2620
01:56:50,599 --> 01:56:57,199
take it all down you can't can't do it

2621
01:56:54,198 --> 01:56:59,000
um but I do think that um we should

2622
01:56:57,198 --> 01:57:01,439
bring I'd love to bring someone on to

2623
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:04,198
talk about IPM and just like it'd be

2624
01:57:01,439 --> 01:57:05,960
great a great conversation yeah we we I

2625
01:57:04,198 --> 01:57:07,678
have access to a young guy and I can't

2626
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:09,800
remember what his name is but Thomas

2627
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:12,679
brought him up to show him that UVC

2628
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:14,920
light um and he's kind of this you know

2629
01:57:12,679 --> 01:57:17,199
IPM genius in the Cannabis World young

2630
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:21,279
kid I met him he was really nice Matt

2631
01:57:17,198 --> 01:57:22,919
Gates what's that Matt Gates oh yeah it

2632
01:57:21,279 --> 01:57:24,840
was Matt you're right so there you go

2633
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:28,480
perfect so we I'm sure we can get mad on

2634
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:32,000
easy enough and uh some other

2635
01:57:28,479 --> 01:57:35,439
folks uba none of that stuff had fully

2636
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:40,399
worked for me I mean I I

2637
01:57:35,439 --> 01:57:44,319
under yeah but it sounded like um The

2638
01:57:40,399 --> 01:57:46,039
Grandmaster lady setup was a little bit

2639
01:57:44,319 --> 01:57:48,000
different than the the setups that I had

2640
01:57:46,039 --> 01:57:51,039
used Marcus remember we had that call we

2641
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:53,960
talked about it where we had tried it

2642
01:57:51,039 --> 01:57:58,560
and we had Sal sum of success but not to

2643
01:57:53,960 --> 01:58:02,359
the point like what grandmas had had um

2644
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:05,079
yeah it's it's been to say the least

2645
01:58:02,359 --> 01:58:06,960
yeah I'm uh I think we have homework

2646
