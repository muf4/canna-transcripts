17
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,518

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,280
little bit of a session before we get

19
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:03,238

21
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,560
it's to be expected at the airport isn't

22
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:11,438
it so yeah I've just got my car parked

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,560
up around here waiting for him to arrive

24
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,758

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,840

78
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,319
celebration and as well my first Booth

79
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,079
of the cup was 95 yes the cannabies the

80
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:08,359
first cannabies that's was my first

81
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,319
public have you been there course that's

82
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,120
probably where we met because I had a

83
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,399
booth with the Cannabis business in what

84
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,400
was it

85
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:20,639
90 I wonder if it was 97

86
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,120
or was it a little earlier than that the

87
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,160
can business in Dortmund I was there but

88
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,399
this was 1995 was the first one I'm sure

89
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,639
1995 okay okay that's why I have 20 this

90
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:36,000
is 2015 oh yes yes my first Cannabis Cup

91
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:39,840
in Amsterdam also was in

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,038
1995 and it was like accidental that was

93
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,799
not planned so I mean I I make this for

94
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:46,839
years with no name and I find out the

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,478
child needs to have a name so that you

96
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:52,079
know what you're talking about right so

97
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:56,079
otherwise this is just a clear piece of

98
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:59,000
glass you true was like um in any other

99
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,599
area of the market it was very uncommon

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,839
a jeans is no name a car with no name

101
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,639
sure nobody will accept that you know a

102
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,119
watch with no name so it took a few

103
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,519
years to give give it a name uh uh yeah

104
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,519
it took me like one two years to find it

105
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:16,439
I I I I I had my I didn't have the name

106
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:20,318
but I had my vision what it should be it

107
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:23,120
should be like Timeless sing and show

108
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,160
some yeah some kind of design some

109
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,478
Timeless design you know I love that

110
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:32,479
it's a pal Dr and so we had so many

111
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:34,680
suggestions and go through kind of I

112
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,839
wanted to have like the double meaning

113
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,680
sing in it mhm because

114
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:43,638
uh especially in our industry you know

115
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,120
it's often this double meaning if you

116
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,199
make it intelligent then absolutely it's

117
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,680
they here like forever and I know the

118
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,280
double meaning I know the story of the

119
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,120
RO it's like a yeah it's a very cool but

120
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,839
even the name you told me years ago

121
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,038
about how you found that name yeah he

122

125
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:13,598
and and

126
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:16,199
uh started selling his book in in German

127
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:18,719
was the first language which was transl

128
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,240
and it was the word that you

129
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,000

130
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,960
microorganism no this this is the the

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,560
word microorganism was on a title from a

132
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:34,198
book which which said the biology of

133
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,319
microorganism this was the book about

134
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,598
was on the title H yeah so if you say

135
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,319
that word

136
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:43,639
microorganism right you say it enough

137
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,280
times you'll you'll hear the word RAR in

138
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:49,680
there micro organism it's the it's at

139
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:54,799
the end of micro and at the start of

140
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:57,519
organism you get r o and o r and uh yeah

141
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,079
the rest is history rure well we're

142
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,038
going to actually be showing some rure

143
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,439
pipes in a little bit a few historical

144
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,719
pieces from the past but uh yeah we just

145
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,399
thought we'd kind of let you guys know

146
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,319
that we made it back to the hotel we're

147
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,799
in downtown Vancouver we stopped off at

148
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,199
Eden we're going to be in

149
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,280

150
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,800

151
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,478
we're going to be at the Great Northern

152
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,280
extraction the first annual so this is a

153
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,079
little thing that they're putting on I

154
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,318
guess I don't know if it's with Eden in

155
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,038
conjunction but we went to Eden today

156
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,639
this was the first dispensary Martin

157
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:34,199
ever seen in Vancouver and they gave us

158
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,400
a bunch of really nice things actually

159
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,720
we got uh what did we get we got uh well

160
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:42,478

162
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:48,318

165
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,800
enrio and then they also gave us all

166
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:57,399
sorts of uh little candies little

167
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,120
droplets goner

168
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:02,638
droplets um a couple of cookies some

169
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,079
nice chocolate chip uh peanut butter

170
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,079
cookies and then also some really nice

171
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:12,639
chocolates really nice pieces of uh

172
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:14,560
homemade chocolates so Edibles

173
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,639
and

174
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,319
extracts never a bad thing right yeah no

175
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,478
they good and then of course I'm pretty

176
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:26,280
impressed is a

177
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:30,158
um the legalization or the

178
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:32,958
open how this is dealt with you can uh

179
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:36,080
and this is pretty amazing compared to

180
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:39,759
Germany or other parts of Europe or the

181
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,240
world so you pretty good here and keep

182
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:44,879
on fighting for it so if you think it's

183
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,639
pretty good it comes over the ocean when

184
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:50,799
it's you know when it's you hear it

185
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:53,039
every day in Canada in North America

186
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:56,519
it's uh now it's pretty much in the

187
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:59,519
media but the politicans don't react yet

188
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,159
so well it's going to happen in Germany

189
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,159
no doubt about it you know it's just a

190
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:05,559
matter of Germany's a a tough a tough

191
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,919
nut to crack like you said there's a lot

192
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,679
of history there and you know you can't

193
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,519
really for instance when we came out

194
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,439
well even when I picked Martin up at the

195
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,399
airport we walked out across the street

196
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,640
and I could tell he probably wanted to

197
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,559
have a one of his American Spirits he'd

198
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:24,559
been on a 12 plus 10 hour flight with

199
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:25,838
waiting and whatnot maybe more and so we

200
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,199
I just said oh let's just walk right

201
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,680
over here and literally within like 30

202
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,320
seconds of walking out the air Port

203
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:35,159
we're in this natury beautiful Zone and

204
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,640
I actually had a little of Horatio's

205
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:40,039
delimine extract so I was able to put a

206
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,759
little tiny dab on the uh American

207
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:45,360
Spirit Forum so nice way to land in

208
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:49,319
Vancouver yeah it's definitely very good

209
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,000
to see that and so uh uh I already

210
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,440
thought uh we should probably think

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,879
positive so when we know it will going

212
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,519
to be happen one day Absolut we should

213
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,480
have something to present and to start

214
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,799
is or to you know to organize like the

215
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,440
first cup or the first something like

216
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,000
absolutely right away they when they do

217
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,640
something you know trust me it happens

218
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,600
fast nowadays you know it might be like

219
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,240
all like closed off and no one's doing

220
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,278
it but the minute it blows that's why I

221
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,759
say we should B start thinking about

222
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:21,519
what to do so maybe internationally he

223
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:23,200
also do something you know you will 100%

224
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,078
be inspired by

225
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,680
420 in two days cuz there's going to be

226
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,078
there's literally like I don't even know

227
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,879
how many thousand thousands of people

228
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,519
but it's just really quite an impressive

229
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,639
Vancouver's 420 is always good we're

230
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,839
going to be down there of course I've

231
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,120
got a booth down there with Johnny B

232
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,040
Martin's going to be down with the

233
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,039
sublimator booth we'll it's already as

234
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,199
it seems so I looked a little bit up in

235
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:52,078
the internet about the history and the

236
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,160
the last days from this 420 in vanov so

237
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,239
it's like Organic Grown there's people

238
00:10:54,159 --> 00:11:00,078
who support that to finance that to

239
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,278
fight for it you know think can't do it

240
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,479
just you I thought about doing something

241
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,919
like this in Europe but you cannot bring

242
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,320
It Like a Rolling Stones concert to

243
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:11,519
every place you know it's like it's

244
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,519
different there not the people who fight

245
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,600
it so they think oh no I can't say that

246
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,759
in public because of the legal situation

247
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,800
which is uh which is unfortunate which

248
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,278
is unfortunate and and what happened to

249
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,039
that dab did you roll it all into the

250
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:28,320
cigarette no no no there's still a

251
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:31,639
little dab left there this was uh was

252
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,680
that the I SED it on yeah that's I

253
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,480

254
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,000

rather enjoyable to go back down memory

293
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,040

that I have on some of the older ones um

295
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:33,919
I mean Roar has been synonymous with the

296
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,958
top of the glass game since well since

297

'95 and um even when before all the

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,958
American Glass was as notorized as it is

300

of the Roar well there's a lot of

363
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,120
collectors that have you know I mean a

364
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,399
lot of people hold on to the Roars they

365
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,399
don't you don't see a lot of them going

366
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,639
up for resale you don't see a lot of

367
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,958
people trying move them so there's got

368
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,120
to be a reason for that yeah I heard

369
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,318
many times so over the years they kind

370
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,599
of

371
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:11,159
get you get close I we see a par so oh

372
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:13,000
yeah every day very very very much and I

373
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,959
mean

374
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:21,759
uh certain like I cool to see yeah we we

375
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,759
I mean that's the most uh what you say

376
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:27,759
get reward or what for your work when

377
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:29,599
people love what you do and so well

378
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,200
they're just not buying it to use it cuz

379
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,678
there are people that buy them to use

380
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,519
them then there are people that are

381
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:39,880
buying them literally to collect them

382
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:43,879
totally yeah I mean you know the the our

383
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,679
philosophy or it's like two two feet

384
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,600
standings know it's the quality and the

385
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,519
the the design and the quality also

386
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:55,798
about how does the filtering system and

387
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:57,200
the volume and these all work together

388
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:01,319
yeah it's always it's all working

389
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,558
machines and when and you respect your

390
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:07,399
if you learned a little bit you you need

391
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:09,200
88 or 4 in4 for example so you see what

392
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,840
is good for you and then it's working

393
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,080
perfect every day MH and yeah true

394
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,119
enough I sure like so that's what is our

395
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:19,199
goal also so like you have your you know

396
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,839
your everyday piece works really good

397
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,240
good to clean the daily driver we even

398
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:28,079

399
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,480

447
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,360

00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:22,639
bit so what do you think of that

585
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:26,319
Martin nearly H op gripping I think what

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,278
is it 88 88 I don't know yeah 88 with

587
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:31,119
counting the the

588
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,759
so as someone that's known for precision

589
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,519
you can feel the Precision in that in

590
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:36,919
that

591
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:39,759
piece in the in the um the Opals and the

592
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:42,919
way they're encased in the glass it's

593
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:48,158
almost uh

594
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:52,960
Martin oh that's the bowl in the ofcc he

595
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,960
encased is it 10 or 10

596
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,679
OP yeah you see they love the quality

597
00:26:55,798 --> 00:27:02,519
there's a lot of very detail did you see

598
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,960
the swing though amazing work in it

599
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:08,359
great just the swing for

600
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,360
now see

601
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:15,798
H how that quartz bucket opens and

602
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:23,759
closes and then that other piece carbs

603
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:25,720
it the same way I was using my uh vial

604
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:29,480
of hash to carb

605
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:32,240
the this pipe comes with a slightly

606
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,240
more fancy

607
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,080
version it's like the most the world's

608
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,558
most expensive ofc

609
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:46,439
yeah and I've seen themel for like what

610
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:48,678
ISC uh optimized flavor zone so like

611
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,440
yeah you know the the Zone it allows you

612
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:54,759
to take a colder colder dab which gets

613
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,519
you more flavor yeah so you put this on

614
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:58,640
here then no the other way though or is

615
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,759
it that way uh oh yeah yeah it is that

616
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,960
way that way yeah like cuz the you would

617
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:07,640
he you would when you torch up the the

618
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,480
tie or the or the um oh yeah quartz it's

619
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,360
so you can have the actual element at a

620
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,798
lower temperature so that the more of

621
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,639
the flavor comes through cuz when it's

622
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:17,359
at a hotter thing it it instead of

623
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,440
vaporizing it combusts so basically caps

624
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,000
it and it's still allowing air to to go

625
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,360
through so you're still going to yeah

626
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,398
it's got that little hole right in the

627
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:29,000
center yeah they're very

628
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:31,079
cool Opals like you wouldn't believe

629
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,200
very cool yeah

630
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:37,398
yeah s also pretty functional this works

631
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,000
also very good this one too cuz it's the

632
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:43,599
one that uh Scott basically is the only

633
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,319
one who can do and it's his his design

634
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,519
yeah this is like all of the designs

635
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:49,798
Martin all of the you know the Taurus

636
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,558
and the kle yeah those are the three cuz

637
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:55,038
this is this is the

638
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:56,960
Taurus right this one's just the Taurus

639
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,960
and then there's the Fab egg and then

640
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,519
there's the Klein that's pieces all

641
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,600
three of them in one

642
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:03,519
piece yeah that's pretty incredible he's

643
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:06,639
going

644
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,599
to tap oh you know what probably won't

645
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,480
