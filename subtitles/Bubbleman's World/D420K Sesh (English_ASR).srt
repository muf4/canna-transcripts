don't go black on the nail that really

34
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,000
is something that's going to happen when

35
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,879
you've got your nail heated up much uh

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,519
well much hotter than say 800° or so 7

or

38
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:51,798
800° I'm sure when it's glowing Orange

39
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,438
it's 12 or, 1400° I'm not sure of the

sir un for you quite a bit of stuff

97
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,279
going on around us there's a lot of

98
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:57,639
people just in the downtown core area

99
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,959
walking around back and forth suits over

100
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,000
here worker dudes over here here

101
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:04,478
everyone in between it's pretty chill

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,720
Vancouver's always been a chill City I

103
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:11,279
have to admit I never felt like

104
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,280
um like I'm really doing anything

105
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,599
wrong you know you don't look around

106
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,600
like you're worried about someone seeing

107
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,879
you because it's just nobody really

108
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,080
cares at all it's uh not really an issue

109
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,918
it's a very puff friendly City I guess I

110
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,680
would go out and say I would be very

111
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,839
surprised to see someone come up to the

112
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,319
window and say hey what do you think

113
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:32,799
you're doing

114
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,160
particularly why tell them to [ __ ] off

115
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
well you probably would it it's easy for

116
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,520
us too though you know obviously the

117
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,879
only illegal part of this at this point

118
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,839
in time would us be driving away after

119
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,639
uh hitting the dabs uh I'm looking

120
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,359
forward to more tests being done and

121
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,519
people maybe being able to even go in

122
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,600
for a test where you get tested at the

123
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,959
DMV under the influence of cannabis just

124
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,240
to make sure that you can drive that way

125
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:58,079
I I myself know that I can but I

126
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,639
certainly don't need to go push it so I

127
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,800
usually just go for a little walk after

128
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,960
after we have a session like this and uh

129
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,598
come back afterwards and and drive away

130
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:10,038
but sitting in our car in this area

131
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:12,519
puffing our meds which we both have

132
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:16,399
Federal licenses for I would say is

133
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:18,279
definitely uh 100% legal might throw the

134
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,038
cops off if they were to drive by and

135
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,159
see it assuming that we were probably

136
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:22,439
going to be driving away right

137
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,319
afterwards they might have a problem

138
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,079
with that but uh we're not knowing that

139
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,840
we have our licenses and we are

140
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,198
medicating they could just look at us

141
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,519
like some [ __ ] bong rip and punks and

142
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,960
you know what the bottom line is the

143
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:39,399
bong rip RI and punks and the license uh

144
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:41,279
medicated Li the license for medicating

145
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,079
they're both the same thing other than

146
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,399
one is a perspective that it's okay

147
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,199
because it's legal and you have

148
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,560
permission from a special group of

149
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,919
self-interest people agenda versus the

150
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,519
other people who are just like I'm just

151
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:54,318
doing this because I know it's not

152
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:56,198
morally or ethically wrong and I'm going

153
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,319
to that's right I'm going to enjoy this

154
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:03,038
so and it's unfortunate that the police

155
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,000
harass that type as well when it should

156
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,120
be just uh you know oh look at those

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,519
bong ripping punks well how about it's

158
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,959
look at those young

159
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:16,639
guys burning over there I wonder what's

160
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:19,799
going on I wonder if I could have a to

161
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:24,280
where over there no no that's I'm

162
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:27,280
joking he [ __ ] always get me mad [ __ ]

163
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,638
where what where over there that's

164
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,359
that's right just around the bushes

165
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,280
there just over by by North Vancouver

166
