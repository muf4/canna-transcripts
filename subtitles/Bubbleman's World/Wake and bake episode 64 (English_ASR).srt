little yeah it was one of these guys it

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,870

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,100
didn't really have a question I kind of

18
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:45,869
had a question but now it's gonna be

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,059
real hard because the picture is not

20
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:50,070

21
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,619

23
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,769

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,520
question on the front page of my picture

25
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,960
okay

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,489
I was holding up that little thing and

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,859
there's the nature in the back there was

28
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:08,280
there was something behind me on the

29
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:12,569
ground it was yellow and if you can tell

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,239

38
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:38,519

39
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,078
two I almost should have given a little

40
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,769
bit of a tip someone should have done a

41
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,769

have a great conversation didn't we have

69
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:03,650
a great conversation yesterday you know

70
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:05,120
yesterday I got into a lot of the

71
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,799
discussion about bubble hash and it

72
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,200
really helped me because right now Tony

73
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,480
and I are designing my new website which

74
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,189
is bubble man brand calm if you go there

75
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,629
now it's just a password page but

76
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:17,810
eventually it's gonna go live it's gonna

77
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:20,239
have beautiful photos you know education

78
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,509
from the macro of the seed all the way

79
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,370
through to the resin of the plant

80
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:27,348
you know Tony and bubble man style where

81
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,289
we're gonna go hard on it and really put

82
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:32,418
major major information into this so I

83
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:35,298
started writing a blog yesterday in

84
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:38,079
regards to bubble hash and how Tony just

85
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:40,280
said hey how would you write a blog on

86
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:42,159
teaching someone how to make water hash

87
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,750
it's pretty complex I'm not gonna lie

88
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,049
because there's so many different sizes

89
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,939
of kits there's fresh frozen there's

90
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:52,010
properly dried and cured material

91
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,229
there's threshing ratios that we spoke

92
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:55,060
about the other day and how

93
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:56,649
felt it is to learn about those ratios

94
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,110
and how you really need to learn the

95
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:03,219
state make mistakes to learn key things

96
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:04,900
about those ratios ice water to versus

97
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:06,370
whether it's trim or bud those are going

98
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,189
to wash differently

99
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,930
temperatures environments outside of the

100
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:12,759
bags as well if it's too warm when you

101
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,580
pull the resin out this is going to make

102
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:17,560
it very hard to not remove too much

103
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,540
moisture so that the high quality resin

104
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,000
self presses in the pressing screen etc

105
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,100
etc I went through all of this stuff in

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,990
the blog and I'm pretty stoked it's

107
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,439
really being able to talk to you guys

108
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,300
has helped me write an even better blog

109
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,579
so that'll be all up there for you guys

110
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,460
Tony's gonna go through my words and

111
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:38,740
photograph in the lab that process that

112
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:41,379
I've explained so you'll have a really

113
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,168
high-quality photo essay with deeply

114
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:46,719
deeply informative words and that's

115
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:49,569
gonna be a bubble bubble man brand.com

116

all right so we're gonna grab this

138
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:44,000
little unit Dubai oh I say yes I've got

139
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:46,399
a double here a little double probably

140
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,629
can't see but there is my double right

141
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,669
there boom and a boom yeah those will be

142
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:54,290
bubble man branded absolutely John but

143
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,640
the we're gonna hold off I think that

144
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,710
was a little ahead of its time I need to

145
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,979
have the infrastructure set up so that I

146
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:03,319
don't have to basically rely on other

147
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,180
people for the infrastructure which

148
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,069
won't really be a bubble man branded

149
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,530
thing it would just be like a leased out

150
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:11,139
to other people so once we have the

151
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:19,479
infrastructure we're gonna get it done

152
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:19,479
all right 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 here we go 1 &amp; 2

be wanting to hear that information to

165
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:36,060
be able to sit through it otherwise I

166
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,259
suspect it could be like a Phish show

167
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:42,790
walking in half way through the middle

168
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:45,099
of an intense tweezer reprise to the

169
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,569
hardcores they're going to enjoy it to

170
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:53,230
other people they're gonna be a little

171
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:57,819
thrown off by it so hey I love fish

172
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:59,379
do you love fish sticks well little

173
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:00,879
self-park drop there now let's take a

174
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,800
couple days to watch it soak up church

175
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,149
Church is heavy duty I mean it's a

176
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,250
serious thing you know that the

177
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:07,989
conversation that sometimes gets created

178
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,060
through the dialog of the information of

179
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:13,030
the massive amounts of years that it's

180
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:16,660
taken for the panelists to compile that

181
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:18,699
information skunkman Sam alone skunkman

182
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,040
Sam alone is worth having hashed Church

183
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:23,639
on Todd McCormick alone is worth having

184
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:28,439
hashed church on you know Tony vers Ora

185
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,439
all of these guys Marsh aldohn Oh

186
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:36,370
chillin like a villain you went there

187
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,560
can't believe it so yes I am going to

188
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,990
definitely be

189
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,818
writing a dry sipped blog as well where

190
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:46,019
I break down as much information about

191
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:48,028
glandular trichomes heads and isolating

192
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:51,448
them without water but Mack mechanical

193
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:53,129
screen separation and I'm excited to get

194
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,838
those up in the very near future I can't

195
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:57,089
believe it's taking this long to have

196
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,779
really great versions of those things up

197
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:02,449
and running it's it's unfortunate but

198
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,620
here it comes

199
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:05,938
what happened to Horatio I'm not sure

200
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,230
Horatio and I just kind of went our

201
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:09,929
different ways

202
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:14,999
we were just getting along less and less

203
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:16,859
I guess you would say not like you know

204
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:20,550
in a negative way but just more like our

205
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,318
egos were colliding and we would talk

206
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:24,479
and we would get into arguments and

207
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:26,159
finally on our last argument it was just

208
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,829
like hey you know what this is silly why

209
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,240
don't we just you be you I'll be me I

210
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:31,979
have nothing against Horatio I think

211
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,959
he's brilliant I love what he did I love

212
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,600
to have him on hash Church I just could

213
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,638
no longer deal my ego you know I'm just

214
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,949
as responsible could no longer deal with

215
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,220
his ego our egos were no longer able to

216
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:46,109
interact as we grew together so I wish

217
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,259
him the best of course I would never

218
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,480
want him to be down and out I want him

219
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:53,300
to have all the successes that he wants

220
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,329
to manifest for himself and his family

221
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:58,349
but it ran out for us and so maybe that

222
00:09:57,328 --> 00:10:01,349
is my own

223
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,569
maybe it's more my fault than his I

224
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,329
don't know maybe my ego was the bigger

225
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:09,299
problem I don't know I have a biased

226
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:14,659
perspective because my ego is the

227
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:17,789
perspective I look through so either way

228
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:20,039
there'll be more Horatio's in the future

229
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:21,928
what I look forward to hash Church and

230
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,730
Todd is also sharing the same vision is

231
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:26,308
that we try to bring as many amazing

232
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,199
panelists I mean the more people we

233
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:30,870
bring on the more likely we are to find

234
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:33,448
the forests I don't know if you guys

235
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,610
remember Samantha LV you know the Wendy

236
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:37,528
Turner's you know all of these great

237
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,688
people that have come on over the years

238
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:42,539
the Jessica Hawkins remember Jessica

239
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:44,698
talking about her daughter niya how

240
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:47,088
heart-wrenching that was how we were all

241
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:49,750
tearing up my goodness

242
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:52,810
very very very

243
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:54,730
intense stories I'm I for one find that

244
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:57,878
hash Church is bigger than any of the

245
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,220
panelists anymore and it's it's now its

246
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,289
own entity that is a responsibility to

247
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,240
feed each Sunday to make sure that hey

248
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:07,509
let's get some people put in there you

249
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,039
know it was great to have Tim Blake on

250
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:11,980
last week it would have been nice to see

251
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:14,139
Alec or from SC Labs those guys are

252
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,209
always hard to nail down I talked to

253
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:18,278
Brad from guild extracts he said he had

254
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,899
an interest in coming on I even spoke

255
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:22,750
with the jungle boys briefly and they

256
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:25,028
said they might if they had time come on

257
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:28,230
and do a little do a little hash search

258
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:31,000
as well so we got some good

259
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,159
possibilities yeah the real Rick Ross

260
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,769
exactly you know how we roll on hash

261
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:39,610
Church we're not gonna bring the the

262
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:41,528
faux Rick Ross on Todd right

263
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:45,970
always with the amazing guests I miss

264
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:48,909
having Kenny from trichome heavy hunts

265
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:53,139
not Trek I'm heavy from geez how am i

266
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:54,610
spacing on K that's crazy that is crazy

267
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:57,220
that I'm spacing on trichome

268
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,839
technology's trichome technologies I

269
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,509
almost called it trichome heavy extracts

270
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,519
which was jibs and Ken's company but yes

271
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:05,409
trichome technologies which is crazy

272
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,679
because that company is like 25 plus

273
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:11,620
years old and so I used to have posters

274
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:12,698
of them on my wall behind me but I don't

275
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,938
know what happened to them I must have

276
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:17,528
given them away how much do you consume

277
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:19,448
these days do you produce yourself well

278
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:22,208
I do produce myself in certain countries

279
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:23,828
not in every country Canada I have a

280
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,198
license to produce so I can produce

281
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:27,609
right now I don't have any plants per se

282
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:31,179
in the ground but I'm getting extremely

283
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:33,339
close now as I'm going to put my refre

284
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:35,888
man Otto flowers let me grab those

285
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:37,120
actually just because we're talking

286
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,860
about him and it sucks to talk about

287
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,379
things when you can't show the things

288
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:46,778
that you're talking about so we have

289
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:47,949
here a little bit of motion there all

290
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:50,889
right so we've got these four Otto

291
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:54,120
flowers from reefer man he sent me these

292
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:57,188
as a nice little gift

293
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,198
nice-looking seeds I have you know with

294
00:12:57,188 --> 00:13:01,299
refre man I'll say this he kind of

295
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:03,949
reminds me of breeder Stephen

296
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:06,169
very much a character very unique

297
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:09,290
individual but always has the flame

298
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:12,259
always has the super rare exotic like

299
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:15,349
low yielding super rare terpene

300
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:17,360
expressing cultivar and to me that is

301
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,180
kind of what a breeder is all about

302
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,159
chimeras the same way he shows up he's

303
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:24,229
got the lime and the pine he's got this

304
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,669
unique terpene profile that I haven't

305
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,700
hit in a long time that took me straight

306
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:30,559
up and just left me completely focused

307
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,140
while I was there thanks to those

308
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,269
particular terpenes when we see the

309
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:38,269
value in producing cultivars that

310
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:41,360
contain all hundred and forty plus

311
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:43,789
terpenes instead of the twelve that we

312
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,250
seem to recreate over and over again and

313
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:50,240
we understand the limitless endless

314
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:53,120
possibilities of profile mixes that can

315
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,600
occur which should and will end up

316
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,480
creating medicinal and recreational

317
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,180
effects unique and different so we

318
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,220
really kind of shot ourselves in the

319
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:06,589
foot when we fell for the prohibition

320
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,649
based how much can I get and how fast

321
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:12,649
can I get it I always appreciated the

322
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:16,250
longer flowering cultivars even in the

323
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:21,529
90s in the mid early 90s I can remember

324
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:25,490
growing cultivars that took 16 to 18 to

325
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:27,199
20 weeks to bloom so you know you would

326
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:32,470
also want to veg that plant for a little

327

328
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,110

333
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:46,789
have a booth I haven't talked to Patrick

334
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,130
I haven't bought a ticket I'm not very

335
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:50,809
organized in that sense I do you know

336
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:53,299
what I mean if I could just roll up and

337
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:56,929
be like hey what's up pay at the door

338
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:59,569
maybe I'll do that but we'll see I'm not

339
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:01,099
sure about exactly the dates on that and

340
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,360
whether or not I'll be in the country or

341
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,740
not so I've got a little bit of

342
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,860
traveling coming up here in the near

343
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:09,110
future

344
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,789
out what do you call them sasquatch Pat

345
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,899
you're holding in today's post I call

346
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:13,849
them dab mass

347
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:15,829
you know there's a bunch of different

348
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,450
ones I have a mothership one here as

349
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,340
well

350
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:22,960
little mothership dad Matt this one

351
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:25,370
silicon comes from an oil slick folks

352
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,290
so yeah I'm mostly looking forward to

353
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,450
this haze they're all autoflowering

354
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:32,529
which should be interesting but this

355
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:35,270
haze and this lemon tie from reefer man

356
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:37,519
he has suggested that both of these are

357
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:40,789
going to be right up my alley

358
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,279
and I wouldn't be surprised if he's

359
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:44,599
right so probably put these in the

360
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,159
ground in the very near future it really

361
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,040
depends on how much traveling I have to

362
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:51,799
do if I can take care of them if I can

363
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,779
get them all sorted out and per when I

364
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:55,339
go on some cool show or roundtable to

365
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:58,399
respect you and your contributors yeah

366
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:02,680
of course I would Louis Garcia it's just

367
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:07,189
a matter of if I have time to do it

368
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:10,549
yeah lemon ties so sweet autos don't

369
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:12,800
they have more CBD I'm not sure if

370
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:14,750
that's the case with reefer man's autos

371
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,539
I don't know how he's been you know

372
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,700
producing these what his selections have

373
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:22,549
been what his work has been whatsoever

374
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,370
really but I have a feeling that I will

375
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:27,159
go and see him in the near future if I'm

376
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,389
able to once I get these into the ground

377
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:31,009
so it was a big responsibility when

378
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:33,220
someone sends you seeds that you make

379
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:35,569
sure you plant them it's kind of like

380
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,740
bubble bags if you've got them don't put

381
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,170
them under your bed make sure there's

382
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,299
trim or bud or some sort of cannabis

383
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:43,309
product going into them for that matter

384
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,620
non cannabis product you can use any

385
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:47,719
plant that secretes essential oils and

386
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,000
glandular trichomes can be used for

387
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,570
water extraction so many things from the

388
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,710
mint family as well as urban mate' or

389
00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:01,730
Besant a and even roses I've extracted

390
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:05,420
resin from so it's pretty cool it's a

391
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:07,610
pretty cool thing autos have come along

392
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,589
pretty good just like LED lights how do

393
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,599
I get invited to legends legends is

394
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:12,708
pretty easy to get invited to you just

395
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,169
have great hash

396
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,029
so usually Legends is around a cannabis

397
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,860
event where people are coming to I'll

398
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:19,889
usually have a booth there and usually

399
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:22,559
it would come up to that

400
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,540
and be like oh man this is my hash I

401
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,759
would like to come to Legends I would

402
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:29,220
look at it maybe puffs a bowl of it and

403
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:31,710
it would be very easy for me to decide

404
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,519
right then and there whether or not you

405
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:37,289
were going to be getting the ability to

406
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,609
purchase a ticket because that's really

407
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,349
what that is that doesn't get you a

408
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:42,659
ticket it just gives you the ability to

409
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:45,599
purchase a ticket now that way that with

410
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:50,180
the ticket purchase we are able to rent

411
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:52,619
venues get caterers have service and

412
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:56,460
give everyone a nice t-shirt that says

413
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:58,739
legends of hash I do not have any tips

414
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:02,670

00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:52,329
if we had an event where just passed

490
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,100
part mockers went and we're like yeah

491
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:55,869
but an event also where you didn't have

492
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:57,490
to rent a booth he didn't promote your

493
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:58,959
company you didn't bring flyers or

494
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,980
business cards and in fact we didn't

495
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,809
even talk business

496
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,819
we just milked the fact that we loved

497
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:06,279
hash and we were all kind of good Chara

498
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:08,079
see people and so that was the birth of

499
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:11,410
the legends of hash and that turned more

500
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:13,599
into let's keep cameras out because some

501
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,310
people that are coming may have done

502
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:19,869
illegal things in the world of hashish

503
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:23,259
in the past they're also true Chara see

504
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:25,809
people and so charas is hand-rubbed

505
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:29,950
can't cannabinoids

506
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:31,389
it's hashish from India or Nepal I'm

507
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,819
sure other countries do it as well but

508
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:37,330
that's where it was most famous from the

509
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:38,769
charas so hashish that is what the

510
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:40,509
legends of Haris party was about we

511
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:42,940
wanted to make it not about people

512
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:45,430
coming and self promoting themselves and

513
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,410
more importantly about trying to capture

514
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,960
parts of it and share it on their social

515
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,550
media afterwards so we made that's why

516
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,319
most of you won't know what legends of

517
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:55,240
hashes other than if you heard about it

518
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:57,009
through like an Instagram post of say

519
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,809
one of those tickets because that's

520
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:01,059
about the only picture you'll ever see

521
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:04,000
at a legends of hash party we don't

522
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:05,710
really do the the cameras and that was

523
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,430
for a specific reason but it really

524
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:11,440
created a very special event

525
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:13,960
particularly during big large events

526
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,860
like spannabis or High Times or whatever

527
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,900
which are so you know massively marketed

528
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:23,169
and sponsored and it's very much about

529
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:26,860
companies and money and products and and

530
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:28,990
that's not a bad thing but this event

531
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:30,909
was one day for all of us when we were

532
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,680
together those special people that were

533
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,690
lived their lives in this and were

534
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,960
working for a living in the cannabis

535
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:40,390
industry where we could step back and we

536
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,240
could have a little bit of a night just

537
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:45,720
to smoke charas to eat good food to

538
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:51,970
drink good drink to eat good fruit and

539
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:53,490
of course to smoke great hash and so it

540
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,470
was kind of funny we just thought

541
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,140
at first they thought I wouldn't be able

542
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,759
to sell 50 tickets you know and I was

543
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,559
like oh I think I'll be able to sell 50

544
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,240
tickets and it was pretty close you know

545
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:04,918
towards the end there I had like five

546
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,370
left and finally I sold them all on the

547
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:11,220
last day but it became a thing within a

548
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:13,439
couple of years that that everyone

549
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,450
wanted to get a ticket too which was of

550
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,269
course hilarious right when you try not

551
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:20,009
to make it any big deal you just pull

552
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:22,619
the people that you feel are the most

553
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:25,079
hardcore hash smokers out of the group

554
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:26,908
to have a night of enjoying hash smoke

555
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:29,158
you know like it's been illegal for so

556
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:31,080
long that people feel they have to feel

557
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,390
bad about enjoying hashish well guess

558
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,908
what I smoked hashish all night at the

559
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:39,330
legends of hash parties I go home safely

560
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:42,240
in a cab or on a bicycle and I end up

561
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:45,689
waking up the next morning early around

562
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,240
7 or 8 a.m. and I'm ready to go a quick

563
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,169
shower brush my teeth a little a little

564
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,120
breakfast and out the door feeling good

565
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:56,909
it's like you can't really get that if

566
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,069
you abused like say alcohol for a night

567
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:01,100
like that the way and I wouldn't say we

568
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:03,980
abuse it we really like it's almost

569
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:08,908
spiritual it's like a therapeutic

570
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:12,538
spiritual night of hashish do I do those

571
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:18,450
yearly I tried to coup I try to it's not

572
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:21,058
easy to do them but I try to yeah I do

573
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:23,460
indeed try to we were supposed to do one

574
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:27,710
in Barcelona this year and it was going

575
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:30,028
to be great if I had my place here in

576
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,579
Vancouver I would absolutely I when I

577
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:34,500
had my gallery the melting point I would

578
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:36,480
have a legends of hashish every year I

579
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,038
threw three in a row in Vancouver and

580
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,659
it's been a while since I threw one in

581
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:43,349
Vancouver over a decade in fact so

582
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:46,289
that's crazy

583
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:48,839
I think it would be a fun one I'm kind

584
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:51,179
of thinking hello Amelia I'm thinking

585
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:55,259
maybe Jamaica would be a fun legends if

586
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:57,990
I could get a hundred people to come to

587
00:25:55,259 --> 00:26:00,058
a legends in Jamaica and maybe even just

588
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:04,200
make it a like a legends weekend almost

589
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:06,089
where you know people come it's the the

590
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,140
logistics are tricky because people

591
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:09,329
really need to have the

592
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,509
sheesh so ideally people would come to

593
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:14,009
Jamaica they would go find material that

594
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:16,019
they felt was the best that they could

595
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:18,960
find they would potentially concentrate

596
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:20,819
or extract it with whatever process they

597
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,819
had because trust me a lot of it is

598
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:26,250
there in Jamaica now it would be fun to

599
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:27,149
come back and meet each other all for a

600
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,589
celebration

601
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:30,390
you know for me it's not about a

602
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:32,339
competition it never really was you know

603
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,750
the the the simple competition is is

604
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:35,759
that you put everything out on a table

605
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,890
and this is how I did it in Vancouver I

606
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,869
put everything out on small plates on a

607
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:42,690
table small amounts of each unique

608
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:46,379
cultivar and you know the one that was

609
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:49,320
gone first was the one that silently won

610
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,630
the one that was given the respects was

611
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,309
oh who brought that one you know in

612
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,840
Vancouver I brought them all so if there

613
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:57,389
were twelve or fifteen different kinds

614
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:59,639
of melt on the table I had put them all

615
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,410
there from saving them over the course

616
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,500
of the last year I'll put like five or

617
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:06,960
six grams of each nice melted part aside

618
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,000
until I have 12 or 15 different ones and

619
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,519
then I would do a big buffet exactly

620
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,410
like what Rob just said I had a nice

621
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,440
picture of Shiva in the background and

622
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:18,330
all these beautiful ornate bowls and I

623
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,190
gave everyone paper plates where they

624
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:21,689
could write then the names of all the

625
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,580
cultivars down and then take a little

626
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,620
scoop out of the bowl and put it next to

627
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:27,659
the name on the plate and you can go

628
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:29,819
back to your table which was inside my

629
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,830
gallery the melting point and there were

630
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:34,169
beautiful rulers and glass on all the

631
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:36,899
tables brand-new stainless steel screens

632
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:39,029
and wicks and anything you needed to

633
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,759
vaporize we had half a dozen different

634
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:45,869
vaporizers from the aeromed from Germany

635
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:50,129
to the volcano to volatize er to the rip

636
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:54,479
tech it was quite lavish I'm not gonna

637
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:58,560
lie it was quite lavish that is the

638
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:01,650
truth so yeah I guess I can't I think

639
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,509
