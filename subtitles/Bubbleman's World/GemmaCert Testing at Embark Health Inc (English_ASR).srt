00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:25,500
I'm here with Dan we're over here at

4
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:29,278
Embark and we're going to be using the

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,660
gamma cert today we had some uh listen I

6
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,460
should say right away we're just playing

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,500
with this thing we don't need all the

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,420
comments of people saying it's a scam it

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,219
doesn't work it's not this we're going

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,939
to be testing black cherry punch today

11
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,260
we do have an hplc COA for this flower

12
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:45,479
that we're going to be testing it

13
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,640
against and we're just checking it out

14
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,699
we're just having fun we just want to

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,859
see what kind of numbers we get so we're

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,960
going to jump in here we're gonna log

17
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,640
into the to the

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,280
to the page are you going to use your

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,500
fingerprint yeah because it has your uh

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,840
all your logins perfect so there we go

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,280
we're going to log in I need inbox

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,500
internet and we're gonna get the

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,540
password going here soon all right just

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,099
giving the unit a little wipe down here

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,200
as it

26
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,298
um what's it doing right now it's right

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,560
now it's just warming up so the unit's

28
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,240
got to warm up to temperature before

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,799
it'll actually let me calibrate it right

30
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,179
then it calibrates then enter the

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,159
calibrate and then we can start playing

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,380
with the putting this stuff into it and

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,880
then we'll check out what kind of uh

34
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,438
what kind of action we have with the

35
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,658
black cherry punch it looks like really

36
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,599
nice bud and it smells great we've been

37
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,759
making really beautiful bubble from it

38
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,140
so I suspect it's all going to go quite

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,159
nice

40
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,159
we'll see what happens

41
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:44,839
we'll see what happens

42
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,239
all right so the unit's warming up and

43
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,239
getting soon to be calibrated and now

44
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,759
Dan has just placed the flower on the

45
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,158
little pin and it will show you what

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,239
this does in a second

47
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,880
it heads on to here this is using light

48
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,319
and a reflective surface and it's

49
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,818
basically

50
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,439
um I mean how would you explain it Dan

51
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,899
it's basically it's using the reflection

52
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,818
of light off the trichome to measure how

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,560
many how much you're like cannibal

54
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:19,619
content is and then goes to a database

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,140
to test against already tested hplc

56
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,480
numbers yes and so it's not like going

57
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,759
to be exactly accurate but I have heard

58
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,439
some people I think when it's not

59
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,120
accurate there are so many ways if you

60
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,919
bump the table if there's vibration in

61
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,439
the room if there's too much anything

62
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,659
the door opens yeah there's an air that

63
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,039
air moves you can you can it can affect

64
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:39,419
your results and so I see a lot of

65
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,359
people saying these things don't work

66
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:44,939
they're a scam I prefer to get my own

67
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,560
first-hand information I've talked to

68
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,959
the people at Gamma cert they're really

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,939
cool they've explained it to us I'd

70
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,098
rather Dan and I go through use this

71
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,159
thing test 20 or 30 batches test it

72
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:58,280
against hplc this material has been

73
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,139
tested against hplc I believe it was

74
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,300
21.2 percent

75
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:05,579
THC when it came back from the hplc test

76
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,439
and so we'll see what we'll get we're

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,019
going to test the bud and then we're

78
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,658
going to do a ground test and test it as

79
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,599
powder and we'll see uh we'll see how we

80
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:17,639
go we're almost done warming up here so

81
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,439
we've changed over to calibration now so

82
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,419
we're just calibrating

83
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,639
being very careful when you're using

84
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:25,919
this I would say some of the most

85
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,139
important factors of using this unit is

86
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,238
to not bump the table it's not to open

87
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,059
the door it's not to have blaring music

88
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,700
going it's to really make sure

89
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,098
that in no way shape or form do you bump

90
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:41,399
or bang this unit while it's calibrating

91
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:43,079
or while it's testing and that generally

92
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,239
can cause a lot of problems and I think

93
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,400
it's probably the number one factor in

94
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,019
Wi-Fi where there's so many people on

95
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,480
our last post that we're saying these

96
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,819
don't work they're not effective you

97
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,979
have to have extremely good Sops and

98
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:58,018
Hyper awareness

99
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,579
of not

100
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,739
um banging the unit I don't think it's

101
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,480
conducive to take this units to events

102
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,158
and have a table with people standing in

103
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,199
front of your table and testing with it

104
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,539
I think it's much better to have in the

105
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,158
lab we're not using it in any way shape

106
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,840
or form is the word of God but if we can

107
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,359
get this thing going and calibrated

108
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,519
properly where we can test our hash and

109
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,639
some of our flour without having to send

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,379
it off right away and have an idea of

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,120
where that sits it doesn't have to be

112
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,500
the word of God for us we're certainly

113
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,560
testing everything in our facility

114
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,540
through hplc at third party Labs that do

115
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,759
all of our testing for us but I think

116
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,620
it's a cool technology I'm glad there's

117
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,680
companies like gamma sir trying to put

118
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,199
this technology out and if it's not for

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,060
you no problem don't buy one don't use

120
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,520
it if it is something that you think

121
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,079
might fit into your lab space while

122
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,539
we're doing these videos for educational

123
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,579
purposes to let people know you know how

124
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,100
we found that it worked so that's what

125
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:55,319
this video is for today okay so we're

126
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,479
going to the next part of this on the

127
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,860
unit here it'll basically give you your

128
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:00,959
run through of what to do so it's

129
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,460
telling us to lift the drawer up and

130
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,779
then hit okay so what we're going to do

131
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,060
is we're going to lift this drawer nice

132
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:07,859
and light and nice to be gentle this

133
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,019
machine is

134
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,060
it's a scientific machine so gentle and

135
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:13,978
everything and says hit Okay so we're

136
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,360
going to hit OK

137
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:18,740
now what it's going to do is it's going

138
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,740
to calibrate with the drawer open

139
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,478
so we'll take a couple more seconds do

140
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,478
its calibration here

141
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,400
and then once that's done it's going to

142
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,160
tell me to put the bud in the drawer

143
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,439
and close it down beautiful there it is

144
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,240
so there we are we're calibrated so now

145
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,699
we're going to touch analyze please

146
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,220
insert flower sample so now that I have

147
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:46,080
this on this on the pin already what I'm

148
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,880
going to do is I'm going to look for the

149
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,099
frostier side that doesn't have a whole

150
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,659
bunch of leaf and doesn't have any stem

151
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,400
sticking out so I'm going to choose this

152
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,139
side here and this stuff's pretty Frosty

153
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,079
and pretty well trimmed and it goes

154
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,538
upside down into this machine so

155
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,500
little magnetic eye

156
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:03,500
that's pretty cool

157
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,600
so there's a yellow dot on the side of

158
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,639
this machine

159
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,620
yeah this yellow dot is supposed to be

160
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,180
lined up Center on our Bud that we're

161
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,918
wanting to test yeah I don't think we

162
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,660
want to be moving this unit at all so

163
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,799
what we're going to want to do is we're

164
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,800
going to want to drop this down

165
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,120
just a littlest bit

166
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,538
and that'll get it into that halfway

167
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,800
point and then rotate it I was going to

168
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:34,019
say it looked like it turned around on

169
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,240
you there we go we have

170
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:39,599
okay

171
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,360
now anything that's Fallen debris wise

172
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,879
can brush out you got your brush

173
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,160
pull that debris out of there

174
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,899
and off the machine

175
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,240
I feel beautiful

176
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:52,739
and from there what they want us to do

177
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,939
is we're going to touch this picture

178
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,319
here

179
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:57,660
and you're going to take a picture and

180
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,560
that goes into the final

181
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,319
um

182
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,259
results the scan results everything that

183
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,840
we get for our numbers will be attached

184
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,000
in the account that we have with that

185
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,500
photo so it's a good frame of reference

186
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,720
to know what you're testing rather than

187
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,519
I often look at coas and there's no

188
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,500
picture of the flower or whatsoever I

189
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,418
think that's kind of this little white

190
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,098
spot you see my finger not coming close

191
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:21,959
to but pointing at that's your

192
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:23,879
calibration screen never touch that

193
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,698
don't try to clean it off don't try to

194
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,439
do anything with it leave it alone okay

195
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,259
so now we're going to drop this drawer

196
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,699
nice and slow and lightly and make sure

197
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,379
that we're not dropping it at the very

198
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,300
bottom because we're dropping it onto a

199
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,860
little robot that's going to be rolling

200
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,720
around the little spectrometer light

201
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,460
that's going to be doing that reading

202
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,900
for us totally so from there we're going

203
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,299
to hit percentage

204
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:47,159
analyze and it's going to hit the Allies

205
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,199
all right so this will go for about

206
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,699
three to four minutes

207
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,160
and we'll come back and we'll show you

208
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,740
what we got

209
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,780
all right so Marcus just stepped out of

210
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,160
the room so I'm gonna get this before it

211
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:01,198
shuts down

212
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,400
we got the unit saying it's done it's

213
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,160
actually seeing a little bit of lower

214
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,019
water activity on there so it's going to

215
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,680
measure that too what we're going to do

216
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,680
is we're gonna hit okay

217
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:15,418
we're gonna pull our drawer up ever so

218
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,360
slightly

219
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:20,639
nice and light once we get to this spot

220
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,319
here we can get our results we can't get

221
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,639
our results until this drawer has

222
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,560
actually been lifted

223
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,120
so what we're going to do from here

224
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,598
is we're going to tap onto the result

225
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,598
button

226
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,200
and there we go that's almost exactly

227
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,718
what it is I think it's like less than

228
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,800
one percent off it's point nine percent

229
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,379
off it was 21.2 percent the total THC

230
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,778
so I gotta say

231
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:47,519
this is some of our most accurate that

232
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:50,039
we've found so far

233
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,500
because we were doing it in a very loud

234
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,759
room people banging the table uh the

235
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,759
other day at the collector's cup we were

236
00:08:53,759 --> 00:09:01,319
getting numbers in the 13 14 15 16 and

237
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:04,740
17 range this compared to an hplc

238
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:08,580
I can show the COA for this it was 21.2

239
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:12,480
percent and what we got is 20.3 so it's

240
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,100
less than one percent off which I have

241
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,959
to say is pretty impressive I'm I'm

242
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,879
extremely impressed with that yeah and

243
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:21,778
we're testing against this COA from an

244
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:24,600
hplc so this is uh on a non-ground cloud

245
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:27,059
on a non-ground flower so we'll probably

246
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,320
do another test with this where we grind

247
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:32,159
the flour

248
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,200
but um yeah that's pretty darn cool from

249
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,939
here we're gonna take the same bud and

250
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,620
we're gonna do a ground test so we're

251
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,839
gonna go into mode

252
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,159
I already clicked on the ground so you

253
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,899
click your ground

254
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,159
and then you go back now we're going to

255
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,320
have to do is we're going to calibrate

256
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,360
the unit

257
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,740
for the ground piece so this is what

258
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,899
they would use you put all your ground

259
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,799
up bud into this little show them how to

260
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,240
open it

261
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,099
so you're gonna

262
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,259
spin it

263
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,659
nice glass wall in there

264
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:02,278
a little the white edges are always

265
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:05,278
going to be your zero for the

266
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,838
spectrometer and then we're gonna take

267
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,700
that

268
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,200
slide it into the machine nice thing

269
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,480
about this machine you don't gotta worry

270
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,980
it's magnetic just pulls it right in all

271
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,580
right I like that a lot and so then what

272
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,959
we're going to do is we're going to

273
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,879
slide this drawer down nice and light

274
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,179
again

275
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:22,259
and we're gonna can we put it right here

276
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:23,659
thank you that's even a little more

277
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,939
obviously

278
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:28,740
but that's okay all right perfect and

279
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,800
we're gonna hit calibrate

280
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,360
perfect so calibrate it up calibrate to

281
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,338
ground make sure it's saying ground

282
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,019
there is no ground in there right now

283
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,700
but it's got to calibrate down to that

284
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,500
first some white screens on there

285
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,120
perfect so it's already warm it's

286
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,940
already at 47 so it's gonna go directly

287
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,740
into calibrating okay perfect and then

288
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,240
we're gonna grind up some flour do you

289
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,919
want to grind up the exact same bud I'm

290
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,459
going to grind the exact same bud

291
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,458
beautiful

292
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:58,159
and then we'll take these Buds and go

293
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,159
throw them into the reactor

294
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,120
so I'm going to pull out as much of this

295
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,519
stem as I can while I'm doing this so

296
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,959
that we're not getting

297
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,959
stem reading off of it

298
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,019
more than enough right oh yeah

299
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,440
all right and perfect timing as we're

300
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:33,539
done the grind

301
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,100
it's done the calibration for the

302
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:38,179
downside so what we're going to do is

303
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,180
we're going to lift the drawer

304
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,120
I'm gonna hit OK

305
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,860
now it's going to calibrate drawer open

306
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,139
all right then we'll come back and throw

307
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,879
that ground flour and

308
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:52,980
all right so we're done calibrating it's

309
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,820
gone back to this normal mode we're

310
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,820
gonna take the unit out

311
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,860
and push down on these two black green

312
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,120
tabs downwards and then it'll rotate up

313
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,879
nicely

314
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,919
cover that little window

315
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,000
and now what we're gonna do

316
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,199
is you want to make sure you're putting

317
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,820
it on a soft surface you're not

318
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,339
scratching that glass on the outside

319
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,420
because that will affect your reading

320
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,620
and now we're going to do is we're going

321
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:19,379
to fill up

322
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,578
the glass any over spillage or anything

323
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:22,019
you're just going to push it back down

324
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:23,819
onto the glass anyway so you don't have

325
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:26,039
to be too crazy careful

326
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,660
but make sure you're getting

327
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,578
all those look at all that Christy

328
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:32,879
sitting on the bottom of that buster

329
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:34,919
yeah so you want to make sure too that

330
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,778
you're getting

331
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,159
all this kind of stuff mixed in

332
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:39,899
otherwise you're not going to get a

333
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,519
proper test

334
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,519
right you need a proper emulsion

335
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,179
from here what I would do

336
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,200
is I would take something

337
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,419
like a stem or something that's not

338
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,879
going to scratch your screen

339
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:01,919
and actually mix the butt up a little

340
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,539
bit

341
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,259
because you can tell how many crystals

342
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:06,259
are sitting on the top

343
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,659
and lightly pack it all down

344
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,120
put our brush out and we're going to get

345
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,240
our brush out to clean up and do a

346
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,240
little

347
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,639
perfect

348
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:28,439
I mean I like to take the back of the

349
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,240
brush

350
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,040
is kinda

351
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,039
make things a little even in here

352
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,240
and then you're going to take your

353
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,320
little screen your little white

354
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,320
make sure white down

355
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,339
and it will lock into place

356
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,879
what that's going to do

357
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,259
show you here it's going to press all of

358
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,259
it up against the side but you're not

359
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:57,659
going to only flour up against there

360
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:59,338
take this unit

361
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:01,860
again it's magnetic so it'll Place

362
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,839
itself into place

363
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,820
and then we go

364
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,339
analyze

365
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,600
please insert ground flour and take your

366
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,839
picture so we're going to take our

367
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,839
picture

368
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:22,578
okay we're going to insert our drawer

369
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,040
and we're going to hit the analyze

370
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,220
button

371
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,319
and we'll be back with the numbers

372
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,180
we got the results in but to get the

373
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,800
results you've got to lift the drawer

374
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:40,519
gotta lift the drawer so we're gonna

375
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,519
take the drawer up

376
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:46,319
foreign

377
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:48,899
looks

378
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,620
looks like ground weed right and now

379
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,620
we're gonna hit the result

380
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:57,959
look at that 20.3 every number is

381
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,060
exactly the same

382
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,338
from ground to the bud

383
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:04,739
so there we go that was an accurate uh

384
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:07,260
uh number today I gotta say I'm pretty

385
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,360
happy with those results we tested the

386
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:11,698
flower twice and what we did this time

387
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,919
is we were OCD we came to a room that no

388
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:15,539
one's in we removed the table from the

389
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,399
wall because there was vibration on the

390
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:19,740
wall it's on a concrete floor so there's

391
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,539
no motion we've eliminated the door

392
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,879
opening and blowing wind into the room

393
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:25,500
there's no music playing we're not

394
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:28,019
touching the table in any way shape or

395
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,720
form and for the first time I feel like

396
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:33,539
we're getting accurate numbers 100 so

397
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,759
there it is den and bubble man coming at
