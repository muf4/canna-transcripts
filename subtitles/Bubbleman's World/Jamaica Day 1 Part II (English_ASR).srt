1
00:00:02,178 --> 00:00:07,349
welcome to bubbleman's world everybody

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,400
we are in st. Catharines Jamaica and I

3
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:08,969
don't know if Joe and I could be any

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,888
happier

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,719
I'm eat fresh fruit you've got a

6
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:14,759
breadfruit right behind you you've got

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,910
mangoes I see tomatoes down there

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,010
it's the yard is covered in beautiful

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,160
fruit trees this is definitely a good

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,109
buy place and we're happy to have about

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,500
a pound of some beautiful Sun grown

12
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,868
Jamaican ganja that's Sun grown tropical

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,759
grown glandular trichomes heads for the

14
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:34,738
bubble man and John to isolate using our

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,840
water and ice extraction methods so

16
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:40,229
John's been helping me for the last year

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,969
so and he's a good assistant and then

18
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:43,648
even better friend so and I can tell you

19
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,010
right now I'd be puffing on this hers

20
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:51,058
and it is killer I got a great buzz from

21
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:53,159
it wait to get this resin in this we

22
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:54,959
brought the originals nice yeah

23
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,459
we brought the original bags most of you

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,549
out there know that we have three levels

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,170
of bags we got our lights our

26
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:03,750
inexpensive model to get the the new

27
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,519
beam on hash maker perhaps the guy

28
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,310
that's kind of lost his way and he's

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,140
gone towards this making oil with

30
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,210
chemical solvents the exposure is

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,618
negative the potential of blowing

32
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:15,719
yourself up and burning your skin off

33
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:18,269
your body is definitely there and this

34
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:20,099
is I top this is in Jamaica this is item

35
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,500
there's no chemicals there's this is

36
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,629
just water and ice so this is what we're

37
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,359
here to do today isolate some resin

38
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:30,959
glass I'm gonna put the bat the the bags

39
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,430
in the bucket and get this started I

40
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,359
still wish I could be joining you right

41
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,940
I know but it seems in the best

42
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:39,370
I haven't smoked cannabis for 13 years

43
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:41,170
because I smoked exclusively hash I only

44
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,850
smoked the active ingredients in the

45
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,290
plant and every once in a while like in

46
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:47,049
this particular situation where I have

47
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,370
no hash I'm feeling it a little bit are

48
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:49,659
you feeling a little bit oh you know

49
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:53,050
what I'm definitely feeling that you

50
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:54,909
very fancy dad smells great so we're

51
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,200
gonna start with the 25 micron bag we've

52
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:57,700
got a bunch of people here and behind

53
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,140
the camera they're gonna stay off camera

54
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,000
but I'm basically time kind of talking

55
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,219
to them while I'm talking to you guys

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,480
we're actually milk yeah we're educating

57
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:06,069
them and then we're also learning

58
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,200
ourselves because we're out of our

59
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:11,049
normal environment so we're in a high

60
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:13,959
humidity high heat warm water

61
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,880
environment the herb everything's

62
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:19,270
different of a couple months ago oh is

63
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,709
it yeah okay so a couple months ago John

64
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,030
and I were at Barcelona Spain and we

65
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:24,250
were making some hash there you guys

66
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,560
probably remember we met with Xavier for

67
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,780
medical seeds we met from dahveed from

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,240
Ripper seeds we went inside the guys at

69
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:38,650
hemp quarters and we made hash all over

70
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:40,060
the place I mean so I think we're gonna

71
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,519
break that record here in Jamaica

72
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,949
oh we're breaking records we've been

73
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,450
here for half half the day and we're

74
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:48,369
already running our first first batch

75
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:51,518
which I have to say I come quite often

76
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,310
and it's always you know you're not just

77
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,439
gonna land and just go make hash and

78
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,750
land and then you kind of go get like

79
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:59,240
you don't go eat some I tell food and

80
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,400
then you

81
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,070
and you look for buckets and everyone's

82
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,020
got a bucket but not so much available

83
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:07,400
for you to have so we took this a couple

84
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,350
hours to find the buckets and we got

85
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,240
those so that's great we're five hours

86
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:13,549
in and we're making out yeah exactly so

87
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,409
the herb was completely easy I've never

88
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,420
had that be easier I usually have to go

89
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:19,099
out and really sort of put my nose to

90
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:21,649
the ground I have a bit of an olfactory

91
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:24,409
that's very sensitive to cannabis and

92
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,110
terpenes and smells and so I'm able to

93
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:30,020
find extremely good cannabis wherever I

94
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,700
go using those tools at my disposal so

95
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,890
when I hear people say oh I went to

96
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:36,199
Jamaica and the herb was so terrible

97
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:38,089
what I say to those people is that's

98
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,429
just what you could find that was what

99
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,170
your personality brought to you you

100
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,090
didn't put the right vibe out there so

101
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:46,549
you didn't get the right herb you know I

102
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,870
don't know what to say try to find the

103
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,430
right vibes you'll find the right herb

104
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,659
in Jamaica it's about that simple when

105
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,790
the vibes here are amazing

106
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:55,520
yeah well I don't know how you'd find it

107
00:03:52,789 --> 00:04:01,340
all right here's a 45 micron bag for you

108
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,420
Johnny what we're doing here for

109
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,400
everyone watching because they

110
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:06,889
potentially never seen this procedure

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,289
before us we're stacking a sieve stack

112
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:11,929
this is like mining for gold this is

113
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:13,969
like if you think of these are screens

114
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,189
and they have holes in them and the

115
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:19,339
smallest screen the bottom the purple is

116
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:21,560
a 25 micron at a micron is a measurement

117
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:25,279
increment that is extremely small your

118
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,069
hair for instance is 7 microns in

119
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,709
diameter it's very very small smaller

120
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:34,339
than we can see with our eyes so we

121
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:37,159
start with a 25 and we go up with a 45

122
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:38,719
and each screen size from here on out is

123
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,370
going to get bigger and why that makes

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,400
sense is because the holes need to be

125
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,379
big and then small and then smaller and

126
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,419
then smaller and what that does is it

127
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:49,790
allows us once we've separated off the

128
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,040
material once we've mixed all the ganja

129
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,260
and the resin has broken free and sunk

130
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,810
in the water all we're going to do is

131
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:59,110
pull these bags one

132
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,899
i won and clean out the hash that's left

133
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,730
on the bottom of the screen there are

134
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:05,138
variables to pay attention to we want to

135
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,790
make sure our water is extremely cold

136
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,168
this would have been better if we even

137
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,669
left it in the freezer if you have a

138
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:11,379
freezer and it's sitting right there or

139
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:13,120
a fridge of course have it in there

140
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:14,469
right up until the moment that you put

141
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,340
everything in the buckets and you start

142
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:20,590
mixing that's going to be helpful when

143
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:21,819
you understand the process and I've sort

144
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:23,849
of given these guys a little bit of a

145
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:28,300
low-down on the glandular trichomes

146
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:30,610
glandular trichomes of course is is the

147
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,970
little part of the cannabis plant that

148
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:36,220
we all love it's why they sing songs

149
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,380
about it it's why we promote it it's

150
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,810
what it's why we wear ganja leaves it's

151
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:43,509
why we gather it's why people go to

152
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,910
Amsterdam people come to Jamaica I mean

153
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,589
really that is the reason this is an

154
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,860
incredible plant don't get me wrong the

155
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:53,019
industrial properties of hemp we know

156
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,879
have 50,000 commercial products from

157
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,889
anything from plastics to hempcrete to

158
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,310
have metals the amino acid rich

159
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,720
essential oil secreting seeds are second

160
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,639
to none they contain all eight essential

161
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,229
amino acids that our bodies need but

162
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,209
can't produce including the three for

163
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:09,879
children so this is basically a whole

164
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:11,889
food hemp is the perfect food they say

165
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,839
actually that it's second only to breast

166
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:15,519
milk I'm not sure about you but I'm done

167
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,969
with breast milk I'm sticking to hemp

168
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,228
seed oil hemp seed I love yeah you can't

169
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,750
get you know I mean they were good

170
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:24,579
enough for Buddha right how long did the

171
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,509
Buddha survive on hemp seeds one hemp

172
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:32,139
see today yeah for like a very very very

173
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:33,699
long time check out the story I'm not a

174
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,800
Buddhist but Buddha seemed like a pretty

175
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:38,079
cool guy I have to admit you read into

176
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,680
what he was all about and I mean it's

177
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,259
hard to kind of be anti Buddha

178
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,939
alright so 73 this is the gold bag and

179
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,740
this is just what you guys would think

180
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:50,949
what do you think about gold we love the

181
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,960
gold not the gold is in gold from the

182
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:55,029
ground but the Sun and the gold the red

183
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,000
gold and green the gold does not

184
00:06:55,029 --> 00:07:01,388
represent gold in the red gold and green

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,339
we all know that so this gold I made at

186
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,269
the 73 micron bag this is the year that

187
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,579
I was born in

188
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:09,039
1973 and when I first made these bags

189
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:10,870
the 73 bag was the favorite

190
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,080
it was the favorite it still is to

191
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:16,389
appoint the favorite but I got the black

192
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,039
bag and the black bag is superior in my

193
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:20,319
opinion in every way this is my favorite

194
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,210
bag this is the bag this is the resin

195
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,719
that I personally prefer almost out of

196
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:28,659
any strains aside from perhaps a

197
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,730
landrace sativa a tropical Sun growing

198
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,350
sativa that isn't gonna grow short and

199
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,870
stout but it's gonna grow very tall with

200
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:37,060
a very thin leaf as opposed to a broad

201
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,160
indica leaf and it's gonna produce heads

202
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,709
that produce a different cannabinoid

203
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,900
profile now what a cannabinoid profile

204
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:46,539
is for the gentleman all sitting here is

205
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:49,629
the cannabinoid profile is the profile

206
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,490
of everything we love about ganja inside

207
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:53,829
that glandular trichomes head that I was

208
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,829
showing you guys earlier on that

209
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:58,990
glandular trichomes head has terpenes

210
00:07:56,829 --> 00:08:01,419
which are smells terpenoids which are

211
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,370
taste so I mean obviously those are the

212
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,990
things we love those everyone loves

213
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,910
squeezing the herb and giving it a smell

214
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,790
I mean that's that's like the precursor

215
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:12,550
to smoking it to smoking and getting I

216
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,410
read is to smell your ganja you know

217
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,270
walking through the forest if you've

218
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,790
ever approached a big ganja field

219
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:22,209
getting hit with that the smell of that

220
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,200
is is a potentially spiritual event I'll

221
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:25,269
say that much about it

222
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,899
so let's get our black bag in there with

223
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:30,759
the yellow and we're gonna go from that

224
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't think think I'm gonna bend them

225
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,470
over the bucket John oh you shouldn't be

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,720
looking at some beauty I'm looking at

227
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:39,430
how beautiful these try cones look elect

228
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,080
mark was talking about with what the

229
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:43,659
sudden growing tropical sativas these

230
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,940
resin heads are so small but just so

231
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,069
amazing yeah once again look at that

232
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,930
plant so I definitely very different

233
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,339
here grown

234
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,139
different soil different environment

235
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,959
different humidity it's something that

236
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:58,309
I've never seen a pulse like this I'm

237
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,159
used to growing in because of course

238
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:02,899
indoors we live in that Canada but I

239
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,338
mean definitely when we take a look at

240
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:06,708
this resin you can tell the difference

241
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:09,470
between night and day by just looking at

242
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:12,229
a Bowie outdoor and indoor in Canada

243
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,570
growing here on the equator yeah this

244
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,149
that the two joints I just spoke to big

245
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,740
fatties I feel great unloaded dated

246
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:24,320
right in that pain I don't think any of

247
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:25,820
you guys have ever seen me do this but

248
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,800
you know the best part of both is is we

249
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,800
take a look at the minute little effects

250
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:39,259
and I pretty much experiencing so of

251
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:42,139
course we're gonna try and break all of

252
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:43,429
this off of the stuff how does that feel

253
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:44,778
we are gonna break it down it yeah

254
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:46,669
that's the course quick question in

255
00:09:44,778 --> 00:09:49,519
regards cuz I know you use indica that's

256
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:51,110
so we have indica and we have sativa and

257
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,299
of course Rob Clark the author of

258
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,149
marijuana botany as well as a wonderful

259
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:57,769
book called hashish one of my mentors

260
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:58,700
he's actually now talking about cannabis

261
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,919
Afghan ago

262
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,089
so you can look up that on Google if you

263
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:05,750
want to learn a little bit more about

264
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:09,310
that and yeah I guess we'll get we've

265
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:11,690
now put our 120 bag in and our 160 bag

266
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:14,569
and I'll explain to you why we're using

267
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,700
all these bags imagine that some of the

268
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,520
glandular trichomes heads are the best

269
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,879
and if we can separate them out and if

270
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,528
we can use these larger hold bags in the

271
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,919
beginning is often people say why do I

272
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:30,019
need all these bags can I do it with one

273
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:32,838
this particular bag in in particular

274
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:35,360
will filter out contamination things

275
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,130
that are still small they're gonna break

276
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,629
down a little smaller than they shut up

277
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:39,980
and they're still gonna sink whereas

278
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:41,929
everything else as long as it has a

279
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,209
surface area it'll float in the water

280
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:46,578
when things get too small they sink down

281
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:49,250
this is why I have this bag it's also

282
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:51,559
why I have this bag just to filter out

283
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:54,139
so generally these two bags will be a

284
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,289
medical quality although you know here

285
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:55,429
in

286
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:57,799
make it theirs they still actually

287
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:59,750
produce some some decent resin the real

288
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,990
magic will be in the orange the black

289
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:05,089
and the yellow and sometimes the white

290
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,759
and the purple can can really surprise

291
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:10,310
you so really these three bags are the

292
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,990
ones we're gonna pay attention to so

293
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:14,088
imagine we're gonna isolate all the

294
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,240
resin glands off the plants so taking a

295
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:19,279
pound we could be left with as little as

296
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,379
you know 20 grams of resin that's how

297
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,110
much active ingredient is on an actual

298
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:26,208
pound is cannabis when you extract those

299
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,860
20 grams we're going to get 20 grams

300
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,899
through all the different bags so if I

301
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,459
get a gram and a half here that's that's

302
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:33,019
no good I don't count that and if I get

303
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,578
another two grams here well I don't like

304
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:37,730
that either I don't count that either so

305
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:39,888
my 20 grams can shrink down incredibly

306
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,440
so once we explain this to the

307
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:44,419
prohibition based mentality of how much

308
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,769
can I get and how fast can I get it

309
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:48,469
which is where we've kind of been locked

310
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:50,209
with ganja for the last 40 to 50 years

311
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,240
at least the North America and Europe

312
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:55,129
parts of Asia it's a how much can I get

313
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,568
and how fast can I get it and we've seen

314
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:58,610
it happen here in Jamaica when I was

315
00:11:56,568 --> 00:11:59,990
coming here in the 90s it was nothing

316
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,610
for me to find the lam spread it was

317
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,009
nothing for me to find the landmass to

318
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,949
Tevas it was very easy for me to do and

319
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:09,078
nowadays it's a lot harder you really

320
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:10,469
have to you almost have to seek out an

321
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:12,299
elder you know

322
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,160
you need to go to like Bobo camp for

323
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:16,169
anion thingy camp and find an elder

324
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,269
who's had his strain and he's kept it he

325
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:20,879
still has it because of all the growers

326
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:22,829
I mean and it's not their fault that

327
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,320
they fell into this because everyone

328
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,540
falls into this they grow these short

329
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,390
little sticky stock plants they're still

330
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:32,699
very powerful and amazing they do grow a

331
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:34,649
wonderful grade of medicine but if you

332
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,100
can imagine when Babylon had their way

333
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:39,870
and decided we'd make cannabis illegal

334
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,570
part of their trip was to make it how

335
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,950
much can I get and how fast can I get it

336
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,140
thing and what they did is they turned

337
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,160
us the people that believed in this plan

338
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,539
the people that believe in the

339
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,129
righteousness and the spirituality of

340
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:53,519
this planet they turned us into

341
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:55,559
modern-day how much can I get how fast

342
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,299
can I get it and I can't tell you how

343
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:01,169
many people have this mentality in the

344
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:04,079
cannabis daily and the unfortunate part

345
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:07,099
is is that when you shrink down your

346
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,660
flowering period to six to eight weeks

347
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,060
as opposed to a sativa which could

348
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:14,279
easily flower for three months you know

349
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,869
20-plus weeks you could flower a sativa

350
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,360
so you understand the prohibition of

351
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,279
space mindset how much can I get and how

352
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,360
fast can I get it is gonna be like oh

353
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,220
man I don't want to wear that's a team

354
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,139
that takes me 22 weeks to grow that plan

355
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,420
from start to finish I can bang out

356
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,699
these indicas in seven to eight weeks

357
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:32,789
boom boom boom boom while you're doing

358
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,910
one crop I've pulled out three that's

359
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:37,949
great but what you're growing is resin

360
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:39,569
and in that resin is a profile and that

361
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,280
profile is gonna offer you a medicinal

362
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,200
benefit and if you can imagine the

363
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,720
prohibitionist as brilliant as they were

364
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,150
and they're evil they cut us out from

365
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,279
our land race genetics the land race

366
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:52,230
genetics if you can only understand that

367
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,929
this is the equivalent of the world

368
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,060
population and when we took those and we

369
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:58,829
got rid of them and we started getting

370
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:00,539
smaller and smaller and smaller it's

371
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,950
basically inbreeding it would be the

372
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,230
equivalent of going and having a kid

373
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,970
with your sister don't do it you won't

374
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,379
get good gene structure you won't

375
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,029
produce strong plants and you won't

376
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:14,200
produce a good medicine you need to

377
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:15,850
bring traits and fee knows in from the G

378
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,440
Poole and this is where landrace comes

379
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,389
in this is where these African sativas

380
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,450
and these in Indian plants where they've

381
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:25,090
been making hashish for 8,000 years

382
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,129
these guys have a serious ganja culture

383
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,899
I have been to India I can and I can

384
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:31,059
attest these guys they don't even smoke

385
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,799
on that if you were to smoke ganja they

386
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:35,799
would just be so confused by it because

387
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,259
they smoke only the hash that's off the

388
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:39,879
ganja now they still have archaic

389
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:41,289
methods in fact they have the most

390
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,480
archaic method because they have the

391
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:45,490
longest history with this plant in any

392
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,680
culture on our planet and what they do

393
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,779
is they hand rub the resin if you can

394
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,729
imagine here in Jamaica they do it to an

395
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:53,429
extent but it's a lot more I mean back

396
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,300
in the day I seen it off of

397
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:57,459
sledgehammers that they were hammering

398
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:59,139
into tires and it would the GaN Jet the

399
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,700
the gum that you could pull off that

400
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,350
sledgehammer was incredible of course

401
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,450
here in Jamaica they don't trim with

402
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,009
scissors scissors are hard to find most

403
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,110
Jamaicans will use a knife and their

404
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:09,429
thumb and they'll curl that leaf in and

405
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,230
they'll pinch it against their their

406
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:13,329
their thumb and it's actually quite

407
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,879
impressive is the first time I thought I

408
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,990
saw it I thought wow that's gonna take

409
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:18,519
so much time

410
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,049
personally John and I don't even trim

411
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,970
our plants if you can imagine we only

412
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:24,969
make hash of it we go into our grow room

413
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,710
we cut down fresh beautiful grown plants

414
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,660
and then we throw them in this bucket

415
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,220
and we mix it then we make water hatch

416
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:34,419
which is I guess what we're gonna do

417
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:39,519
right now excellent last two bags and

418
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:41,259
before we yes please do that I haven't

419
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:47,169
seen eyes it of course I brought a bunch

420
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:49,299
of dozen to get a gift

421
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:51,129
let alone a supercool ganja oriented

422
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:53,049
gift they can a keep the police from

423
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:54,429
from harassing you because the police

424
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:56,529
know it you know they're not the

425
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:58,719
smartest but they have noses and this is

426
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:01,439
the problem we love our stinky cannabis

427
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,120
and it makes it so easy for the police

428
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,590
to realize we have it right they smell

429
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,179
it on us and even when they don't smell

430
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,750
it on us they they lie and they say

431
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:09,750
there's no Ames

432
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:16,370
all right so get ready yeah we got the

433
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:19,410
220 in here but we could start doing is

434
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:22,259
I'm gonna pour this into here part of it

435
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:24,899
Chuck about half and then we'll break

436
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,759
the bud into the top of the ice and then

437
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,529
we'll pour more ice or water on top just

438
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:31,830
like we would do in a bubble bag so can

439
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:34,799
we put the ice on the bottom you should

440
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:37,280
not pick this up too I'm not going to so

441
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,279
what we're saying

442
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:58,469
so once again we're trying to keep it as

443
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,620
cold as possible on more ice to better

444
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,910
itself can you grab me that cooler in

445
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:08,609
the back of the car

446
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:17,189
yeah thanks just thinking out loud with

447
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:21,179
that yeah once once we make the hash

448
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:23,550
this is basically this process is pretty

449
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:26,068
darn simple to break your butt down not

450
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:26,938
too much to break your butt down in let

451
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:29,069
me go back a little bit

452
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,570
this process is counterintuitive even

453
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:33,059
every person here is gonna watch it

454
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:34,950
they'll have a certain understanding of

455
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:37,169
it but immediately they'll start

456
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,900
thinking of ways they can do it better

457
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,210
based on what they think is happening

458
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,340
and I just I did the same thing and

459
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,740
everyone's done the same thing and in

460
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:49,049
North America particularly in America

461
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,849
because Americans are just so gung-ho

462
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:52,289
and like let's do it babe let's do it

463
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:54,179
large let's go as strong as you can and

464
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:56,879
so I'm showing people how to mix with it

465
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,400
with a stick and the Americans are

466
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,680
getting like outboard motors from their

467
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,840
boat and literally like running it in

468
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,029
kiddie pools and unfortunately what that

469
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,740
does is it turns the canvas to mulch and

470
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:10,680
it doesn't really I mean when you see

471
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,779
that these are microscopic glands we

472
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,519
don't need a vortex mixer you don't need

473
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:17,160
like an extremely powerful drill today

474
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:19,049
we're gonna make this with a stick I'm

475
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,060
just gonna mix it with a stick I've got

476
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:23,819
machines that I sell that you can use

477
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,139
and it's easier even to use a cake mixer

478
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:27,599
I used to use a cake mixer here in

479
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,430
Jamaica all the time which was great

480
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,750
just a little handheld tool with the two

481
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:34,950
little prongs it would spin it around

482
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:38,579
quite nice your your stock also has a

483
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:41,160
use of course cannabis stocks can make

484
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:42,569
paper you can make hempcrete from this

485
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,220
stuff basically what we're sitting on

486
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:46,168
right here can be made out of hemp grown

487
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,639
on the back mountain no problem

488
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:49,980
it's actually quite simple I think it's

489
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:52,618
just a lot it's like yeah you mix lye

490
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,028
you mix water you mix hemp fibers I

491
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:56,278
think they take the stalks and they chop

492
00:18:54,028 --> 00:18:57,659
them up together so it's a whole process

493
00:18:56,278 --> 00:19:00,659
you can look into it if you don't know

494
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:03,929
about it it's definitely cool of course

495
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:07,909
cannabis stock is just biomass so of

496
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:07,909
course you can make concrete out of it

497
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:18,880
do this up Johnny love to get that gun

498
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:21,159
down my fingers so this is how I get the

499
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,550
extra medicated because of course it

500
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,690
goes through your skin because the oils

501
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:27,220
absolutely you know rub a little coconut

502
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,140
oil on your hands while you're doing

503
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,360
this or do it after you've got gum on

504
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,100
your hands and rub coconut oil on well

505
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,229
that's a transdermal effect that will

506
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:37,569
actually bring those cannabinoids into

507
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,019
your skin and of course your skin is an

508
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:39,639
organ

509
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:41,379
it's the largest organ in your body it's

510
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,500
called the epidermis and the epidermis

511
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:47,230
of course is where we find quite a few

512
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,329
cb2 receptors so a quick little science

513
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:52,120
breakdown so you know not to confuse

514
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:54,549
anyone but we discovered in the 80s and

515
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:56,139
the 90s cb1 receptors I'm sure you guys

516
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:59,409
heard about this this is when they says

517
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:01,600
they found receptors for THC in the

518
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,700
brain that we had receptors that bond

519
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,589
that that the cannabis would bond to

520
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,750
these receptors so these were called cb1

521
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:10,569
receptors and they were found in a high

522
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:13,359
concentration in the brain then about

523
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:17,439
eight years later I think it was 1992 or

524
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:20,500
signee 192 cb2 and was it the Spanish

525
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,779
woman who discovered this Cristina okay

526
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,730
so Cristina basically came up with cb2

527
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:27,609
receptors and these cb2 receptors are

528
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:29,950
located throughout the rest of the body

529
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:32,469
and organs and your lymphatic system and

530
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:35,950
so there's also receptors for

531
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:39,400
cannabinoids in in in those organs so

532
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:41,080
what that really means is is that this

533
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,410
system called the endocannabinoid system

534
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:45,789
that regulates all of our biological

535
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,740
function you know well not all but I'd

536
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:49,720
say 90% of it of an extremely high

537
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,609
amount you know eating and sleeping and

538
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,620
remembering and forgetting all these

539
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:56,289
things are are based on your

540
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:59,319
endocannabinoid system for instance pts

541
00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:01,420
tea you know postpartum stress disorder

542
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:02,919
people go to war they do things they

543
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,460
don't want to do they come back all that

544
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,170
stuff

545
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,700
they have messed up their

546
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,830
endocannabinoids system they can't

547
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,630
forget they can't forget what they did

548
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:10,990
maybe they shouldn't forget what they

549
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,480
did

550
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:17,589
either way cannabis is very helpful for

551
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:20,620
them to release that energy release that

552
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:22,569
tortured energy that they basically you

553
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:24,009
know some of them did it on their own

554
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:25,990
but a lot of those guys aren't bad

555
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:27,279
people they just got thrown into the

556
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,250
army and the next thing you know they're

557
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:32,049
in another country doing crazy things so

558
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,900
we know cannabis is extremely well for

559
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:37,809
that and that can be worked either

560
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:41,080
through smoking vaporizing transdermal

561
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:43,629
patches decarboxylation of the cannabis

562
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:45,789
and then eating it and we can discuss

563
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,720
all these things a little later on you

564
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:49,599
want to tell them a little bit about

565
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,759
decarboxylate enjoy decarboxylated so

566
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,259
it's basically activating the TT

567
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,420
molecules of the cannabinoids so the

568
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:57,789
bindery stuff is in your brain so well

569
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,460
smoke because they will not bind they

570
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:02,049
will not find if you just need the

571
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,090
answer I hate it if you can get that a

572
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:08,409
for confessed and if we eat bud we're

573
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:09,819
getting THC a we're getting CBD a we're

574
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,930
getting all these cannabinoids and th

575
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:15,369
C's in the A's the acid so when we

576
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:18,039
decarboxylate all it is simply is we

577
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:21,399
heat to a certain temperature 200 and

578
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:22,029
200 you long once again what's my

579
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,290
temperature

580
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:29,220
I go 320 degrees Fahrenheit just under

581
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:31,750
200 Celsius what you're going to do is

582
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,750
scientifically you're going to lose a

583
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,160
carboxylic acid ring on those molecules

584
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,099
and what that does is they turn all

585
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,500
those th CAS and CBD A's in the THC and

586
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:44,129
CBD and now when you consume those

587
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,130
products

588
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:55,470
or some heat generated when drawing us

589
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:58,159
let's make sure lose this I mean it is

590
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:03,739
only the 160 bag but let's just do this

591
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:07,919
so I can we're a little bit messy okay

592
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:09,869
this will just alleviate that problem of

593
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,669
us losing any and that's one more reason

594
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:14,459
why you have those extra bags in there I

595
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:21,570
mean the thought of plant matter going

596
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:23,819
into my 90 micron hash so actually going

597
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:25,980
back to when they discovered the east

598
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:28,048
yes he had a cannabinoid system for

599
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,839
those you know no it was discovered in

600
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:32,158
1977 they found the receptors in pigs

601
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:34,259
you know that's where the research

602
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,389
started when they talked about this [ __ ]

603
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:39,659
going on actually after working fella

604
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:42,808
just under 12 new at 11 years then they

605
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:44,190
found it in the human brain so it's

606
00:23:42,808 --> 00:23:46,048
interesting that they knew it was there

607
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:49,409
but then they made it illegal knowing

608
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:51,599
that we actually need it and things are

609
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:52,559
changing and you know this is an

610
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,928
interesting thing because the

611
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:57,388
endocannabinoid system in my opinion is

612
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:58,798
just you know it's something straight

613
00:23:57,388 --> 00:24:00,658
people have never known about it I'll

614
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,398
tell you dr. David Allen had a really

615
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,379
good point he said that people with

616
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:06,508
massive endocannabinoid deficiencies

617
00:24:04,378 --> 00:24:08,969
that are like beyond and above on normal

618
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:10,970
endocannabinoid deficiency these people

619
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:13,319
basically get a type of brain damage

620
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,999
against cannabis these are the cannabis

621
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,618
prohibitionists that will throw you away

622
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:18,450
in jail they'll ruin your life they'll

623
00:24:16,618 --> 00:24:19,980
shoot your dog they'll take all your

624
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,600
things they don't care if your kids are

625
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,058
crying they don't care about any of that

626
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:28,678
because they're completely not tuned in

627
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:31,079
to their own system so I really like

628
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,639
when David Allen said that it makes so

629
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:34,398
much sense why our prohibitionists why

630
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:39,109
are the people that don't use cannabis

631
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:42,169
why do they care if we use it

632
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:44,149
silly all right so we keep the gun in

633
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:47,330
here right now Johnny doesn't want to

634
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:54,048
run a whole town that's underground I'd

635
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:56,058
say we got to make our general breaking

636
00:24:54,048 --> 00:24:59,450
this up so these five gallon bags

637
00:24:56,058 --> 00:25:02,990
generally will fit 200 grams of dried

638
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:05,779
bud if you stuff too much bud into the

639
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:07,759
bucket the resin won't be able to filter

640
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:10,160
down it'll get caught in the plant

641
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:14,269
matter and so it's key that we do the

642
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:17,240
right amounts I oft in a way but we also

643
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:19,308
don't dry our bud anymore we we run it

644
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,808
fresh frozen so if you've got fresh bud

645
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:22,399
you got a freezer right besides it

646
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:23,960
thrown into it well the next we get

647
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,820
better result the next bubble we make

648
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,470
will be in a ganja field and we'll be

649
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:29,240
cutting those plants down fresh and

650
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,029
going right into the bucket that's

651
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,548
definitely the way I remember hiking for

652
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:37,428
forty minutes into the hills here in

653
00:25:34,548 --> 00:25:39,048
Jamaica back in 2002 when I came out

654
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:41,660
with international cata graphic and

655
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:43,339
gypsy Nirvana who's now in Milano prison

656
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,048
awaiting extradition from the

657
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:46,970
Philippines to the US let's hope they

658
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:48,410
don't get him guys they already got Marc

659
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,769
Emery we shouldn't give them gypsy

660
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,769
nirvana

661
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:04,079
and once we get into her into the ice

662
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,580
it's breaking oh yeah well it's nice to

663
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,528
break the herb down you don't like I

664
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:09,509
said you don't want to break it into

665
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:12,538
powder but you definitely want to get it

666
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:15,119
you know broken down so that it's a it's

667
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:16,890
gonna release those trichomes and one

668
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,769
thing I did see when I looked at this

669
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:21,360
bug with what the lid you see definitely

670
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:23,129
how the trichomes release in there

671
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,658
because what the sativa is they're not

672
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,370
as tight as the indica buds that I'm

673
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:28,320
used to rock hard wood you always see on

674
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:30,269
my videos what I talk about is how dense

675
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:33,889
and how we rock are those in the Khazar

676
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:36,450
this is not that type of but it's um yes

677
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:39,149
this is the kind of but I love this is

678
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,528
participate it is I said all the time

679
00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:42,479
and I guess banyumas

680
00:26:40,528 --> 00:26:44,369
I'm constantly defending the herb in

681
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,079
Jamaica because you can't you get like

682
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,489
touristy people come here and it's like

683
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,048
listen man like just because you came

684
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,240
here and didn't find anything worth

685
00:26:49,048 --> 00:26:53,369
finding but certainly isn't to say that

686
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,259
something worth people constantly say

687
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:56,219
when they can't find something that it

688
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:58,500
doesn't exist

689
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,720
oh there's no good weed in Jamaica but

690
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,700
is like the most insane statements that

691
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,589
you could ever possibly make and really

692
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,929
it's ignorant to say it because it shows

693
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:09,058
that you must have stayed at sandals

694
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:11,159
never visited any real people on the

695
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:14,038
island and literally just like bought I

696
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:17,100
don't know like swaggy moldy brown baby

697
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:18,808
from from the local hotel guy

698
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:20,308
don't stay in hotels when you come to

699
00:27:18,808 --> 00:27:22,619
Jamaica if you can help it get out of

700
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:24,240
those all-inclusive those those hotels

701
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:25,619
don't leave any money on this island

702
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,798
they take it all off and they don't pay

703
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:30,869
employees properly it's all a pretty

704
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,519
pretty bad scene in general so I've

705
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:34,739
always prided myself the first time I

706
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,908
came to Jamaica I stayed in a tent and

707
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,429
everyone was like you can't stay in a

708
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:39,690
tent I was like why not I'm bringing it

709
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:41,159
who's gonna stop me

710
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,350
well the army did actually at one point

711
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,789
in time tried to stop me but I found one

712
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:46,079
I bribed those guys with a big buck

713
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,308
knife that I had they just buggered

714
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,528
right off it was awesome

715
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:51,148
it was amazing actually the middle Bush

716
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:53,759
is going back into like the early

717
00:27:51,148 --> 00:27:55,168
nineties yes a long time ago guaranteed

718
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,190
things have changed here so yeah

719
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:59,730
absolutely

720
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:01,528
that I'm talking about so who knows I

721
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,120
sure look forward to the

722
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:05,819
decriminalization here in Jamaica

723
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,709
happening beautiful pretty big steps for

724
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:09,898
Jamaica to take to decriminalize two

725
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,399
ounces for personal I think even more

726
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:14,579
importantly than the decriminalization

727
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:16,589
of two ounces is to let everyone that's

728
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:20,009
in jail out if they're in for cannabis

729
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:20,579
crimes potentially we re proud part

730
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:25,620
reiations

731
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:27,329
and boy felony you know clean clean the

732
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:29,668
charges you can't you can't those people

733
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:33,839
can't be charged for something that was

734
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:37,679
simply you know unknown unreasonable

735
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:40,168
government towed line from the 1937

736
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,700
drugging piece of narcotics treaty that

737
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:44,460
the united states of course look bigger

738
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,808
put into got all the other countries to

739
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,519
sign up and that's basically what's been

740
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:49,769
holding everything up why for so long

741
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,888
nobody's been able to grow cannabis

742
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:59,159
legally and and actually experiment and

743
00:28:52,888 --> 00:29:00,388
do and do good work with it we could

744
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:02,519
show it up yeah i mean it's just a

745
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:04,408
little bucket of ice a little bucket of

746
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,298

put more ice in we're gonna put more

749
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:18,418

750
00:29:17,878 --> 00:29:20,099

00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,880
[Music]

760
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,009
you'll never use enough ice in this

761
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:10,369
process don't ever think you're using

762
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:13,369
too much I think that every video we say

763
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:14,959
keep it cold keep it cold cold keep it

764

cash out on the Pacific Ocean on a boat

767
00:30:18,648 --> 00:30:22,639
I made it with DJ short once and Marc

768
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:24,229
Emery actually on a school bus driving

769
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,480
around Vancouver that was trippy there

770
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,890
were no school kids on it though we had

771
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,339
just rented it for our own sort of

772
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:33,049
tokers gold party that we were having

773
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:34,668

774
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:41,869
all over the world Switzerland Germany

775
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:43,880
Italy France London India Thailand Korea

776
00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:46,219
I made hash all over the world so I'm

777
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:51,470
happy to be here doing it Suns gonna

778
00:30:46,220 --> 00:31:03,079
start mixing up the medicine always get

779
00:30:51,470 --> 00:31:04,490
a rhythm going you be getting water

780
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:07,609
pouring out of the sides don't be

781
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:10,808
worried because the resin is trapped

782
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:10,808
inside the screens

783
00:31:25,729 --> 00:31:29,840
kind of you guys anybody there

784
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,039
that right there is a good mix if we can

785
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:44,379
get that for five to ten minutes we're

786
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,059
going to assure glandular trichomes

787
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:51,250
isolation and decontamination

788
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:51,250
[Applause]

789
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,710
[Applause]

790
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:18,599
got this great drink here real Jamaican

791
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:20,009
around so I'll juice yeah that's nice so

792
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,808
back at home I have washing machines

793
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:23,700
they're very small washing machines I

794
00:32:21,808 --> 00:32:26,220
get them out of China they're about this

795
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,380
big I have bigger ones as well but these

796
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,089
are an incredible product they're fairly

797
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,400
inexpensive they'll actually wash your

798
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:34,500
clothes but they'll also wash the resin

799
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,970
off of your plants so this is one of the

800
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,910
variables that a lot of people can make

801
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:40,558
mistakes in like I said earlier the

802
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:43,350
majority of the time people try to over

803
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,470
mix they try to put too much mix into

804
00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:47,849
the material with dry material what can

805
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:50,750
happen is you can break it up more than

806
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:54,178
you want to and create contamination and

807
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:55,470
basically it's it's a fine line of

808
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:56,880
mixing and that's why I started selling

809
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:59,160
the machine not because I thought people

810
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,860
need of another machine and you can

811
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,720
totally do this with a stick but it took

812
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:05,569
out the variables of people worrying

813
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,950
about ruining their product I mean it's

814
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:10,619
for John and I it's nothing to throw

815
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:13,009
kilos and kilos and kilos into water and

816
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:15,629
ice and just mix it up I personally run

817
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:18,400
hundreds of pounds of bug into hash

818
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:20,950
eight to ten pounds of hash at a time

819
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,320
with this process every three to four

820
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:26,769
days this is something that I've done in

821
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:28,960
the past now I'm doing a lot less these

822
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:31,960
days I'm not really isolating on those

823
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,880
levels anymore I mostly I mostly isolate

824
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,150
myself and for John for our own personal

825
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:42,790
medicinal reasons why can't you make

826
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:44,800
your own resin that's it you can give a

827
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:47,049
man a fish and he'll be happy but you

828
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,609
teach a man to fish and that is a whole

829
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:50,109
different ballgame and that's what we're

830
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,729
doing right here we're not coming in and

831
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:53,229
saying we have all the secret

832
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,519
proprietary knowledge and we know how to

833
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,650
do a bunch of stuff that you don't know

834
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,660
how to do our whole trip is beautif

835
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,670
people how to do this I won't be leaving

836
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,500
Jamaica with these bags I'll be leaving

837
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,269
them here with the person that got the

838
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,799
most excited about learning and the

839
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:07,929
person that's the most gung-ho I'm

840
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:11,559
getting this started and turned into a

841
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:13,750
not a business but a journey it's a

842
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:16,539
journey to the unadulterated cannabinoid

843
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:19,030
high and when you experience that pure

844
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:20,769
essence of job through just the resin

845
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,840
with out that contamination

846
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:24,849
it is either what do you want to call it

847
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,639
a religious I personally call it a

848
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:29,860
spiritual experience and I am lucky

849
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:32,079
enough to have it every day some people

850
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,530
call it ritual but every day for me and

851
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,219
John

852
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,220
its original

853
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,889
[Applause]

854
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,590
get that fall

855
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:54,679
I need a friend

856
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,450
I've made a lot of John's water hatch

857
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,630
with and for him over the course of the

858
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:04,139
last year

859
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:06,690
happily John has done a lot for me John

860
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:08,909
helps a lot of people selflessly on a

861
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:11,039
regular basis so if you want to know how

862
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:12,719
to find happiness in your life it's not

863
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,250
going to be by collecting baubles and

864
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,779
gold chains for yourself it's actually

865
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:18,389
gonna be going out and doing something

866
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,730
for someone not necessarily that has

867
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:22,589
less but maybe just a person that needs

868
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:25,699
a little bit of help or a smile or a

869
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,700
nice word or two

870
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:43,210
so on the machine when I'm mixing like

871
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,810
this I'll generally mix for six minutes

872
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:48,010
with my machine because I'm hand mixing

873
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:53,099
and the mixing is going to be a little

874
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:53,100
less standard yeah I'd say about 15

875
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:10,959
working it

876
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:12,880
so a marketing company sorrell to me

877
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:16,228
from us and I have my first one if you

878
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,229
didn't see the expression on my face

879
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:23,068
pretty nice eh it's great and apparently

880
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:35,129
they're available in Canada so hey I'm

881
00:36:23,068 --> 00:36:37,769
buying two pieces of these oh yeah what

882
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:40,230
I'm making bubble hash in Jamaica make

883
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:46,440
sure you I drink so Rael juice I'm just

884
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:47,639
joking one of the things about John and

885
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,909
I you'll notice is we don't promote

886
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:53,639
anything that we don't love we actually

887
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:56,489
have this thing called integrity which

888
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:59,190
lowers profits immensely but it creates

889
00:36:56,489 --> 00:37:01,558
better vibes so when you see us on our

890
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:04,440
show when we're promoting a certain type

891
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:06,390
of product or tool or whatever it's not

892
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,250
because a company has approached us and

893
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:09,568
said hey listen you know if you just

894
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,949
tell everyone my product is the best

895
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:12,179
I'll pay you someone so money we don't

896
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:13,889
do any of that we don't take money from

897
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:16,169
companies we just promote the products

898
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:17,929
with a high integrity that we believe in

899
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:21,329
that you should you know in the least

900
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:23,899
check out if you are you know along the

901
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:23,900
same path

902
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,650
well that's it and that's why with the

903
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:32,539
LED light people are asking me already

904
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,519
do you like the LED do you like the lush

905
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:36,980
well I'm only starting to grow my first

906
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:38,690
crop with it so I can't really tell you

907
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,400
if I like it yet and I can't really

908
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,260
promote it in a way that says yeah you

909
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,940
should go buy one because I haven't

910
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,440
actually grown any resin with it once

911
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,179
I've grown my cannabis and I've

912
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,909
extracted the resin and I've actually

913
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:57,710
smoked the resin with John then we'll

914
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:58,909
have an idea you're gonna set us up with

915
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,349
the pressing strings I'm getting

916
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:04,339
pressing screens and they're there at

917
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:06,139
the Karno right in there so this is the

918
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,059
final part once you've done your mixing

919
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:10,579
I'm not done yet I'm gonna mix for about

920
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:13,460
five more minutes once you've done your

921
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:15,650
mixing we settled for about five minutes

922
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,420
right now as I talk little trichomes

923
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,750
have been broken off as cannabis and

924
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,369
they're actually sinking in this bucket

925
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:24,949
for me as a cannabis aficionado and

926
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:26,509
lover I always get so excited about

927
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:28,819
sharing this information with people

928
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:31,280
that I know love cannabis but they don't

929
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:33,620
know about this I mean imagine all your

930
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,510
life all you ever had was grape juice

931
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:37,460
and then one day someone that just came

932
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:40,310
over to you and said have you ever seen

933
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:42,380
these and you they showed you grapes you

934
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:44,179
know that's the equivalent to what we're

935
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,490
doing here when we when we lift these

936
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:50,559
bags and you just see this sandy kind of

937
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:53,089
product you'll you'll get the the idea

938
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,829
and of course I'm talking to my Jamaican

939
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:56,539
friends here not so much the people back

940
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:57,860

941
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:59,059

942
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:02,740
and I know you guys pretty much know

943
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:02,739
this process inside and out

944
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:10,450
if you guys have any questions at all

945

946
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:13,960
about it you're not interrupting I'll

947
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:15,940
edit this video and I can pause and cut

948
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,679
things out and make I don't want you to

949
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,480
be lost at any point in this process

950
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,909
there's ever a point where you're like

951
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,010
why did you do that what is it you're

952
00:39:21,909 --> 00:39:31,389
doing right now just interrupt and ask

953
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:34,930
me so these bags define little story are

954
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:39,609
made in Nepal Nepal Kathmandu huge

955
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:41,129
shivay Bubba group in Nepal Shivaratri

956
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:45,789
of course which is Shiva's birthday

957
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:47,980
Shiva in my opinion is the most rascal

958
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:51,730
like of the Hindu gods

959
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:54,309
you know Shiva's pretty damn cool Shiva

960
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:56,409
puffs top and even drinks bang he was

961
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:59,559
got long-ass hair and a huge ass beard

962
00:39:56,409 --> 00:40:01,750
and every celebration I've ever been

963
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:03,579
involved in and every saw do cuz there's

964
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,610
many many types of holy men in India

965
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:07,239
many type of sadhu and they're not all

966
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,910
she bites

967
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:11,709
there's Brahmins and there's Krishna's

968
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:14,049
and there she bites so you have a bunch

969
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,460
of different schools it doesn't take

970
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:17,230
long to figure out when you go to India

971
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,970
that the she bites or the poppers so of

972
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:21,960
course the whole time I was there I was

973
00:40:18,969 --> 00:40:24,689
hanging out with shivay Bubba's

974
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,539
and here's an interesting fact that the

975
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:30,329
Jamaicans will love these guys are

976
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:32,190
revered in India they're dreads they're

977
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:33,989
bearded they're holy men and walk around

978
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:36,150
in bare feet they don't own things but

979
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:38,338
they're revered by the people because

980
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:41,400
they live a hard life belief system in

981
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:43,259
India with karma and how karma works is

982
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,450
that the Saudis are living this life to

983
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,520
work through the Karma of the people not

984
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:48,989
just for themselves a lot of the North

985
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:50,309
American mentality when it comes to

986
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:52,409
karma is a selfish

987
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:54,029
Oh as long as I'm nice I'll have good

988
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,539
karma well that's not really how it

989
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,339
works

990
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:58,529
bad karma can be trapped by good people

991
00:40:56,338 --> 00:41:00,449
and good karma can be trapped by bad

992
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,890
people we're all one people on this

993
00:41:00,449 --> 00:41:04,789
earth and our Karma's are all

994
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:07,190
interconnected they're not separating a

995
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:10,969
[Music]

996
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,970
couple more minutes don't it

997
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:17,838
[Applause]

998
00:41:14,818 --> 00:41:17,838
I'm getting the

999
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:27,090
[Applause]

1000
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:36,370
a little herb water in that in the

1001
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,369
either

1002
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,550
I've got two pieces of cardboard here

1003
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:45,799
when I was just explaining the cardboard

1004
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:47,870
to the guys behind us is gonna soak the

1005
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,150
moisture that we leave within that is in

1006
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:52,099
the hash of the moisture out of my gosh

1007
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:54,230
very important for here in Jamaica a

1008
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:57,170
desiccant a desiccant is something that

1009
00:41:54,230 --> 00:42:00,170
will absorb moisture with the help of

1010
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:02,119
gravity so cardboard is a desiccant it's

1011
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:04,369
any paper you can see if I put paper

1012
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,719
down right here right now obviously it

1013
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:08,359
would absorb the water off of the

1014
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:10,579
concrete so cardboard is the same idea

1015
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,280
we like to get a triple applied

1016
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:14,840
cardboard we used pizza boxes because we

1017
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,550
can close them wrap them in parchment

1018
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,130
paper and when we grade our bubble over

1019
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:21,670
top of it it's going to be safe from any

1020
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:24,590
contaminant like hair or debris or dust

1021
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:27,320
what I mean by grading it or receiving

1022
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:28,670
it or micro planing it once we pulled

1023
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,820
this resin out of here it's going to be

1024
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,050
wet and it's very important that we I'm

1025
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,269
probably the most important thing that

1026
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:39,019
we will do in this whole process is that

1027
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:41,329
will break that bubble hash up so it's

1028
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:43,460
powder and the greater the surface area

1029
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:45,670
of powder that we can spread the more

1030
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:48,050
efficient the cardboard will be with its

1031
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:50,900
desiccant action I mean if you put a

1032
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:52,700
little paddy one little paddy on a big

1033
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,889
piece of cardboard yeah that cardboard

1034
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:56,569
is gonna pull right under that paddy

1035
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:58,579
it'll never dry properly now what if I

1036
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:01,250
broke that paddy into powder and spread

1037
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:02,630
it all over the cardboard well in a

1038
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,159
place like Jamaica it doesn't take very

1039
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:07,160
long before that moisture is absorbed

1040
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:09,799
and then the resin is is able to cure so

1041
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:11,629
a small explanation of that is that the

1042
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,010
wax membrane cuticle that holds in the

1043
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:16,610
cannabinoid profile and glandular

1044
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:18,230
trichomes becomes brittle and we break

1045
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:21,320
it off and we separate the hash however

1046
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:23,510
if it's fresh or herb it's going to

1047
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,340
maintain hydration inside that wax

1048
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:28,220
number and there's moisture in it okay

1049
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:31,100
so when you add more water to an already

1050
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:34,279
moist membrane you saturated and it

1051
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:36,559
becomes harder to dry so in Jamaica in a

1052
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,900
place like this using dry herb can be

1053
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:42,289
beneficial however I still love to do

1054
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:46,150
fresh frozen my fresh frozen okay way to

1055
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:46,150
do fresh frozen filled

1056
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,240
fresh frozen field they say we pulled

1057
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:57,529
these bags pretty soon

1058
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:59,629
the beds I think so pretty soon so we've

1059
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:02,480
got my water right here John it's nice

1060
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:06,619
and cold we'll be able to do our rinses

1061
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,719
I think what we'll do because it's very

1062
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:10,819
important

1063
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:14,929
potentially Ashley or someone what we

1064
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:16,820
require is the hose these turned on down

1065
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:19,579
there okay and then as we pull the bags

1066
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,980
and I clean the hash out someone's gonna

1067
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:24,319
have to take the bags as us I'm gonna

1068
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:26,809
clean the hash out John's gonna flip the

1069
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,000
bag inside out inside this bucket rinse

1070
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:30,409
McClure it's the majority and the resin

1071
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,929
off of the screen but because of this

1072
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:37,009
heat and this moisture we need to ensure

1073
00:44:32,929 --> 00:44:39,019
that those that the the resin is cleaned

1074
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:41,000
off the screen properly so really pay

1075
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:42,860
attention with your eyes look at the

1076
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,480
screen is there resin all over that hose

1077
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:46,550
down there is unfortunately very warm

1078
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,829
water if you put your thumb over the

1079
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:50,269
hose and create a real jet you should be

1080
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:53,239
able to clean the bags and we're gonna

1081
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:55,219
give you the bags wrapped inside out

1082
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:57,379
over this bucket so they'll be already

1083
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:59,689
stretched so you won't have to hold a

1084
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,849
floppy bag there'll be a nice open

1085
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:04,730
screen right here you can hold the bag

1086
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:06,679
underneath you know cinched and just

1087
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:07,990
hold this sideways and John can go down

1088
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:10,989
with you the first time definitely

1089
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:10,989
alright

1090
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:18,630
[Music]

1091
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:36,519
I think you did 15 John I think we're

1092
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:39,309
good yes clean if you can that wasn't

1093
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:41,639
there a second ago you gotta keep it

1094
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:41,639
clean

1095
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:46,510
oh yeah and you know what little blood

1096
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:47,019
particles aren't really what we're

1097
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:51,880
worried about

1098
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:53,079
right it's the resin exactly so just

1099
00:45:51,880 --> 00:46:08,079
think I think we're gonna have to dump

1100
00:45:53,079 --> 00:46:10,420
this lovely plants yeah well we'll see

1101
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:14,289
what happens yep and here we go guys

1102
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:15,970
well embed bags when our first bags in

1103
00:46:14,289 --> 00:46:18,130
Jamaica so we did you know make a little

1104
00:46:15,969 --> 00:46:20,379
bit of a mess on our first we've got a

1105
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,690
little vs. LV bag is very good to have

1106
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:25,150
it is even though still I'm gonna clean

1107
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:26,710
it as much as I can rather than let this

1108
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:31,809
get into the final product

1109
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:33,639
a great thing about water hash as well

1110
00:46:31,809 --> 00:46:35,070
is that you know often when people see

1111
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:37,329
it for the first time they're surprised

1112
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,830
that there's you know there's that you

1113
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:41,230
took all this herb and only got this

1114
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:42,940
small amount of resin well that's the

1115
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:44,769
fact of canvas there's a small amount of

1116
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,150
resin and all these people you know

1117
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:48,699
people when I got caught with my

1118
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:50,170
cannabis I have a cannabis felony I got

1119
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:52,210
caught with 16 and a half pounds at a

1120
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:53,829
roadblock and the police just thought it

1121
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,210
was the greatest thing ever and I you

1122
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:56,829
know luckily they didn't catch me

1123
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:59,829
earlier that day when I had 100 pounds

1124
00:46:56,829 --> 00:47:02,259
that's a whole other story but the 16

1125
00:46:59,829 --> 00:47:05,019
and a half pounds got taken my cash got

1126
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,820
taken it was actually being held for the

1127
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:08,980
BC compassion club it was herb for

1128
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,210
terminally sick people it wasn't going

1129
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:12,429
to high school students and it wasn't

1130
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:14,079
even a recreational thing so the judge

1131
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:17,049
in Canada was really cool about it he

1132
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,269
judged in a way that gave me no fine no

1133
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:20,650
time no probation and he ordered the

1134
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:22,690
prosecutor give me my money back

1135
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:25,090
and while I was being charged the

1136
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:26,619
prosecutor asked my lawyer if I could

1137
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:30,460
get their friend who was dying of cancer

1138
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:32,529
in the hospital a bag of weed did you

1139
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,099
get that the prosecutor who was

1140
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:37,400
prosecuting me for trial

1141
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:40,400
Cannabis asked my lawyer to get his

1142
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:43,489
friend a bag of weed who was dying it in

1143
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,670
the hospital of cancer of course I did

1144
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:47,869
it of course I'm gonna show the guy that

1145
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,979
just because you're under bullying you

1146
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:51,440
have such a shitty job you have to

1147
00:47:48,978 --> 00:47:54,199
prosecute people for you know cannabis

1148
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,460
in fact the most righteous level of

1149
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:57,498
cannabis distribution you're

1150
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:59,269
distributing to terminally ill people

1151
00:47:57,498 --> 00:48:01,219
you know these people these people were

1152
00:47:59,268 --> 00:48:03,738
really sick back then now luckily today

1153
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:05,449
in Canada there's a variety of us John

1154
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:06,920
and I are clearly not terminally ill but

1155
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:10,189
we're still allowed to use cannabis as a

1156
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:13,519
medicine which is fairly important to

1157
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:15,380
the two of us so the best part about

1158
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:25,338
pulling this bag is how much of Isis in

1159
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:27,410
there it's creamy it's like and when we

1160
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:32,239
see it creamy we're happy

1161
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:34,659
yeah we're happy when we see I'm almost

1162
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:37,970
happy of all the colors aside from clear

1163
00:48:34,659 --> 00:48:39,978
clear states that you know this looks

1164
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:41,538
like sour sap juice it really does is

1165
00:48:39,978 --> 00:48:43,669
what this looks like in here soursop

1166
00:48:41,539 --> 00:48:44,539
juice so you know we did something and

1167
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,389
we didn't only do a mechanical

1168
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:49,880
separation which is the process but

1169
00:48:47,389 --> 00:48:52,879
we've also leached water-soluble

1170
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,650
terpenes into this water and that's why

1171
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,979
we've got this color definitely keeping

1172
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:56,979
this ice

1173
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:26,409
quick thinking Johnny Johnny quick

1174
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:27,819
thinker so I'm just grabbing little bits

1175
00:49:26,409 --> 00:49:30,069
and pieces just because the quality of

1176
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:59,050
this you never know it could be good why

1177
00:49:30,070 --> 00:50:01,750
would I want to this is our contaminant

1178
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:04,450
bag a little bit of ice cubes cuz John

1179
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:08,170
and I got a little overzealous on our

1180
00:50:04,449 --> 00:50:10,480
mixing um it's a lot of contaminant but

1181
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:14,619
you can tell that we filtered something

1182
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,329
out all right this isn't what it's what

1183
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:17,679
we don't want and people often ask why

1184
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:19,449
do you why didn't want to use that bag

1185
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,639
because we need to get this out of our

1186
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:23,769
smoker this isn't something that that's

1187
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:25,389
that we were going to be wanting to

1188
00:50:23,769 --> 00:50:27,280
inhale now there are medicinal

1189
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:28,929
properties in this you could cook it

1190
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,269
into a banana bread you could literally

1191
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:32,980
collect this stuff by the kilo and give

1192
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:34,900
it to someone who makes Mehta bowls and

1193
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,440
those Mehta Bulls would be unbelievable

1194
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:40,329
and of course John we know that because

1195
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,829
when we eat THC what does it do in our

1196
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:44,349
body we feed a Rango cannabinoid system

1197
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:47,019
and it metabolizes in our liver so when

1198
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:48,579
you eat cannabis it's different from

1199
00:50:47,019 --> 00:50:50,409
smoking and it actually will go through

1200
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:52,090
your liver and it metabolizes and what

1201
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:55,179
it does is it turns tetrahydrocannabinol

1202
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:56,980
which is THC into eleven hydroxy

1203
00:50:55,179 --> 00:50:59,919
metabolites and anyone that's ever eaten

1204
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:02,829
cannabis that stuff will lick you good

1205
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,990
like it will put you down it isn't very

1206
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:06,579
different from smoking cannabis and sure

1207
00:51:04,989 --> 00:51:07,699
you can get people who smoked a bunch

1208
00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:09,559
and have

1209
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:12,078
minor anxiety attack and return a very

1210
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:14,838
intense it's nothing compared to the

1211
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,369
power of eating or overeating cannabis I

1212
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:18,259
eat a lot of cannabis and I haven't the

1213
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:20,720
last 24 hours X 2 3 days so of course

1214
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:22,220
I'm eating this canvas yeah well you

1215
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,108
need a lot of cannabis it's not you I'm

1216
00:51:22,219 --> 00:51:27,949
talking about that's for sure I know

1217
00:51:24,108 --> 00:51:30,429
so this is our 190 you just pull that

1218
00:51:27,949 --> 00:51:37,098
ice cube oh if you get a chance there

1219
00:51:30,429 --> 00:51:45,949
all right so so 190 so once again feel

1220
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:48,099
the resin on there over here stretch

1221
00:51:45,949 --> 00:51:51,108
that right over the top

1222
00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:53,450
pull cinch it on the bottom and then

1223
00:51:51,108 --> 00:52:00,409
we'll just stick it in the water and get

1224
00:51:53,449 --> 00:52:04,909
that this is an extremely important

1225
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:06,739
about this is a very important part use

1226
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:08,389
your eyes use a microscope if you have

1227
00:52:06,739 --> 00:52:10,848
food there's stuff on the street and if

1228
00:52:08,389 --> 00:52:12,858
you leave it there each time it's gonna

1229
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:14,780
dry and it's gonna fill the holes and

1230
00:52:12,858 --> 00:52:16,549
once you've eventually filled the holes

1231
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,920
on the screen you're gonna be throwing

1232
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:21,589
pounds of weed and and getting very very

1233
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,960
very small returns because it's not

1234
00:52:21,588 --> 00:52:26,239
making it through the screens you can

1235
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:29,119
fix this by taking some you know over

1236
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:31,639
proof alcohol clear alcohol and rubbing

1237
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:34,369
gently I use a toothbrush I flip the bag

1238
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:35,750
over a screen and make it tight and then

1239
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:38,088
I just use this toothbrush with the

1240
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:41,539
smallest amount of solvents as you guys

1241
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,989
know I am NOT a solvent fan I I say it

1242
00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:44,420
all the time

1243
00:52:41,989 --> 00:52:46,219
water sustains life and solvents end

1244
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,599
like it's as simple as that there's no

1245
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:49,879
ifs ands or buts about it

1246
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,690
water sustains life on Earth and

1247
00:52:49,880 --> 00:53:00,280
solvents end life on Earth

1248
00:52:52,690 --> 00:53:03,068
next bag 161 3000 we got a pile Dhoni

1249
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:06,880
yeah and right away it's this oranjee

1250
00:53:03,068 --> 00:53:16,538
ready lie bed awesome like beautiful

1251
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:20,019
hash like that's nice 160 a little bit

1252
00:53:16,539 --> 00:53:22,150
the process that I use almost panning

1253
00:53:20,019 --> 00:53:24,400
I'm gonna balance it around and I'm

1254
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:28,470
gonna pick itself up off the screen and

1255
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,470
get these little shaking processes

1256
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:44,309
anticipated because we were this is the

1257
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:49,269
160 so by no means is this what we want

1258
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:51,609
but I'll tell you to get that quality is

1259
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:53,019
a good sign it only means that our 120

1260
00:53:51,608 --> 00:53:55,838
bag that I'm about to go pull right now

1261
00:53:53,019 --> 00:53:57,849
is only gonna be better this is

1262
00:53:55,838 --> 00:53:59,469
basically nicer than any gun you could

1263
00:53:57,849 --> 00:54:01,900
find on the entire island because I

1264
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:04,419
washed it it's not an ego thing it's

1265
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:07,690
just that they're smashing resins with

1266
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:08,980
knives and I washed the resin we have

1267
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:11,789
the microscope because we could really

1268
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,789
show these guys

1269
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:29,720
well yeah I'm seeing if you go over on

1270
00:54:27,619 --> 00:54:32,389
this side you'll see contaminant you'll

1271
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:33,289
see systole pairs stigmas kappa pick

1272
00:54:32,389 --> 00:54:35,960
stocks

1273
00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:40,940
not so much actual plant matter but

1274
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:43,760
trichome contamination why don't we get

1275
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:47,929
it off and I'm gonna use a little bit of

1276
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:50,300
this water just to kind of rehydrate

1277
00:54:47,929 --> 00:54:54,399
that resin that I allowed to in this

1278
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:56,930
heat it's drawing me this resin will dry

1279
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,760
so you can always rehydrate it by adding

1280
00:54:56,929 --> 00:55:00,649
more water on to the screen to get it

1281
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:03,110
off once again movies on ice cold water

1282
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:05,000
underneath now after this bag we wash

1283
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:06,740
the other bags back into the other bags

1284
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,199
we want to keep collecting that residue

1285
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:11,239
after this bag this bag is not a good

1286
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:12,829
enough resin for us yet I looked at it

1287
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:16,039
under the microscope it's probably only

1288
00:55:12,829 --> 00:55:17,360
40% gland heads every sixty to seventy

1289
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:19,940
percent contaminant great for eating

1290
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,110
great for your 100% right that is great

1291
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:25,130
whatever you know that's something we're

1292
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:27,800
gonna put in our pocket cannot be snobs

1293
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:29,390
are the purest it's just like you say

1294
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,550
the same thing with a good piece of

1295
00:55:29,389 --> 00:55:33,109
fruit as opposed to a bad piece of fruit

1296
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:36,650
you know I'm grateful that's right

1297
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:38,750
perfectly ripe bananas it's the one

1298
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:40,910
that's like overly ripe and almost

1299
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:42,409
rotten I prefer that to give that to my

1300
00:55:40,909 --> 00:55:44,859
wife and she makes banana bread out of

1301
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:47,690
it you know there's different levels of

1302
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:52,000
qualities and the fruit that we're

1303
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:52,000
looking for is the highest quality

1304
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:13,230
getting that slow drip on the 120 is

1305
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:15,329
never of that and now I need to show you

1306
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:16,920
guys each time because you're gonna see

1307
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:18,900
the different quality and you're gonna

1308
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,720
see that the resin it moves around

1309
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:25,139
different and it cleans different and as

1310
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:28,849
it gets better as it gets better I'll be

1311
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:28,849
able to basically

1312
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:40,789
I need a spray bottle if I had a little

1313
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:43,129
spray bottle let's clear it all into the

1314
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:56,719
center make it easier to collect you

1315
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:59,240
know all right I know and you know a

1316
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:02,569
balla resin like this could easily be 2

1317
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:14,019
to 3 grams it looks very small but resin

1318
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:14,019
is extremely dense I have a feeling

1319
00:57:17,889 --> 00:57:20,889
microscope

1320
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:33,949
so of course we're now looking at it

1321
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:36,819
which you guys haven't seen and now it's

1322
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:42,259
heads and now it's all the fresh heavies

1323
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:47,300
hence his company yeah that's nice

1324
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:50,510
yeah that's a good start I came here in

1325
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:53,150
2002 and my friend from Seaford town

1326
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:55,370
he's a German descent the white Jamaican

1327
00:57:53,150 --> 00:58:01,309
guy born and bred his whole family's

1328
00:57:55,369 --> 00:58:04,609
friend yep yep and uh he had a pound of

1329
00:58:01,309 --> 00:58:07,789
herb that he was selling to an expat in

1330
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:09,769
Negril who was the coin man he used to

1331
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:11,599
cut coins and make that look like it you

1332
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:14,480
know someone was smoking a joint inside

1333
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:16,339
a coin and Chris would sell him a pound

1334
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,840
to herb for 50 bucks he'd bring it down

1335
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:19,850
from the hills well the day that I came

1336
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,559
to Jamaica and met Chris the coin man

1337
00:58:19,849 --> 00:58:24,110
told him that the herb was no good and

1338
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:26,059
that he wouldn't pay him the $50 but

1339
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:28,340
Chris had already invested his own money

1340
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:31,549
to get that herb and he had bought it

1341
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:33,230
for maybe 30 bucks or something but 30

1342
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,880
bucks was a lot of money to christen him

1343
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:36,530
he's gonna he was gonna mess him up for

1344
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,970
about a week and a half if he didn't get

1345
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:40,610
it taken care of you was really bummed

1346
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:43,039
out or not the herb wasn't very nice but

1347
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:45,260
I took the herb and I turned it into 11

1348
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:48,710
grams of hash and he sold it to the coin

1349
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:51,560
man for $220 u.s. the same pound to herb

1350
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:54,710
the coin man wouldn't buy for 50 US

1351
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:55,130
dollars so we took it we made hash out

1352
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:58,039
of it

1353
00:58:55,130 --> 00:59:00,710
it took us 30 minutes and Chris went

1354
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:02,630
from losing 30 dollars to making a

1355
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:06,710
hundred and ninety dollars let me tell

1356
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:10,660
you if Chris was pretty happy and so was

1357
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:12,860
the coin mine until he found out

1358
00:59:10,659 --> 00:59:14,899
rehydrating because it wasn't super

1359
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:18,200
happy good job that's that's a great

1360
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,800
that's the Jamaicans spritzer is it yeah

1361
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:20,329
absolutely

1362
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,680
[ __ ] I'm gonna something I know you're

1363
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:24,769
not learning something you just created

1364
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:26,690
something this is how it happens get

1365
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:28,809
your hands dirty make cash with your

1366
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:31,500
friends I swear to god you'll earn this

1367
00:59:28,809 --> 00:59:34,599
haven't done me for actually I just

1368
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,110
that's a great idea worked perfect it

1369
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:37,750
worked

1370
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:38,680
we're great see we learn something new

1371
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:44,739
every day

1372
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:46,179
I might have to just borrow that okay so

1373
00:59:44,739 --> 00:59:48,489
now at this point we're gonna wash this

1374
00:59:46,179 --> 00:59:50,199
Bank into the best rent exactly this is

1375
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:52,599
one of harvest us this is a big change

1376
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:54,730
now we're we're not putting Dresden that

1377
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:56,259
was 90 percent heads and that looks like

1378
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:58,090
something we all want to smoke into this

1379
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:00,040
bucket which is clearly going to be

1380
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:04,530
washed into the garden we're gonna wash

1381
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:08,529
it right back in to the 90 micron bag

1382
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:10,000
what that's gonna do for us is it's

1383
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:14,350
gonna trap those resin heads that were

1384
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:35,170
on this screen in our next we want to

1385
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:36,400
keep this bag is always just great this

1386
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:39,789
is something that will happen sometimes

1387
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,200
with bubble hash you get foam and you

1388
01:00:39,789 --> 01:00:46,019
can't you won't be kind of can't tell

1389
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:46,019
what you have to give it a little blow

1390
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:08,069
some small amount of 19 years we're

1391
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,230
gonna get a big poll in the 73 I was

1392
01:01:08,068 --> 01:01:12,358
expecting at least twice this much of 90

1393
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:14,670
I think it all went into the 73 John

1394
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:16,469
I'll say this as well if we were dealing

1395
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:18,480
with sativas here if there were sativas

1396
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:20,669
in the bunch we're gonna find a large

1397
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,789
amount of heads in this white bag the 45

1398
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:26,909
micron bag and that's due to the fact

1399
01:01:23,789 --> 01:01:29,369
that the tropical Sun beats such

1400
01:01:26,909 --> 01:01:31,889
powerful UVB rays down on this resin

1401
01:01:29,369 --> 01:01:34,260
that it produces almost a smaller

1402
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:36,029
trichome rather than the large bulbous

1403
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:41,309
ones that John and I are used to pulling

1404
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:43,200
off of we're indoor grown cannabis the

1405
01:01:41,309 --> 01:01:49,740
sativas particularly the outdoor ones

1406
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:53,750
will tend to pull much smaller just like

1407
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:58,078
that just because it'll it'll self press

1408
01:01:53,750 --> 01:02:01,500
itself less normally when I'm doing this

1409
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:03,390
as well these right here would be in a

1410
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,548
cold environment like if this was full

1411
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:07,409
of ice we would have it open and we

1412
01:02:05,548 --> 01:02:09,480
would have this down inside of the ice

1413
01:02:07,409 --> 01:02:11,699
mixture and it would just keep a sort of

1414
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:14,130
thermal Klein from I mean it's gotta be

1415
01:02:11,699 --> 01:02:17,250
27 26 degrees out here right now so it's

1416
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:21,858
definitely nice and warm something that

1417
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:25,338
the resin doesn't always appreciate so I

1418
01:02:21,858 --> 01:02:25,338
like freezing

1419
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:49,318
so actually brought this all right here

1420
01:02:41,489 --> 01:02:51,630
you go you want to clean this bag up get

1421
01:02:49,318 --> 01:02:55,048
it down there's a little trick we

1422
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:57,179
learned in Spain yeah we do that I have

1423
01:02:55,048 --> 01:03:00,449
done that before Spain but he just had

1424
01:02:57,179 --> 01:03:03,900
the perfect size pocket and filled

1425
01:03:00,449 --> 01:03:06,778
actually even before I went to Spain we

1426
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:08,969
made hash with the bucket on the side of

1427
01:03:06,778 --> 01:03:11,248
the river that she could miss river up

1428
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:13,528
in Whistler British Columbia raging

1429
01:03:11,248 --> 01:03:15,748
glacier-fed River behind me and John and

1430
01:03:13,528 --> 01:03:17,400
what do we do well we bring a bunch of

1431
01:03:15,748 --> 01:03:19,558
his fresh frozen buds and some bubble

1432
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:22,949
bags and ice and we make hash down by

1433
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:23,369
the river it's quite nice oh yeah look

1434
01:03:22,949 --> 01:03:25,528
at this

1435
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:27,749
the water came right out of the 90

1436
01:03:25,528 --> 01:03:29,518
micron bag why is the water not falling

1437
01:03:27,748 --> 01:03:32,188
through this screen right now what

1438
01:03:29,518 --> 01:03:34,649
possible reasons could it be full of

1439
01:03:32,188 --> 01:03:36,298
breath it's full of resin so you could

1440
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:40,249
stand here like an idiot for 20 minutes

1441
01:03:36,298 --> 01:03:40,248
and let it drain or you could simply go

1442
01:03:43,668 --> 01:03:48,358
from jerking the resin with a quick jerk

1443
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:50,668
up off of the screen and the water is

1444
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:57,418
rushing down through the screen I

1445
01:03:50,668 --> 01:04:00,118
literally had customers who with this

1446
01:03:57,418 --> 01:04:02,129
bag one guy in particular he said it

1447
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:04,499
took him thirty two hours to drain the

1448
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:05,459
bag and I was just like Oh what did you

1449
01:04:04,498 --> 01:04:07,168
do for 30

1450
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:09,958
he's a claw huh I hung it on the

1451
01:04:07,168 --> 01:04:11,458
bathroom doorknob and with the bucket

1452
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:13,678
underneath it and then when I showed him

1453
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:15,448
that I could drain any bag in ten

1454
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:17,338
seconds he actually did not believe me

1455
01:04:15,449 --> 01:04:21,179
and when I finally showed him how to do

1456
01:04:17,338 --> 01:04:23,548
it well the guy just felt so stupid and

1457
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:25,318
you shouldn't feel stupid man in my

1458
01:04:23,548 --> 01:04:27,298
opinion the only way you can learn is to

1459
01:04:25,318 --> 01:04:29,969
put yourself out there look like an

1460
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:31,829
idiot make mistakes I learn from them I

1461
01:04:29,969 --> 01:04:35,358
mean holy [ __ ] how do we learn we make

1462
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:35,359
mistakes that's how I learned anyway

1463
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:43,179
holy [ __ ] how about that that's all I'm

1464
01:04:42,608 --> 01:04:44,920
gonna say

1465
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:47,679
bad got the biggest yield I've seen of

1466
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:51,970
anything that's a really nice 73 Pole

1467
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:54,009
right there this is what I was talking

1468
01:04:51,969 --> 01:04:59,259
about for that is what we're talking

1469
01:04:54,009 --> 01:05:02,019
about your bumps here when you get goose

1470
01:04:59,259 --> 01:05:03,969
bumps you guys look at that goose bumps

1471
01:05:02,018 --> 01:05:07,748
from that resin see the hair standing up

1472
01:05:03,969 --> 01:05:09,399
that's amazing you can't see we're gonna

1473
01:05:07,748 --> 01:05:10,748
get the microscope out once the cameras

1474
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:20,710
off and we'll all get to look at it for

1475
01:05:10,748 --> 01:05:22,868
now I want to pull it off it's always

1476
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:32,470
nice to pull a really nice bag to show I

1477
01:05:22,869 --> 01:05:36,700
know I just thought my arm yeah this is

1478
01:05:32,469 --> 01:05:38,949
this is 10 grams I would say there's a

1479
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:43,268
10 gram pull and we didn't even use all

1480
01:05:38,949 --> 01:05:46,058
about oh how do you know this graceless

1481
01:05:43,268 --> 01:05:48,328
cuz you know that 45 that's gonna be the

1482
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:48,329
same

1483
01:05:51,469 --> 01:05:56,539
I had to show the goose and the hair is

1484
01:05:55,130 --> 01:06:01,670
standing up I was like that's amazing

1485
01:05:56,539 --> 01:06:04,309
that's what we came here to show you all

1486
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:06,619
right clean that off into the 45 we only

1487
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:08,469
have two bags left so we'll be getting

1488
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:10,970
down to the fun stuff here pretty soon a

1489
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:12,709
lot of people make mistakes when they do

1490
01:06:10,969 --> 01:06:14,539
this for the first time it's so exciting

1491
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:17,059
when you see what John and I just saw

1492
01:06:14,539 --> 01:06:19,338
for the first time especially that

1493
01:06:17,059 --> 01:06:21,170
sometimes the bags don't get cleans fast

1494
01:06:19,338 --> 01:06:25,039
enough sometimes they get put down and

1495
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:26,809
everyone's like just do me a favor look

1496
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:28,880
at the hash once you've cleaned your bag

1497
01:06:26,809 --> 01:06:30,170
so I'm gonna clean your bags and then

1498
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:34,099
look at the hash it's not going anywhere

1499
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:35,869
on the 7390 by the 45 because it's so

1500
01:06:34,099 --> 01:06:37,640
small it's gonna get stuck in those

1501
01:06:35,869 --> 01:06:39,800
screens and yeah I gotta get it clean

1502
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:41,629
right away most important parts I mean

1503
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:43,369
they're all important but really pay

1504
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:50,240
attention to your ninety or seventy

1505
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:51,460
three because paper bags all right so

1506
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:57,129
this one's gonna be heavy

1507
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:57,130
45s always hold in the water nice

1508
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:25,090
chance yeah this is probably like twice

1509
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:26,769
as much as the 73 and learn he's just

1510
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:28,750
all water but it's definitely the same

1511
01:07:26,769 --> 01:07:30,400
size once this water drips that's why I

1512
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:32,349
had to give him a depressing screen I

1513
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,559
hoxsey haven't changed my game right

1514
01:07:32,349 --> 01:07:34,510
away

1515
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:37,289
okay I mean that screen okay we're

1516
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:37,290
adaptable John

1517
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,050
so as he started doing that I was well

1518
01:07:54,059 --> 01:08:00,210
ready to the same thing you can actually

1519
01:07:55,050 --> 01:08:03,650
blow the foam off to the side one at a

1520
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:06,990
time no no no yeah I know I got stomped

1521
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:09,150
all right so nice little 45 Pole

1522
01:08:06,989 --> 01:08:10,469
this one's gonna drive him faster so

1523
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:11,760
this is the one these are the two bags

1524
01:08:10,469 --> 01:08:13,230
I'm not gonna walk around and show you

1525
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,520
all but you guys are all gonna be able

1526
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:17,250
to see it on the pressing screen once

1527
01:08:14,519 --> 01:08:18,899
we've got to collect it so this is a

1528
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:22,199
nice pile it's it's actually not quite

1529
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:27,778
as much as the 73 but it's pretty pretty

1530
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:29,909
chunky clean - this is this is what the

1531
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:31,980
water offers us the water offers us the

1532
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:34,710
ability to clean the resin in a way that

1533
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:36,929
we've never been able to before and I'll

1534
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:39,210
tell ya Jamaica was one of the first

1535
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:42,390
countries I came to to show this process

1536
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:47,338
- and I went to a lot of countries like

1537
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:49,109
99 mm I came in 2000 2001 2002 3 4 &amp; 5

1538
01:08:47,338 --> 01:08:51,149
and I think some of those first bags

1539
01:08:49,109 --> 01:08:54,120
were posted on your Facebook page by

1540
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:56,639
someone from here yes yeah I got I got

1541
01:08:54,119 --> 01:08:58,318
good friends in Orange Hills Diggy I got

1542
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:02,430
good friends in Grange Hill that we've

1543
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:06,359
made bubble hash with over the years yes

1544
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:09,329
and maybe people really growers these

1545
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:10,980
guys aren't there's lots of different

1546
01:09:09,329 --> 01:09:11,909
kinds of growers in Jamaica just like

1547
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:13,318
there's lots of different kind of

1548
01:09:11,909 --> 01:09:15,149
growers everywhere in the world but to

1549
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:17,730
find the real root see growers to find

1550
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:19,769
the real you know the the guys that are

1551
01:09:17,729 --> 01:09:21,419
really focused on the effects of the

1552
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:23,549
plant not on how much they're gonna get

1553
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:24,869
from the tourist market which there's

1554
01:09:23,548 --> 01:09:26,399
nothing wrong with that I mean if I

1555
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:28,349
lived in Jamaica I'd be selling the [ __ ]

1556
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:32,338
out of hash to tourists we need to be

1557
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:33,690
funny yeah so when I tour here I mean it

1558
01:09:32,338 --> 01:09:35,369
would be great honestly when I arrived

1559
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:37,169
here the first thing I had to do is go

1560
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:39,059
find ganja and turn it into hash how

1561
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:40,230
happy would I have been if someone met

1562
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:41,370
me at the airport and said oh man we've

1563
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:42,539

Steve Newlin's came we gotta get back

1568
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:53,460
you have to keep in mind John and I have

1569
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:57,659
licenses for this I personally have a

1570
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:59,369
license to have ten pounds of hash at my

1571
01:09:57,659 --> 01:10:01,189
house I'm allowed ten pounds of hash

1572
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:03,109
what do you allow 15 15

1573
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:04,339
fifteen point five pounds over here ten

1574
01:10:03,109 --> 01:10:07,250
pounds over here between the two of us

1575
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:15,289
we rock a 25 pack of hash how sweet is

1576
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:17,119
that we don't the world you know I

1577
01:10:15,289 --> 01:10:19,159
personally consider myself an Earthling

1578
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:22,609
I'm not really a big proponent of

1579
01:10:19,159 --> 01:10:23,930
borders and division of human culture I

1580
01:10:22,609 --> 01:10:25,759
love the fact that we have other

1581
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:28,310
cultures but they're all of our

1582
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,760
culture's to share we're not separated

1583
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:53,840
in any way one more bag Johnny then this

1584
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:55,699
is the bag everyone hates I want to get

1585
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,350
us some cups and we're all gonna have a

1586
01:10:55,698 --> 01:10:59,238
drink of this liquid and you're gonna

1587
01:10:57,350 --> 01:11:00,980
protein-rich cannabis liquid it's not

1588
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:03,289
gonna get any of you high it's just

1589
01:11:00,979 --> 01:11:04,399
gonna be like drinking cannabis tea and

1590
01:11:03,289 --> 01:11:07,729
I know a few of you are gonna be

1591
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:09,579
inspired by it at least and as everybody

1592
01:11:07,729 --> 01:11:11,959
knows you always see me during the night

1593
01:11:09,579 --> 01:11:16,519
yeah it's a nice thing to do you know I

1594
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:18,170
feed it to my plants personally I mean

1595
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,030
these are these are flavors and terpenes

1596
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:21,199
and whatnot and it just seems like a

1597
01:11:20,029 --> 01:11:23,630
good idea to just put them right back

1598
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:24,979
into you know what you don't drink

1599
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:27,440
because I mean obviously John's not

1600
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:29,179
gonna drink five gallons of bubble hash

1601
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:39,500
water because he makes bubble hash

1602
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:41,060
almost every day yeah for it's the last

1603
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,500
little tip on this and you guys have

1604
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:44,900
already seen me doing it these bags are

1605
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:46,819
a little harder to finish off I don't

1606
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:48,229
want you squeezing the fruit I don't

1607
01:11:46,819 --> 01:11:50,389
want you know we don't want to bruise

1608
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:51,229
the resin we don't want to damage it so

1609
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:54,619
what we're gonna do is we're gonna

1610
01:11:51,229 --> 01:11:59,408
create we just open the bag all right

1611
01:11:54,619 --> 01:12:06,550
and we create air in the bag

1612
01:11:59,408 --> 01:12:09,039
and then we use the air to force the

1613
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:11,260
rest of the water and the foam out of

1614
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:13,060
the bag this is very helpful and it

1615
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:15,880
allow you here's the thing when you have

1616
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:17,380
your resin soaking in water let's get it

1617
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,029
out as soon as possible we're teaching

1618
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:21,819
and educating here today so we're going

1619
01:12:19,029 --> 01:12:23,500
real slow but generally you'd see me I'd

1620
01:12:21,819 --> 01:12:25,238
already have this over here this would

1621
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:26,500
have been in the house and microplane

1622
01:12:25,238 --> 01:12:28,959
like we would have already done a lot of

1623
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:30,760
this but we're going slow because we're

1624
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:36,600
in Jamaica and when teaching we're gonna

1625
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:41,920
rush some people yeah all right five

1626
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:43,690
this is our last bag and I'm gonna get a

1627
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,609
really good bucket with a bed this is

1628
01:12:43,689 --> 01:12:48,069
how we do it we used to pull up only the

1629
01:12:45,609 --> 01:12:49,569
[ __ ] and exposes it right there marks

1630
01:12:48,069 --> 01:12:51,009
really experience so we hold in his hand

1631
01:12:49,569 --> 01:12:53,408
just cars it off with this and with what

1632
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:54,880
the spoon but really reality to make

1633
01:12:53,408 --> 01:12:56,049
life a lot easier for you guys as you

1634
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,300
see what he's doing here right now he

1635
01:12:56,050 --> 01:13:00,659
pulls it over a bucket and then you have

1636
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:03,819
access to that resin

1637
01:13:00,659 --> 01:13:03,818
[Music]

1638
01:13:08,309 --> 01:13:15,179
all right so we get a real nice almost

1639
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:16,738
artistic resin mixed with the white foam

1640
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:18,510
that I created and because I gave it a

1641
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:21,468
little bit of a blow I created these

1642
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:25,230
psychedelic patterns inside the resin

1643
01:13:21,469 --> 01:13:26,760
you can see here in here how easy it is

1644
01:13:25,229 --> 01:13:28,198
to see the contaminant when you get rid

1645
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:40,829
of all the contaminant even if you have

1646
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:42,868
1% generally nothing will get through

1647
01:13:40,828 --> 01:13:44,250
these bags but the way John and I the

1648
01:13:42,868 --> 01:13:45,719
way I didn't fold the bag is over

1649
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:47,488
themselves right away and we were

1650
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:49,529
stripping the herb it was falling

1651
01:13:47,488 --> 01:13:58,198
between the bags so we had a little bit

1652
01:13:49,529 --> 01:13:59,340
of there but that's a major major so

1653
01:13:58,198 --> 01:14:00,598
we're gonna see we're gonna look at all

1654
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:02,279
of these under the microscope I'll

1655
01:14:00,599 --> 01:14:04,800
actually photograph them all right now

1656
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:05,969
with my camera so you know it's a little

1657
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,369
bit easier than looking through that

1658
01:14:05,969 --> 01:14:16,198
tiny little eye hole and we'll be able

1659
01:14:08,368 --> 01:14:19,109
to fudge I've been smoking hash for a

1660
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:21,089
long time over 15 years probably close

1661
01:14:19,109 --> 01:14:25,139
to 20 I've been smoking it almost

1662
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:26,578
exclusively for 13 years but I'm here to

1663
01:14:25,139 --> 01:14:29,368
tell you right now

1664
01:14:26,578 --> 01:14:32,729
the Jamaican sun-grown resin is some of

1665
01:14:29,368 --> 01:14:35,069
the best quality resin I've ever inhaled

1666
01:14:32,729 --> 01:14:37,348
in my life and that's saying something

1667
01:14:35,069 --> 01:14:39,988
you guys all know who I am you know that

1668
01:14:37,349 --> 01:14:41,880
I'm not smoking anything less than what

1669
01:14:39,988 --> 01:14:44,368
I would consider the best everywhere I

1670
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,989
go but for whatever reason and John's

1671
01:14:44,368 --> 01:14:47,308
gonna be on this man I'm so excited for

1672
01:14:45,988 --> 01:14:49,799
you to join us here soon

1673
01:14:47,309 --> 01:14:52,050
oh I have something to do making bubble

1674
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,750
uh yeah that too but I mean I got to

1675
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:56,279
smoke Jamaican bud before we actually

1676
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:58,948
did this and like you guys some be

1677
01:14:56,279 --> 01:15:00,779
working here hard going solid and you

1678
01:14:58,948 --> 01:15:02,469
know I did I tweaked my neck a little

1679
01:15:00,779 --> 01:15:07,159
bit but otherwise not you know

1680
01:15:02,469 --> 01:15:08,689
definitely and that's the difference

1681
01:15:07,159 --> 01:15:10,399
between you know when we have what I

1682
01:15:08,689 --> 01:15:12,339
love having John here with me is because

1683
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:15,289
we're not really just promoting you for

1684
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:18,219
values of cannabis which I have 100% of

1685
01:15:15,289 --> 01:15:21,109
proponent on I believe in using cannabis

1686
01:15:18,219 --> 01:15:22,489
spiritually and in in the sense that the

1687
01:15:21,109 --> 01:15:24,948
same way it is the discipline for your

1688
01:15:22,488 --> 01:15:26,959
body it is medicinal for your brain and

1689
01:15:24,948 --> 01:15:28,609
for your soul and the synergy of those

1690
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:32,359
three things the Holy Trinity you have

1691
01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:35,899
my only Trinity anyway I'm gonna what do

1692
01:15:32,359 --> 01:15:38,479
you think do a little a little bit a

1693
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:39,979
little bit now you can do a second run

1694
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:41,659
from that and I can guarantee we get

1695
01:15:39,979 --> 01:15:44,329
more from that right it's true we could

1696
01:15:41,659 --> 01:15:47,149
literally take this put it back into the

1697
01:15:44,329 --> 01:15:49,369
bags mix it again for 10 or 15 minutes

1698
01:15:47,149 --> 01:15:50,750
and we could get more I would not tell

1699
01:15:49,369 --> 01:15:55,130
you to throw that away

1700
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:57,948
oh no however as you do this as you

1701
01:15:55,130 --> 01:16:01,760
start making this especially here in

1702
01:15:57,948 --> 01:16:04,579
Jamaica I can easily see with the way my

1703
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:07,310
mind works that I would set up a thing

1704
01:16:04,579 --> 01:16:09,350
where all the firsts is like one team of

1705
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:11,210
people and then this is the second team

1706
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:12,920
it's not run by the first team you have

1707
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:14,779
a you have a team of people who are

1708
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:17,569
doing the jobs that John and I did and

1709
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:18,889
then you have specific experts who will

1710
01:16:17,569 --> 01:16:20,448
deal with this product right here

1711
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:24,429
because let's be honest no many people

1712
01:16:20,448 --> 01:16:27,919
you're not taking care of that well okay

1713
01:16:24,429 --> 01:16:30,469
big job the big job is breaking up the

1714
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,899
hash into powder and drying it properly

1715
01:16:30,469 --> 01:16:35,060
this is like a foreman job this is a

1716
01:16:32,899 --> 01:16:37,639
supervisor this guy's getting paid more

1717
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:39,860
than everyone else trust me these are

1718
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,780
believers the laborers they're just

1719
01:16:39,859 --> 01:16:43,279
anyone any laborer I mean you just saw

1720
01:16:41,779 --> 01:16:44,899
what we did it's just really simple

1721
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:46,519
labor you're moving around water and ice

1722
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:47,899
you're moving you're mixing with a stick

1723
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:49,940
or you've got washing machines if you've

1724
01:16:47,899 --> 01:16:52,159
got washing machines you're using a bag

1725
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:54,619
like this that's all screened the whole

1726
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:56,809
bag is screen and it zips closed I throw

1727
01:16:54,619 --> 01:16:58,399
the ice and the urban you throw it in

1728
01:16:56,810 --> 01:17:01,250
the washing machine you turn the button

1729
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:03,649
ten minutes later another guy washes

1730
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:05,448
that drains that washing machine into a

1731
01:17:03,649 --> 01:17:08,000
set of buckets and starts doing what we

1732
01:17:05,448 --> 01:17:10,729
did you could have one machine and run

1733
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,309
three 20 gallon sets of bag so three

1734
01:17:10,729 --> 01:17:14,919
machines nine 20 gallon sets of

1735
01:17:13,309 --> 01:17:17,989
eggs you might have four people

1736
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:20,359
constantly making ice breaking it up and

1737
01:17:17,988 --> 01:17:21,439
filling bags in these all screen bags

1738
01:17:20,359 --> 01:17:23,269
and then putting them in the freezer

1739
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:24,919
then you have your second crew coming

1740
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:26,000
along opening the freezer opening those

1741
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:28,489
putting them into the washing machine

1742
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,399
and turning them on that's all they do

1743
01:17:28,488 --> 01:17:32,328
the third crew is pulling bags this is a

1744
01:17:31,399 --> 01:17:34,519
crew you want to

1745
01:17:32,328 --> 01:17:35,719
they're not just laborers these are

1746
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,920
people you've trained and these are

1747
01:17:35,719 --> 01:17:39,529
people who know what they're doing

1748
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:43,399
and they're going to get to this and

1749
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:44,988
this part right here this is where guys

1750
01:17:43,399 --> 01:17:47,328
like John and I come in to Train

1751
01:17:44,988 --> 01:17:49,069
specific people you need a hyper aware

1752
01:17:47,328 --> 01:17:51,618
individual you need someone that is

1753
01:17:49,069 --> 01:17:54,558
aware of their surroundings in a hyper

1754
01:17:51,618 --> 01:17:56,899
aware way not someone that's kind of

1755
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:59,239
like just doing the job and all cut it

1756
01:17:56,899 --> 01:18:01,879
up it has to be done specifically so any

1757
01:17:59,238 --> 01:18:04,788
for this particular job you got to hire

1758
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:07,069
someone that's OCD you know or like anal

1759
01:18:04,788 --> 01:18:08,689
like they're just like I want this to be

1760
01:18:07,069 --> 01:18:10,340
it has to be perfect because if you

1761
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:10,819
don't have that person this is gonna

1762
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:12,440
mold

1763
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:13,880
you're gonna leave moisture in your hash

1764
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:16,098
and you're basically they may turn it to

1765
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:17,900
garbage especially if you start making

1766
01:18:16,099 --> 01:18:20,389
it all large-scale especially if you

1767
01:18:17,899 --> 01:18:22,189
start producing pounds of it so we've

1768
01:18:20,389 --> 01:18:23,319
got this what I want to do now is we're

1769
01:18:22,189 --> 01:18:25,848
gonna have a little sip of this water

1770
01:18:23,319 --> 01:18:28,308
we're going to take this inside and

1771
01:18:25,849 --> 01:18:31,400
we're gonna I guess we can break it up

1772
01:18:28,309 --> 01:18:33,170
into cardboard and that'll start the

1773
01:18:31,399 --> 01:18:34,638
drying process we'll probably leave it

1774
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:38,000
on the cardboard for two to three days

1775
01:18:34,639 --> 01:18:41,538
you know although tonight in the next 20

1776

to 30 minutes I will hand press a piece

1777
01:18:41,538 --> 01:18:46,279
India style and I will get as much of

1778
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:47,840

hotels in downtown Kingston I guess it

1844

was up this way and it's sort of with a

1845
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:43,520
nicer houses already drive up the

1846
01:22:41,369 --> 01:22:43,519

1847
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:51,960

little bit probably hear us a little

1849
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,039
better if we don't have that going on

1850
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:57,869
so and Johnny I came up here to do a

01:22:56,039 --> 01:23:01,350
little bit of video editing we puffed a

1852
01:22:57,869 --> 01:23:03,979
few bowls out of the kit man that's

1853

he found it I thought I spilt it even

1855

though I didn't see anything new but

1856
01:23:16,779 --> 01:23:22,759
yeah we have one screen so we can't

1857
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:24,769
really mess around with it in the way

1858
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:26,090
using it would be fairly detrimental we

1859
01:23:24,769 --> 01:23:28,400
do have the mothership in the D mail

1860
