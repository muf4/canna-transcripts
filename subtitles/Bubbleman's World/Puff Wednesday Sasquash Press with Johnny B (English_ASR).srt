Johnny Johnny B came by today we're

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,000
going to do a quick sasquash press we

18
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,159
found our last sasquash video uh was

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,840
well received I think 25,000 people have

20
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:05,798
watched it so far 26 now yeah just from

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,240
a month ago so that's really cool and we

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,080
figured why don't we do that again

23
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,319
Johnny show you this like talk more

24
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,280
about it right yeah know like like like

25
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:15,438
we we have the bud which we have we have

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,118
the death Bubba here Johnny brought the

27
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,359
death Bubba so if you want to even pull

28
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,719
a butt out and show the camera up close

29
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,039
we'll do or I can do that actually

30
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,200
beautiful little little death Bubba very

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,240
dense dense nugget and uh very smelly

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,400
pretty pretty pretty nice nose on it

33
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:33,679
like I got to say it's it's got a real

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,799
nice bouquet I sto I stopped by the

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,439
death bubble Garden today just to see in

36
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:38,840
see the difference between the gavitas

37
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,639
and the regular bulbs and I showed you

38
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,040
the pictures massive we we can show them

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,519
on the video if you guys want to see the

40
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,960
difference one side you've got the

41
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:49,078
gavitas on the other side you have the

42
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,759
th000 watt regular Phil up bulbs HPS HPS

43
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:52,478
is and it's pretty substantial the

44
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,840
difference there's definitely a lot more

45
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,399
growth I'd say like 20 to 30% more

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,280
growth on the healthier you can

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,920
definitely see a difference and and it

48
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,599
comes from a lot of the stuff that we t

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,920
talk about and the videos that we go

50
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,798
with the lighting and stuff like that

51
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,079
and and now people are actually like hey

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,479
come check this out we see what you're

53
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:08,719
doing and stuff like that it's

54
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:10,959
interesting there's no doubt about it he

55
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,280
was all about the Sasquatch so he

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,319
pressed or he trimmed some of that death

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,919
Bubba over the trim bin I wish I left it

58
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,119
in a pile for you guys I didn't

59
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,518
photograph the I maybe I did I I don't

60
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,560
think I did though for some reason I got

61
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,400
to cleaning it I separated it out into a

62
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,360
few piles here we have four piles on

63
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,000
this piece of paper one which is pure

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,360
contaminant I'll show you on the screen

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,598
right now you can see there's

66
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,519
fibers and hairs in there there's uh

67
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:36,518
pieces of plant matter and things that

68
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,120
are not even really I don't even know

69
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:39,400
what they are little heads in there and

70
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,439
there is some little heads in there as

71
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,120
well as capitate stocks and cyth hairs

72
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,878
and then in the other two piles

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,200
basically you have one pile with a

74
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,598
higher concentration of heads and

75
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,399
another pile with maybe a higher

76
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,959
concentration of uh pistolet hairs and

77
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,959
and capitate stocks and whatnot so

78
00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:01,000
Johnny's idea was to uh rosin sasquash

79
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,519
press the the whole lot of it my idea

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,239
was like hey let's separate it out into

81
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,439
a few different piles and we'll press

82
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,000
that so I guess we have two good piles

83
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:09,439
here well it be the difference in the

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,479
color and stuff like that so this is a

85
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,479
really good taking a look at it it's

86
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:15,639
like using the 110 and the 200 and the

87
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,079
304 screens that we have with the dry St

88
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:19,598
you guys can kind of see the two big

89
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,040
piles here so this is what I think is

90
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,238
the better of the two even though this

91
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,519
is lighter we'll see what the squish

92
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,840
gives us it's going to be interesting to

93
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,680
say the least I think it's going to be

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,640
tasty yeah so what do you say which one

95
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,280
do I fill first I say we go for the one

96
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,399
that we want to smoke okay just saying

97
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,438
that's what you guys want do I heard

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,879
look at this John see this is how we

99
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:43,400
know we got some good resin that's

100
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,039
that's that's work when the dry SI picks

101
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,438
up in one single pile like that that's

102
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,919
uh that's something else that's a thumbs

103
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:51,199
up that is a thumbs up so definitely and

104
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,919
and taking a look at how this is

105
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,438
actually like I said it's and then

106
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,559
squishing the bud too so we got

107
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:58,598
different piles so it's like which ones

108
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,640
have different eaes and which one what

109
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:02,078
has you got you know more more of a

110
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,479
stone I've never really thought about

111
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,120
that no no

112
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,719
exactly use this little bag here to just

113
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,200
use this little bag to sort of get the

114
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,039
last little bit on there I know people

115
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,519
don't like us touching our resins not

116
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,798
wearing plastic rubber gloves or

117
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,918
anything right now no this is just a

118
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,560
real chill it's Christmas resin personal

119
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:26,198
Christmas resin stash so there's that

120
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,800
one if you want to kind of maybe break

121
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,360
it down and you know get the pieces to

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,918
fall down and I'll fill

123
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,360
I love how that completely came now that

124
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:36,038
is definitely a lot different from when

125
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,479
I first showed up with it and I actually

126
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:39,199
took a picture of it in my hand when I

127
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:42,038
left there and sent you a picture I was

128
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,319
like I'm on my way oh good I'm not sure

129
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:45,918
I saw that one I just saw the funny

130
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,680
picture of you showing up at my

131
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:51,560
door wow this this went into a really

132
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,600
nice little this just like it's Hardy

133
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,639
isn't it it's it's Hardy it's just it's

134
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,720
a solid you know there's resin in there

135
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,120
right there's some serious resin in here

136
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,160
like I like to like you could just take

137
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,120
out this chunk right now as in one wow

138
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,840
beautiful I love that like so you know

139
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,280
what just a little little close up

140
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,918
inside that you can see it just went

141
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,000
like right in how did that one squish up

142
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,439
really hard too this one's much much

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,519
lighter yeah much much lighter just like

144
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:21,240
I would have assumed like a talcum

145
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:23,120
powder light you know not what

146
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,600
percentage of head on say that I'm

147
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,399
guessing it was 20 20 to 30% so why

148
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,759
don't we why don't we pull out the

149
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:31,638
little scale

150
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,240
how much is the bag we well I have a

151
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,560
bunch of them here they're about 08 to a

152
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,038
gram So within range we're not going to

153
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,280
have the most accurate numbers here

154
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:44,439
because we don't have a 0 scale but yeah

155
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:47,599
this is about 08 so I can tear it

156
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:51,079
actually wow that's a solid chunk I'm

157
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,600
excited to see this resin go so this is

158
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:55,959
2.6 G this particular one right here

159
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,800
this one's I'm concerned about this is

160
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:01,079
one we all want to see right here and

161
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,560
that one's 9.2 G and that's with the

162
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:07,478
tear so this is literally 9 G of

163
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,639
dry it's as hard as a rock like feel

164
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:11,719
this one in comparison oh that's like

165
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,560
yeah I wish that's what I was trying to

166
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,039
show you guys like like here's going to

167
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,879
be the difference so this is like like

168
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,839
squishing the 304 right say with Micron

169
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,000
size cuz what when I do the 304

170
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,758
underneath your 200 mesh screen because

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,800
you can still squish that so when you

172
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,680
guys have your screens using the 200 M

173
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,199
screen underneath of that is what I get

174
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,280
this telom pattern type stuff and I've

175
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,598
be Swit

176
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,279
so it's the same at all it's just mostly

177
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:36,478
contaminant if you just get your

178
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:38,159
microscope out you won't have to guess

179
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,240
what you're looking at and that's why I

180
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,800
always photograph the resin and uh

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,120
basically show you guys exactly what's

182
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,439
going on so do you want let's let's

183
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,800
let's show them that first and then they

184
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,279
can come wait for the Ooze we already

185
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,240
yeah we have while we were talking about

186
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:52,959
it I was showing it it's edited oh this

187
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,560
this one first you mean yeah all right

188
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,439
[ __ ] a John's got it I see what

189
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,000
you're saying I thought you wanted to

190
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,319
squish I you know what yeah I was but I

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,879
was going like you know what you're

192
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,039
going have to wait for him I'm down I'm

193
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,280
down so Johnny's sitting over there he's

194
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,240
going to operate the handle for us uh

195
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,038
I'm going to be open and close guy and

196
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,840
I'll use my ear so let to give you guys

197
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,120
an idea also because this is Hash we're

198
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,519
pressing it a little warmer we're not

199
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,478
down in the 180 we're in the

200
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,198
225 range today so that's where we're

201
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,758
going to be pressing it at so when we do

202
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,000
the button we're going to go down to 180

203
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,680
and this is Johnny B uh if you want yeah

204
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,839
sure absolutely I didn't even realize we

205
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,160
were going to squish the butt as well

206
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,560
that's awesome we're squishing

207
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,720
everything all right sish let's uh let's

208
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,720
get you squishing that

209
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,279
buddy nice he's doing it keep going keep

210
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,519
going keep going keep going now stop for

211
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,279
a second this is what we call the pre

212
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,878
squish we're going we're going to give

213
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,399
this dry sift just a 5 to 10 second pre-

214
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,319
squish get that resin kind of heated up

215
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,878
starting to liquefy and then I'll get

216
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,158
Johnny to bring it down so the plates

217
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,319
are almost touching that's a 10 second

218
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:01,120
give it a go

219
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:03,759
Johnny maybe 10 more like one two three

220
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,720
four more a little more see last time I

221
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,919
squished it too too quick and and I

222
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,280
burst the bag and so I'm I'm I'm

223
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:11,549
learning cuz this you want to give it

224
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:14,649
another couple of

225
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,649
[Music]

226
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,720
Clips I can hear it now she's coming out

227
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,158
she's flowing so really up to you it's

228
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,240
your resin how long you want to leave it

229
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:27,199
on for a 10 a 20 a 30 second 30 is a lot

230
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,800
at this temperature but

231
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,840
uh yeah I think the next one I can see

232
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,680
the resin coming out now you want to

233
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:39,990
give it a little crack and we'll open it

234
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:41,759
up and see what's going on 16 17 18 19

235
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,879
[Music]

236
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,799
20 all right this looks pretty good

237
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:48,720
Johnny B there you go like for what it

238
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,838
is you want to grab that right out the

239
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,519
middle [ __ ] it smells amazing put your

240
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,120
nose in there oh

241
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,759
my so that was the that was mostly

242
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,120
contaminant what we just squished out

243
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,600
there guys stuff that I have thrown away

244
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,440
so many times I can't even tell you like

245
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,159
I got a pile of it and the smell is

246
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,040
incredible it looks like it's pretty

247
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:12,639
decent quality so I guess um put that

248
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,639
right together that's how I normally put

249
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,720
it right together sure get it all on one

250
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:21,879
side all on one side and uh I think with

251
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,720
that now for me I know I used to leave

252
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,679
it and I used to peel off right away it

253
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,320
be hard to take off the parchment but I

254
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,799
watch how you when we're like cooling it

255
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,399
want to do it right away yeah was like

256
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:33,159
we can probably pretty much get that off

257
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,278
right away and I know he you guys see

258
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:37,120
this but as you pull off really quickly

259
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,399
it ends up mostly all on the one side

260
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,360
and you can actually fold the parchment

261
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,278
again and together again but I think is

262
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,519
that it's not it's not breakable is it

263
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:48,320
it's not like a shy type product is it

264
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:53,000
right now well let's see real quick it's

265
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:56,320
not it's not that is a thumbs up that is

266
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,759
awesome that is a beautiful beautiful

267
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,760
beautiful oh W is she so

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:22,278

274
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,278
literally attracted to my check thisit

275
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,000
out okay that's pretty cool this is so

276
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,559
cool that is so cool [ __ ] I just want to

277
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,278
turn it sideways and show it to them but

278
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,039
it's like the stat itic energy doesn't

279
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,399
want to let me yeah let me pull it over

280
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:36,719
with my don't you touch it

281
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,360
oh okay let's go okay let's okay let's

282
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,680
put that back that's pretty cool dude

283
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,278
that that was pretty cool I was like so

284
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,799
that was a great temperature um I like

285
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,240
how that pulled together and that's not

286
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,439
like the shaty that I was scared them so

287
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,360
I always figure with a too hot a

288
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,760
temperature too long of a press I always

289
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,959
thought that was making my stuff turn

290
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,679
into like a shaty type Ros in that I

291
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,039
didn't really like well I'll tell you

292
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,679
one thing I like the idea of just I

293
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,480
thought it's older rosin that's what it

294
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,799
is and this is more more of a fresher

295
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,759
triform cuz it just came right out of

296
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,519
the trim B we're like like today I like

297
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,639
the idea of getting it off the parchment

298
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,839
without much work like pulling out off

299
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:14,519
was so sweet look at that yeah and this

300
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,360
is just uh you know your first uh what I

301
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:22,078
would call really like the worst grade

302
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,079
of the dry and here you go buddy okay so

303
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,078
we're going to get that dab right now

304
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,838
this will be the

305
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:32,000
dab we got to get that big that big bowl

306
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:34,880
that we their own house huge

307
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,799

308
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:41,439
again a beautiful gift from the people

309
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:43,719

310
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,680
are like pre-folded ones we're not going

311
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,680
to be pre-folding them but we are going

312
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:51,759
to be using them as nice big pieces of

313
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,278
fresh parchment to lay down that rosin

314
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,000
on top

315
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,879
of

316

God okay now here's the good one we got

317
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:00,720
to weigh one of these out we'll take

318
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,919
tear this right

319

exactly what just happened here cuz I'm

322
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,200
really yeah let's let's let's good call

323
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,919
John hey you guys want to know right yep

324
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,440
they

325
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:18,078
do all right so that's

326
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,399
1.2 is that okay there you go here we go

327
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:20,719
here's the test so what was the

328
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,198
beginning stage of these numbers you

329
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,839
would

330
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:27,479
remember I don't know if I do but let me

331
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,399
just think for one second it was 9.2

332
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,959
which was the good 2. seven I think I

333
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,000
might have said 2.6 but I'm pretty sure

334
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:36,399
it was

335
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,720
2.7 uh the weight of material that you

336
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,198
put in there you go and so this which we

337
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:47,199
can weigh as well so this

338
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:52,359
is is about a gram so you got 1 gram of

339
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:54,039
rosin from 2.7 G of contaminant so this

340
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,720
is

341
00:12:54,039 --> 00:13:00,799
2 2.3 now and it

342
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,160
weighed 2.

343
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,958
S 3 points yeah it's you got a gram of

344
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,278
rosin from basically like less than

345
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:12,239
three grams of contaminant so so that's

346
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,078
pretty good John that's but this one I'm

347
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,879
really looking forward to all right so

348
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:19,759
we've cut a nice big piece of parchment

349
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:23,720
here we've got the 9.2 G of dry sift

350
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:26,240
packed up and the unit is

351
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,360
open so really just a matter of getting

352
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,079
that in

353
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,159
there proper

354
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:35,039
I guess want to grab a magnet on that

355
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:37,759
side Johnny B no

356
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:42,039
problem just magnet it

357
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,039
up actually let's pull it up a little

358
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:49,000
higher all right

359
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,600
so I think uh you want to give it a go

360
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,360
there Johnny

361
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,360
B give it a little pre-

362
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,040
squish you can see the plates on the

363
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:01,039
side h

364
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,369
[Music]

365
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,360
going

366
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,799
going we're excited here all right I

367
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,799
think that's a good pre- squish uh pre-

368
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,039
squish spot let's leave that there for

369
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:19,719
maybe 5

370
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,360
seconds and uh we should zoom them in

371
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,920
are you excited give them a zoom give

372
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,879
them a zoom maybe when it starts

373
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,039
squishing okay let's not jump the gun

374
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,399
just yet I'm really excited he's

375
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,919
stoked all right let's let's do it

376
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:37,519
Johnny B you want to go let's squish

377
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,519
this blow it out nice and nice and

378
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,120
slow

379

going hear

380
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,879
it just little

381
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,040
distance what

382
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,519

383
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,120

to blow it out that's the most important

389
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,000
thing when you do when you're at this

390
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,920
point to not blow it out when you have

391
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,879
that beautiful color that just dripping

B that's a

421
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,160
photo Let's

422
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,919
uh let's find out what you got

423
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,640
buddy

424
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,720
so let's find out yeah you want to see

425
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,919
the differences in colors between what

426
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,079
was considered commercial versus what

427
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,480
was

428
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,279
considered so when you get rosin like

429
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,960
this now you know what you're

430
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,639
buying it's true right right and this is

431
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,319
a great way of taking a look at it a lot

432
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,280
of people are feel like oh it's really

433
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,079
killer it is nice it's not bad it's not

434
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,440
but but that's that's what that's what

435
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:48,439
they're keeping away

436
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,319
from you want to guess on some amounts

437
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,549
I'm going to I'm just by looking at that

438
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,158
I'm going to say

439
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:59,918
[Music]

440
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,120
6.4 I'll tell you Johnny I think it

441
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:06,919
could even be

442
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:09,719
more let's see oh a little bit less 5.3

443
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,720
Gams of beautifulness here I'll give you

444
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:16,360
the

445
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:20,000
camera all right so 5.2 gam Johnny with

446
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,000
a very close guess at six

447
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,798
grams just give you the

448
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,480
absolute I think all that's really left

449
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,559
to do John

450
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,759
is for us to have a little bowl I think

451
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:36,158
that has to happen all right so I've

452
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,679
just put it in between two sheets here

453
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,480
and I'm just letting the the heat plates

454
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:44,038
heated up ever so gently like 5 Seconds

455
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,720
at a time getting it a little bit warmer

456
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:48,440
and then just off camera here I have my

457
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,038
denail manual press you're going to be

458
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,640
able to hear it when I close it it's not

459
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:54,599
plugged in at

460
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,120
all but it press it does a nice job

461
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:59,558
though don't you think Johnny of like

462
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:02,798
squeezing out the uh Patty

463
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:06,359
it it's like an awesome

464
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,359
job so here we

465
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:15,159
go I just like this I just got a little

466
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:18,038
chili straight buttery goodness oh wow

467
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:21,440
look at that rosin Johnny bee so this is

468
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:23,400
so thick it's got the 710 parchment

469
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,720
perfectly embedded into the middle of it

470
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:31,400
look at that piece of rosin dude oh

471
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:34,360
my okay so so so we even discussed off

472
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,600
camera is is if it wasn't

473
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:39,079
cleaned that color would be in this for

474
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,759
the interruption we don't want our

475
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,439
plates to cool down that's why I got

476
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:45,038
quiet but you're 100% right what John

477
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,440
was saying was this

478
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:48,640
color would have ended up in there and

479
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,200
that's why you get that color you would

480
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,880
have lost that light light color now

481
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,480
there was a trick you know I did run

482
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,480
these um you know we separated out the

483
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,400
gland head so that's going to always I

484
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,038
want you to understand if you've got the

485
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,720
ability to make rosin putting all your

the

619
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:32,678
line because this is definitely some

620
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,880
really really really superior quality

621
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:36,120
resin The Taste on that is unbelievable

622
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,559
I mean I know we're always saying this

623
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,119
we're always like this is so good this

624
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:43,000
tasted but it

625
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:45,599
does I mean that tastes

626
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,240
like I'll be interesting it'll be

627
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,439
interesting to see if the flower rosin

628
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,200
can compete with that that's why I have

629
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,320
to that's why I have to switch it you

630
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,360
know what I mean it's

631
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:59,918
like well let's do it let's squish it

632
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:02,959
out Johnny come down

633
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,919
I'm down for squishing with you we're

634
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,200
down what do you think of this Tech of

635
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,799
cleaning the bangers I I really I really

636
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,120
like that cuz someone recently was

637
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,200
putting water in it I couldn't believe

638
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:14,918
it now that you have that and I'm seeing

639
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,600
the hot you know basically liquid going

640
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,360
into a hot Banger and it's coming up

641
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:19,918
perfectly clean yeah it's mostly water

642
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:22,278
with a little coconut extract a little

643
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,000
sugar cane extract extract a little

644
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:27,079
caranga oil it's really like if you left

645
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,679
it open in the container I'm sure that

646
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:30,759
it would evaporate like probably

647
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,720
overnight once again it's it's a

648
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:34,240
concoction of a different formulas that

649
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,000
they've came up with that works well

650
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,359
it's kind of very similar to this rosin

651
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,640
thing that we're using you know people

652
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:43,278
aren't really giving as much credit to

653
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,559
the steam the the water that's that's in

654
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:48,079
the herb and in the hash because isn't

655
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:50,440
that really what's turning to a steam

656
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,240
and acting as a steam distillation and

657
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,960
carrying the resin with it I I think

658
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,440
that's a lot of what's going on when we

659
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,840
press rosin that's why I saw the

660
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,440
difference when I was pressing rosin

661
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,038
that was really really dry I mean

662
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,558
pressing but that was really dry and

663
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,079
then using the Bowa at that 62% made it

664
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:06,839
different yeah well you got have that

665
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:10,240
moisture all of a sudden I'm getting

666
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:12,319
just better resin more returns as well

667
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,399
so why don't we Johnny B and I will

668
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,480
prepare you want to pull that bag of

669
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:18,359
butt out right now so this is the death

670
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,200
Bubba he's got the Bova pack in there

671
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:22,199
show them the whole bag this is the bag

672
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,120
right

673
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,240
here all right so we are just preparing

674
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:30,199
the ra uh sasquash um press where

675
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,278
lowering the temperature down to 200 or

676
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,720
190 whatever John wants to prefer and uh

677
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,759
we're going to press out this butt he's

678
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,159
got about 10 or 11 Gams or something and

679
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,640
up did did you want to yeah yeah we can

680
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,080
wait up no problem but did you want to

681
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,000
like kind of break it down a little bit

682
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:48,798
and put it into the bags and do a big

683
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,960
bag squish or did you want to do these

684
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:53,918
as like just Bud squishes and clean the

685
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,840
Speckles out how did you want to do it

686
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,360
you know what we're down to 190 now so

687
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:06,158
we're getting to a lower temp that's

688
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:10,079
cool 924 perfect L why l y l y all right

689
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,519
so D D D D

690
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,879
D there we go presses are going to cool

691
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,000
down over the course of the next little

692
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:21,760
bit and uh yeah I guess we'll prepare

693
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,759
this nugget so uh time to prepare the

694
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,278
Nugget everything stra here everything

695
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,399
is perfectly set up here so you know

696
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:29,640
we're going to weigh this out for you

697
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:33,239
guys so that's one G was an eighth now

698
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,240
we're at 6.3 for three

699
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,640
G we're at

700
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:42,278
7.1 there's a quarter you want to do a

701
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,240
quarter squish a quarter we're going to

702
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:49,079
squish a quarter no wait we did 10 G of

703
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:52,960
that what was the last 9.2 G of the last

704
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:56,678
did we even weigh that no we didn't did

705
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,759
we we had to have we did we must have

706
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:01,880
five points St play yeah yeah it's like

707
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:04,440
come on it was five yeah it was 5.2

708
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,399
you're right it was 5.2 which is good

709
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,679
that was that was 50 that was over a 50%

710
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:12,518
return what we so now we're at

711
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,880
8.7

712
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:18,798
8.7 9.6 and what did we start with this

713
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,880
product was and the hash was uh 9.2 n

714
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:24,960
there you go so you want to do a 9.6

715
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:28,159
squish to a 9.2 squish okay so one tip

716
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,840
that uh Phil gave me was that you know

717
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,799
you can put the buds in almost as buds

718
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:34,398
but he said to kind of and maybe he said

719
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:35,558
it for hash as well was to make sure

720
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:39,000
that the

721
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:40,240
corners had material in them yeah you

722
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,798
know what I mean so that the corners

723
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,839
aren't empty if you put in just a bunch

724
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:47,278
of big

725
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:49,879
buds the corners can end up getting

726
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,000
pockets and of the screen basically is

727
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,360
what I'm talking about I say you know

728
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,839
what let's take the stock on just of a

729
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,719
few buds you don't have to do it to many

730
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:58,278
of them for sure not well we definitely

731
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,079
don't need this big piece of stock it's

732
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:04,119
covered in resin we'll just press it

733
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:07,000
right out it's actually pretty amazing

734
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:09,558
it smells really nice so yeah just to

735
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,880
make sure that these Corners right get

736
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:15,519
filled with a couple of uh tinier

737
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,919
remnants of cannabis then uh then we can

738
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:22,038
go in with the rest here's some smaller

739
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:25,600
pie we got a nice squish going

740
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:27,558
on and get a nice squish going on super

741
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:30,240
chill always happy to squish some buds

742
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:32,480
with you guys hear that snap hear that

743
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,000
crack oh yeah it's got a good uh perfect

744
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,480
cure proper cure proper cure it's been

745
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,480
in my drawer for a week or two at

746
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:46,319
least and I didn't open it a single time

747
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:48,240
of course she didn't oh

748
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:49,398
interest did you leave that butt here

749
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,240
like yeah remember we talked about this

750
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:54,119
last week oh yeah this is this is pretty

751
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,638
sweet it's like marshmallow give it a

752
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:57,479
give it like a squeeze it's pretty

753
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:59,959
impressive like it's almost like the

754
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,798
hatch yeah it is like it's dense like oh

755
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,200
wow that's just like yeah I'll give it a

756
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,558
prepress on the dmail here you go I

757
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,000
always do although you know what we

758
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:09,798
don't have to maybe we'll just uh we've

759
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,759
got this cooling down I should probably

760
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:14,359
open this a little bit and let that heat

761
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,038
dissipate now would you put like another

762
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:18,439
bag over this way no no no I would

763
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:21,038
squish this just as it is exactly like

764
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,000
this this is great as long as these

765
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:26,599
Corners are full that's kind of like the

766
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,278
main you know to not let these Corners

767
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:31,678
makes sense fill up with an empty spots

768
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,839
cuz otherwise the oil will sit there and

769
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,278
pocket so God that smells so nice I

770
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:40,439
think this is going to be a pretty nice

771
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:41,599
squish I'm looking forward to it so uh

772
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,120
yeah we're just going to wait for this

773
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,759
to get brought down to temperature and

774
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:48,239
then we'll squish all right guys so we

775
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:51,000
managed to get the Cannabis all

776
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,679
prepared very nice and dense as we said

777
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,798
earlier so we got a nice piece of

778
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,000
parchment set up plates are down to

779
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:58,679
about

780
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,839
193 so we're pretty much at that 190

781
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,278
that we're going to go for we're not

782
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:05,519
sure if we're going to do a 40c a minute

783
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,319
30 seconds a minute 15 just talking

784
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,519
about that we'll test it out we we just

785
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:10,558
talked about the temperature and the

786
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,759
press and the buttering out and and what

787
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:13,158
we're looking at and the type of

788
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,839
products that if you were higher

789
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:17,679
temperature shorter press would be more

790
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:19,480
of a shy type snap on P yeah um so these

791
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,159
are little things that I paid attention

792
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,038
Ian I'm just been using a hair

793
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,919
straighten yeah so a higher temperature

794
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:27,440
I'm I'm I'm seeing just different ways

795
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,480
of being able to actually use a machine

796
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,798
like which I will be getting that

797
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,000
shortly oh here close the plates right

798
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:37,440
up cuz I

799
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,038
that I bet you that will actually give

800
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,200
us the lower temperature that we're

801
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:42,319
looking for that's why I kept that

802
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,759
little space just we were cooling it

803
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,480
down I wanted to cool it down and the

804
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:48,200
top plate on the V1 uh sasquash Rosen

805
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,000
press of course is not heated only the

806
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,480
bottom plate is heated the top plate

807
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,079
Heats by pushing it up against the

808
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:57,919
bottom plate the V2 which I have coming

809
00:32:54,079 --> 00:33:00,359
here um probably in the new year uh it

810
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,000
is heated on both sides and it's pretty

811
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:03,359
excited to have that unit come into town

812
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,638
we'll be I'm sure we'll be squishing

813
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,479
some stuff on puff

814
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:10,158
Wednesdays yeah look we're getting a

815
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,480
nice drop we're down to 191 right now

816
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,880
and I bet you it's even going to be a

817
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,960
little lower I don't mind it being a

818
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,960
little lower if you

819
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,880
don't I'm new at the Sasquatch press and

820
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,679
you know what right now I'm learning and

821
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:26,200
once I get the new Sasquatches probably

822
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,080
will be picking one up since I do squish

823
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,880
I got to get away from the hair

824
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,599
straightener you're a mad squisher dude

825
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,720
I'm so surprised you don't have one to

826
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:35,759
be honest I just you squish more you

827
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,159
squish more than most people but it's

828
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:38,480
what works for me it's it's what's

829
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:41,039
helping me for what I'm going through

830
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,740
and stuff like that little magnets oh

831
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,200
the magnets I just saw

832
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,519
[Music]

833
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,798
them all right so Johnny and I have been

834
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:50,880
off camera laughing uh about not being

835
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:53,240
able to find the magnets that we used

836
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,679
earlier we are completely baffled as to

837
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,880
what happened to the magnets we can't

838
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:59,480
find them anywhere not in our pockets

839
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,720
not stuck in on all the metal components

840
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,919
that are nearby and around us the chairs

841
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,600
the tables we didn't even leave the room

842
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,440
nothing it's it's um anyway the the

843
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:13,000
rosin is wonderful obviously it's gotten

844
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,280
us elevated to the point where uh we've

845
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,039
lost the magnets but that's okay because

846
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,800
we have the herb [ __ ] the magnets let's

847
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:23,838
crack this baby open Johnny be I'm

848
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,440
pretty excited about this guys 189

849
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:29,480
so 189 what do we got we got our

850
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,960
pressure still we here oh 60 we'll we'll

851
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,199
we'll raise the PSI um I've always been

852
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,440
told by soil grown to keep my uh what is

853
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:40,158
it a 15g DeWalt air compressor at around

854
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,440
80 psi it's lowered to 60 so I'm going

855
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,159
to merely go and raise that and we'll

856
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,599
get right back to this so that was quick

857
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:49,280
and easy we got that done we're going to

858
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,200
go in here with the big

859
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,560
squish what was that N 9 point something

860
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:56,559
grams keep your fingers off of that for

861
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:59,000
a second thank you I just want to push

862
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,400
make sure that I don't s well you know

863
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,159
it's always a good idea to make sure

864
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,400
your your fingers don't get squished in

865
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,319
this process because let's be honest

866
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,760
we're squishing hash we're squishing bud

867
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,320
but we are certainly not squishing

868
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,320
fingers all right Johnny

869
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:22,039
B no magnets so we can't keep this up

870
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:25,039
the way we had earlier but uh

871
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:28,360
yeah are we hearing anything no the

872
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:35,159
plates aren't together yet

873
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:36,519
[Music]

874
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:39,078
let's see what happens this is the

875
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:40,280
exciting part of making rosin sometimes

876
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,480
sometimes you feel like you really know

877
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,680
what's going on other times I have no

878
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,519
idea what's going on it's always a

879
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:49,199
learning experience for me by no means

880
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:51,800
do I pretend to be a expert at squishing

881
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:54,039
uh buds much more comfortable with the

882
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,160
squishing of the hash I've done you know

883
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:58,159
some pounds of hash at this point but

884
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:02,639
I've only really done a very short

885
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:03,879
amount of F that uh 183 183 is great

886
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,719
yeah so I mean we can leave it a little

887
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,599
bit

888
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:12,559
longer some people go as low as 130 and

889
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:12,559
140 um yeah

890
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:20,160
yeah definitely different from the

891
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:20,159
hash interesting though isn't

892
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,240
it f cing open it

893
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,730
up p

894
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:30,729
[Music]

895
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,920
all right I I can tell already it's cake

896
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,760
batter pull that out you see the quality

897
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:45,440
there Johnny

898
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,440
wow wow

899
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:50,199
right and obviously we're not going to

900
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,838
get returns like the flow uh like the

901
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:54,559
bud or the hash I should say but I bet

902
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:56,279
you there's still a couple of grams of

903
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,400
uh raos in

904
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,800
here with

905
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,720
uh well if it was 1.6 I think it's we'd

906
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,440
be at 20% so did you want me to collect

907
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:06,439
it real quick

908
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:17,920
yes thought was that Max

909
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,039
that so that's uh that's our squish guys

910
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,559
and I can even see in the corners you

911
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:25,559
can see how it's collected what they

912
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:27,920
talking about make sure you get it in

913
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:30,159
the corners cuz this is definitely you

914
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,119
can feel how it's like caked around the

915
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:34,639
edges here so I think would be a little

916
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:37,039
bit easier to bring

917
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,960
up so I'm going to do the quick uh get

918
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:42,960
it onto both sides there you

919
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,960
go

920
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:48,679
surface no it's not going to do that she

921
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:54,200
says I'm going to stand on one but now I

922
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:54,199
can tell I can pull it off in nice large

923
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:00,599
pieces there you go so definitely the

924
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:02,639
same type of color HH oh it's completely

925
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:06,640
light light beautiful I'm very

926
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:10,000
interested in almost a blind taste test

927
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:12,960
of hitting these and seeing if we can

928
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,800
tell which one is the flower rosin and

929
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,679
which one is the dry Rin cuz taste Wise

930
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:22,318
It's like damn near or sorry smell wise

931
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:24,159
they are very very close yeah they are

932
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:25,838
quite similar I mean this is what I

933
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,159
expected this one to smell like I

934
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:31,799
expected this one to smell like uh

935
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:35,078
uh obviously flower rosin

936
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,079
but all

937
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,440
right off there so yeah nice little

938
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,440
little pile of flower rosin right there

939
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,400
we're going to weigh out in a second on

940
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,240
the scale and see what we got so we've

941
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:53,240
just thrown that herb in for a second

942
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:55,279
batch we got 1.2 G of once again just

943
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:59,039
beautiful cake

944
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,480
batter buttery rod and goodness so that

945
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:06,318
turned out rather nice if you want to

946
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:08,800
see it next to the dry sift wow um oops

947
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:10,279
just gently tapped my finger in there

948
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,920
you can see the difference of the colors

949
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,760
right there this is a much more uh lower

950
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,480
temp that we hit it at this was the 180

951
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,000
and this was a 225 so probably that

952
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,800
little bit of dark color in there is

953
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,639
from that extra temperature so we'll let

954
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,599
you know how they

955
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,118
smoke all right you want to crack this

956
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:31,119
open our second B

957
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:31,119
P

958
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,880
yeah see if you got anything

959
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,839
nice little bit little bit even got a

960
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,318
little blow yeah I don't see too much

961
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:50,078
herb though yeah no herb so otherwise

962
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:52,639
else I think that was successful that's

963
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,280
the second switch so uh what is

964
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:56,679
worthwhile doing the second s think

965
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,040
might be able to half round what's that

966
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:59,480
might be a half

967
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:01,519
I think there's probably about a half

968
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,000
gram here and you'll get that 1.7 and

969
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:07,039
it'll be about 20% that you yield it so

970
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,358
it's nice to have the glass Dabber from

971
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,639
rure definitely don't feel overly

972
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,440
comfortable sticking the titanium Dabber

973
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:16,719
into the mega pot it's uh I mean I can

974
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,960
do it with a gentle twist but you sure

975
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:20,719
don't want people sticking it in there

976
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:23,079
and scraping it around on the quartz and

977
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:25,759
on the actual uh carving that's in the

978
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:27,640
quartz so would you like to go first

979
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,839
Johnny B I love how it says mother ship

980
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:32,519
right across there here actually you

981
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:33,838
know what you take what you want I'm

982
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:35,440
just admiring the glass where it says

983
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:38,679
mother ship right across there that's

984
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:42,039
nice and I will fire this up for

985
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:42,039
you oh

986
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:52,719
my this is like a glue [ __ ] super

987
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,720
glue so

988
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,800
nice that that is

989
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,559
I it's it's so to get up off it's

990
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,160
definitely not Snapp and pull no it's

991
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,639
not at all

992
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:08,920
no I like even try and push that on a

993
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:11,159
higher temperature and see what the

994
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,559
result would be I'm just curious you've

995
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:14,799
done it before I haven't so yeah I'd

996
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:16,358
play around with the different

997
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,880
temperatures looks like our torch is

998
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:22,759
running out of fuel here as I quartz as

999
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:26,119
I torch Johnny's

1000
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,880
arm no no torching Johnny's arm don't

1001
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:31,599
torch the arm don't touch the arm

1002
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,280
man all right

1003
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:37,760
so excellent very nice very nice good

1004
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,680
puff Wednesday I like that yes good puff

1005
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,560
Wednesday we've uh squished a little dry

1006
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:44,519
sift uh I cleaned a little dry sift pre

1007
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,519
to squishing I photographed a little dry

1008
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:49,119
sift we smoked a little dry sift smoked

1009
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:52,318
some rosin this is good this is good I

1010
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:55,960
got about 30 cents on the timer left and

1011
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:57,880
I will try this extremely very low temp

1012
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,639
I wouldn't say overly long long press I

1013
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,680
mean they would know I didn't time it I

1014
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:03,239
thought about 60 seconds it seemed like

1015
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,838
it was probably around a minute so yeah

1016
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:06,479
it's about a 60 seconds press and I've

1017
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:08,078
never pressed that long so I really you

1018
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,440
know for me it was kind of some good

1019
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,079
experience and then seeing what we got

1020
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,358
out of this so really good learning

1021
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:14,079
experience from a guy that just use a

1022
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:15,318
hair straightener all the time and you

1023
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,359
know it's just there's a difference in

1024
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:19,480
price ranges on what people can uh

1025
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,440
actually obtain now that we got the

1026
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:25,000
machine that

1027
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:28,318
works dabs away with this guy here

1028
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,920
definitely I mean I can see the sizzle

1029
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:32,440
in there how clear that is definitely

1030
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,200
represents the same color of what's

1031
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,200
sitting here right

1032
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,480
now

1033
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:50,800
beautiful very nice

1034
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,318
indeed really low temp just

1035
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,280
puddled just absorbs into the Q-tip when

1036
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:01,279
it's like that it's really

1037
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:09,519
nice oh man that was really nice and

1038
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,280
tasty you know it tasted just like the

1039
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:15,239
bud obviously which is what you want it

1040
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,720
did taste a little bit a little bit

1041
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:19,799
lighter than the hash

1042
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:21,118
rosin which makes sense to me I'll have

1043
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,240
to have another hit of the hash rosin to

1044
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:27,318
be 100% sure but okay there was uh a

1045
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:30,598
little bit of a lightness to it it's a

1046
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:30,599
good thing to know too right

1047
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:36,480
so I'm just getting this thing clean on

1048
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,680
the religious

1049
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,960
style and if you clean your courts

1050
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:45,358
religiously throw a comment up in the

1051
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,960
comment section let me know how it goes

1052
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,318
for you let me know how you like to

1053
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,440
clean yours I'm telling you I have yet

1054
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:56,039
to see anything as effective as this for

1055
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:59,119
both the outside and the inside of the

1056
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:01,199
Banger it's just really quite a good

1057
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,240
little solution pretty much got to get

1058
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:04,399
myself a bottle and most important for

1059
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:05,639
me obviously is that I don't want to

1060
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,240
smell it I don't want to taste it I

1061
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:10,598
don't want to have a flavor of it in any

1062
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:13,078
way shape or form and I don't so that's

1063
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:15,359
good this one's for

1064
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,880
you you got yourself I'm just like

1065

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:27,039
and I wanted to make sure the

1068
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,039
bowl was clean for Johnny B

1073
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,719
Sammi Hagar back in those days it was

1074
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:51,919

back in the 80s that's another that's

1080

rosin and give his impression on what he

1083
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:15,799
thinks about it as we get here quickly

00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:19,759
bowl like get a that was a really close

1125
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,519
to like burned but because of the

1126
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,319
cleaner I knew I'm just worried myself I

1127
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:26,199
would have ruined this bowl a long time

1128
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:28,599
ago had I had it because I just didn't

1129
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:30,719
really I'd watch my buddy row and some

1130
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:32,280
other people you know take care of their

1131
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:37,318
quartz and clean it and I was just like

1132
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:39,359
[ __ ] I do not think I have that

1133
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:41,679
ability because this is quite a bit to

1134
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:45,279
do to clean you know I mean [ __ ] I'm

1135
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:49,078
getting invested here with qtips and

1136
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:52,040
whatnot well QP stock just went Q-tip

1137
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:54,318
stock one went up there the parment you

1138
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:56,679
know now now it's the Q-tip Department

1139
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:58,440
all these little things that we can use

1140
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:00,679
and and uh definitely stoked on this

1141
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,559
cleaning solution it's just uh it only

1142
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:05,118
really works in the heat that's that's

1143
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:07,720
how it's beneficial where you get this

1144
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:11,400
real sort of hot quartz and you drip it

1145
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:13,439
into there that was incredible John like

1146
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,800
you saw what that looked like right yeah

1147
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,679
no no it was it that's it was it was

1148
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,240
just in like where did we get it yeah

1149
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:22,318
well we get it from uh Dark Crystal

1150

1151
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:25,800
guy that does the quartz bangers and

1152
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,358
he's out in Ontario Mick I believe is

1153

Rosen R I'm I'm just really so Stone

1163
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,319
sitting here and I'm looking at the

glass cleaner I'm like you know what

1165

this is it was it was quite really an

1167
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:58,279
experience being able to see the

1168
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,079
difference in how we did the bud with

1169
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,000
the hash and everything and the flavors

1170
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,480
and and and really just see even the

1171
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
separation when you did that it's yeah

1172
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,519
it's really good to see this it's really

1173
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,358
good to uh really uh like Merry

1174
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:11,920
Christmas I also enjoyed it Merry

1175
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:13,920
Christmas puff Wednesday I very much

1176
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,318
enjoyed watching the rosin press out the

1177
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,798
first stuff that came out that was

1178
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:20,119
beautiful darker but still very very

1179
00:49:17,798 --> 00:49:22,559
lovely uh and then you know getting this

1180
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:25,880
huge press of super buttery caked out

1181
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,359
dry sift rosin batter and then going to

1182
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,798
the bud and getting getting this even

1183
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:31,838
lighter like it's almost like clay or

1184
00:49:29,798 --> 00:49:33,400
something yeah it's like clay completely

1185
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:34,838
insane yeah this is insane at least this

1186
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,358
can come off so this one we can kind of

1187
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:39,078
put away for now over here and this is

1188
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:41,759
the one we're going to hit a dab of each

1189
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:43,480
now is that correct that's correct and

1190
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,520
did you just hit your dab so I guess

1191
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,240
I'll hit the next

1192
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:50,759
one correct I got that right right you

1193
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:52,759
just hit the last dab so yeah yeah I'm

1194
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:55,079
just remember cleaning it and being like

1195
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,720
[ __ ] that was the the most cuz I hit a

1196
00:49:55,079 --> 00:50:00,400
little at first when I saw it yeah cuz I

1197
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:01,919
torched it a lot should have went to I

1198
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,559
should have told you a minute a minute

1199
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,000
went a minute 15 seconds or I should

1200
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:07,319
have felt it with my hand I was just

1201
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,239
relying on of we're learning I was

1202
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:10,358
relying on the timer and I should have

1203
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:14,519
relied

1204
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:17,199
on the energy the energy the energy all

1205
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:17,199
right well let's do

1206
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:25,639
this looking forward to this little

1207
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:27,838
tasty rip little dry sift Rosen rip that

1208
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,759
uh give me a little idea of the

1209
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,639
differences I've had this one once I

1210
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,359
felt like the flower rosin was beautiful

1211
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:37,519
but a lighter version almost like when

1212
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:39,078
you own a 450 exe KTM and you get the t

1213
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:42,199
uh the 250

1214
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:45,480
xcfw low ratio and you're out on the

1215
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:47,118
trails and you're blasting that bra and

1216
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,480
people are like how do you like that 250

1217
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:54,599
and I'm always like well it feels a lot

1218
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:56,119
like half of my 450 so that's what I

1219
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:57,720
will say about that is this my head it's

1220
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:00,400
your head jeez I'm I about to give it to

1221
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:02,358
you I forget I'm like telling dirt bike

1222
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,358
stories there's eight people that

1223
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:08,838
enjoyed that I was like bubble man knows

1224
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:10,039
what KTMs are bubble man rides KTMs not

1225
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:11,558
only does he know are I'm going to be

1226
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:13,639
curious you're going to do this hit Then

1227
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:16,640
I then then I'm going to do mine and

1228
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:19,879
then I'm going to ask a question

1229
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:22,078
because I'm going to have to wait until

1230
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,640
I ask this questions so then you know

1231
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,720
it's like just a fair question what's

1232
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:28,960
Happening Here

1233
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:32,239
because I

1234
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,720
think this is some amazing

1235
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:37,639
flavors oh my gosh

1236
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:40,439
listen I think it's definitely by far

1237
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:42,920
listen there is absolutely no denying

1238
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:46,200
that the dry sift is way more intense on

1239
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:49,639
every level it's a thicker meteor more

1240
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:52,118
horsepower more everything it is

1241
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:55,480
absolutely a more intense version of the

1242
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:55,480
flower rosin

1243
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:05,358
that is 150% sure in my in my mind okay

1244
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,160
but you let me know what you feel right

1245
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:09,639
now as you're about to take yours and I

1246
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:12,639
saw you had just like just a nice little

1247
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:12,639
head

1248
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:19,558
yeah it's definitely

1249
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,559
uh just this amazing

1250
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:30,078
slab makes life very much that's

1251
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,760
treaty how sweet is this though hey like

1252
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,480
just clean the

1253
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,799
pipe all lovely lovely and I love

1254
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,960
there's no smell like you use other

1255
00:52:35,798 --> 00:52:38,920
cleaners and they always have some kind

1256
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,519
of a smell to them yeah there's like the

1257
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,960
lightest the odd time I'll smell a

1258
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:44,759
little bit of like an oil like a natural

1259
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,960
oil like a like you know like a coconut

1260
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:49,760
extract or

1261
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,519
something so yeah most

1262
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,480
Pleasant here it is the last hit and

1263
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:56,960
then the question that could lead to one

1264
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,119
more hit

1265
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:03,039
it usually does one leads into another

1266
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:05,440
leads into another leads into

1267
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:08,159
another let me get it prepared for you

1271
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:16,039
me to be a little bit harder to torch it

1272
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:21,200
up for

1273
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:21,199

Johnny thank you Marcus yes

1277
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:41,559
yes get you all ready got about 45

1278
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:43,480
seconds but you can do your your energy

1279
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:47,960
o That's

1280
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,960
twoo lots of energy going on right

1281
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:53,039
now well you know I see a lot of people

1282
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,519
lose the back of their hand so they can

1283
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,358
really feel the heat and they can feel

1284
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:59,719
how hot it is their hand so we can use

1285
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,318
the R I would feel the back of the hand

1286
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:02,879
is definitely the hottest I could feel

1287
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:04,400
that it's very sensitive back very very

1288
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,838
sensitive on the back of the hand it's

1289

1291
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,639
to touch it so it's

1292
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:26,769
like there well the timer says 55

1293
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:33,579

definitely dve Ron for the win

1297
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:02,719
definitely the back of the hand for the

1298
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:04,798
602 instead of the 55 that was

1299
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:07,480
beautiful could even went maybe a little

1300
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:10,159
bit longer no this this one cleaned out

1301
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:14,159
perfect the way it should the last one

1302
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:15,480
was too hot definitely last H yeah that

1303
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:17,399
one was

1304
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,920
beautiful you know what sometimes when

1305
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,838
you clean this up it froths it right up

1306
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,400
and it gets the dirt on the lip of the

1307
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:24,719
quartz you going to have this little bit

1308
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,119
of rosin sitting right here that's

1309
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:29,719
really tasty

1310
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,039
I don't know did you hit that already no

1311
00:55:29,719 --> 00:55:32,798
but we hit that when we first came in

1312
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,000
didn't we oh okay yeah yeah yeah the MK

1313
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:37,079
Ultra yeah really tasty really similar

1314
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,838
to this flavor you

1315
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:41,640
say um yeah this is I mean this is a

1316
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,599
more this is different this is Poland

1317
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:45,318
snap and this is butter this is this is

1318
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,079
more especially because this one's made

1319
00:55:45,318 --> 00:55:49,038
from hatch I find it to be much when we

1320
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:51,519
first came in before we started this

1321
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:53,799
whole process of our uh little uh

1322
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:58,038
adventure of squishing yes we did a dab

1323
00:55:53,798 --> 00:56:01,838

1326
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:11,838
cushy when you say that now this is

1327
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:13,439
amazing but that would super charge that

1328
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:14,880
to that effect that we got cuz that

1329
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,720
effect that I got in that beginning over

1330

1331
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:21,519
