be using today uh further left uh my

9
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,960

and we're super stoked to have them here

18
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,599
too so I guess uh awesome [Â __Â ] we should

19
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,280
probably start with some bowls we should

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,359
start with some Puffin yeah we'll start

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,480
with a little bowl what did you load me

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,400
up here John this looks like some of

23
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,759
your dry sift that will be some dry sift

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,680
oh yes strain um I'm I'm I'm thinking

25
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,519
that would be the I think that's uh the

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,640
headband the headband all right well

27
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:15,280
I'll take a little hit of the headband

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,320
through the Mother Ship before we get

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,320
started here I'm going to hit some

30
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:23,118
freshly

31
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:26,039

32
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:28,599
Whistler let's wear suits oh that sounds

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,479

00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:33,359
Whistler opening this

35
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,359
Saturday 2 weeks before it's supposed to

36
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,200
be opening oh yeah I think it would be

37
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,599
really fun I haven't been of course John

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,680
and I will be at the Cannabis Cup in

39
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,118
Amsterdam in about 10 days I've been

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,960
there every year for the last I don't

41
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,759
know how many years this will be the

42
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,118
first year that Whistler opened early

43
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,599
enough that I'm actually able to go for

44
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,599
opening day I'd say in about seven or

45
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:58,478
eight years so I'm all about wearing a

46
00:01:53,599 --> 00:02:00,798
suit and going to represent most

47
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,560
definitely all right so I loaded you a

48
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,240
little bit of full melt bubble hash that

49
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,840
I've been puffing on on the regular it's

50
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:09,000
a variety of

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,640
cushion uh today's really going to be

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,439
about dry sift we're going to go over um

53
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,878
I'm going to tell you kind of reiterate

54
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,800
what I've told you before in some of my

55
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,318
past articles um not so much in video uh

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,719
maybe once in the tumble Now video this

57
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,479
is really today we're working with the

58
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:26,959
4T X 2T screens these are aluminum frame

59
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:30,119
tight screens it's a set of three um

60
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,239
they come in lines per inch and so in

61
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,560
per in lines per inch the top the top

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,239
number the biggest number uh which is in

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,920
Micron say like a 200 Micron in lines

64
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,959
per inch is the opposite it'll actually

65
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,559
be a smaller number so our top screen is

66
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:47,640
110 lines per inch that's how silk is

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,920
measured uh and that's about 140 Micron

68
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,439
then as you get a higher number 200

69
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,280
lines per inch is the next one that

70
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,639
one's about a 70 Micron that's our

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,199
second screen the one that we'll do the

72
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:01,158
majority of our cleaning on and then we

73
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,878
have the 305 which which is the bottom

74
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:06,079
screen it's about a 40 Micron and it's

75
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:09,560
what we do um the last little bit of of

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,840
of filming uh of cleaning sorry so took

77
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,959
a took a little rip and uh got myself a

78
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,479
little sideways there

79
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,799
anyway so I also not only want to go

80
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,560
about how I like to teach people how to

81
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,120
clean their resin from which they've

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,560
extracted initially out of one screen

83
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,439
but then John's going to tell you guys

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,239
also about you know his method not so

85
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,719
much his method but the method he's come

86
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,280
to appre apprciate from you know working

87
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:36,280
with the screens with the screens over

88
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,598
last year I just found a um a way a

89
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,878
little gentler a lot gentler yeah just

90
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:44,399
giv a little finess and uh yeah yeah so

91
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,798
that's basically um John's going to use

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,360
a single screen and acquire his 90%

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,200
heads um I'm teaching people how to

94
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,799
acquire 70 to 80% contaminant and then

95
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,719
clean that up to 90 to 98% plus heads so

96
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,040
that's kind of they both are perfect if

97
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,519
you've got pounds of weed and you can

98
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,239
just run buds then John's uh you know

99
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,959
the way John's been doing it kind of

100
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,400
which is what I'd call a nice gentle

101
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,158
he'll show you in a little bit we'll get

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,879
into it uh little bit different and and

103
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:12,400
it's why I like to talk about it and

104
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,199
sort of get it out there that when I'm

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,879
telling people how to clean dry sift and

106
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,319
then someone like John who would never

107
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,519
do this personally cuz I know him but

108
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,238
some guys might be like oh you don't

109
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,439
have to do all that I get pure heads

110
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,959
just like this and then they come on and

111
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,199
they kind of confuse people and say oh

112
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,439
you don't got to use all those screens

113
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,439
you just need one you do it like this

114
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,079
yes if you're in a situation that a

115
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,759
you're not acquiring sift that's already

116
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,120
made B you have enough Bud that you're

117
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,120
you can just make as much as you want if

118
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,120
you're in if you're not in those

119
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,918
situations then you're in the situation

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,399
where you want to learn how to clean it

121
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:44,439
so it's counterintuitive or

122
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,038
counterproductive to have someone come

123
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:47,680
and tell someone you don't need to learn

124
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:50,240
how to clean it because wouldn't you

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,319
agree how did you learn how to extract

126
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,600
gentler by cleaning by cleaning and Ryan

127
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,918
Ryan just got a bubble box yeah Ryan

128
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,039
Ryan's learning you're feeling it a

129
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,478
little bit too the counterintuitive Pro

130
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:04,560
of well tell the story about today you

131
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,399
making your your bit hash I I had some

132
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,800
hash that I had uh free extracted and I

133
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,239
thought you know we'll just clean it up

134
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,600
real quick that's the first mistake you

135
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,478
used you used the you used um I love the

136
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,280
story though the way John the way John

137
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:18,279
told it the way you you hit it a few

138
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,318
times and you're like do you think it

139
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:21,959
melts yet and John's like no you got to

140
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,600
work it more and then so Ryan gives it

141
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,599
like four more cards and he's like wait

142
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,000
it's got to be melty now and and then I

143
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,000
laugh and said you know what it was it

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,600
was 25 after said I'm going to come back

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,120
at quter to 9 and says you'll probably

146
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,120
have like a hoot left there cuz he

147
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,879
thought he had like 10 and sure enough

148
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,639
quter to n he goes I think I think there

149
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,959
might be half a hoot left there well

150
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,439
because it's never about what's there

151
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:46,439
it's always about the Purity but then he

152
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:48,680
realized that good did M goes oh yeah

153
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,959
exactly oh yeah and and then and then

154
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,079
right away he's like right back at it

155
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,799
like you showed me you absolutely what

156
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:58,359
about Darren we got another good buddy

157
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,439
who's been absolutely representing he's

158
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,080
he couldn't get it for about 3 months

159
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,800
and it's you'll see why I keep

160
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,758
reiterating this process it does it does

161
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,280
take a while there's almost a finesse to

162
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,879
it and I'll try to get the camera very

163
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,198
close when I start doing the carding

164
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,159
work and stuff so people can really I

165
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,800
mean it sounds silly cuz it's it doesn't

166
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,400
it's not brain surgery but at the same

167
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,280
time there is so many different ways to

168
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,318
do it improperly that are

169
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,038
counterintuitive that make you do the

170
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,520
opposite of what you should really do so

171
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:29,639
uh we'll probably have a few more bong

172
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,598
rips here uh while we sit and wait for

173
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,519
for the next stage which is uh getting

174
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:35,918
some of this herb out of the bag onto

175
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,959
the

176
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,598
screen probably yeah we we're going to

177
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,198
use this herb right here for start this

178
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:43,319
this is no I

179
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,478
understand uh so basically we're going

180
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,360
to get some of this herb onto the

181
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:52,240
screen and uh John will show some of his

182
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,919
process of how he L gently bounces um

183
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,960
I'll show macro photographs of what can

184
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,240
come out of a single screen bounce when

185
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:02,318
you're gentle and then I'll also do a

186
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,918
little bit of uh a more rigorous we're

187
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,439
going to clean through here yeah we'll

188
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,758
clean we'll clean down to three you know

189
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:09,038
there's not going to be much on the 40 I

190
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,720
want to do the majority of the cleaning

191
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,199
on the 70 so that's what all right we're

192
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,319
back John's going to show us how he

193
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,800
likes

194
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:21,000
to be a little gentle when he does his

195
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,639
uh first single screen extraction rather

196
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,079
than uh you know rather than how the

197
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,800
some people are just manhandling it I

198
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,800
can smell the minute he opens this herb

199
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,759
you can smell it from like 12 ft away we

200
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,720
almost measured it's

201
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:36,479
12T coffee like smell really nice and

202
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,280
dank really you know

203
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,560
it's just great smell so so what is this

204
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,038
bud is this some headband is this some

205
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,639
um well this this is um oh we really

206
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,719
don't know what we're being told is is

207
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,400
it's a it's a SoMo diesel cross with a

208
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,199
cush all right it it's got a very cushy

209
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,439
smell very very cushy very very nice but

210
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,720
uh basically um how I uh have been able

211
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:00,519
to manage my paint control is by doing

212
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,960
this

213
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:06,878
booah booah and the best part about this

214
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:08,478
is how I do this is I just basically um

215
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,840
I'm I'm cleaning up cuz the way I trim

216
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:15,839
my weed and uh I kind

217
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:20,279
of ever so gently drop so gently and you

218
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:22,079
can already see look at that yeah hands

219
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,198
on absolutely so yeah just for moving

220
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,279
the nuggets out of the way you can

221
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,560
definitely see a lot of heads and

222
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:31,718
capitate stocks and also pistolet hairs

223
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,879
that's a lot of orange

224
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:35,360
hairs so yeah this is the first screen

225
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:38,000
it's a big screen it's going to you know

226
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,200
a lot of the good stuff is going to fall

227
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
fall right through

228
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:47,278
yeah so delicate way to get some pure

229
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,440
heads it's nice to have the hands on

230
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,159
approach feel the yeah and and now I

231
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,000
start breaking and as everybody knows I

232
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,519
slowly just kind of break these apart as

233
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,799
you can hear them snapping yeah they're

234
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:00,278
definitely dry enough how important do

235
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,439
you believe the dryness and the humidity

236
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:05,360
humidity content is to proper dry

237
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,600
sifting huge I've came across quite a

238
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,000
bit where I've actually done it right

239
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,639
right from fresh off the stock not fresh

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,078
but you know hung like for six seven

241
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,879
days and found a balance with it and had

242
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:18,159
some great medicine and called je and go

243
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,759
dude it went all [Â __Â ] gummy on me

244
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,199
right away and and it really comes down

245
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,720
to developing that trione right that's

246
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,360
that's what it is and hey you got to I

247
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,759
hang dry and then I got to cure it

248
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,720
properly and then people ask me all the

249
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:36,319
time to be dry to dry sift and I'm like

250
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,720
well the first word in dry sift is dry

251
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,399
so I know it might seem a little

252
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,160
ridiculous but truly that it it's dry

253
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,919
sift you don't really I mean you can go

254
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:46,838
different ways of using Frozen butd and

255
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,599
there's dry ice methods and whatnot but

256
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,760
it it extracts an enormous amount of

257
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,759
contaminant I like the Hands-On approach

258
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,799
to sort of the old school screens I like

259
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,600
the tumbler I love the bubble box you

260
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,479
know this this is kind of a Grower's

261
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,040
tool really you know this isn't for your

262
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,399
your guy home that smokes a couple

263
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:06,278
joints this is a tool this is a tool for

264
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,320
me getting my my perfect medicine for me

265
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:09,958
and U they work great to hang your

266
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,399
plants when you're hanging your plants

267
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,439
make sure you have these three scens

268
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,000
under your plants that's where I do this

269
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,120
absolutely why would you rubber M you

270
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,759
know those 4x8 tables I have two of

271
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,799
these set up and I hang over top and

272
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,679
that's where I do everything and

273
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,958
absolutely that's why I always have this

274
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:28,239
wicked full melt so many heads are lost

275
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:30,159
in transport and in touching and in

276
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,200
bagging and in all the these processes

277
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,799
that he's completely avoiding he's just

278
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,399
cutting them down and hanging them over

279
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,919
this screen the only way he could

280
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,799
possibly take it a step further is to

281
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,799
grow his plants with screens like this

282
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,319
just under them at all times we I

283
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,799
discussed that and you know what cool to

284
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,680
have a floor made of this there's so

285
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,399
many times that I'm walking in my garden

286
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,919
I brush up against it and I'm like check

287
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,000
this out and I bring a fresh bug we take

288
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,519
a picture he goes yeah but you knocked

289
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,120
off half it'll take like it'll take all

290
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,959
the heads off the stocks and then it'll

291
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,959
leave like three red fibers it's just

292
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,479
like a horrific like a and then you

293
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,559
really start understanding that you're

294
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,159
like wow but as you can see all of that

295
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,559
basically families are starting to come

296
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:13,480
off now everything like that and yeah

297
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:13,479
nice I just slowly do this and I do

298
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:19,599
this I I know

299
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,958
there's a lot of resin underneath here

300
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,839
right now oh there's still in what John

301
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:28,439
is doing is he's really acquiring the

302
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,600
one to two% of like the best heads on

303
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,360
these buds the ones that are the biggest

304
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,959
the most mature the most eager to

305
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,039
release those will be the ones that are

306
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,518
the easiest to isolate from the rest of

307
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,199
the chape you know the smaller

308
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,879
contaminants and the smaller heads and

309
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,399
uh it definitely is very noticeable I'm

310
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,159
sure John can attest when he first

311
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,399
brought his dry SI by and uh I cleaned

312
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,639
it up for him it was an eye opener

313
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,519
wasn't it oh that medy was so nice and

314
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,480
then I was like oh then we did that yeah

315
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,000
then we cleaned it that day and yeah I'm

316
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,959
going to insert photos uh while we're

317
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,759
doing doing this today and sort of show

318
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,159
you the process um we'll try to do

319
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,319
photos of a single screen extraction but

320
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,000
what we're going to show you for sure is

321
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,959
the process of

322
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,759
actually um the second screen what it

323
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,518
looks like when you don't um Just Bounce

324
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:21,039
pure nugget when you get like a higher

325
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,320
contaminant contaminant ratio maybe like

326
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,799
50 60 70% contaminant I want to show you

327
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,440
the photos of how it takes you know 5 to

328
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,679
10 minute increments of cing that

329
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,839
material over the second uh the 70

330
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:35,599
screen the second screen and how um it

331
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,560
how long it takes to actually get it to

332
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,480
purify before you start seeing like less

333
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,119
of these stocks and I'll show those

334
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,000
photos while we're talking about this

335
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,320
process and and you'll really see what

336
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,240
what it is we're talking about you know

337
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,199
what we're talking about is we're first

338
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,600
extracting the glandular tricomes from

339
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,719
the plant matter but the Tricom itself

340
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,519
oh it's the chainsaw guy we're going to

341
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,600
take a break right now cu the chainsaw

342
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,159
guy okay we're going to start over the

343
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,879
chainsaw guy is done okay is he done oh

344
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,278
you know what so what we're doing is

345
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,639
we're there he goes again we're going to

346
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,078
have the chainsaw guy up here a little

347
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,600
bit later on and we'll actually have a

348
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,879
puff with him he's a good guy and and

349
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,360
it's okay that he's we been waiting we

350
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,679
did wait an hour to do this video he

351
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,079
promised he'd be done at three but

352
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:20,000
that's okay we love Steve the chainsaw

353
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:23,278
guy and so what I was

354
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,039
saying is that the chainsaw is very

355
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,759
loud we're going to take a

356
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,278
break it's almost 4:20 now so what we

357
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,559
want to do do when we say we're

358
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:34,240
isolating the gland heads First We Take

359
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,198
the herb we're isolating the the

360
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,360
glandular tricomes the chainsaw the

361
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:41,359
[Â __Â ] chainsaw we're taking a

362
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,679
break all right so when we talk about

363
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,879
the chainsaw is now done we're going to

364
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,679
try this a third time when we talk about

365
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,399
isolating the tricomes from the plant

366
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:55,958
that's going to get us the glandular

367
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,720
Tricom head the capitate stock um the

368
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:01,239
cyth hair and potentially some small

369
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,800
particle of pistolet hairs or broken

370
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,240
immature heads and and so on from there

371
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,078
that's what I call a single screen

372
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,198
farmer sift from there what we want to

373
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:15,919
do is we want to isolate the the heads

374
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:15,919
just the glandular heads there's that

375
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,639
chainsaw just the glandular heads of the

376
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,359
Tricom so that's all I really wanted to

377
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:25,120
say and soon we'll have Steve the

378
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,240
chainsaw guy up here for a bowl and

379
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,360
we'll laugh about this further uh we're

380
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,600
also going to show you a closeup of how

381
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,079
I clean the resin a little bit so stay

382
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,800
tuned all right so we'll get a little

383
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:38,638
closer there just discussing see the

384
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:40,078
quality of the resin a nice white you

385
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,000
put you just put your card through there

386
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:45,319
gently you can see that it's a

387
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,120
real nice grainy nice white

388
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:52,000
color it's got the Great Sound it's very

389
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,959
Sandy this is uh not your regular stuff

390
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,039
that falls out of a uh tumbler that's

391
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,359
filled with low quality trim this is

392
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:03,480
high quality bud this is probably 90%

393
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,839
Plus Dry set so we'll be checking it out

394
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,399
with the macro lens in a near in the

395
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,360
near future yeah but you know what it's

396
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,879
it's pretty clean but let's clean it up

397
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,879
so uh we photographed it with the macro

398
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,799
lens this is really clean 90 plus per

399
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,240
heads will be overlaying these shots

400
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:22,000
right as I'm speaking and you'll see

401
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,240
them um we're still going to do uh you

402
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,839
can also feel that hear that sound and

403
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,600
feel if you were doing this it's very

404
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:32,440
gritty grainy sand likee that's a great

405
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,319
sign um you know it's just almost all

406
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,800
heads I'd be very gentle with this and

407
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:37,799
just ever so

408
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,838
gently pushing the little bit of

409
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,360
contaminant and there there is a little

410
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,480
bit of contaminant it's definitely it

411
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,318
wouldn't take long you could work resin

412
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,680
like this for a very short period of

413
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:55,159
time and come out with a a 99% pure

414
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:57,278
heads easily however uh you had a hit

415
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:59,838
didn't you John yes and it was melty and

416
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:02,439
beautiful beautiful just

417
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,480
potent as racy you said it it was it's

418
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,440
beautiful yeah well I'm already I

419
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,959
already actually did it this

420
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:14,000
morning so because I have um the first

421
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,838
part of it that's it right there that's

422
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,480
what you did this morning yeah the color

423
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:20,399
so so that is actually um under the the

424
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,360
bottom

425
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,919
screen excellent and uh what I didn't do

426
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,120
is I didn't Harvest to the 70s so this

427
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,159
is just a different method that we've

428
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,318
done today which uh yeah so this is is

429
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:34,159
the one screen below with all of that in

430
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:36,120
there and I've clean this a little bit

431
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,519
well this just came out superb

432
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,959
completely different you know literally

433
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,560
what I just did the back and forth

434
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,679
motion the carding gently back and forth

435
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:44,919
uh in a colder environment if you can it

436
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,359
will push through all those other

437
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:48,838
contaminants if you have hash that's

438
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,278
only 20% heads you can still use this

439
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,680
technique and get it to the point where

440
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:55,838
it looks and feels and smokes like this

441
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,359
um I guess really what we should do is

442
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,199
uh maybe all have one big puff and say

443
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,560
all is we got the the big benefit

444
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:02,519
concert tonight that we're going to

445
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,918
that's right too that's where we're

446
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,640
headed and that's the best well that'll

447
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,839
be good I think I got my uh well we've

448
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,480
gotten to my favorite part of the video

449
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,678
what what what part are we at John we're

450
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,759
we're at we're at the we're now

451
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,559
testing what we just cleaned it's time

452
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,160
to bioassay the product Everyone likes

453
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:21,160
to put their product in a gas

454
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,839
chromatograph I like to put mine into my

455
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,720
lungs get it into my blood stream and

456
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,519
then get it into my endoc canabo system

457
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,400
and then I'll let you know what I think

458
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:34,038
of it let me uh we always talk about

459
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,160
oh we won't make mention oh but it was

460
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:40,279
funny I know that was the large

461
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,840

464
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,639
this uh about of what we're about to hit

465
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,480
as we just showed you they're 90 plus%

466
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,960
clean it since then we did clean it a

467
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,079
little bit for about 5 minutes so we

468
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,600

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,400
have smoked the full melt dry sift it

479
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:45,360
really is considered the Holy Grail of

480
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,480
hashes now not the strain Holy Grail but

481
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:51,399
the Holy Grail in the sense of

482
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,400
this it seems to be as you climb and you

483
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,519
go through this cannabis experience and

484
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,840
you learn you know I started with seeds

485
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,079
and stems and green papers with thick

486
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,439
glue and that turned into thinner papers

487
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,558
and eventually we got the stems and the

488
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,960
seeds out and eventually I just got the

489
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:06,200
butt out and then I got all the

490
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,480
contaminant that it was out in the

491
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,440
tricomes out and now I'm at a point

492
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,480

494
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,640
health but for smoking it I really just

495
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,480
smoke where the medicine is located

496
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,919
