PVE Road through the forest and

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,239
mountains best air on the Lower

24
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,478
Mainland yep I agree and we're going to

25
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,079
hit some absolutely phenomenal quality

26
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:15,159
rosin yeah before we go out and do it

27
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,798
and then when we come back from the

wooden Dabber for today if you can

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,118
imagine I'm hitting with a wooden Dabber

36
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,880
but uh I think we're going to be able to

37
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,399
pull it off give thanks to douge for the

38
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:41,399

40
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:47,920
you'll be sucking water okay that's the

41

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,118
are getting into this skateboarding

43
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,759
thing while getting into it you're deep

44
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,879
in both feet like you are deep into it

45
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,640
and it kind of holds me with a foot in

46
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,798
this world cuz I I don't have any other

47
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,399
friends inviting me to go skateboarding

48
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,000

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,039
find people to go skateboarding so I

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,640

00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,479
to go hit this spot with it's kind of a

53
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,039
long long way to go by yourself you know

54
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,000
yeah for sure for those of you that

55
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,719
don't know we are in North Vancouver

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,318
like Chris just mentioned at the M Mount

57
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,719
Seymour Parkway and these are pretty

58
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:25,919
special Trails it's like this beautiful

59
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,120
paved little road that just goes right

60
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,399
through the middle of the forest how

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,480
long is it I think it's like eight miles

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,319
I've never made it right to the end wow

63
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,318
uh um and it's it's a good ride and

64
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,878
there's lots of turns and curves and the

65
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,518
Pavements really nice and smooth that's

66
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,318
awesome Hills and gullies and all that

67
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,080
type of stuff man then there's some

68
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:46,158
really good off-road trails as well just

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,159
getting the Dabber here or the uh carb

70
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:49,158
cap

71
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,878
she may be a small little piece but I'll

72
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,439
tell

73
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,439
you she hits like an absolute

74
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,840
Champion I am going to give you a more

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,319
reasonable hit this time I think I gave

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,920
you a little bit too big of one last

77
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:20,518
time yeah I'm not lightweight when it

78
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:22,000
comes to the dab well it's not even

79
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,480
about lightweight it's about being

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,039
comfortable with the hit that you're

81
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:29,840
comfortable with having and I myself who

82
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,438
smoke pretty large dabs if a friend

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,039
loads me a dab I'll often get like

84
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:35,400
higher than I would get if I loaded the

85
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:39,158
same

86
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,480
dab so let's load you one up Chris is

87
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:42,959
just like me when we get into this

88
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,318
situation the talking the puffing it's

89
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,400
all good and fun but let's get to the

90
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:49,759
riding that's right

91
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,519
man it's so great people really enjoy

92
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,519
these skateboard videos too so uh you

93
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,480
know there's not uh I mean last one

94
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,959
obviously there was an En an enormous

95
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,759
amount of uh good cannabis knowledge

96
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,640
dropped but today I don't think we're

97
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,959
going to be dropping quite as much we're

98
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,438
going to be dropping

99
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:11,719
carves we're going to be dropping

100
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:14,519
uh turn down a bit since it got run over

101
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,918
by a car it only lights at a certain

102
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,720
amount the gas has to be on a certain

103
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,680
amount before it lights I uh I lost at

104
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,120
dirt bike riding on the way up to brome

105
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,040
Ridge and uh I went by two trucks and

106
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,560
they both said they never saw it and

107
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,919
then when I finally found it I could see

108
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,519
why they never saw it because cuz they

109
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,918
clearly had both driven over it but uh

110
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,000
it's still working pretty good you can

111
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:39,599
see a little bit of Marks here nice not

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,079
too shabby Chris is like all right

113
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,680
should I hold this thing good for you

114
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:48,319
yeah I think it's a good idea

115
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,400
okay give that little guy oops parchment

116
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,800
paper don't worry it's the empty one let

117
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,279
it cool down a little bit the beautiful

118
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,160
thing about this tiny nail is that it

119
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,159
cools down so fast you certainly don't

120
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,199
need a 45 second cool down or you will

121
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:05,039
be getting the ultimate in uh

122
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,038
in uh low temp hits all right you ready

123
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,520
yep the challenge is to not touch the

124
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,680
wood to the actual nail this is uh

125
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,680
hillbilly dabbing

126
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,039
101 there we go seems just about right

127
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:22,038
that seems about

128
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,038
right

129

with this one it was completely

250
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,919
different from the Boost that I don't is

251
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,479
a completely different you know the

252
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:33,078
boosted has better Electronics than than

253
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,480
this one better handset uh um but just

254
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,479
this is this one is all about the car

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,039
and then you get good range you know

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,920
what I mean like we would have the range

257
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,000
is killer I think I I think I three or

258
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,759
four times boosted with this I think

259
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,360
well it basically seems like about 40

260
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:47,159
minutes of ride time yeah that you could

261
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,240
do on it which is yeah yeah well I could

262
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,919
go say from Sunset Beach all the way

lot must be kind of a night it can be

335
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:10,318
fun was uh last year I was doing uh um

336
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:11,798
night shifts on Davy Street and then I'd

337
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,798
ride the seaw wall back at night you

338
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:15,879
know yeah and it was always a blast to

339
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,359
like what about during the fireworks oh

340
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,679
yeah you know for sure that might be a

341
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,279
good time

342
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,199
to bring the board into the city the

343
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,959
city is gridlocked like 50,000 people

344
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,880
yeah come to these fireworks from all

345
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,720
these different areas around Vancouver

346
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,200
and uh

347
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,600
yeah if you if you get caught in it it's

348
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,120
a nightmarish hell but uh imagine being

349
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,038
on an electric skateboard and just

350
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:41,119
whipping by all the cars and all the

351
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:43,440
people and that could be nice

352
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,839
yeah yeah it's so nice here right the

353
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,720
air is just so fresh dude like look at

354
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,959
where we are it almost seems like it's

355
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,720
just a shitty little park but then you

356
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,480
look up and you're like oh right I'm

357
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,079
like this is like epic Back Country yeah

358
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,440
it just happens to have a little Trail

359
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:01,960
and an access point in yeah no for sure

360
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,320
yeah Vancouver is right on the edge of

361
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,519
the forest and then this road and trail

362
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:10,200
goes into the forest that's the

363
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:12,480
Vancouver's on the edge of so it's a

364
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,400
Nifty little kick of

365
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,919
nature get the City Vibe out of

366
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,759
you well I live in this very similar

367
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:24,679
kind of experience but uh I would always

368
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:27,359
want to come here uh more so if I lived

369
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,000
in the city as well cuz the city's a

370
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,119
good vibe but it's like you said it's to

371
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,599
kick it out of you every once in a while

372
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,000
and get out into the mountains and

373
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:36,759
pretty amazing that you can do it with a

374
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,759
an electric

375
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:42,919
skateboard that was a delicious

376
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,399
dab I got a low temp on see how it's

377
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:48,880
still kind of there yeah it's still kind

378
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,759
of there this pipe is is amazingly

379
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,520
resilient and the nail cools down if

380
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,038
that was any other nail I would be so

381
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,839
burnt right now but it it's uh barely

382
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:00,359
hot

383
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:04,439

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,280
of you know it's it's definitely not

388

391
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,519
