little video much like the last one that

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,278
I did a little bit of an introduction a

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,160
little bit of some puffing and then I

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,719
wanted to get into the mountains the

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,839

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,278

12
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:34,679
up with a video that I posted a similar

13
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:38,119
