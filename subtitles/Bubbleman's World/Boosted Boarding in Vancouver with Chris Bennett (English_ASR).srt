2
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,118
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,598
I'm sitting here with Chris Bennett we

4
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,240
just slayed the seaw wall yeah more I

5
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,399
think we did it one and a half times I'd

6
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,079
say about two like damn near two we only

7
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,878
cut out that one little part but then we

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,200
went through the middle we got off the

9
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:36,558
beaten path and got told we're not

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
allowed to be on there what within about

11
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,959
8 seconds yeah about 8 seconds so

12
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,000
civilians in Vancouver pedestrians are

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,679
very uh I could see him approaching you

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,320
yeah yeah I could see coming closer and

15
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:48,320
closer amped and amped and I thought oh

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,039
maybe we're not supposed to be on here

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,159
yeah so we got off there pretty quick

18
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,320
you know what I mean fair enough you

19
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:54,159
know what I mean you don't want people

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,119
riding on the I hear you you know I hear

21
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,679
you but at the same time at the same

22
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,280
time you want people like I see people

23
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:01,320
on the bike path I'm go I go bike path

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,518
yeah you know responsible adult use is

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,400
you know what I mean I I we complied and

26
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:06,679
got off the The Pedestrian pass you know

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,880
that's about all you can really say when

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,400
you're you're in the wrong spot that's

29
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,959
it so we did uh we did the Z board and

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,840
we did the Metro board two of the

31
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,399
electric boards that Chris has I posted

32
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,079
it on my um Periscope account you can

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,439
check me out there BC bubbleman that's

34
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:24,559
my Twitter account as well and Periscope

35
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:25,798
is a new app that lets you uh live

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,400
stream whatever you're doing wherever

37
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,439
you're doing it from from pushing your

38
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,520
button in your phone pretty cool so most

39
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,719
of today's videos on Periscope this is

40
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,920
the first part of the video that I

41
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:38,039
filmed on my actual camera and we got

42
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,879
the Mother Ship here we got some rosin

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,200
right here that I pressed out with d420

44
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:45,718
K the other day boing there we go looks

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,719
quite nice and uh we're going to have a

46
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:49,839
a couple of rips cool before we go out

47
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:51,879
on the boosted boards yeah and head into

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,159
Vancouver this time yeah yeah you know

49
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,078
like the thing about the boosters are

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,478
way better kind of performance boards

51
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,438
but you only get about a third of the

52
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:01,759
radius out of them right I mean that's a

53
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:03,078
major thing that's a major thing

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,359
radiuses you know that's one of the

55
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:07,239
things you got to balance I would say

56
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:10,080
the three things you look for the major

57
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:12,840
things are rad uh the radius that the

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,879
board can make y the the speed that it

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,200
can go boosted Metro are supposed to be

60
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,598
about 20 M hour I think the Metro is a

61
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:23,560
little faster than that and the boosted

62
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:25,199
supposed to be 22 M hour I'd say one of

63
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,080
my boosted is faster than that the other

64
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:32,399
one no interesting uh um and uh that

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,080
first give you a few seconds on the on

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,959
the weight cuz the the quartz gets

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,879
pretty hot and this is a a very oily

68
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,560
substance so usually they'll wait 30 to

69
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:44,280
45 seconds I'll just give you like maybe

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
10 or 15 more seconds and then we'll hit

71
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,120
you up there sure sounds good we get it

72
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,719
in there to start melting it away oh

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,719
yeah here we go go go

74
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:58,959
ahead

75
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,640
boom Rosen rips out of the Taurus

76
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,039
beautiful

77
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,039
that's what I'm

78
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:09,840
saying okay so now quick give us some uh

79
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,319
something historical quick while you

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,959
just

81
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:19,958
right oh jeez barely can hang on to the

82
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:23,239
Mortal realm after hit like

83
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,560
that let alone getting into anything to

84
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,120
articulate yeah the zboard is about

85
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,920
twice as heavy as the booster P it's got

86
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,840
to be yeah that was Heavy when I picked

87
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,199
that up I I felt like wow that's they've

88
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,519
got a new bottle coming out in the

89
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,839
summer in July and uh it's rated for 24

90
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,959
miles and it's about as uh the same

91
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,560
weight I think as the uh boosted oh okay

92
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,759
and it's a lot smaller you know much

93
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,158
smaller battery box and stuff like that

94
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,399
right you know well I'm sure it's only

95
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:50,759
going to get better and bigger and

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,158
faster I'd say the Metro is about 3 lbs

97
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,639
heavy but you know again it's got that

98
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,359
20 M radius both those boards though

99
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,438
don't have Flex they're hard decks so

100
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,040
you know if you're going over a lot of

101
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,158
bumpy terrain this is true as well

102
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,039
that's one of the thing was really

103
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,199
missing from my skateboard days um those

104
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,078
things were not very flexible the

105
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,000
boosted you could jump off that thing

106
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,159
like a D in the Metro there's like a

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,878
hesitation when you engage of uh maybe

108
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,840
half a second or so but it's still

109
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,680
enough to notice like when you hit the

110
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,840
forward or you hit the thing it takes

111
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,040
just a moment and and it's not as

112
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,799
responsive as like the handset for the

113
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,680
Boost is way better and the the Metro

114
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,840
the handset you got to put batteries in

115
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,120
it you know that's like so you got to

116
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:34,719
always be changing batter batteries it's

117
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,519
not a rechargeable handset and uh um you

118
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,919
know that's kind of a pain is Big too

119
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:40,319
you know and you got to point it at the

120
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,918
board it works by a light coming out of

121
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,478
it that touches a a light sensor on the

122
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:48,240
deck and so if you hold it in your back

123
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,959
hand you could easily lose control of

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,639
the board and you know then you just be

125
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:53,599
zipping along at a high speed and just

126
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,960
be riding a normal board all of a sudden

127
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,560
right you know so that's kind of a bit

128
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,159
of a danger um you know they they say

129
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,918
there's warnings about the Bluetooth on

130
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,759
the boosted cutting out but I've never

131
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:05,799
had mine cut out ever and I just feel

132
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,240
like way more confident with the

133
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,319
breaking and the Absolut for you know

134
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm looking forward to getting out there

135
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,800
do you want to have another rip I'm good

136
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,759
man that was probably enough one thing

137
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,160
altered my Consciousness just enough

138
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,160
yeah I have to say I'm in the same boat

139
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,800
after uh we've just done 22 or 21 kilm

140
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,759
um one good rip out of the mothership is

141
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,000
really more than enough so yeah we will

142
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,160
uh catch you guys later if you want to

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,399
check out more of these videos uh

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,720

here this time guys so uh we are now on

154
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,880
the Boost Bo today that I saw was that

155
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,520
kick it before you started because a lot

156
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,639
of juice is used up starting from a

157
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,069
stand I saw that as well I like

158
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:15,850
that

159
