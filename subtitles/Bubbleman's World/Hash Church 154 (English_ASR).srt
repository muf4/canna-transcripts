15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,159
it's always interesting to see who will

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,079
come in first generally it's going to be

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,519
Etienne for the most part he seems to

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,500
make it his way in first although I

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,660
should say

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,420
155 of you have already made it in so

21
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,699
maybe atan isn't first maybe today he's

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,879
going to be like

it's so nice to hear your voice too I

34
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,159
thought you might have pulled one of

35
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,739
these on me no I restarted my computer

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,118
beforehand to make sure

37
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,079
do you know how long I've been doing

38
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,540
that for

39
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,519
uh it's amazing because sometimes you

40
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,200
don't and everything works fine in like

41
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,539
last couple weeks everything I have it

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,020
set up the night before sit down and get

43
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,020

46
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,700
this week I'm looking forward to another

47
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,059
nice episode of hash Church nothing

48
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,618
major planned but I did invite in um oh

49
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,359
I was asking forever flowering

50
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:54,299
greenhouses if you wanted to come back

51
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,219
in I invited Peter from soil balance and

52
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,860
Wade and Forest of course from the

53
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,019
caladrius network in the house of

54
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,299
harlequin

55
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:06,478
and then the regulars you know lots of

56
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,060
little regulars d420k and Skunk Man Sam

57
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,679
and Tony and yourself and whatnot so

58
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,878
I don't know I think it's you and me and

59
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,739
we should just call

60
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,159
what do you say there again

61
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,719
oh I think that's very doable

62
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,419
what's your puffing on today

63
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,878
I got a little bit of full melt a bubble

64
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:25,919
hash that I'm uh working away on here

65
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:29,818
what flavor

66
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,079
this one is holy grail but I do also

67
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:32,579
have

68
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,270
um V

69
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,800
foreign

70
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,239
[Music]

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,980
I was just showing my entries that I

72
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,959
have for the karma cup the I guess I get

73
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,899
to be a judge for the solventless entry

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,819
so I think they sent me uh they sent me

75
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,580
11 different entries here so throughout

76
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:52,859
the episode I may hit one or two and

77
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,660
write a few things in my little my

78
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,420
little book here you know with the uh

79
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,159
they got all the categories written up

80
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:01,979
quite quite beautifully here for the

81
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:04,859
karma cup how many uh how many samples

82
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,018
are you going through I've only got a

83
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,739
to go through for solvent list but I

84
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:14,099
mean if you look at her actual contest

85
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:18,800
she's got Indica she's got bud hybrid

86
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:18,799
she's got shatter hybrid shatter indica

87
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:27,000
you know pages and pages and pages and

88
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:28,919
pages of things she gets a lot of

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,539
entries into this contest so different

90
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,399
people are judging different aspects

91
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:35,340
like some people exactly or some people

92
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,840
are having Edibles and yep so these are

93
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,580
experienced people I take it that are

94
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,280
doing it or they're people who pay to

95
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,200
get these I think she has a selection of

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,080
both people who are I mean the karma cup

97
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,818
is kind of a Roots cup it's still very

98
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,940
much like um

99
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:52,738
it hasn't really transferred in I'm not

100
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,900
sure if you see it down in California I

101
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,539
would suspect you absolutely do but here

102
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,158
in Canada

103
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:01,019
there there are these cup type events

104
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,759
and there are these conference type

105
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,640
events and they are both very very

106
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:07,919
different one is very roots and one is

107
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,259
very corporate and so you know with the

108
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,479
corporate events for instance at the end

109
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:15,899
of the conference everyone actually goes

110
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,939
over to a bar and drinks alcohol

111
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,500
and so that's not happening at the karma

112
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:21,719
cup I mean some people might go and

113
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,639
enjoy an IPA or a beer or whatever but

114
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,400
for the most part it's a it's a puffing

115
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,740
event for puffers and that's exactly who

116
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,239
will be there hardcore puffers how's it

117
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,759
going Sam

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,418
how to howdy howdy

119
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,759
is it a numerical scoring system in that

120
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:41,279
little grid like do you have like three

121
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,379
and a four and a one and a two yes

122
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,299
exactly it goes one to nine and then the

123
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:46,800
other cool thing cool thing is once

124
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,199
you've done all your voting you can

125
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,819
actually she's giving us a pass right

126
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,460
you get your pass and I won't show it

127
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,379
but on the back of my pass there is a

128
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:58,680
username and a password and that allows

129
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:01,620
me to go online and transfer all of my

130
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,418
book information onto computer so the

131
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,280
book is really for you to have to keep

132
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:07,019
your information because who the hell is

133
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,138
going to sit in front of a computer and

134
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:12,478
puff 12 varieties and and and you know I

135
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,400
like to be around out in the world wake

136
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,719
and bakes end of the nights all these

137
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,659
different ways that I like to hit

138
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,880
something that's a smart way of doing it

139
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,060
because that way you can carry the book

140
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,620
with you wherever you go

141
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,139
you know go along and then when you sit

142
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,360
down at the computer put all the data in

143
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,060
there but the cool thing about having a

144
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,919
numerical scoring system is now you can

145
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,680
do statistics on it and you could do

146
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:40,859
data analysis and you could do all kinds

147
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,199
of different algorithms to look to see

148
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,240
what kind of Trends you see in the data

149
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,400
so that's totally cool and Sarah is very

150
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,819
computer savvy she worked for years in

151
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,620
I.T she's very smart capable girl and I

152
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:55,459
would say that is that is exactly

153
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,680
something she's going to be doing

154
00:05:55,459 --> 00:06:00,959
that's outstanding people love data data

155
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,538
is awesome if you can get your hands on

156
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,538
data and you're a data person yeah you

157
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:07,680
love that that's it

158
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:09,000
exactly well I'm going to start it off

159
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,459
with a big old rip of some of this

160
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,779
bubble hash

161
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:14,698
hoping everyone's having a really nice

162
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,679
Sunday afternoon even though it's not

163
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,300
afternoon yet but it is afternoon for

164
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,939
skunk man Sam

165
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,259
and maybe

166
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:24,060
late afternoon

167
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,840
yeah right what do you like it's six

168
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:30,300
o'clock at night right now

169
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:32,959
607. all right well here's the 607 in

170
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,960
Amsterdam

171
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,580
noon on the East Coast so I

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,240
so uh what's happening in Pennsylvania

173
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:44,459
there uh doc

174
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,000
oh all kinds of things going on out here

175
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:50,758
so the first uh uh groups that have uh

176
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,220
field tests Harvest for hemp are

177
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,620
happening like in this last week or so

178
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,460
and so a lot of hemp crops are getting

179
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,220
mowed down which is cool to see and

180
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:05,579
um I was communicating with uh one Adam

181
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,020
Thompson who's a farmer up in Lycoming

182
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:10,439
County in Pennsylvania and they're

183
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:13,198
turning their stuff into uh a seed oil

184
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:17,360
so they'll be selling hemp seed oil and

185
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,360
making hemp seed oil from their their

186
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:25,860
I don't know Sam I I think um uh they

187
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,300
shared it with me once before and I

188
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,220
think we talked about it on hash church

189
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,960
but I can get back to you on that are

190
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,960
they churning the times back into the

191
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,359
soil or what are they doing

192
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:39,060
um you know I don't know and it would be

193
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,860
a great thing to get them onto

194
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,019
Ash Church sometime to talk about

195
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,139
exactly what they're doing with it the

196
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:48,060
only limited acreage uh plots so they

197
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:51,000
can't really do a whole lot in terms of

198
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,000
scale of economy that to actually make a

199
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,639
a profit so they're very limited and you

200
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,079
have to be tied in with the university

201
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,720
and there has to be sort of like a

202
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,939
purpose to what they're doing

203
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,400
I know that one of the plots is

204
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:09,598
specifically for um

205
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:12,899
uh phyto remediation of uh of a fouled

206
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,060
former uh steel mining site where I

207
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:17,939
guess they mine steel ore and there's a

208
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,519
bunch of you know maybe not desirable

209
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:23,038
Farm soil and and maybe a lot of

210
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,779
leftovers from the mining industry and

211
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,240
the steel industry that just sort of

212
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:29,818
left a field that was kind of like

213
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,278
cruddy it was too cruddy to plant corn

214
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:34,379
but they threw hemp seed down in it and

215
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:37,200
the hemp took off there so I think part

216
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:39,599
of it is to reclaim land but each

217
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,060
individual plot I think has to have some

218
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,099
kind of research project with a local

219
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,819
University tied to it but I can get an

220
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:49,500
update and I'll come back on

221
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,500
I would give a shout out to Joe Strobel

222
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,539
and Jeff Keim from Ontario they were the

223
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,820
ones that accidentally really kind of

224
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:59,219
figured out the the vital remediation

225
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,339
properties of cannabis by planting it on

226
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,839
Tobacco fields in between Seasons oh how

227
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,000
about that it was their first

228
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,740
experimental field and they knew the

229
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,320
radiation levels of the field because

230
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,560
they've been spraying radium-226 for

231
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,080
decades on it and so when they

232
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,539
registered when they when they went

233
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,399
through and and measured the plants they

234
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:21,899
were shocked at how much radiation they

235
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,600
had in them but they were then shocked

236
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:27,000
as well at how much less radiation was

237
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,820
actually sitting in the soil and that

238
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,399
was that was got to be 1993 and that was

239
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,180
really the reason our company cgp

240
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,860
started the um Chernobyl

241
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:40,919
phytoremediation project in the Ukraine

242
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,740
so that was it was done long before the

243
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:47,159
90s in Europe they were experimenting

244
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:50,159
with it in the 60s and 70s the 80s also

245
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:53,219
but radiation

246
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,740
with radiation or just heavy metals

247
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,259
I know there was especially heavy metals

248
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,180
exactly radiation I'm almost certain

249
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:02,278
they had no idea it could pull up

250
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,958
radiation until the 90s

251
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:05,700
yeah I agree because when I went and

252
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,139
dealt with that Ukrainian hemp and then

253
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,019
of course there was a study that came

254
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:12,958
out in um at the bio fock in 97 talking

255
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:15,959
about how uh this industrial

256
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,879
um uh heavy metals plant in Poland they

257
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,799
had done a similar situation where they

258
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,958
remediated it with growing up happen

259
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,879
they were astonished by that was one of

260
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,219
the first really big ones that wasn't

261
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,679
just a small trial no no it was really

262
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,778
big and it really pulled up

263
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,599
um a lot of the heavy metals and it made

264
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:35,820
the um

265
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,459
the soilologists really sit up and look

266
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,440
and rethink about how to reclaim lands

267
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:42,539
using you know natural biodiversity as

268
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,920
opposed to you know in the past just

269
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:45,740
scrape the land off and move it

270
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,240
somewhere else

271
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,579
then they had to figure out what to do

272
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,959
with the contaminated hemp exactly well

273
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:53,278
not only that they had to figure out

274
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,199
what to do with the contaminated land

275
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,838
and I found that out being Growing Up in

276
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,940
Southern Louisiana all those levees and

277
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,040
all that land that was built up that's

278
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,160
all contaminated land I knew because I

279
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:12,778
would go as a kid and roll down those uh

280
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:16,319
levees and find 13 17 19 leafed clovers

281
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:18,539
um trippy that ain't good luck no really

282
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,660
lucky the two options we were looking at

283
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:23,759
was uh burning and glossifying the Ash

284
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:27,360
and then the other one was an electron

285
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,759
scan electron cluster scientist from

286
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,519
Russia who was it was using electron

287
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:35,639
clusters to manipulate and and sort of

288
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:38,039
you know take radiation radioactive

289
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:40,500
nucleotides just literally take them

290
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:43,019
apart molecule by molecules so he had

291
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,759
this technology and I I remember that we

292
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,679
were sitting down uh talking to him at

293
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,019
one point in time not sure whatever

294
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,578
became of it though hey Sam are you

295
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,679
familiar with there's I know there's a

296
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:56,759
group uh working on

297
00:11:52,679 --> 00:12:00,239
um growing hempin uh Fukushima to uh see

298
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:02,879
about if any type of remediation been in

299
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,680
contact with them unless one of the

300
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,220
Japanese groups that we were in contact

301
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:10,199
with years ago and I just don't know it

302
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,759
okay because I know I mean since we're

303
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,320
talking radiation that's the only one

304
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,539
for sure sure that I know that's

305
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,339
currently ongoing where they're trying

306
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:19,799
to figure out if there's

307
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:22,019
I mean we all know that's an

308
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:25,620
uninhabitable area for a long time and

309
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,419
way to clean up soil but uh what what

310
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,060
they got to do is figure out some way

311
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,979
that they can make uh rockets that they

312
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:34,679
can shoot these things into space or

313
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,560
something so that we can get rid of the

314
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,879
contaminated hemp once we got it that

315
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,399
sounds like it's about as good of an

316
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,879
idea as like pushing our sewage into the

317
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:49,320
ocean well don't they make fireworks out

318
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:52,500
of uh hemp uh burnt hemp carbon I'd

319
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,440
heard that in China really I've heard

320
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,778
that but I have not seen or one of a

321
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,320
manufacturers that seriously goes to

322
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:03,120
show that there really truly is 50 000

323
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,860
commercial products that you can make

324
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,959
out of hand

325
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,419
it's ridiculous

326
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:12,059
do anything you can do anything with it

327
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:14,338
it's kind of like a like a Snead

328
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:16,078
remember the old beneath from The Lorax

329
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,600
everyone needs a feed

330
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:21,958
yeah I see why the religious right

331
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,060
basically thinks man this is too good to

332
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:26,159
be true there's something wrong with it

333
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:27,419
yeah they all think we're insane they're

334
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,458
like oh my God they're wearing it

335
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,379
they're eating it they're smoking it

336
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,599
I have a friend who actually took the

337
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:36,480
old uh decorticator

338
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,120
um recipes from I mean the

339
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,039
the plans from back in the 30s and has

340
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,379
now made his own decorticator here in

341
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,480
America and is now working on

342
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:48,120
cellulastic plastic so we're gonna

343
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,360
investigate possibly making you know

344
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,578
these Lids that we put on our our uh

345
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,879
cannabis Etc he's gonna start looking at

346
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:59,519
making them from plastic from hemp well

347
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:02,519
shelled hemp seed you could start with

348
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,740
that so you've got a food product and

349
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,509
then you need hemp toilet paper so you

350
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,759
can get rid of your food product

351
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:10,740
[Music]

352
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,659
good call good call because cutting down

353
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,299
ancient trees to wipe [ __ ] off your

354
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,819
a-hole it's not the real most

355
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,559
sustainable great idea like I don't know

356
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,940
who came up with that idea but I suspect

357
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,479
it was under the influence of like

358
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:27,060
alcohol or some other shitty drug

359
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,579
you mean the caveman didn't have Scott's

360
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,679
toilet dish oh dude listen I've had the

361
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:33,778
best argument I ever had in Thailand

362
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,120
when my friend's wife was arguing with

363
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:37,679
this other girl about you know the North

364
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,000
American girl was like oh how do you

365
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,159
guys not use toilet paper that's

366
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,480
disgusting and then the Thai girl was

367
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:44,578
like you guys don't wash with water

368
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,278
you're disgusting and the end of the

369
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:49,739
argument was would you just wipe [ __ ]

370
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,019
off your arm if it got on your arm or

371
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,198
would you use some water and some

372
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,198
foreign

373
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,839
teach their baby cubs to lick it off

374
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,659
there you go well I'm not licking it off

375
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,760
but uh we're a strange punch the human

376
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,919
the human uh I think we need to restart

377
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,379
the world but Day program and get the

378
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,659
days out there again you don't need

379
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:16,019
toilet paper you just use the toilet and

380
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:17,159
Goa where a pig will uh snip up your

381
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,440
butt

382
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,559
the Truffle Pig

383
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,260
oh man

384
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:29,239
talk about service with a smile

385
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,240
oh man I think I'll stick with the bidet

386
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,899
I don't need that bacon uh the bacon day

387
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,639
yeah in the Middle East everybody just

388
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,379
wipes with their left hand so there's no

389
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,180
shaking with your left hand so there's

390
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:42,059
no toilet paper just a hole in the

391
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:45,059
ground any anybody who's a Thief what

392
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:47,879
they do is they cut off their left hand

393
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:50,099
so they have to wipe with the right hand

394
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:53,039
nobody will shake their right hand if

395
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,278
they only have a right hand

396
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:59,039
yeah careful one shaking with the left

397
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:02,299
hand in uh in parts of Asia and uh

398
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,299
literally hands down

399
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:09,079
down oh my gosh sometimes it just goes

400
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:11,518
deep it goes deep here on hash Church

401
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:15,198
it goes deep in Beaver Terps that's

402
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,639
better oh my gosh

403
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,859
but what else is new in the wonderful

404
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,500
world of cannabis here

405
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,000
well we got Natasha Dr Natasha is in the

406
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,100

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,839
yeah I've been taking uh my Sundays to

412
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,039
have some relaxation time the last few

413
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,220
weeks

414
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,500
um getting some Forest time in uh always

415
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,120
essential

416
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,820
which is very nice and we're fortunate

417
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,980
here in Vancouver we have access to some

418
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,759
amazing forests with

419
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,820
um

420
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,899
really amazing trees that are so big and

421
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,139
just

422
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:03,778
really you feel like you're standing by

423
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:05,818
something just like another being like

424
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:07,439
I've never felt like that around trees

425
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:09,298
necessarily before but when you're

426
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,220
walking through these old growth forests

427
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:13,699
here it's just

428
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,019
really you feel like

429
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:18,259
lawyers up there or are they just

430
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:21,359
redwoods

431
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:24,119
okay thanks yeah I'm not actually sure I

432
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,159
don't know my my trees very well but my

433
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,779
neighbor

434
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,000
my neighbor planted a sequoia in her

435
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,918
front yard 35 years ago and you should

436
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,200
see this tree

437
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,520
what do the Sequoias look like which are

438
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,380
the sequoias

439
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,679
I think they're the biggest trees on

440
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,860
Earth they're large redwoods yes exactly

441
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:46,200
yeah they have a large uh stem but they

442
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:48,659
have a very shallow root system so they

443
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,519
tend to grow in groups otherwise they

444
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,558
can tend to fall over in storms they're

445
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,240
similar to the big Douglas Firs that

446
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,279
you're seeing in our forests when you

447
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,919
know those huge trunks

448
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:01,319
steroids with the agaricons and the and

449
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,600
the and the the the the red belts that

450
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:06,899
grow around their bases and stuff

451
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:09,058
I uh yeah the uh

452
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,280
systems you see with these big trees are

453
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:13,379
also outstanding in the different colors

454
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,519
and I mean you're seeing blues and

455
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,500
different

456
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:18,500
well you're also dealing with them yeah

457
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,179
that you could drive a 16 wheeler

458
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,298
through it sideways without touching the

459
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:30,179
without being taller than the Sequoia

460
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:32,759
was wide there's a red belted one two or

461
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:34,679
three that I photographed in my my son's

462
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,660
school in my neighborhood here has an

463
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,580
old growth forest for the school ground

464
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,580
that's it's just in the forest it's

465
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:44,038
Trails it goes over creeks and stuff

466
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:47,460
it's totally huge and they just release

467
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:49,798
like four to seven year old kids into

468
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,720
this Forest every day and it's uh it's a

469
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:55,740
pretty cool school ground I gotta say

470
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:59,640
well to tell you the truth you know we

471
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:03,240
don't own these old growth forests we

472
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,759
hold them in steward-ish ship for the

473
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,798
Next Generation we should save them they

474
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,140
should all be saved there's a

475
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:11,819
biodiversity in them that's amazing when

476
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,720
I was in West Virginia there's virgin

477
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:17,460
Hemlock forests uh not too far outside

478
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,339
town and it's a little Trek to get there

479
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,679
but when you get In Those Old growth

480
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:25,740
forests everything around you from the

481
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,480
ground to the canopy is so unique

482
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,400
compared to other forests that you're in

483
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,339
because that biodiversity has been left

484
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,559
intact as opposed to you know destroyed

485
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:37,740
temporarily and never rebuilt through

486
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,960
logging so it's an amazing thing that if

487
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,298
if you're around and you have access to

488
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,940
go to a virgin Forest somewhere around

489
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:47,460
in your state or a province I highly

490
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,759
recommend if you've never been go in sit

491
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:53,340
down and just look yeah another one that

492
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,779
you might want to check out Natasha is I

493
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:57,839
could take you and David up there one

494
00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:00,480
day it's just north of Whistler on

495
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,939
Cougar Mountain and there is an ancient

496
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,220
Cedar Forest there and the trees there

497
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,140
are bigger than any of the ones that

498
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,179
you've probably seen unless you've gone

499
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,780
to Vancouver Island to specific areas

500
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:14,460
like north of Tofino strawberry Island

501
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:15,899
you won't mirror Island you won't have

502
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,579
seen trees this big they're like you

503
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,559
know they're not as big as the Cali ones

504
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:22,439
you could pretty much almost drive a car

505
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:24,960
through these ones they're about 14 to

506
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,820
15 to 20 you know feet in diameter

507
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,220
they're huge like you pull up to them on

508
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:31,139
a dirt bike and it's you just feel like

509
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,679
a little peanut

510
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,360
it's pretty awesome yeah

511
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,679
that would be uh that would be amazing

512
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,899
to check that out

513
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,019
um I think the biggest tree place that I

514
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,700
went to check out was on Vancouver

515
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:46,379
Island near Nanaimo I can't remember

516
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,740
exactly where it was but it was about an

517
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,380
hour outside in Nanaimo we went to some

518
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,000
Forest that was a preserved area with

519
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,580
some special sort of trees I mean

520
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,960
horrible job explaining this but I

521
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:00,599
remember we went there specifically for

522
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,400
the trees and just I mean I I don't

523
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,139
necessarily want to just walk through I

524
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,480
want to go and like sit with the tree

525
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:09,600
and just

526
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,099
I don't know it's it's different than

527
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,980
um like I'm not the type of person where

528
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:16,079
I really feel Vibes or those kinds of

529
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,940
things like I I understand other people

530
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,960
do feel that

531
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,259
um but

532
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,519
in my general life I just don't feel I

533
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:25,679
don't know I don't say I'm like super

534
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,660
connected to feeling my surroundings but

535
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,159
when I'm around trees like that it's

536
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,019
just it's different

537
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,539
um and and so it really makes me want to

538
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:36,599
just sit there and um I don't know just

539
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:39,480
it just uh next to ones that are really

540
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:42,000
old and the Fallen they've uh cut

541
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,659
through the entire trunk so that you

542
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,679
could see the Rings and uh shown you

543
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:52,860
know on on the tree where Christ was

544
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,840
born and before for people that want to

545
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:56,459
check out photos of what Natasha was

546
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,019
talking about if she was in Nanaimo

547
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,419
looking at ancient trees it would have

548
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:03,058
been in McMillan Provincial Park and it

549
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,559
would have been Cathedral Grove which is

550
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:06,960
right off the highway in between

551
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,579
Victoria and Nanaimo and it there are

552
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,440
spectacular trees there but I'm telling

553
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:11,939
you the ancient Cedar Forest North of

554
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,298
Whistler

555
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,340
it's totally trippy the sound is insane

556
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:19,500
it's like quieter when the trees are

557
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:22,439
that much bigger it's even quieter in

558
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,960
the forest if that's somehow

559
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,340
I totally feel you and yeah as you're

560
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,140
saying the place we were was by a

561
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:30,359
highway and

562
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,740
um it did like I didn't feel like we

563
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,119
were deep in the forest and we were

564
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,919
seeing the trees it felt like we were

565
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,500
doing more of like a tourist drive

566
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:40,080
through so yeah

567
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,179
yeah yeah so I would like to check out

568
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,399
the area you're talking about I like the

569
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:47,100
more secluded Forest oh yeah this one

570
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,159
will take you like 45 minutes or two to

571
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:53,099
an hour just to hike up the mountain to

572
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:56,520
get to the area so I cheat I take my

573
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:59,219
dirt bike up there but uh we can walk

574
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,980
I like the journey to to get to the get

575
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,298
to the uh the site it always feels

576
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,279
better when you get there I feel like

577
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:07,519
you've earned it welcome Forest hey I

578
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,259
heard you were talking about forests

579
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,379
we literally are talking about trees and

580
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:16,140
forests

581
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,760
copyrighted it I feel like if I feel

582
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,280
like if Chimera was here he would have

583
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:23,220
already told us about the importance of

584
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:25,980
the terpene pining inside the forest and

585
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,798
how it sort of clears my name is the

586
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,259
most common terpene in the world

587
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:34,440
primarily from forest and it's that

588
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:36,599
fresh Forest smell that you inhale it is

589
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,058
literally part of that no well in Japan

590
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:40,859
we've all been hearing about the forest

591
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:42,960
therapy it's been getting more pressed

592
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:47,519
lately but they actually have areas of

593
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:50,220
forest that's uh preserved and kept uh

594
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,779
specifically for Forest therapy

595
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,839
um and there's some clinical work where

596
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:57,178
they've taken groups of like teenage

597
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:59,519
boys on who were troubled youth or

598
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:01,559
having just behavioral issues and then

599
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,829
they take them on these either day long

600
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:03,119
or weekend

601
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:04,019
[Music]

602
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,418
um

603
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:08,700
basically Forest hikes and they spend

604
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,740
time in the woods and they're finding

605
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,900
that their behavior improves their

606
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,759
immune profile improves and they've done

607
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,700
some blood markers like stress hormones

608
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:19,259
and some inflammatory immune markers

609
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,640
um so there's some pretty interesting

610
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:22,558
even clinical work and then they're

611
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,900
bringing it back to what could be

612
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:27,000
physiologically responsible and so yeah

613
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,460
Alpha pinene is one of the main

614
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,500
mechanisms of how forests when you spend

615
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,480
time

616
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,940
um in the trees you actually are

617
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,919
breathing in that monoterpene and

618
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,900
getting it into your body but even I

619
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,280
mean we look at the the microbes that

620
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,340
you're experiencing when you're the

621
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,480
bacteria and the fungi populations that

622
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:47,220
you're experiencing when you're in the

623
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,099
forest and there's even some studies

624
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,259
done with mice where they spend time in

625
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:53,579
certain uh dirt bacteria and they find

626
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:57,058
that their mood improves and it's

627
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:58,379
affecting their serotonin Pathways so I

628
00:24:57,058 --> 00:25:00,058
don't think it's just the alpha pione

629
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,220
it's also the bacteria it's also

630
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:05,519
obviously like Marcus you were saying

631
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,659
like the sound that meditative aspect of

632
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,819
just being

633
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:10,080
um even the sensory deprivation you're

634
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:11,939
looking all around you and all you see

635
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,678
is green and trees so that's very

636
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,019
soothing and good for your stress

637
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,000
response also so yeah in the forest

638
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:19,798
especially when you you know you you

639
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,900
gave a perfect example like you're not

640
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:24,599
the type of person to be super feely

641
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,640
about Vibes and energy you got more of a

642
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:29,158
scientist mind you're going into Data

643
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,799
you like like I you're more like you're

644
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,960
like an analytical mind but the forest

645
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:35,700
is powerful enough to break through to

646
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,740
many many different types and you see

647
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,659
people all the time who are maybe not

648
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,240
necessarily you know going to be going

649
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:44,520
to a rainbow gathering anytime soon and

650
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,919
and feeling the love of the whatever but

651
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:49,319
you go into the forest and you really

652
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,320
see everyday people people that might

653
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:54,000
not be you know as connected to their

654
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,918
plants say at their house or something

655
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,140
on an everyday basis but they get into

656
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,320
that forest and especially like an

657
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:04,259
ancient beautiful like Sequoias and

658
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:08,038
Douglas Furs and Cedars like these trees

659
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:10,200
are spectacular and they are a huge huge

660
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:12,359
part of our ecosystem as we see because

661
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,519
when we cut them down you know the

662
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:16,619
destruction is obvious even to the most

663
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:19,139
blinded

664
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:21,479
people you see that this it's

665
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,220
destruction it's uh wow when you destroy

666
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,159
a forest then you're just left with land

667
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,079
it's a bummer and d420k is in the forest

668
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,220
although we just shut off and went to

669
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,798
his uh

670
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,600
classic photo of him on his riding

671
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,819
lawnmower how [ __ ] redneck is that

672
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,699
though honestly

673
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:41,460
d420k's photo of him on his lawnmower is

674
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,659
like I love that [ __ ] don't you mean

675
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,860
Rouge neck

676
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:49,020
Ruth can you see me we can see you in

677
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:51,538
here you bro you're in the forest we're

678
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:53,278
talking about the forest forest came in

679
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:54,900
with the name forest and we were like

680
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,179
how's anyone Gonna Wanna and now I can

681
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,820
see the forest from the trees and now

682
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:01,380
you're in the forest

683
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:04,918
enjoy it while you can because pretty

684
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:09,020
soon all combustion engines are gonna be

685
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,020
banned worldwide for everybody

686
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,700
yeah they're actually passing

687
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:17,278
anti-combustion laws in India by 2040

688
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,380
and other countries so they're ramping

689
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,240
up to already throw away fossil fuels

690
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,980
forever whereas America we've still got

691
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,220
our head so far up our ass we need

692
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,839
electric snowmobile

693
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:30,120
yeah trust me I need electric snowmobile

694
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,740
I need an electric dirt bike I need an

695
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:34,379
electric boat so I'm going to need an

696
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,359
electric truck well an actual competing

697
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,100
company just came out uh competing

698
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,740
against Tesla with the first electric

699
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:43,759
truck humans I think it's Tesla with

700
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,019
their patents given to them yeah

701
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:48,240
Tesla gave all his patents away to those

702
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:50,759
companies so they could compete how

703
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,679
[ __ ] cool was that at the stroke of

704
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:54,900
Genius for the entire you know we had to

705
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:56,700
drive the industry dude it's so

706
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,679
beautiful like I wish more people had

707
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,480
that like what a brilliant like the guys

708
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,960
got some of the most valuable patents

709
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,220
you know legitimately on the planet like

710
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:10,558
they have to be in the top 10 like

711
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:12,600
ridiculous money and he gives them away

712
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,759
gives them away to all all of his

713
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:16,139
competition not just like put it on the

714
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:19,379
internet for whoever but he actually

715
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,240
sent it to car companies like and you

716
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,240
saw he just bought his cousin's company

717
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,220
the Solar Company for two billion cash

718
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,620
you know nice to hook up your cousin

719
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,960
with two bill in cash and now started

720
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:32,819
that solar roof right so he's got solar

721
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,220
roofs for your solar house with this

722
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:37,558
storage capacity from your portable all

723
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,440
the way up to large municipality cities

724
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:41,819
and now you can power your car I mean

725
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,159
it's guys

726
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:45,720
Beyond futuristic any stunning Rockets

727
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,980
to and from space and they're coming

728
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,200
back and landing in the middle of the

729
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,759
ocean holy that [ __ ] blew my mind I

730
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,380
watched that [ __ ] with my kid and I can

731
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:53,158
honestly say there's only a few times in

732
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,480
life

733
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,520
in life where you feel there's some

734
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,440
world history going on you know like

735
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:00,538
when they land on the moon there's like

736
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,700
certain things when there's when Nassau

737
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:05,700
sends a rocket off it's like it can be

738
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,440
it can be fairly historical and you know

739
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,240
Nassau said it was impossible that you

740
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,980
couldn't send that Rockets up into space

741
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,859
and then have them come back down and

742
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:18,480
land on a platform particularly on the

743
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:20,519
ocean a moving platform he did it I like

744
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,460
electrical but there's still a couple of

745
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,859
things that kind of bug me number one is

746
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,620
how far you can you go on a single

747
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:31,859
charge number two is how long does it

748
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:36,719
take to recharge so you know those those

749
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:39,479
things are number three I wish come from

750
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,019
the electrons probably come from a

751
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:46,019
fossil fuel burning go ahead that's the

752
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:48,058
third reason yeah okay

753
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:50,038
so the electron economy where the

754
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:52,259
electrons come from that's an important

755
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,000
one thing from coal or nuclear power

756
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:56,278
plant you're definitely using a lot of

757
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,619
it to get those the material to get

758
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:01,140
those batteries built they're using a

759
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:02,699
lot of petrochemicals they have to be

760
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,620
but

761
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,620
you know it is what it is

762
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,798
solar collectors find those other

763
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:12,778
companies we're also using

764
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:15,418
petrochemicals merely to create products

765
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:17,819
that use petrochemicals so to cut off

766
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:20,278
one one sort of head I think is a good

767
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:23,418
thing and hopefully eventually they'll

768
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:26,099
stop using the petrochemicals

769
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:27,840
with production you'll have also of

770
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:30,178
people looking for Alternatives the way

771
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,639
that they're you know they they do all

772
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:34,500
the time so once you do something in

773
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,740
production hydrogen that sounds really

774
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,740
good to me sounds clean as [ __ ]

775
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:44,460
yeah unfortunately unfortunately the

776
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:47,819
cost of all alternative energy is

777
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:50,220
directly tied to the price of fossil

778
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:52,918
fuels that which are subsidized and are

779
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,980
being you know where they are that's the

780
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:59,240
way it is in in this era of of cheap

781
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:02,460
fossil fuels which it just uh yeah again

782
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:06,058
more so than being tied to fossil fuels

783
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:08,038
what it's really tied to is human labor

784
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:10,379
because human labor is what does

785
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:13,379
everything regardless of the illusion of

786
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:16,679
money or the actual reality of fossil

787
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:19,799
fuels versus electric it's human labor

788
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:21,899
that makes the world go round that's why

789
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:24,778
money was created so people could say oh

790
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:27,239
I'm gonna do this without cheap fossil

791
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:30,298
fuels there wouldn't be the food

792
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:35,120
production distribution consumption

793
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:35,119
system that exists in America today

794
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:40,320
they wouldn't be Amazon there wouldn't

795
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:42,778
be a different one the whole Commerce is

796
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:45,658
predicated on cheap everything would be

797
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:47,099
local yeah and money would be printed

798
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:49,200
differently you know because when I hear

799
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:51,058
people say oh it's too expensive well

800
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,919
money is a mental construct that we made

801
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:57,058
up that we just print as much of it as

802
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:59,220
we want but labor is real labor is the

803
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:01,440
real thing that actually gets things

804
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,019
done you can't extract things out of the

805
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,659
earth you can't grow food you can't move

806
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:08,940
things you can't do anything with labor

807
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:11,278
that's the real value in the world not

808
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:14,340
money not fossil fuels not any of this

809
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,500
other [ __ ] it's labor people doing

810
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:19,319
[ __ ] for people

811
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,659
that's my opinion you almost sound like

812
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:24,058
a slave owner really

813
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:26,820
well I can tell you that I own those

814
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:29,819
names other than myself I am a slave to

815
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:31,740
my own to my own job but uh thank you

816
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:33,439
for calling me a slave owner how do you

817
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,000
respond to that yeah

818
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,159
you know what it's skunk and Sam so if

819
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,079
it was anyone else you won't know but

820
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,480
with Skunk Man Sam you just laugh it's

821
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,639
like he definitely doesn't mean harm he

822
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,140
definitely is not being malicious he's

823
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,059
like he'll he's like Dave Chappelle

824
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,919
he'll say anything for a laugh and

825
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:53,879
you're not gonna succeed so there we go

826
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,759
exactly well I I

827
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,799
jokes have to be explained they can't be

828
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,819
that funny

829
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:01,819
could you explain that

830
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:08,640
oh my gosh I said if we remember it

831
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,559
it is crazy though

832
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,620
that we haven't had a bong rip yet since

833
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:15,720
d420k got into the room I've had a few

834
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:18,000
years slacking I am totally slacking

835
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,679
welcome uh Wade I don't know if he's on

836
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,640
the phone or oh no he's just I think

837
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,860
what has real value in the world is

838
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:29,399
creativity and inventiveness of course

839
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:31,819
you need labor to manifest it but it's

840
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:35,099
the inventiveness and creativeness

841
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:37,259
that's the biggest donation that's being

842
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:39,139
given to humanity by really bright

843
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:42,558
people

844
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:45,059
I call it the one percent inspiration 99

845
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,558
perspiration I get people all the time

846
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:48,000
hitting me up and saying I got a great

847
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,158
idea I'm going to give it to you but I

848
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,200
want like I want 50 percent

849
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,320
and I'll be like listen your great idea

850
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:58,080
is worth one percent the executive

851
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:00,480
execution of said great idea is worth 99

852
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,960
and that was sort of a thing my grandpa

853
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,798
told me years ago uh that that it's 99

854
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,338
perspiration and it's one percent

855
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:11,759
inspiration I I used to always say that

856
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:15,239
if ideas were what was really really

857
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:19,220
important then the wealthiest people on

858
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,219
the planet would be the Rainbow Tribe

859
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:31,220
Rainbow Tribe are they still around oh

860
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,220
yeah

861
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:37,679
they're following fish and they're

862
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:40,460
following the rainbow family they're

863
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,460
following the rainbow

864
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,699
you did yourself before Marcus when you

865
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:47,099
said rainbow gathering I hadn't heard

866
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,960
the rain rainbow gathering for a while

867
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:50,760
does that thing still exist yeah

868
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,320
definitely not on fish tour I'll tell

869
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,599
you that much because Mark would know if

870
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,420
they existed if they were unfair no the

871
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,280
people on this course is the 12 tribes

872
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:03,240
fuss right that

873
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,740

inside is that the same like family that

876
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,980

and you're allowed to have only one

878
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:16,559
length of ponytail and a big beard and

879
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,380

894
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,519
when you grow your ponytail longer than

895
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,440

896
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:53,699
telling me about his weird dogmas and I

897
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,960
was just like all right whatever I'll

898

Cafe

905
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:07,980
and I came and check it out and all the

906
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,259
chicks were wearing like weird like

907
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,179
Little House on the Prairie dresses like

908
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,400
all the same dress that like went up to

909
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:17,338
here with the weird little sorta and it

910
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,740
just got weirder and weirder and weirder

911
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:21,539
I I was into weird so it wasn't like I

912
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:23,819
wanted to do it but I was like I'll just

913
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:26,279
like trip out on this and and with my

914
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,380
buddies and experience this moment not

915
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,359
laughing at them not mocking at them not

916
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,220
thinking I'm better than them in any way

917
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:34,980
shape or form just like

918
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:36,899
I trip on human belief systems you know

919
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:40,980
like I've got Hasidic Jewish friends

920
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:43,200
from Brooklyn and I trip on their belief

921
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,960
systems I've got raw foodist friends

922
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:48,539
from Switzerland and I trip on their

923
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,820
belief like it's just neat how fervent

924
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,920
we get in our belief systems well that's

925
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,320
right we got the right to believe what

926
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,480
we want and then we have the right to to

927
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,760
look at it and giggle sometimes with

928
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,679
some people you know the fish song birds

929
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,680
of a feather I think was written about

930
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:06,960
those folks outside Mark might know the

931
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:08,578
band well enough you know when they the

932
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,740
birds of a feather are flopping outside

933
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:12,740
and perhaps you'll receive invitations

934
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:22,980
I don't think it's about those fans

935
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:24,420
they turn drag them in there nitrous

936
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,440
balloon in one hand they're trying to

937
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,700
drag him into the bus for teeth

938
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,700
there's nothing wrong with people

939
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:36,539
believing in any belief system that they

940
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:39,480
like as long as they're not enforcing it

941
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:41,279
on others and saying well if you don't

942
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,039
do it then you're obviously going to

943
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,019
burn and to Purgatory for [ __ ] ever

944
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:48,420
because you're a heathen

945
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:50,820
right so I have a question for everyone

946
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,338
on the panel

947
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:57,440
what is the strangest thing that you

948
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:57,440
have ever smoked cannabis out of

949
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,700
have been Darren from BC he won the

950
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:11,039
Cannabis Cup in like 96 or 97 when the

951
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:14,879
big BC contingent came out he had the

952
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:17,519
long curly hair and he had a broccoli

953
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,380
pipe and I had smoked out of quite a I

954
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,659
smoked out of a carrot and a zucchini

955
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,220
and an apple and oil I had smoked out of

956
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:25,319
quite a few different fruits and [ __ ]

957
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:27,480
but when he pulled out the broccoli pipe

958
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,720
with the full head still on it with the

959
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,519
bowl like right in the broccoli head I

960
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,739
was like all right dude that and a thick

961
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:36,480
stock like it had almost as thick as my

962
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:37,979
wrist broccoli stock

963
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,820
that was probably the weirdest thing

964
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,820
I've smoked out of

965
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:44,240
next

966
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:49,920
no everyone's too afraid when I was

967
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:54,299
really young we rolled a joint out of a

968
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,039
woman's tampon paper the paper that the

969
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,200
tampon came in looked like rolling paper

970
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:59,820
to us so we're like oh all right Mark

971
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:02,098
wins

972
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,720
I'll go next

973
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:05,820
page out of the Bible

974
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:07,559
I've heard that one

975
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,240
the page out of the Bible I might even

976
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:10,679
been there for one of the page out of

977
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:13,098
the Bibles but

978
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:16,319
a tampon paper

979
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:19,160
was it before or after I'm gonna go for

980
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:25,039
before it was no it was it was not used

981
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:28,618
I was holding up a human bone pipe

982
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:31,139
are you kidding me Sam no he doesn't

983
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:34,519
clown around look at that thing you have

984
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:34,519
a human but where'd you get that in

985
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,260
with all the knuckles from the monks and

986
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:46,859
stuff so that makes sense holy [ __ ]

987
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:49,320
maybe Sam wins Sam wins that's that's uh

988
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:51,179
that's heavy I've never smoked out of a

989
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,160
human except when they blow into my

990
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:55,699
mouth

991
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:58,799
Jesus Christ mine was the least weird

992
00:39:55,699 --> 00:40:01,799
uh my mine isn't that weird mine was

993
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,900
just this uh this pipe at a party I was

994
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,740
at in Berkeley and

995
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,180
um

996
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:11,399
you you hit the ball this bong and then

997
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:14,039
it had a release valve that shot a

998
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,900
whippet right behind the smoke and shot

999
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:18,838
it straight into your lungs

1000
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,960
and that was probably the strange most

1001
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:24,299
unique pipe that I've ever hit uh I

1002
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,119
would love next time and next time I see

1003
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,980
you Sam I want to hit that pipe so it's

1004
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,079
a nitrous oxide

1005
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:32,519
uh gravity bong

1006
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,339
yeah

1007
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:37,320
I I've hit the nitrous oxide gravity

1008
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:40,920
bong not really a gravity bong it was

1009
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:43,800
more like a nitrous oxide like balloon

1010
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,358
that just pushed through you fill the

1011
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,339
bong with a rip and then you just

1012
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,920
release this little valve that he had

1013
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:52,078
and it blew the nitrous and the rip into

1014
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,760
your uh lungs I'm not I wasn't a fan of

1015
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,640
it at all I don't like those kind of

1016
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,400
alcohol type uh

1017
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:01,618
it was unique but uh okay come on rest

1018
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,900
of the panelists this here Dr rise would

1019
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:07,338
it would have uh you're just very

1020
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,338
vanilla and you're smoking what

1021
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
oh

1022
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,940
an earth pipe and puffed right out of

1023
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:20,519
Mother Earth what is an earth pipe no

1024
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,858
well you just you can make a bowl and a

1025
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,659
stem and you the the pipe is the earth

1026
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:27,119
you just dig a hole and you bury the

1027
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:29,639
stem and you create a little pocket you

1028
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,140
can puff out of the mark cloaky did a

1029
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:33,420
whole crazy video of like making

1030
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:36,500
everything into pipes in Vancouver he

1031
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:38,940
drilled out benches and trees and like

1032
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,619
Signs and then did a whole video on it

1033
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,820
where he just walked around he'd be

1034
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:43,858
sitting on a bench and then the next

1035
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,599
thing you know he'd be like on beside

1036
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:48,719
the bench stuffing it full of weed

1037
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,480
puffing out of a park bench puffing out

1038
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:54,239
of trees puffing out of like a lot of

1039
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,159
strange things things that you watch it

1040
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,439
you wouldn't puff up have you done an

1041
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,598
earth hit with a solar

1042
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,119
you know that's the no but I have done

1043
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:06,960
solar bowls but I've never done a solar

1044
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:09,599
Earth Bowl on a windy Beach a solar bowl

1045
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,059
is great oh yeah

1046
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,519
absolutely solar bowls are awesome if

1047
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:17,039
you like going blind because it's great

1048
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:19,199
because you're staring at this ball of

1049
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:22,380
sunlight in your pipe are you wearing

1050
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:23,759
sunglasses dude even with sunglasses you

1051
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,858
got to wear like it's like a solar

1052
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,839
eclipse in your bowl every time I ever

1053
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:30,838
hit a solar like trying not to look but

1054
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:33,719
every time because I also my solar bowls

1055
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:36,000
were majorly not but they were full

1056
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:37,799
Mount bubble and with solar bowl with

1057
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,719
full Mel bubble the bubble melts and

1058
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,539
moves away from the heat so you have to

1059
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:44,219
watch it and move it around it's not

1060
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:46,199
ideal

1061
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:48,419
anyone else with some weird pipes that

1062
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:51,179
they've got Forest anything yeah

1063
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,920
no I mean I mean when I was most of them

1064
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:55,440
were probably when I was younger so it's

1065
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,900
more white trashy than interesting or

1066
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,720
cool but I'm sure there was like a found

1067
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:03,480
recycled can pipe at one time I was the

1068
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,818
master of those things nice or some sort

1069
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,699
of you know some sort of

1070
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:11,119
trailer park MacGyver sort of nuts and

1071
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:11,118
bolts

1072
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,940
where they hit water and that's like a

1073
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:25,019
really common up in New England and in

1074
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:27,000
Vermont so like you'd be basically at a

1075
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:29,639
construction site that would suddenly

1076
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,619
just hit water and it would completely

1077
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:34,379
fill up and so there's a lot of these

1078
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:37,260
swimming quarries up in Vermont and this

1079
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:40,280
one in Dorset Vermont actually has a

1080
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:42,839
bowl carved into the side of the cliff

1081
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:45,420
so you could actually go there and hang

1082
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:47,880
out and go diving and whatnot into the

1083
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:50,159
Quarry but there's a bowl carved into

1084
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,619
the side of the cliff that you can just

1085
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,420
kind of come up and use so that's kind

1086
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:57,720
of cool that's we've smoked out of the

1087
00:43:54,420 --> 00:44:00,000
doors Quarry Bowl I like that concept

1088
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:01,799
that that seems like a concept that is

1089
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,679
thousands of years old

1090
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,019
the concept of creating a pipe to to

1091
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:09,059
leave somewhere and and smoke out of

1092
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:10,559
like when you get carved right into the

1093
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:12,719
Cliffside that you could come right up

1094
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,219
and use yeah it was pretty cool it was

1095
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:16,500
pretty cool I think the original one

1096
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:18,959
actually someone had actually broken it

1097
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,940
off because it was much smaller and when

1098
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,679
we went back years later I think it was

1099
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,019
on Grateful Dead tour I want to say in

1100
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:27,719
the late 80s we went there swimming one

1101
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:29,699
day in between shows and yeah I want to

1102
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:32,578
use the bowl and noticed that it was it

1103
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:34,679
was a different bowl that and it would

1104
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:37,079
been replaced by a much larger one but

1105
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:39,379
this is in a place called Dorset Vermont

1106
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:42,060
right off of Route seven in Dorset

1107
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:44,579
marble Quarry where they hit water and a

1108
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:46,259
lot of people go swimming there so it's

1109
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:48,599
cool to have a little bowl built into

1110
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,520
the cliff that's awesome dude welcome

1111
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:54,960
people

1112
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:58,400
why God made papayas papaya branches are

1113
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:02,639
natural for filling up with herb or hash

1114
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:05,099
they work really truly great and here's

1115
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:07,739
a 100 year old Chillum that I collected

1116
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:10,619
it's made out of either iron or steel or

1117
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:13,799
I'm not exactly sure the metal it's

1118
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:15,900
maybe a hundred years old and uh the

1119
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,839
reason sad who's like this was because

1120
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:21,599
they could hang it on a string and they

1121
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:24,480
wouldn't break it

1122
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,160
weird crazy wild hey welcome Peter we're

1123
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,099
just talking about crazy whacked out

1124
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:32,460
pipes that we've smoked out of my pipe

1125
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:35,280
was the broccoli uh Mark uh scaldon

1126
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:38,099
rolled a joint in a tampon paper the

1127
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:42,380
420k used the Bible

1128
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:45,300
um Mr Sam uses a human bone yeah yeah

1129
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,980
that's literally on his his thing right

1130
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:51,599
now with the 100 year old Chillum that's

1131
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:53,519
a human bone pipe from uh from like the

1132
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,660
first person he ever killed I think no

1133
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:59,599
no it's from Tibet

1134
00:45:56,659 --> 00:46:04,078
yeah you earlier man

1135
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:06,420
it was already completely stained

1136
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,000
did it have any like flesh left on it or

1137
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:11,760
did it just came nice

1138
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,559
it was old like maybe 50 or 100 years

1139
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,300
old when I got it

1140
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:18,599
it's great when the zombie apocalypse

1141
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:21,240
comes Sam's pipe's gonna wake up so be

1142
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:23,220
on the look at this

1143
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:25,259
human Stone That's Heavy that's like the

1144
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:28,318
nagas do you ever hang out with Naga sad

1145
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:31,500
news like well in Tibet you also see

1146
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:34,980
they use human just the very top top

1147
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:37,199
part of the skull as a little bowl

1148
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,240
that's what the nagas well not all of

1149
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:43,139
them but a few that I met had that

1150
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:43,139
little bowl they

1151
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,079
dude I was like that's That's Heavy

1152
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:52,500
that's like that's like about as heavy

1153
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:55,260
as the belief system got while I was in

1154
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:57,300
although I did see a guy get murdered at

1155
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:00,599
the Maha Kumba Mela because he went into

1156
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:02,940
the ghats before the uh the Naga sadhus

1157
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:05,160
he thought he would go bathe before them

1158
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,318
and the guy just picked up a big Spear

1159
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:09,659
and stabbed him right in the side

1160
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:12,599
and nobody did anything like he just

1161
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:15,480
floated down the river like no Army no

1162
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:17,338
like military yeah the Blessed death he

1163
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,079
died in the Holy River well that's what

1164
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:21,239
people were telling me later and I was

1165
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:24,359
like

1166
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:26,939
this is [ __ ] insane whoa yeah of

1167
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:29,338
little belief

1168
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,380
visitor I felt like I was in the Star

1169
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:33,960
Wars set

1170
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:37,019
Tatooine or something [ __ ] was Next

1171
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:40,260
Level belief system's wild man yeah I've

1172
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:43,559
seen I've seen mobs go after uh drivers

1173
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:47,339
of automobiles that killed cows and uh

1174
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:50,578
you know every everybody says if you're

1175
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:55,139
out in the Villages don't stop

1176
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:57,440
oh if you hit a cow you mean yes yeah no

1177
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:57,440
doubt

1178
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:03,000
they take it very personal oh I know

1179
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:06,619
there were caves in Nepal that cows were

1180
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,619
allowed in but Mark Rose wasn't

1181
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,420
think of that for a minute

1182
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:20,519
all through the unique belief system

1183
00:48:14,818 --> 00:48:23,940
so uh you it mine is not uh smoking but

1184
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:27,719
uh I've recently started uh eating

1185
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:31,318
cannabis uh flowers putting them in my

1186
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:33,919
lip between my gum and my cheek and

1187
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:37,318
sucking on it for half hour to an hour

1188
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:40,200
and you get a really nice sense of how

1189
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:43,980
those flowers were finished and a really

1190
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:46,980
nice buzz off of it try it sometime it's

1191
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:49,740
not smoking but it's pretty good

1192
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,900
I'm gonna try this

1193
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:54,719
you're eating th

1194
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:57,858
and getting a nice Buzz

1195
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:57,858
I'll take that Sam

1196
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:07,200
yeah that's a yes yes

1197
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,699
uh I'm enjoying the flavor and a

1198
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:10,500
physical experience more than a

1199
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:12,598
psychoactive Buzz

1200
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,358
it's a different Buzz it's a different

1201
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:19,680
Buzz yeah it's not the bus

1202
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:24,539
so when I when I ate uh dried but uh

1203
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:28,078
still in the THC form uh uh buds uh I I

1204
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:30,079
did feel a tiny bit of an effect but if

1205
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,880
I take that same Bud that I

1206
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,440
decarboxylate it and then eat it I get

1207
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,960
whacked

1208
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,400
yeah without a doubt well I mean there's

1209
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,400
more than just you're gonna have some

1210
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,079
breakdown of the acidic thca to THC in

1211
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,200
the flowers you're going to get some but

1212
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:48,240
you know the fact I've been doing this a

1213
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:49,919
really long time we're learning that

1214
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:52,439
some of these effects you know we could

1215
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,539
be feeling in the chirping profiles as

1216
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:58,800
well so that could have something to

1217
00:49:54,539 --> 00:50:00,900
have been depending on the both of our

1218

1272
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,000
through a little bit more than most

live car accident on YouTube yeah they

00:52:26,338 --> 00:52:31,799
have them it's called Russian car dash

1276
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:34,140
cams Russian dash cams that's like the

1277
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:37,680
worst YouTube channel ever to watch that

1278
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:40,259
is the craziest [ __ ] dude

1279
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:42,179
I mean you there is just out of left

1280
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:43,810
feet it's out of left field everything

1281
00:52:42,179 --> 00:52:45,960
you're like what the

[Music]

1283
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:52,199
watching those videos is definitely not

1284
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:54,299
don't you find Italians drive faster

1285
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:56,039
Italians

1286
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,900
what do you mean

1287
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:00,599
yeah what do you mean

1288
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:03,780
I mean what are you talking about drive

1289
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:06,660
faster and crazier and more dangerously

1290
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,760
but the Russians are pretty bad

1291
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:11,159
yeah well here's the difference the

1292
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:14,460
Italians don't have to by law have a

1293
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:16,139
dash camera in their car and all the

1294
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:19,199
Russians don't prove

1295
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:21,420
we don't get exactly you don't get to

1296
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:24,019
register your car without those dash

1297
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:28,460
cameras so that's why there's so many

1298
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:28,460
every accident is recorded

1299
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:35,159
pretty ridiculous

1300
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,780
and I would say that the in Switzerland

1301
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:39,719
at least in the south

1302
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:42,300
the Italian sort of Swiss Italian are

1303
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:45,659
driving as crazy and fast as in the

1304
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,320
north the German uh Swiss they drive

1305
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:48,420

[Music]

1307
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:54,900
well in in Germany 1 through 30

1308
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:57,179
kilometers outside of a city then there

1309
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,200
are no speed limits on the on the

1310
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:00,419
highways

1311
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:03,299
know I don't like it I definitely know

1312
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:05,338
as long as there's three lanes and uh

1313
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:07,800
it's 30 kilometers out of a city center

1314
00:54:05,338 --> 00:54:10,980
and stay out of the far left lane and

1315
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,660
last year literally in a 200 000 dollar

1316
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,059
car

1317
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:17,399
[Music]

1318
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:19,859
it just takes 200 kilometers an hour

1319
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,660
yeah but man

1320
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:24,239
some of those cars are going way faster

1321
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:26,338
than 200 kilometers an hour that's true

1322
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:28,558
like and when you see them in your

1323
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:30,420
rearview mirror and they're super far

1324
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:33,780
away and then you look down and you look

1325
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:36,300
back up and they are like literally

1326
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:38,940
I got to drive Gypsy Nirvana's brand new

1327
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:42,059
whatever Jaguar he bought that was like

1328
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:46,260
115 000 Euros back in the day I drove

1329
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:48,359
that thing like 250k on uh on the the

1330
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,740
German Autobahn there and it was as we

1331
00:54:48,358 --> 00:54:53,578
were driving down to Switzerland

1332
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:57,118
together I I on long trips I prefer

1333
00:54:53,579 --> 00:55:01,200
higher speeds as long as it's safe uh uh

1334
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:03,358
I mean I drive a Bugatti except that uh

1335
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:04,078
you have to put gas in it every half an

1336
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:05,880
hour

1337
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,619
you want to get one of those electric

1338
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,619
Bugattis

1339
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:12,660
I haven't seen it have you seen one no

1340
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:15,119
no that's that car is like 1200

1341
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:18,299
horsepower or something although I

1342
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:20,280
wouldn't be surprised if a Tesla p100s

1343
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:23,460
could still take it off the line

1344
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:26,160
well you'll have to admit it would be

1345
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:28,440
fun to drive one time it just beat a

1346
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:31,078
Lamborghini the other day by like a half

1347
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,700
second but it's every mile it beats

1348
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:36,059
everything I've never seen anything beat

1349
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:38,039
it and somebody got 664 kilometers in

1350
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:41,160
Europe on one charge the other day off

1351
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:43,079
of a ps100 wow that's you know you know

1352
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:44,279
once they break a thousand

1353
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:46,079
that's

1354
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,859
I mean how many freaking kilometers can

1355
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,859
you drive in a day

1356
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:54,480
[Music]

1357
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,818
Peter's world tell us what's going on

1358
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:00,659
what's new and different Peter

1359
00:55:56,818 --> 00:56:03,420
so um well we just uh I was listening to

1360
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:05,279
some amazing uh

1361
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:07,139
stuff that you were blowing my [ __ ]

1362
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,180
mind with earlier man and I had to jump

1363
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:11,699
in you were talking about like I think

1364
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:13,500
sustainable Eco Villages or like you

1365
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:14,818
know the Rockets blasting and all that

1366
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,139
stuff and I was like I gotta come see

1367
00:56:14,818 --> 00:56:17,880
what Marcus is

1368
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:20,159
what's going on in his mind because it's

1369
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,500
pretty amazing stuff yeah we were

1370
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:24,000
talking about Elon Musk and sort of you

1371
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,579
know a lot of his projects that he's

1372
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,920
working on and whatnot with uh

1373
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:30,960
I don't know he's got like three huge

1374
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,720
projects going on at any given time the

1375
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:36,659
solar panels the electric vehicles and

1376
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:39,179
the SpaceX program

1377
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:43,618
yeah I've been thinking a lot about

1378
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:45,179
um uh water conservation in Eco Villages

1379
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:48,059
like these sustainable communities

1380
00:56:45,179 --> 00:56:50,039
because if we can get well because I'm a

1381
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:51,240
soil nerd right so that's what I do so

1382
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:53,759
that's kind of what goes on in my mind

1383
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:56,159
but if we could get soil to a point of

1384
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:59,280
Competency where you know it's just

1385
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:01,980
super good rich dark soil you know full

1386
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:06,240
of humus in these Eco Villages you could

1387
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:08,460
actually like filter the water

1388
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:10,979
um and allow it to purify through the

1389
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:13,679
biology through the minerals and just

1390
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:15,838
have a really cool system in it in a

1391
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:17,519
super healthy uh you know sustainable

1392
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:19,139
Eco Village it's one of the things I've

1393
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:22,318
been thinking about lately

1394
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:25,139
sounds like a nature septic field yeah

1395
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:26,279
exactly exactly like a nature septic

1396
00:57:25,139 --> 00:57:30,179
field

1397
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:31,980
let the water percolate uh through the

1398
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:34,519
through the soil and then almost get

1399
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:37,679
caught in like a funnel where you could

1400
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:39,480
recirculate that and allow it to go back

1401
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:42,118
into the plumbing and just keep using

1402
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,460
the water but it's a natural uh really

1403
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:46,200
good carbon filter like the best carbon

1404
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:49,079
filter that you don't have with

1405
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:51,179
nutrients and the correct uh beneficial

1406
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:53,339
bacteria that the soil provides the

1407
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:54,960
plants which the plants provide us well

1408
00:57:53,338 --> 00:57:58,199
it's part of what it does it's part of

1409
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,500
its design yeah I mean that's [ __ ]

1410
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:03,659
nature dude yeah

1411
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:05,400
go ahead uh

1412
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:08,098
it sounds almost like you're talking

1413
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,599
about aquaponics is that a fair

1414
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:12,000
description of what you're talking about

1415
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,780
where you're circulating water to your

1416
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,818
plant materials and fish are uh their

1417
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:19,380
waste products are feeding the plants

1418
00:58:17,818 --> 00:58:21,420
and then anytime you can circulate the

1419
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,260
water back to the fish and or into your

1420
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,079
garden

1421
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:28,559
etc etc yeah like that but on a larger

1422
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:32,099
scale kind of kind of like for humans

1423
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:34,079
the human version yeah I remember when

1424
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:36,180
breeder Steve first started the he did

1425
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,798
aquaponics he had those little mouth

1426
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,879
breeder fish I can't remember the name

1427
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:41,159
of them now

1428
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,500
the heck were those ones called but yeah

1429
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:45,358
aquaponics is cool yeah it was great it

1430
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,039
was but the crazy thing was he could get

1431
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:49,019
a lot of growth out of it but you could

1432
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:51,239
also get like like the same way you

1433
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:52,980
could get like five to ten days of

1434
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:55,379
beautiful growth like in a very like

1435
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:57,900
short period of time like 24 to 36 hours

1436
00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:00,240
you could you could kill your whole crop

1437
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:03,720
like equally as fast like just decimate

1438
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:07,379
it like yeah like so dead like it's not

1439
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:10,679
coming back yeah yeah well yeah once the

1440
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,720
uh that biology it's like a macro sweet

1441
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:14,759
spot in the sense if anyone understands

1442
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,318
macro photography when you shoot macro

1443
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,440
photography your depth of field

1444
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:22,558
disappears and you get this like band

1445
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:25,920
that is like nine or eight or seven

1446
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:27,480
millimeters wide and that's your area

1447
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,460
that you have to shoot that'll be

1448
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,798
that'll be clear everything else will be

1449
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:35,639
out of focus be ahead of it and behind

1450
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:38,519
it so the sweet spot if you will is very

1451
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:41,690
very very very you know if you're not on

1452
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:43,980
it it's it becomes obvious right away

1454
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:48,019
so subs subs are green

bye-bye

peace out

1459
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:07,739
later man so the other thing that was uh

1460
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:11,400
that's pretty new uh in our world with

1461
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:14,098
with our biology is that um we just got

1462
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:16,858
some some preliminary data in from one

1463
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:19,559
of our hemp cultivators and um they've

1464
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:22,679
been testing CBD levels for the last uh

1465
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:24,059
uh six years they spent about forty five

1466
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:27,058
thousand dollars a year they're a big

1467
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:28,980
operation on CBD and THC potency

1468
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:31,380
analysis

1469
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:34,679
um obviously they don't want the THC to

1470
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:36,599
get too high because if it does then the

1471
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:40,199
crop is illegal you know if it goes hot

1472
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:42,539
for these hemp Growers big deal you know

1473
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:45,779
they they come in and they burn their

1474
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:46,619
whole crop so it's a it's a big deal and

1475
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:48,240
um

1476
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:51,599
uh so anyways they've been doing a lot

1477
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:53,399
of analysis on these uh different CBD

1478
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,140
levels which I'm not too familiar with

1479
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:57,000
yet I'm still learning a lot about the

1480
01:00:55,139 --> 01:01:00,420
CBD levels

1481
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:03,119
um but they said that uh in in analyzing

1482
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:06,420
hundreds of plants over the last uh six

1483
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:09,420
years weekly is how they do their

1484
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:11,760
analysis uh they said that our product

1485
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:15,000
on the bell curve over the last six

1486
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:19,140
years is 30 percent higher in CBD oil

1487
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,699
production uh than the non-treated so

1488
01:01:19,139 --> 01:01:24,000
they said that was a big thing they also

1489
01:01:20,699 --> 01:01:26,219
said that the type of CBD uh was a

1490
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,798
really good quality of CBD so I don't

1491
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:32,578
know if there's different you know

1492
01:01:27,798 --> 01:01:34,619
another CD cbda and there's cbdva

1493
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:37,140
like if it was a different uh

1494
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:39,740
I don't know what's a better one but uh

1495
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:39,739
but anyways

1496
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:46,259
in our treated plants than the

1497
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:48,118
non-treated over the last six years of

1498
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:49,940
the bell curve so they're obviously

1499
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:53,099
happy with Biology

1500
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,599
they're obviously happy with that and

1501
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:56,280
they and this is in the first two weeks

1502
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:59,400
of flowering so now what they're saying

1503
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:01,200
is that if if this keeps trending on the

1504
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:05,220
progression that they're they're used to

1505
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:07,980
seeing on their analysis uh that the uh

1506
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:11,098
it could go up as much as 50 or 60

1507
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:13,798
percent in in the oil production

1508
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:15,900
just from increasing the the biology

1509
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:18,659
exponentially and the guy was like the

1510
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:20,940
guy the guy is a PhD right and he's like

1511
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:24,779
I thought my [ __ ] instruments were

1512
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:26,400
broken man he goes he goes this uh

1513
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:28,859
this is something that I've never seen

1514
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,139
before and five generations of uh

1515
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:33,000
cultivating well I think that's proof

1516
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:35,759
that we're on the right track because if

1517
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,260
the labs never see anything new then

1518
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,940
we're not innovating and we're not

1519
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,559
changing anything and all the brilliant

1520
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:44,099
people that are involved in all of this

1521
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:45,900
stuff are doing [ __ ] yes sir it makes

1522
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:48,720
sense that we're going to hear Labs say

1523
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:50,760
things like I've never you know like the

1524
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:52,039
first time I ever had heard it was when

1525
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:55,559
I gave

1526
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:57,659
indra's oil to the labs here in

1527
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:59,579
Vancouver all of them said that they had

1528
01:02:57,659 --> 01:03:01,858
never seen numbers that high that they

1529
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:04,079
were they had never tested protein

1530
01:03:01,858 --> 01:03:06,179
powder isolate that high they had never

1531
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:09,599
seen oil content that clean and that

1532
01:03:06,179 --> 01:03:11,719
high and uh you know it's it's it's good

1533
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:16,140
because if if we're not hearing that

1534
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:18,659
then we're not all doing a very good job

1535
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:20,338
in the world of innovation and you know

1536
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:22,920
pushing this stuff forward and making

1537
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:25,380
and if the CBD levels are increasing

1538
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:28,440
what about the THC levels are they

1539
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:29,430
increasing also no the the THC levels

1540
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,679
went down

1541
01:03:29,429 --> 01:03:34,159
[Music]

1542
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:39,058
that's unusual

1543
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:42,358
so unusual he said the THC levels were

1544
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:45,599
down in contrast to the uh

1545
01:03:42,358 --> 01:03:48,598
to the other ones so our city and our

1546
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:50,400
THC was down in in hemp plants in these

1547
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:52,680
particulars what would the health hemp

1548
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,920
plant cultivars do you know thank you

1549
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:57,358
good question you know what I I don't

1550
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,920
know but but they're ones that they've

1551
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:00,920
been growing for the last seven years

1552
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:10,739
they said we thought our instruments

1553
01:04:08,338 --> 01:04:13,199
were broken because it was you know it

1554
01:04:10,739 --> 01:04:15,058
was Zero the THC was Zero

1555
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:18,179
they were like so we kept doing new

1556
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:22,079
instruments but the THC was like zero to

1557
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:25,440
to point well that does not surprise me

1558
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:28,980
at all I mean I'm a firm believer and uh

1559
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:31,740
you're kind of growing so but what does

1560
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:34,559
surprise me is that the CBD would go up

1561
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:38,399
and the THC would go down in the same

1562
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:40,380
crop I mean that's that doesn't follow

1563
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,358
logical sense

1564
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:44,519
would it have anything to do with the

1565
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:48,358
fact that the cultivar was being bred to

1566
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:51,599
produce CBD and to produce less THC

1567
01:04:48,358 --> 01:04:53,880
was it or was it just a hep variety no

1568
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:56,400
this is for industrial hemp operation

1569
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,019
yeah but word hemp varieties inevitably

1570
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,880
when you get rid of one cannabinoid

1571
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:02,159
another takes its place I mean are there

1572
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:05,400
I'm not bred for him they're only one or

1573
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:10,019
two percent CBD but there are CBD

1574
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:13,139
varieties which are over 20 right

1575
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:15,780
those are bred for CBT but you got to

1576
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:17,338
think of this guy's growing for CBD and

1577
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:19,440
he's got a PhD and he's got a big

1578
01:05:17,338 --> 01:05:22,679
operation and he knows that if he grows

1579
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,000
cultivars that are bred for CBD it's

1580
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:25,858
going to make a lot more sense for his

1581
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,619
business than to grow like hemp plants

1582
01:05:25,858 --> 01:05:30,598
that are two percent CBD no yeah but the

1583
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:33,660
only way you could do that would be by

1584
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:36,960
analyzing huge huge numbers of plants

1585
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:38,460
and eliminating any that had uh THC

1586
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,318
levels that were too high it could be

1587
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:43,920
done but that's what the ukrainians did

1588
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:46,380
that's what go to baroco right the

1589
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:49,139
people here are not doing that right

1590
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:51,480
okay it's a simple mess

1591
01:05:49,139 --> 01:05:53,400
it depends on what his goal is too right

1592
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,380
I mean it's his goal to produce CBD are

1593
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:58,318
they producing fibers and other

1594
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:59,700
byproducts of the hemp plants and CBD is

1595
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:02,219
a nice afternoon there's no

1596
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:05,639
infrastructure for there's no monetary

1597
01:06:02,219 --> 01:06:07,318
gain for fiber for for hemp no very very

1598
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:09,659
few people on the planet are doing that

1599
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:11,519
the value is in the seed oil and in the

1600
01:06:09,659 --> 01:06:14,598
cannabinoids and the terpenes period

1601
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:18,480
right now I wish they were doing flavor

1602
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:20,099
I wish hospitals this particular grower

1603
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,619
yeah and they sell to multitudes of

1604
01:06:20,099 --> 01:06:25,740
hospitals uh internationally so they're

1605
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:26,880
growing cannabinoids correct right so it

1606
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:29,639
would make sense that they're probably

1607
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:32,220
CBD cultivars I mean to plant hemp

1608
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:35,098
cultivars that are like two percent CBD

1609
01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:37,519
over ones that are you know five times

1610
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:41,660
higher so if the plant here's what might

1611
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:44,509
five times ten times Well

1612
01:06:41,659 --> 01:06:46,558
to grow right if if if

1613
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:49,859
[Music]

1614
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:53,960
strain of plant is meant to produce High

1615
01:06:49,858 --> 01:06:56,900
CBD and low THC then wouldn't

1616
01:06:53,960 --> 01:07:00,838
increasing its its true genetic

1617
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:03,660
expression in those directions uh kind

1618
01:07:00,838 --> 01:07:05,400
of makes sense to you guys that was my

1619
01:07:03,659 --> 01:07:08,639
kind of question too like if it was just

1620
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:10,500
a hem for if THC had been bred out of it

1621
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:13,500
and that was the sort of what was going

1622
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:16,679
on in that cultivar maybe the bacteria

1623
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:19,079
somehow influenced that same pathway

1624
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:20,460
rather than raising all the cannabinoids

1625
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:22,440
I don't know enough about it but there

1626
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:25,380
is someone in the room asking if you are

1627
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,059
talking about Davis herb Farms extreme

1628
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:29,460
scale performances shooting a

1629
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:31,319
documentary on their story right now no

1630
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:33,199
but I'll check that out for sure that

1631
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:36,960
sounds good

1632
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:41,239
usually if you're increasing the uh

1633
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:44,579
flowers the resin the terpenes the uh

1634
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:47,159
cannabinoids it's across the board it's

1635
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:50,039
not just particular cannabinoids to

1636
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:52,318
particular terms it's whatever the plant

1637
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:55,260
normally expresses but to a slightly

1638
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:57,298
higher degree right it's exactly it's

1639
01:07:55,260 --> 01:08:00,000
just a slight higher degree with with

1640
01:07:57,298 --> 01:08:02,059
the the biodiversity yeah but I like to

1641
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,559
jump in with an observation

1642
01:08:02,059 --> 01:08:06,420
uh one of the things I found I've not

1643
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:09,000
done nearly as much testing as the folks

1644
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:12,298
you're describing Peter but I have found

1645
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:16,020
that depending on when you harvest some

1646
01:08:12,298 --> 01:08:18,960
CBD Rich cultivars you can change the

1647
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:20,339
proportion of CBD to THC pretty

1648
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,698
dramatically

1649
01:08:20,338 --> 01:08:25,439
uh and it might be that in addition to

1650
01:08:23,698 --> 01:08:26,939
soil biology contributing to the

1651
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,738
wellness of the plants and their

1652
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:30,838
opportunity to express their genetic

1653
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:32,399
potential the other thing that might be

1654
01:08:30,838 --> 01:08:34,798
going on and you said they they were

1655
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:39,599
testing every week what you'll see is

1656
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:42,179
that CBD tends to come on before THC in

1657
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:46,100
the genetic expression of that plant the

1658
01:08:42,179 --> 01:08:49,440
biosynthetic process so to speak and

1659
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:52,140
I've seen pretty dramatic differences in

1660
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:55,079
the ratios that are in finished flowers

1661
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:58,079
depending on when you harvest them the

1662
01:08:55,079 --> 01:09:01,079
later they go in their cycle the THC

1663
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:02,640
tends to increase and CBD tends to

1664
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:04,559
decrease

1665
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,000
yeah I don't know Sam you've probably

1666
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,739
seen the same thing I'd love to hear

1667
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,659
what you have to say about that I've

1668
01:09:07,738 --> 01:09:12,119
seen varieties that did that and I've

1669
01:09:09,659 --> 01:09:13,798
seen varieties that did the opposite I

1670
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:15,119
don't know if there's any fixed

1671
01:09:13,798 --> 01:09:16,920
situation

1672
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:19,559
interesting

1673
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,119
well can I ask a question about

1674
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,859
um just following up on what you were

1675
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:25,318
just saying there

1676
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:27,960
um if you were growing a cultivar of

1677
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:30,420
cannabis and say it was a nine week

1678
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,079
flowering plant and you

1679
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:33,838
um

1680
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:36,838
and do that at eight weeks like how much

1681
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:38,818
of that final cannabinoid

1682
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:40,859
um development are you losing like is it

1683
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:42,779
five percent is it 20 like how much is

1684
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:44,699
happening in those final weeks of

1685
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:47,699
development does anyone have a different

1686
01:09:44,698 --> 01:09:50,698
varieties it really depends on the

1687
01:09:47,698 --> 01:09:55,439
variety some varieties really Frost up

1688
01:09:50,698 --> 01:09:58,619
the last two three four weeks uh so uh

1689
01:09:55,439 --> 01:10:01,500
you don't want to take the plant before

1690
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:05,279
it's done frosting up unless you're

1691
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:08,760
after a more uh maybe terpene Rich

1692
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:11,399
because the longer you let it flour then

1693
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:13,940
you're probably decreasing the terpenes

1694
01:10:11,399 --> 01:10:13,939
a little bit

1695
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,360
yeah I've been doing some tours over the

1696
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:20,520
last few weeks of some of the different

1697
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:22,679
licensed producers here in Canada and

1698
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:25,620
checking out their Grow rooms and stuff

1699
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:27,539
which has been really interesting and uh

1700
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:28,319
just hearing some of the

1701
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:30,960
um

1702
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:33,238
just Logistics of how people are setting

1703
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,980
up their grow and how many growth Cycles

1704
01:10:33,238 --> 01:10:36,238
they're anticipating

1705
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:38,158
um it's just interesting hearing the

1706
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:40,198
differences between groups and some

1707
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:42,059
groups are thinking like oh eight weeks

1708
01:10:40,198 --> 01:10:43,259
is going to be consistent and we'll just

1709
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,840
be able to turn over the room after

1710
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:47,640
every eight weeks and then my husband as

1711
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,319
a grower is kind of asking those

1712
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,600
questions like well what about because

1713
01:10:49,319 --> 01:10:53,399
some of the cultivars he's growing that

1714
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:56,280
he was expecting to be done in eight

1715
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:58,019
weeks he's finding other the longer he

1716
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:00,359
leaves them obviously they're frosting

1717
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:03,900
up more and so we've been just thinking

1718
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:07,259
of those questions of what's up take 24

1719
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:11,839
weeks and if you do it faster you're not

1720
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:11,840
creating the best I want them

1721
01:11:12,779 --> 01:11:16,800
for real

1722
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:20,000
where is it

1723
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:24,840
why is that because my personal favorite

1724
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:27,539
okay I have a real affinity for exotic

1725
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,039
um tropical grown narrow Leaf drug

1726
01:11:27,539 --> 01:11:30,719
cultivars and that's what he's talking

1727
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:32,460
about a hundred percent the terpene

1728
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,520
profiles they have different you are

1729
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:37,260
unique terpenes

1730
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:39,179
they're almost gone Forest if you can

1731
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,860
imagine prohibition and that's why

1732
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:42,480
they're gone because of prohibition so

1733
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:45,960
when when I see something like

1734
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:49,198
prohibition taking a stab at exotic long

1735
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:51,179
flowering tropical grown narrow Leaf

1736
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:52,919
drug cultivars I think there's got to be

1737
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:55,980
a serious value there so then I start

1738
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:59,480
looking into it my first day they cannot

1739
01:11:55,979 --> 01:12:03,899
compete indoors under lights on a

1740
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:08,339
production per gram per hour basis but

1741
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:11,099
a a big giant Greenhouse or Outdoors or

1742
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:13,380
you live far enough South then uh yeah I

1743
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:15,900
grew them in worse I grew 16 and 20

1744
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:17,760
weakers indoors and man people thought I

1745
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:20,279
was nuts but I'll tell you the same

1746
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,260
thing happened every single time when it

1747
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:24,359
was time to harvesting they wanted to

1748
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:26,780
smoke your herb oh God did they want to

1749
01:12:24,359 --> 01:12:29,939
smoke my herb dude

1750
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:32,899
the haze that's what we called it we

1751
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:32,899
just hired

1752
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:37,139
um you know what it's it was all about

1753
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:39,539
the terpene profile that was for me I

1754
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:40,980
mean it was it's the it was the terpene

1755
01:12:39,539 --> 01:12:43,380
profile that was modulating the

1756
01:12:40,979 --> 01:12:45,899
cannabinoids so uniquely and differently

1757
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:49,159
like causing anxiety attacks in some

1758
01:12:45,899 --> 01:12:52,139
people but for me just the most Blissful

1759
01:12:49,158 --> 01:12:54,658
experience like my mind was sharp I was

1760
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:56,940
inspired I wasn't lazy I wanted to do

1761
01:12:54,658 --> 01:12:59,759
things I wanted to create I wanted to

1762
01:12:56,939 --> 01:13:02,279
innovate I wanted to I just love the

1763
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,900
haze so was it a high was it high name

1764
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:05,179
and limonene that we're bringing that or

1765
01:13:03,899 --> 01:13:07,738
was it a more

1766
01:13:05,179 --> 01:13:09,899
Europeans got to test the terpenes back

1767
01:13:07,738 --> 01:13:11,879
in the day I suspect terpenaline had a

1768
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:13,379
lot to do with it as now the more I

1769
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,539
learn about these different terpenes

1770
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:17,940
it's one of my favorites for sure

1771
01:13:15,539 --> 01:13:19,560
but it's a combination right there's a

1772
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:21,359
whole slew of them in there and I

1773
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,520
wouldn't be surprised if in those exotic

1774
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:25,259
narrow Leaf drug cultivars if you

1775
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:28,320
actually tested for how many there were

1776
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:31,340
you would find so many more than 12 or

1777
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,340
20 or 30.

1778
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:37,679
different terpenes in different ratios

1779
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:40,920
than you find in widely drug varieties

1780
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:44,219
from uh you know Afghanistan and

1781
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:47,100
Pakistan or the wide Leaf sativa hybrids

1782
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:49,439
which dominate the American California

1783
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:50,640
West Coast Market

1784
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:52,738
yeah

1785
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,340
gets my mouth watering talking about

1786
01:13:52,738 --> 01:13:55,339
Haze

1787
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:00,840
you know speaking of mouth when you take

1788
01:13:57,479 --> 01:14:03,059
like a like a haze and you chew on a

1789
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:05,819
little bud I think the little ringing

1790
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:07,140
that you get sort of in between the

1791
01:14:05,819 --> 01:14:09,840
cheek and gum

1792
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:11,760
that we was talking about is partly due

1793
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,260
to probably terpening but probably all

1794
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,840
the terpenes that are just you know

1795
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:17,579
again being absorbed into the mucosa

1796
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,679
there right

1797
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:22,079
it's interesting because probably the

1798
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:24,719
most uniformly beneficial

1799
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:26,399
plant you know when we get into without

1800
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:28,619
going down that rabbit hole but when

1801
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:31,139
you're dealing with specific and rare

1802
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:34,559
neurological conditions and others you

1803
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:37,500
really see the fine differences in the

1804
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,360
concept of the Entourage effect but if

1805
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:42,779
we were going to generalize and say okay

1806
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:45,179
we have a broad Target that works for a

1807
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:47,399
lot of neurological regulatory issues

1808
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:48,779
albeit epilepsy or Spectrum Disorder

1809
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:51,719
conditions

1810
01:14:48,779 --> 01:14:54,300
it's uh Mary Hayes the first strain that

1811
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:56,399
ever worked for Silas is one that we've

1812
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:58,079
continued to cultivate and has been

1813
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:00,420
universally probably one of the most

1814
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:04,500
beneficial plants that we've worked with

1815
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:06,779
and it is uh it comes out at about one I

1816
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:09,899
Forest isn't that the one where they

1817
01:15:06,779 --> 01:15:12,000
found by earthering being produced by

1818
01:15:09,899 --> 01:15:14,819
the plant genetically

1819
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:18,319
yeah yeah I've read that I haven't been

1820
01:15:14,819 --> 01:15:18,319
able to see it in our own testing but

1821
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:24,840
interesting it is a special plant and

1822
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:27,659
you know it's and I it's unbelievable

1823
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:29,760
profile

1824
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:31,799
force it it's a two to one did you say

1825
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,320
yeah yeah

1826
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:36,440
um

1827
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:42,420
but yeah right in that in that window

1828
01:15:36,439 --> 01:15:45,960
to CBD to everyone THC yeah yeah

1829
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:48,480
it's it's an amazingly beneficial

1830
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:50,698
profile that it produces um be happy to

1831
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:53,658
send you guys it's got really high in

1832
01:15:50,698 --> 01:15:53,658
terpenes for us

1833
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:02,579
um yeah yeah I mean

1834
01:15:56,819 --> 01:16:05,819
it uh it is it's got a lot of bags tank

1835
01:16:02,579 --> 01:16:08,640
yes yeah at times and what's the

1836
01:16:05,819 --> 01:16:10,559
flowering period on that one now for us

1837
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,960
I think it's about it's somewhere around

1838
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,640
10

1839
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:16,198
to 12 weeks I believe

1840
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,900
um we have some going this year when

1841
01:16:16,198 --> 01:16:21,299
Wade Pops in we'll get him to to chime

1842
01:16:18,899 --> 01:16:22,738
in because he's uh produced it for me a

1843
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:24,719
couple years now and he's he's kind of

1844
01:16:22,738 --> 01:16:28,819
the expert in that world I'm the once

1845
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,819
it's grown that's where I take over but

1846
01:16:32,899 --> 01:16:40,679
Hayes is one of those that uh is pretty

1847
01:16:36,179 --> 01:16:43,739
stable in its ratio uh I found that it's

1848
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:46,560
pretty ideal in about 10 weeks yeah

1849
01:16:43,738 --> 01:16:49,819
going from first of August uh for

1850
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:52,080
flowering initiation in our area

1851
01:16:49,819 --> 01:16:55,619
so that puts it around the middle of

1852
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:59,100
October for an outdoor Harvest and at

1853
01:16:55,619 --> 01:17:00,920
that point uh what I found uh with that

1854
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:03,360
one and a lot of the other cultivars

1855
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:06,899
that uh we're using for the medicine

1856
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:09,899
process uh we Harvest when there are

1857
01:17:06,899 --> 01:17:12,658
still some trichomes that are clear on

1858
01:17:09,899 --> 01:17:16,619
the flowers and mo the bulk of them have

1859
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:19,619
gone milky but before you start seeing a

1860
01:17:16,619 --> 01:17:21,719
lot of Amber trichomes which is more

1861
01:17:19,619 --> 01:17:23,039
typically when I would Harvest a THC

1862
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:26,039
variety

1863
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:26,899
have all been yes hairs turned red from

1864
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:30,899
White

1865
01:17:26,899 --> 01:17:33,299
uh at that point many Haze is still

1866
01:17:30,899 --> 01:17:36,379
producing white hairs

1867
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:36,380
at 10 weeks

1868
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:42,600
they're natural photo period or under

1869
01:17:39,899 --> 01:17:45,738
artificial no that's Outdoors

1870
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,739
in Northern California

1871
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:52,500
and it's my sense that it could go

1872
01:17:47,939 --> 01:17:55,799
longer Sam but it uh we have uh

1873
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:58,079
uh at our elevation and uh whatnot

1874
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:01,140
location in California

1875
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:05,640
in a greenhouse in Santa Cruz I had a

1876
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:08,280
haze that was planted in July and it was

1877
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:11,640
harvested the first of April we called

1878
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:14,219
it April Fool's Haze it took so freaking

1879
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:16,980
long it was insane under natural photo

1880
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:20,000
period in a greenhouse

1881
01:18:16,979 --> 01:18:22,919
I love that concept

1882
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,840
I've had people with long experiences

1883
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:27,840
with cannabis start to take a daily

1884
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:30,060
supplement of some of the

1885
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,760
concentrates and oils that we make from

1886
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:35,699
this and come back and say they've never

1887
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:37,679
experienced something quite like I think

1888
01:18:35,698 --> 01:18:39,899
some of that is to do with some of them

1889
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,399
haven't used a supplement approach to

1890
01:18:39,899 --> 01:18:44,519
cannabis it's just something new to them

1891
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:47,279
and some of that is just its effect uh

1892
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:49,500
beneficial effect on the body I'd be

1893
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:51,179
happy to uh send you guys some at some

1894
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:53,600
point but yeah it's it's a good plan so

1895
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:56,760
when you bring up the unique

1896
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,260
personality and unique expression of the

1897
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:02,039
haze Clan I mean they can't help but

1898
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:04,260
think the background is

1899
01:19:02,039 --> 01:19:06,719
no I'm not I'm not the guy for that one

1900
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:10,140
dude I love watching Marcus pull monster

1901
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,480
[ __ ] rips bro that's a [ __ ] nice

1902
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:14,760
rip dude

1903
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:20,119
uh Sam what I know about Maddie Hayes is

1904
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:20,119
it's from uh uh Jamie in Spain

1905
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:24,779
that's where the seeds that I first

1906
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:27,139
worked with came from yeah we had it

1907
01:19:24,779 --> 01:19:27,139
brought over

1908
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:32,579
so if you know Jamie at rosin seeds uh

1909
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:36,738
he could give you more background on it

1910
01:19:32,579 --> 01:19:36,738
Amy hi me all right

1911
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:41,940
[Music]

1912
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:44,279
I'll ask him sometime when I'm talking

1913
01:19:41,939 --> 01:19:47,399
to him next time well maybe we'll make

1914
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:49,079
it to Spain this uh next uh upcoming

1915
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:50,219
March hey Sam

1916
01:19:49,079 --> 01:19:52,738
Maybe

1917
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:54,658
we gotta do it

1918
01:19:52,738 --> 01:19:57,959
it's got to be done I can't believe we

1919
01:19:54,658 --> 01:20:00,839
missed uh no he's he's done a lot of

1920
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:04,500
work for uh folks that are interested in

1921
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:06,420
CBD I I I had a variety 10 years before

1922
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:09,359
but I licensed it to a big

1923
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:11,699
pharmaceutical company and uh yeah but

1924
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:14,158
they've been working their butts off up

1925
01:20:11,698 --> 01:20:17,339
with CBD and they're gonna make it so

1926
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:19,139
there will be legal products but uh you

1927
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:21,900
know how big pharmaceutical companies

1928
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:24,420
are they uh are not real good about open

1929
01:20:21,899 --> 01:20:25,099
and sharing they don't like to share do

1930
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,420
they

1931
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:29,940
[Music]

1932
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:32,279
yeah Dr Russo talks about a strain that

1933
01:20:29,939 --> 01:20:34,259
GW Pharmaceuticals have that I would

1934
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:38,599
really like to get my hands on that is

1935
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:41,340
Express this really high in CBD and CBC

1936
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:44,699
with a really

1937
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:48,119
heavily balanced landline the CBD

1938
01:20:44,698 --> 01:20:50,879
variety was developed by me and uh it

1939
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:53,039
was uh not particularly high in CBC we

1940
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,500
developed another variety that was

1941
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:57,600
extremely high in CBC

1942
01:20:55,500 --> 01:21:00,119
yeah well the one I'm talking about that

1943
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:03,000
they've worked with and have now is high

1944
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:05,519
in CBD and CBC with Atlanta little

1945
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,738
dominant chirping profile which is

1946
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:10,020
someone who's interested in

1947
01:21:06,738 --> 01:21:12,238
anti-spasmatic properties yeah love to

1948
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:14,340
get my hands on that one

1949
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:16,799
crazy that you just can't it was

1950
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:18,239
licensed to DW I can't give it to

1951
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,579
anybody else

1952
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:23,459
that's gotta be like a

1953
01:21:20,579 --> 01:21:24,960
for someone like like anyone working for

1954
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:26,340
that company for that matter meeting

1955
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,739
people who are like oh I'd really love

1956
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:30,900
to get that cultivar it's like well you

1957
01:21:28,738 --> 01:21:33,059
know I can't give it to you all right

1958
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:35,339
no no no but I really need it like this

1959
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:39,120
isn't like it's not a monetary thing I

1960
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:41,159
just need it no no can't do that that's

1961
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:43,260
[ __ ] evil

1962
01:21:41,158 --> 01:21:46,799
yeah

1963
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:50,579
little little kids slowly season the

1964
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:52,800
death but you know Money Talks it's so

1965
01:21:50,579 --> 01:21:55,859
[ __ ] up

1966
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:58,100
it's like I get capitalism I agree with

1967
01:21:55,859 --> 01:22:02,099
what you're saying and I also say that

1968
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:05,000
GW has probably done more than any other

1969
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:06,560
medical company whether intended or not

1970
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,020
to

1971
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:12,539
help move medical cannabis forward

1972
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:14,760
because it's obvious that it's real when

1973
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:16,439
people like this are involved and they

1974
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:18,480
were just first I mean there's a lot of

1975
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:21,419
other uh cannabis companies out there

1976
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:24,139
now all I'm saying is is like the

1977
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:27,060
Keystone Cops if you can't share a cut

1978
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:28,739
while you're driving the newest and

1979
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:30,900
latest Ferrari

1980
01:22:28,738 --> 01:22:33,299
you're [ __ ] evil

1981
01:22:30,899 --> 01:22:35,059
like I'm sorry

1982
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:37,739
there's really no way around it

1983
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:40,260
everyone's like patent coverage on any

1984
01:22:37,738 --> 01:22:43,619
of those molecules those molecules are

1985
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:45,239
all in the public domain so that's where

1986
01:22:43,619 --> 01:22:46,979
the Folly is

1987
01:22:45,238 --> 01:22:49,619
well hopefully you know enough people

1988
01:22:46,979 --> 01:22:51,419
work enough people enough Elon musk's

1989
01:22:49,619 --> 01:22:54,300
make work that that they put out there

1990
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:57,420
without uh you know trying to control it

1991
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:59,159
right down to the last drop because uh I

1992
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:01,319
mean it started here's the thing this

1993
01:22:59,158 --> 01:23:03,539
didn't start in the for you know that

1994
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:05,698
you could take this human nature right

1995
01:23:03,539 --> 01:23:08,000
down to the lowest denominator and I I

1996
01:23:05,698 --> 01:23:10,198
saw it in prohibition I saw people

1997
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,238
absolutely not sharing with one another

1998
01:23:10,198 --> 01:23:13,979
because they were like oh I own the

1999
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:16,079
market on this cultivar this is my

2000
01:23:13,979 --> 01:23:17,819
strain I'm gonna you know it's like your

2001
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:20,340
stream you've got seeds given to you or

2002
01:23:17,819 --> 01:23:22,319
you've got a CD bagweed and now that's

2003
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:24,179
your strain that you've named and you

2004
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:25,920
own and nobody gets and you won't share

2005
01:23:24,179 --> 01:23:27,420
it and it's awesome you like to brag

2006
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,219
about it but you're not giving it to

2007
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:33,658
anyone but you can buy it for 3 200 a

2008
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:35,939
pound it is their share it is there they

2009
01:23:33,658 --> 01:23:39,839
renamed the Clone that they got from

2010
01:23:35,939 --> 01:23:42,658
somebody else so it's theirs dude I know

2011
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:45,420
so many people I know people like my

2012
01:23:42,658 --> 01:23:47,939
friends that have done that

2013
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:50,460
that's half the that's half the uh

2014
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:54,119
product Market it is marketing to

2015
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:58,500
families with kids you know it's not R4

2016
01:23:54,119 --> 01:24:00,599
it's not AC DC it's Hillary's helper you

2017
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:03,000
know and it's our own it's our own

2018
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:06,120
strain and you know if you want to save

2019
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:09,179
your uh child or your loved one you can

2020
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:10,920
only get Hillary's helper from us you

2021
01:24:09,179 --> 01:24:12,779
know and it's that's pretty much what

2022
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:15,440
they do to keep people dependent on

2023
01:24:12,779 --> 01:24:20,238
their product it's it's they changed

2024
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:20,238
everything eventually everything else

2025
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:27,840
excuse me

2026
01:24:26,279 --> 01:24:30,000
go ahead

2027
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,739
we see commonly that is in an

2028
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,079
intentional move that most people don't

2029
01:24:31,738 --> 01:24:38,459
recognize to keep people dependent on

2030
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:40,738
specific products they they take the

2031
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:41,939
name of the strain so it's not something

2032
01:24:40,738 --> 01:24:43,198
you can get somewhere else it's

2033
01:24:41,939 --> 01:24:45,839
something you can only get from us

2034
01:24:43,198 --> 01:24:48,599
because it's our particular strain when

2035
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:50,159
in reality some of them for example we

2036
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:53,100
know and know the people that gave them

2037
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:54,479
the initial acds here are four plants

2038
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:57,179
that they may have bred and called

2039
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:59,099
something new and they don't tell them

2040
01:24:57,179 --> 01:25:00,658
how to dose those are the two big tricks

2041
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:03,360
they don't say how many milligrams are

2042
01:25:00,658 --> 01:25:06,179
in there they they train people to do so

2043
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:08,219
based on volume right so I don't know

2044
01:25:06,179 --> 01:25:10,640
the strain it's only Hillary's Helper

2045
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:12,719
and I only know I get like 0.5

2046
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:15,060
milliliters but nothing on the bottle

2047
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:16,380
tells me exactly what I'm getting and

2048
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:18,120
that's intentional to keep people

2049
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:19,980
dependent on that one product because

2050
01:25:18,119 --> 01:25:22,859
you don't have the information necessary

2051
01:25:19,979 --> 01:25:24,919
to understand you could move on and

2052
01:25:22,859 --> 01:25:27,899
treat yourself or work with other

2053
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:29,640
medicines and it's it's not an a

2054
01:25:27,899 --> 01:25:30,619
accidents when we see that with strains

2055
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:33,300
all the time

2056
01:25:30,619 --> 01:25:36,479
eventually everything will be marketed

2057
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:39,539
by terpene and cannabity profile and

2058
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:42,718
you'll be able to find a very similar

2059
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:44,760
products yourself very easily

2060
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,980
yeah because the names won't be able to

2061
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:49,260
lie anymore then it'll be exactly what

2062
01:25:46,979 --> 01:25:52,819
Chimera said make the name the

2063
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:56,460
constituents that make up what it is

2064
01:25:52,819 --> 01:25:58,920
terpene profiles that's what makes the

2065
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:01,079
name that's it right the names can be

2066
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,819
you know secondary for the people who

2067
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:05,000
existed for all that we can be like oh

2068
01:26:02,819 --> 01:26:08,698
man I love the terpenely mercine

2069
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,619
delimiting AKA that sour diesel or

2070
01:26:08,698 --> 01:26:13,379
whatever right like there's gonna be

2071
01:26:10,619 --> 01:26:15,119
ways to still connect those names to

2072
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:17,100
those terpene profiles but for me

2073
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:18,960
personally I'm more interested in people

2074
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:21,800
knowing what they're getting each and

2075
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,939
every time accurately

2076
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,440
yeah so that's something we do quite a

2077
01:26:23,939 --> 01:26:27,960
bit is to just hope

2078
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:30,599
the families develop the right language

2079
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:33,179
you know it's not

2080
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:35,219
um this brand name that's saving your

2081
01:26:33,179 --> 01:26:39,000
loved one or your mom or dad or child

2082
01:26:35,219 --> 01:26:40,500
it's cannabis and you're not let's learn

2083
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,539
about what you're dosing let's learn

2084
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:45,000
about what's in it because that's what's

2085
01:26:42,539 --> 01:26:47,819
going to free you to not be dependent on

2086
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:51,060
this one company you know who's maybe

2087
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:53,759
charging you uh somewhere around 25

2088
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:55,560
cents a milligram when in reality you

2089
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:58,320
can really take care of yourself in a

2090
01:26:55,560 --> 01:27:00,000
much more affordable way if you learn

2091
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:02,039
exactly what it is you're given in

2092
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,238
docent

2093
01:27:02,039 --> 01:27:05,100
um I think it's been a lot of trouble

2094
01:27:03,238 --> 01:27:06,419
with some people but that's just the way

2095
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,620
it is well I love where you're coming

2096
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:09,840
from dude and you know what it's it's

2097
01:27:07,619 --> 01:27:11,579
very much where I've come from for the

2098
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,619
longest time even when you know

2099
01:27:11,579 --> 01:27:15,119
promoting Prana through Tony's company

2100
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:16,380
in Jamaica and they're like we need this

2101
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:18,179
we need this I'm like bro you have

2102
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:19,920
coconuts and you have cannabis make your

2103
01:27:18,179 --> 01:27:20,840
own we don't know the recipes I'm like

2104
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:23,460
dude

2105
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:25,920
just start soaking it in coconut oil

2106
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:27,300
using different cultivars bioassaying

2107
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,800
you'll find the one that works for you

2108
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:30,179
it's a beautiful thing the cannabis

2109
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,460
plant it's not going to kill you you're

2110
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:34,260
trying it you have access to it there's

2111
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:37,380
so much analytical information in

2112
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:39,780
Jamaica because everyone uses it like

2113
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:42,300
everyone just some people don't talk

2114
01:27:39,779 --> 01:27:44,579
about it like they get the Grandma using

2115
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,779
it for the tea for her cramps and her

2116
01:27:44,579 --> 01:27:47,279
arthritis and then she'll go out and

2117
01:27:45,779 --> 01:27:48,658
give her grandson a smack in the back of

2118
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:51,300
the head because he's smoking a spliff

2119
01:27:48,658 --> 01:27:54,000
and he doesn't know she's using ganja

2120
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:56,940
but she is

2121
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,800
yeah yeah I think the last time you know

2122
01:27:56,939 --> 01:28:01,619
I've had I do classes where we'll teach

2123
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:03,239
Families how to make man so we just try

2124
01:28:01,619 --> 01:28:05,819
to work towards independence as much as

2125
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:07,500
we can and empowering and

2126
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:10,679
um you know last time I got threatened

2127
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:14,100
to be sued was from a company who wanted

2128
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:15,779
to who has a nasal spray product that

2129
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:17,820
they've convinced people that they've

2130
01:28:15,779 --> 01:28:19,500
just spent hundreds of hours and all

2131
01:28:17,819 --> 01:28:22,500
this money on

2132
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:25,260
um doing and in reality it is just a

2133
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:28,439
it's just MCT oil in an Amazon nasal

2134
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:31,679
sprayer and they are you know wanting to

2135
01:28:28,439 --> 01:28:34,678
patent that hey Silas what's up Silas

2136
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:34,679
hi

2137
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,940
so

2138
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:40,199
that little guy right there you know

2139
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:42,899
we've when you're dealing with

2140
01:28:40,198 --> 01:28:46,138
epileptics there's three forms of rescue

2141
01:28:42,899 --> 01:28:47,698
it's it's sublingual it's rectal or it's

2142
01:28:46,139 --> 01:28:50,579
nasal spray or we've been messing around

2143
01:28:47,698 --> 01:28:52,319
with all those forever and is this

2144
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:54,600
company in Colorado decided they could

2145
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:55,859
do it they had a video go viral and then

2146
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:58,079
all of a sudden they started threatening

2147
01:28:55,859 --> 01:29:00,179
to suit organizations like mine the

2148
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:02,158
caladrius network because they wanted

2149
01:29:00,179 --> 01:29:04,079
the corner of the market and they just

2150
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:06,719
teach and they just manipulate parents

2151
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:08,460
and say this you can't do this safely we

2152
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,319
only we can do it in this High Lab it

2153
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:11,939
was really complicated you could only

2154
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:14,279
get it from us or you're risking your

2155
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:16,138
child's life and when those of us who

2156
01:29:14,279 --> 01:29:18,658
are educated have known and been working

2157
01:29:16,139 --> 01:29:20,460
with this for a long time know that

2158
01:29:18,658 --> 01:29:22,379
they're just putting the same spray they

2159
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:27,198
put in the sublingual drops in a nasal

2160
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:29,460
sprayer and they see big dollars

2161
01:29:27,198 --> 01:29:31,799
they're probably into there's some

2162
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:34,679
chemistry to emulsify if it's an

2163
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:36,179
oil-borne one to make it not separate

2164
01:29:34,679 --> 01:29:38,039
and you'll probably and that would be

2165
01:29:36,179 --> 01:29:39,899
the patent not the method of getting it

2166
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:42,970
why would they want to take away one of

2167
01:29:39,899 --> 01:29:46,148
the three ways that you can stop us

2168
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:46,149
[Music]

2169
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:52,800
don't separate an MCT there's there's no

2170
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:54,659
problem there no no no no no but is it

2171
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,279
is it a water-based

2172
01:29:54,658 --> 01:29:58,738
um nasal spray

2173
01:29:56,279 --> 01:30:00,479
it's MCT it's oil

2174
01:29:58,738 --> 01:30:05,399
it's oil

2175
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:05,399
yeah yeah it says you know

2176
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:10,079
[Music]

2177
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:11,698
that's pretty wild I would put that

2178
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:13,319
company on major blast man because

2179
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:15,178
that's like that's like the epitome of

2180
01:30:13,319 --> 01:30:16,799
evil once again you're coming at it from

2181
01:30:15,179 --> 01:30:18,960
the worst place it wouldn't even be

2182
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:21,239
surprised to look at the board of uh of

2183
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:23,340
that company and see it's like the NX

2184
01:30:21,238 --> 01:30:25,759
police chief the ex-health minister the

2185
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:27,719
excellent

2186
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:29,699
in particular

2187
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:32,100
that company in particular is one of the

2188
01:30:29,698 --> 01:30:33,839
worst at convincing parents and families

2189
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:35,880
that they're good guys by keeping them

2190
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,980
in the dark so it's funny when you try

2191
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:39,359
to teach some parents about it they'll

2192
01:30:37,979 --> 01:30:41,459
lash out at you

2193
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:42,779
you know and they'll come back at you

2194
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:44,340
know these people are great they're

2195
01:30:42,779 --> 01:30:45,599
Saints they're saviors and they just

2196
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:47,039
don't realize how much they're being

2197
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,420
exploited but

2198
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:49,198
we're going to keep fighting the good

2199
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:52,440
fight

2200
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:54,599
yeah maybe that's Martin shkreli's uh uh

2201
01:30:52,439 --> 01:30:57,539
cannabis company his CBD company that

2202
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:59,520
sounds like a him thing to do Mr uh get

2203
01:30:57,539 --> 01:31:02,219
the control of the drug there and raise

2204
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:04,199
the price a thousand percent overnight

2205
01:31:02,219 --> 01:31:06,920
remember that right

2206
01:31:04,198 --> 01:31:06,919
yes

2207
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:14,939
suspended in MCT oil is not an invention

2208
01:31:11,698 --> 01:31:18,000
that's that's open art so you can't

2209
01:31:14,939 --> 01:31:20,879
claim and you can't shut down people who

2210
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:23,039
use well no no you can claim and you can

2211
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,480
go through court and then you can find

2212
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:26,100
out that you can't but you can do

2213
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:28,198
whatever you want when it comes to these

2214
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:30,360
insane patent flaws dude I'm telling you

2215
01:31:28,198 --> 01:31:32,759
I could just start telling I could come

2216
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:35,039
up with a bunch of [ __ ] and and say any

2217
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:37,380
patent is is breaching my thing and it's

2218
01:31:35,039 --> 01:31:40,079
like it doesn't often just get wiped off

2219
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:42,420
the table they're like oh good business

2220
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:44,399
let's bring this in let's make let's get

2221
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:47,579
let's see how much money we can suck out

2222
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:50,158
of this we're all lawyers yeah yeah it's

2223
01:31:47,579 --> 01:31:53,340
called a slap yeah

2224
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:56,339
this guy went as far to go on silas's

2225
01:31:53,340 --> 01:32:00,060
awaren meniscuso syndrome awareness page

2226
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:02,159
and start uh making threats and calling

2227
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:03,539
us Thieves for taking this product in

2228
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:05,179
this case it's got a multi-million

2229
01:32:03,539 --> 01:32:08,100
dollar company it's one of the biggest

2230
01:32:05,179 --> 01:32:11,279
CBD companies out of Colorado you know

2231
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:13,020
and they know that we're giving it away

2232
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:14,219
so we're not even selling so he has no

2233
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,920
ground for any lawsuit because the

2234
01:32:14,219 --> 01:32:19,739
collagers network doesn't sell anything

2235
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:21,719
and his his patents are

2236
01:32:19,738 --> 01:32:24,658
nonsense that he's saying that he has

2237
01:32:21,719 --> 01:32:26,340
but this is just the the level that that

2238
01:32:24,658 --> 01:32:28,859
some of these people go to to keep

2239
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:30,719
control on the information and that's

2240
01:32:28,859 --> 01:32:33,299
kind of why I brought it up it's not

2241
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:35,219
that it was um we were selling and

2242
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:36,539
cutting into his market share it's that

2243
01:32:35,219 --> 01:32:38,760
they don't want people to know that

2244
01:32:36,539 --> 01:32:41,100
there's really no magic behind this I

2245
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:43,079
mean though this plant is there for all

2246
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,699
of us and as much as you want to inform

2247
01:32:43,079 --> 01:32:48,119
yourself and educate yourself you can

2248
01:32:44,698 --> 01:32:49,079
take some control into your own hands in

2249
01:32:48,119 --> 01:32:50,099
your own life and there's a lot of

2250
01:32:49,079 --> 01:32:51,600
people who don't like that about

2251
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,820
cannabis it's one of the reasons it's

2252
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:55,620
been so hard to monopolize and

2253
01:32:53,819 --> 01:32:57,658
pharmaceutical companies can't take it

2254
01:32:55,619 --> 01:32:59,219
now I have the Cannabis industry some of

2255
01:32:57,658 --> 01:33:01,500
them trying learning the same hard

2256
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:03,600
lesson as they just try to grasp on the

2257
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:05,340
control as much as they can it's almost

2258
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,860
all in the language Forest when you hear

2259
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:09,779
people say I helped I did this I did

2260
01:33:07,859 --> 01:33:11,399
that you're like my fire alarms my

2261
01:33:09,779 --> 01:33:13,979
Spider Sense goes off but when they say

2262
01:33:11,399 --> 01:33:15,179
you know cannabinoids help them I

2263
01:33:13,979 --> 01:33:16,678
pointed them in the direction of

2264
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:18,658
cannabinoids and that helped him it's

2265
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:20,520
like yeah exactly it was like it was the

2266
01:33:18,658 --> 01:33:25,379
cannabinoids that helped them I mean

2267
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:27,420
let's not take credit for for such silly

2268
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:30,840
things it's such it's so Donald Trump

2269
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:32,760
asked like oh huge crowd in Houston huge

2270
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:36,000
crowd great to see all you people huge

2271
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:37,860
it's like dude that is douchebaggery at

2272
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,658
the highest degree that's like you know

2273
01:33:37,859 --> 01:33:41,880
what that's like that's like giving a

2274
01:33:39,658 --> 01:33:43,979
homeless person half a sandwich or money

2275
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:46,079
and then going home and posting about it

2276
01:33:43,979 --> 01:33:47,759
on your social media oh I just want to

2277
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:49,800
let everyone know today I gave a

2278
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,360
homeless person some money because I'm

2279
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:53,520
such a good person I want you all to

2280
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:54,899
know that it's like man it was good that

2281
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,639
you've maybe gave that person a sandwich

2282
01:33:54,899 --> 01:33:58,439
but then you ruined it by talking about

2283
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:01,880
it and having to tell everything about

2284
01:33:58,439 --> 01:34:04,500
it and turning it into an ego thing

2285
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:06,119
uh Marcus I love it when you take big

2286
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:08,279

2290
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:16,619
opposite of awesome but I'll take that

2294
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:26,519
everyone ready for a big rip it's gonna

2295
01:34:22,859 --> 01:34:29,099
be huge it's gonna be a huge rip look at

2296
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:29,760
these rips they're huge

2297
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:32,579
um

2298
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,739
well that's it so I don't know if they

2299
01:34:32,579 --> 01:34:36,658
have any other topic but I know rip dude

2300
01:34:34,738 --> 01:34:40,500
you know what I've been ripping is this

2301
01:34:36,658 --> 01:34:44,638
uh this little terp vaporizer and um the

2302
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:46,979
the grass that I got man it's got um 10

2303
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:49,159
major types of terpenes

2304
01:34:46,979 --> 01:34:51,238
[Music]

2305
01:34:49,158 --> 01:34:52,799
what is that like three four percent

2306
01:34:51,238 --> 01:34:54,899
terpenes

2307
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,579
yeah it's really it's really how I'm in

2308
01:34:54,899 --> 01:34:58,799
I don't know the exact percentage but

2309
01:34:56,579 --> 01:35:00,238
it's it's three different types with

2310
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:03,360
like

2311
01:35:00,238 --> 01:35:05,638
um each each strain one strain has like

2312
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:07,319
seven to nine different types of Majors

2313
01:35:05,639 --> 01:35:09,119
right there's so many different terpenes

2314
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:12,000
you could test for but as far as the

2315
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:15,059
major ones this one's got um seven to

2316
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,738
nine in each strain I look forward to

2317
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:19,800
the day where we go as deep as the

2318
01:35:16,738 --> 01:35:22,138
machines will let us and just go as deep

2319
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:24,420
as we can with because I'm also a firm

2320
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:26,400
believer for whatever reason that the

2321
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:27,420
the terpenes that are in the Lesser

2322
01:35:26,399 --> 01:35:30,899
amounts

2323
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:34,199
could be just as important

2324
01:35:30,899 --> 01:35:35,819
yeah yeah you're probably I mean it's

2325
01:35:34,198 --> 01:35:38,219
just an opinion I have nothing to back

2326
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:40,859
it up right I'm learning too and I agree

2327
01:35:38,219 --> 01:35:42,899
100 with you dude like those little

2328
01:35:40,859 --> 01:35:46,019
macro doses of the other ones probably

2329
01:35:42,899 --> 01:35:48,359
act as like a catalyst to some of the

2330
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:50,760
other ones to maybe make you know that

2331
01:35:48,359 --> 01:35:53,460
their efficacy enhanced so without the

2332
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:55,199
one like that perfect balance you know

2333
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:56,939
yeah I have a hard time believing that

2334
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:58,319
they're there for no reason totally

2335
01:35:56,939 --> 01:35:59,759
right man

2336
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:01,698
yep

2337
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:05,039
and it's also

2338
01:36:01,698 --> 01:36:08,099
I predict right here and now because

2339
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:11,279
when I've tested for terpenes I always

2340
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:14,400
found plus 50. that there might be more

2341
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:17,759
of it I only had a hundred standards of

2342
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:21,738
the 150 terpenes found in cannabis but

2343
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:27,119
uh the the end effects of it is the uh

2344
01:36:21,738 --> 01:36:29,698
the the terpenes that we did find uh the

2345
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:32,279
some of them uh have very positive

2346
01:36:29,698 --> 01:36:36,479
effects a few of them had negative

2347
01:36:32,279 --> 01:36:39,000
effects so there could be terpenes that

2348
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:42,899
you really don't want in in there also

2349
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,520
oh really that's interesting wow so

2350
01:36:42,899 --> 01:36:46,138
there's there's ones that you don't want

2351
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:49,440
in there

2352
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:51,779
uh at least from a recreational point of

2353
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:54,419
view from a medical point of view might

2354
01:36:51,779 --> 01:36:57,840
be completely different but I've seen it

2355
01:36:54,420 --> 01:37:00,719
happen I'm talking about flavor

2356
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:04,199
I've seen certain strains terpenes

2357
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:06,960
have absolutely adverse effects so give

2358
01:37:04,198 --> 01:37:09,599
an example we've had there's a high CBD

2359
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:13,439
strength called Electra and there's

2360
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:15,659
electric four so so we were using High

2361
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:18,238
CBD strains with a lot of kids and

2362
01:37:15,658 --> 01:37:19,379
typically AC DC is like my tried and

2363
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:20,939
true

2364
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:23,639
um it's just stable it's got a good

2365
01:37:20,939 --> 01:37:25,678
terpene profile it's what's being used a

2366
01:37:23,639 --> 01:37:27,300
lot by a michelin's group I think people

2367
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:28,500
who are doing medical work are really

2368
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,699
kind of stuck with it it's been pretty

2369
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,738
decent and

2370
01:37:29,698 --> 01:37:33,539
I switched over with Silas at one point

2371
01:37:31,738 --> 01:37:36,359
to a lecture because we were out of AC

2372
01:37:33,539 --> 01:37:39,539
DC exact same CBD

2373
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:41,880
um dose and his seizures went through

2374
01:37:39,539 --> 01:37:45,179
the roof they just spiked

2375
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:46,739
incredibly and I was kind of skeptical

2376
01:37:45,179 --> 01:37:48,060
like well could it be this could it just

2377
01:37:46,738 --> 01:37:50,519
be something in the system that's

2378
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:52,199
causing it and eventually said well we

2379
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:53,699
gotta get the others trained back and

2380
01:37:52,198 --> 01:37:55,138
see what happens and they stopped

2381
01:37:53,698 --> 01:37:56,638
immediately so something in that

2382
01:37:55,139 --> 01:37:58,260
chirping tonight

2383
01:37:56,639 --> 01:38:00,179
um had another medicine we gave them

2384
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:02,400
once that I didn't realize had a lecture

2385
01:38:00,179 --> 01:38:04,800
in it and both times he had really

2386
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:06,479
adverse reactions and I can only

2387
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,500
difference in that is their terpene

2388
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:10,319
profile

2389
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:12,479
when you change these formulations that

2390
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:16,619
you're giving them how quickly do you

2391
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:19,259
see a difference in his symptoms in his

2392
01:38:16,619 --> 01:38:21,539
response to it like when you change if

2393
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:25,920
you change his oil this morning he'll

2394
01:38:21,539 --> 01:38:28,139
immediately today yeah yeah I think that

2395
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:30,359
has the metabolism rate right just like

2396
01:38:28,139 --> 01:38:33,539
when we use it in other ways it's in our

2397
01:38:30,359 --> 01:38:36,119
system in its most effective time window

2398
01:38:33,539 --> 01:38:38,880
it's in that four to six hour range and

2399
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:40,859
you know I had used High CBD oils with

2400
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:44,279
those stick with silos here but for a

2401
01:38:40,859 --> 01:38:45,960
year and never had it we had some

2402
01:38:44,279 --> 01:38:47,939
cognitive benefit but never helped with

2403
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:50,579
a seizure he said he sees every single

2404
01:38:47,939 --> 01:38:52,500
day on the dot and when we got to more

2405
01:38:50,579 --> 01:38:54,679
balanced profiles and it was actually

2406
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:58,139
that strained many Haze the first time

2407
01:38:54,679 --> 01:39:00,779
when he tried when we started that he

2408
01:38:58,139 --> 01:39:03,319
had like 80 seizures on Friday we

2409
01:39:00,779 --> 01:39:06,179
started the medic Haze Saturday morning

2410
01:39:03,319 --> 01:39:08,399
and he didn't have a seizure for four

2411
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:10,980
months it was his first time in three

2412
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:14,339
years he hadn't seen so it the onset was

2413
01:39:10,979 --> 01:39:16,559
immediate his body immediately had the

2414
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:19,020
tools it needed to correct the problem

2415
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:21,300
and the same with the adverse reactions

2416
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:23,280
when we gave it to him that day it was

2417
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:27,119
like holy crap what has happened you

2418
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:30,179
know so I have heard some parents in Dr

2419
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:33,420
Bonnie Goldstein has talked about this

2420
01:39:30,179 --> 01:39:36,480
um a tribute a four to six week period

2421
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:39,119
to just keep trying to implement nation

2422
01:39:36,479 --> 01:39:40,500
in the brain so where and I would see

2423
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:42,539
that as maybe something different going

2424
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:45,539
on than an endocannabinoid deficiency

2425
01:39:42,539 --> 01:39:46,979
disorder or a regulatory issue but when

2426
01:39:45,539 --> 01:39:50,158
you have

2427
01:39:46,979 --> 01:39:52,138
constant CBD doses there's the thought

2428
01:39:50,158 --> 01:39:54,059
that what could be happening is some of

2429
01:39:52,139 --> 01:39:55,619
the swelling starts to go down in the

2430
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:58,320
brain and when it goes down to a certain

2431
01:39:55,619 --> 01:40:00,719
point they see all of a sudden the onset

2432
01:39:58,319 --> 01:40:03,779
of some kind of efficacy and she's

2433
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:05,460
talked about that quite a bit but in my

2434
01:40:03,779 --> 01:40:08,599
personal experience I haven't seen that

2435
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:11,399
I've seen we we see it relatively

2436
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:14,820
quickly immediately like that day or the

2437
01:40:11,399 --> 01:40:16,619
next day or we don't what's uh the

2438
01:40:14,819 --> 01:40:17,939
longest Silas has ever gone without a

2439
01:40:16,619 --> 01:40:21,899
seizure

2440
01:40:17,939 --> 01:40:23,819
almost six months yeah well it depends

2441
01:40:21,899 --> 01:40:26,339
he has 10 different kinds of seizures so

2442
01:40:23,819 --> 01:40:28,500
when we've started him on the medihaze

2443
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:31,699
he went a year and a half without a

2444
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:31,698
single Grand Mall seizure

2445
01:40:32,119 --> 01:40:38,039
yeah 10 he has 10 different kinds So

2446
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:39,780
within that window we went almost six

2447
01:40:38,039 --> 01:40:41,399
months without any seizures and then we

2448
01:40:39,779 --> 01:40:45,119
had some what are called myoclonic

2449
01:40:41,399 --> 01:40:47,819
spasms these smaller uh seizures and

2450
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:49,439
but it was a year and a half before we

2451
01:40:47,819 --> 01:40:51,420
had what would be considered a dangerous

2452
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:54,599
you know a dangerous or serious teacher

2453
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:57,420
so we saw amazing effects and then that

2454
01:40:54,600 --> 01:41:00,719
was from 2500 seizures a month you know

2455
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:01,800
to zero it was I mean and that's really

2456
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:03,539
when I

2457
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:05,300
you can't you can't experience something

2458
01:41:03,539 --> 01:41:08,279
like that and not be a hundred percent

2459
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:11,119
convinced of the efficacy of of cannabis

2460
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:13,319
as a medicine so yeah

2461
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:16,619
go ahead

2462
01:41:13,319 --> 01:41:20,639
um I just wanted to ask a question so is

2463
01:41:16,619 --> 01:41:22,319
uh Silas taking uh is my voice okay

2464
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:25,020
yeah it was a bit robotic for a second

2465
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:26,698
but it's it's good now it's okay now

2466
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:28,980
um I'm just wondering is Forest taking

2467
01:41:26,698 --> 01:41:30,899
just a rescue dose with the intranasal

2468
01:41:28,979 --> 01:41:32,759
or is he doing like a daily maintenance

2469
01:41:30,899 --> 01:41:34,559
dose for those periods when he's gone

2470
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:35,820
seizure free like you mentioned he did

2471
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,980
the one

2472
01:41:35,819 --> 01:41:39,719
dose and then with seizure free for

2473
01:41:37,979 --> 01:41:41,638
three months like is that taking it

2474
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:43,260
every day or is he taking like one

2475
01:41:41,639 --> 01:41:47,219
treatment and then feeling that effect

2476
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:48,480
can you do it every four hours yeah and

2477
01:41:47,219 --> 01:41:50,158
that's you know that's what we see is a

2478
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:53,339
lot of people ask can cannabis be a cure

2479
01:41:50,158 --> 01:41:54,839
you know and I've just I no I don't in

2480
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:57,060
what I've read about how it works in the

2481
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:59,880
body and what we've seen it's it's not

2482
01:41:57,060 --> 01:42:02,639
it's more of a supplement you know and

2483
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:04,500
it's it's those spinal cannabinoids are

2484
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:06,239
supplementing in the lack in our

2485
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:08,039
endogenous cannabinoid system as long as

2486
01:42:06,238 --> 01:42:10,079
they're there and when they're gone the

2487
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:11,698
body can no longer utilize them and the

2488
01:42:10,079 --> 01:42:13,439
problems and consequences sort of

2489
01:42:11,698 --> 01:42:15,178
manifest I mean we saved some of our in

2490
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:17,638
our Oedipus tissue so you do get some

2491
01:42:15,179 --> 01:42:20,579
residual trickling but for the most part

2492
01:42:17,639 --> 01:42:22,859
you know it's it's in the system and

2493
01:42:20,579 --> 01:42:24,779
it's therapeutic dose you know I some

2494
01:42:22,859 --> 01:42:27,059
people go a couple times a day I've

2495
01:42:24,779 --> 01:42:29,279
found that the more consistent I can

2496
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:31,679
keep that level the more effective so we

2497
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:33,779
go every four hours you know just to be

2498
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:35,819
right on that point of uh the metabolism

2499
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:38,179
rate in the body

2500
01:42:35,819 --> 01:42:40,618
well every four hours or do you do oral

2501
01:42:38,179 --> 01:42:42,359
intranasal is only the breakout of a ton

2502
01:42:40,618 --> 01:42:45,059
of chronic seizure so that's meant is

2503
01:42:42,359 --> 01:42:46,979
we've a hundred percent been able to use

2504
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:49,260
that as a rescue medication for

2505
01:42:46,979 --> 01:42:50,819
toniconics I haven't seen it work really

2506
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:52,679
well with other types of cluster

2507
01:42:50,819 --> 01:42:54,719
seizures without we don't have to go

2508
01:42:52,679 --> 01:42:57,118
totally in the epilepsy world but you

2509
01:42:54,719 --> 01:43:01,500
know you like those Forest what dose is

2510
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:03,118
effective for rescue in a nasal spray

2511
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:04,800
that see that's what's great about

2512
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:06,839
understanding cannabinoids is we've

2513
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,520
actually been able to adjust that for

2514
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:10,679
different children um there are certain

2515
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:13,440
children's who are the the stuff that's

2516
01:43:10,679 --> 01:43:15,300
on the market is at five milligrams THC

2517
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:16,859
per spray

2518
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:19,020
um and that's just I don't know why they

2519
01:43:16,859 --> 01:43:20,339
landed there but what we do is you know

2520
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:22,679
there are some kids who are sensitive to

2521
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:25,319
THC and we've actually seen still

2522
01:43:22,679 --> 01:43:28,500
benefit by bringing that down to one

2523
01:43:25,319 --> 01:43:30,420
milligram THC or two and then having CBD

2524
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:33,000
and other cannabinoids in there as well

2525
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:36,118
but typically what you're seeing in the

2526
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,340
market and we use something similar for

2527
01:43:36,118 --> 01:43:41,099
Silas it's about around five milligrams

2528
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:43,020
it's a 0.1 ml sprayer so they last

2529
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:44,639
forever that's another thing about

2530
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:46,139
the nasal spray that's why it's a

2531
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:48,900
sensitive issue for me it's only for

2532
01:43:46,139 --> 01:43:51,719
life saving and you're talking 0.1 ml

2533
01:43:48,899 --> 01:43:53,719
per spray so with a gram you're offering

2534
01:43:51,719 --> 01:43:56,219
you know 500

2535
01:43:53,719 --> 01:44:00,118
you know you can offer quite a bit of of

2536
01:43:56,219 --> 01:44:02,158
rescue for for a family and what you're

2537
01:44:00,118 --> 01:44:04,559
supplementing or what you're relieving

2538
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:07,738
is the need for the pharmaceutical

2539
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:09,900
rescue meds and those are always heavy

2540
01:44:07,738 --> 01:44:12,959
benzodiazepines

2541
01:44:09,899 --> 01:44:15,539
um Ativan diastat verse said you know so

2542
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:18,480
they're really intense nasty drugs like

2543
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:20,039
they would cause just as much problem as

2544
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:22,439
the seizures in a lot of ways because

2545
01:44:20,039 --> 01:44:23,939
you get this benzo withdrawal and dump

2546
01:44:22,439 --> 01:44:26,279
afterwards so you have these just

2547
01:44:23,939 --> 01:44:28,500
emotional crying kids and you're trying

2548
01:44:26,279 --> 01:44:31,738
to console them from the seizures so

2549
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:35,399
we've a hundred percent been able to uh

2550
01:44:31,738 --> 01:44:37,079
switch purely to cannabis rescue sprays

2551
01:44:35,399 --> 01:44:39,479
and it's they're working really well for

2552
01:44:37,079 --> 01:44:41,760
us because we use them for terminal

2553
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:44,339
clonics other types of clusters they I

2554
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:46,320
haven't seen them work you know so kids

2555
01:44:44,340 --> 01:44:48,300
who have focal clusters or myoclonic

2556
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:50,340
clusters it doesn't seem to work but

2557
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:53,699
something about when the brain's in that

2558
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:56,579
full ton of chronic seizure mode uh 20

2559
01:44:53,698 --> 01:44:58,678
20 seconds or so and it they snap right

2560
01:44:56,579 --> 01:45:00,359
out of it I had one more question for

2561
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:02,880
you for us if you didn't mind

2562
01:45:00,359 --> 01:45:05,399
sure I was wondering if you went through

2563
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:07,618
the variety of extraction processes to

2564
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:10,079
find the one that you guys are using now

2565
01:45:07,618 --> 01:45:11,759
or if you just kind of came across that

2566
01:45:10,079 --> 01:45:13,500
one early and it worked and that's the

2567
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:16,320
one you've stuck with

2568
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:19,679
no no we we went through so I've used

2569
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:22,859
well I haven't used all of them

2570
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:24,719
um I've always stayed away from BHO type

2571
01:45:22,859 --> 01:45:26,099
of extractions just because you know I

2572
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:28,319
don't know a lot of people down here who

2573
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:30,960
do it super well

2574
01:45:28,319 --> 01:45:34,198
um but we have went through this we have

2575
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:36,480
some many days uh rosin right here this

2576
01:45:34,198 --> 01:45:38,698
is a good good amount of medication we

2577
01:45:36,479 --> 01:45:43,379
went through those processes we went

2578
01:45:38,698 --> 01:45:46,618
through CO2 and uh then settled on

2579
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:50,039
the ethanol extraction not because I

2580
01:45:46,618 --> 01:45:51,238
want to be 100 solvent free but one the

2581
01:45:50,039 --> 01:45:53,039
people that we have doing it are

2582
01:45:51,238 --> 01:45:54,359
probably the best I've seen so when you

2583
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:57,359
get really good at your crash you're

2584
01:45:54,359 --> 01:46:00,539
able to get the solvents out uh for the

2585
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:02,759
most part but what that did is it and I

2586
01:46:00,539 --> 01:46:04,439
wish we had a smell of vision here where

2587
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:06,840
I could have you guys experience it but

2588
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:09,299
it's a process that is able to really

2589
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:10,860
maintain a lot of the whole plant and

2590
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:12,960
and working with it with what I had to

2591
01:46:10,859 --> 01:46:15,719
work with the CO2 extractors that I had

2592
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:17,819
it was great it was crystal clear but it

2593
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:20,460
was really there was almost no smell to

2594
01:46:17,819 --> 01:46:22,380
it at all it really extracted out a lot

2595
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:24,179
of the the

2596
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:25,800
terpenes I know there are people who are

2597
01:46:24,179 --> 01:46:27,658
able to do it with the terpenes but I

2598
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:30,840
didn't have access to it at the time so

2599
01:46:27,658 --> 01:46:34,379
we settled on that because it got me the

2600
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:37,500
best whole plant profile from what we

2601
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:39,920
had to work with down here is uh in our

2602
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,920
communities

2603
01:46:42,779 --> 01:46:45,539
one more question

2604
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:48,319
um

2605
01:46:45,539 --> 01:46:51,359
uh what was I gonna say oh with the

2606
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:52,738
types of cultivars you're finding are

2607
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:55,559
you paying attention to the terpene

2608
01:46:52,738 --> 01:46:57,779
profiles like have you noticed like Lena

2609
01:46:55,560 --> 01:47:00,480
luel has been helpful like I know that

2610
01:46:57,779 --> 01:47:02,219
that has some effect efficacy for

2611
01:47:00,479 --> 01:47:03,359
um different types of seizures so I'm

2612
01:47:02,219 --> 01:47:05,039
just wondering if you have any

2613
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:06,779
experience with that or working with

2614
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:09,238
lavender or other

2615
01:47:06,779 --> 01:47:11,939
uh plants that can also be helpful

2616
01:47:09,238 --> 01:47:13,500
together with cannabis of course I've

2617
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:14,719
got some test results in front of me

2618
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:18,779
Forest

2619
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:22,920
yeah we're talking about AC DC being of

2620
01:47:18,779 --> 01:47:25,439
benefit to Silas and uh how Elektra was

2621
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:27,840
problematic for him so I went and found

2622
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:34,079
uh some of the test results from those

2623
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:36,480
two varieties and uh AC DC uh has uh

2624
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:39,439
in this particular test results it's a

2625
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:42,539
concentrate no this is a tincture

2626
01:47:39,439 --> 01:47:46,379
uh three quarters of a percent Premier

2627
01:47:42,539 --> 01:47:49,079
lean a little bit of linole less than a

2628
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:51,800
tenth of a percent uh a third of a

2629
01:47:49,079 --> 01:47:54,238
percent beta mercine Citronelle

2630
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:57,300
chlorophylline oxide

2631
01:47:54,238 --> 01:48:00,138
and then beta chlorophylline is by far

2632
01:47:57,300 --> 01:48:02,400
the largest terpene in that test result

2633
01:48:00,139 --> 01:48:04,100
and meantime if you go over here to

2634
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:08,879
Electra four

2635
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:12,420
uh the big one by far is terpene

2636
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:15,118
terphenoline is 1.8 percent

2637
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:18,300
and 2.2 percent limiting

2638
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:21,539
in Elektra and uh half a almost a

2639
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:22,980
percent of beta mercine but no beta

2640
01:48:21,539 --> 01:48:24,960
chlorophylline

2641
01:48:22,979 --> 01:48:25,529
and no

2642
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,118
um

2643
01:48:25,529 --> 01:48:29,899
[Music]

2644
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:33,000
um what was that other one

2645
01:48:29,899 --> 01:48:36,899
significantly reduced amount of uh

2646
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:41,279
terpenoling yeah compared to the electro

2647
01:48:36,899 --> 01:48:43,559
four what about uh was there um I said

2648
01:48:41,279 --> 01:48:46,618
there was a little bit in the AC DC but

2649
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:48,239
in the election was there any none Nolan

2650
01:48:46,618 --> 01:48:50,279
a little in the Elektra

2651
01:48:48,238 --> 01:48:52,019
that's interesting because one of my

2652
01:48:50,279 --> 01:48:54,719
favorite cultivars being the haze

2653
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:56,760
varieties it seems to be high in

2654
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,439
terpenaline really does mess with

2655
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:00,119
certain people's central nervous systems

2656
01:48:58,439 --> 01:49:01,638
and just blows them into full-blown

2657
01:49:00,118 --> 01:49:04,920
anxiety attack

2658
01:49:01,639 --> 01:49:08,579
I've seen like so many times

2659
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:11,158
welcome Alec hey

2660
01:49:08,579 --> 01:49:13,260
we're just talking testing we're talking

2661
01:49:11,158 --> 01:49:15,539
cannabinoids we're talking terpenes when

2662
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:16,520
are you guys going to start testing for

2663
01:49:15,539 --> 01:49:19,760
more terpenes

2664
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:21,960
[Music]

2665
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:24,000
is like one of my favorite terpenes and

2666
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:26,039
it took me a while to get into it um I

2667
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,560
when I I used to be in the Navy um I was

2668
01:49:26,039 --> 01:49:29,579
in the Navy for five years and and uh

2669
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,039
when I first got out of the Navy

2670
01:49:29,579 --> 01:49:34,920
terpenolene was actually the terpenish

2671
01:49:32,039 --> 01:49:37,319
my buddy shared uh in a bowl with me and

2672
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:39,179
I freaked out um and had such a bad

2673
01:49:37,319 --> 01:49:41,698
experience that I had to go kind of

2674
01:49:39,179 --> 01:49:43,679
excuse myself from our hangout and I had

2675
01:49:41,698 --> 01:49:45,118
to go to sleep and and it set me off on

2676
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:47,158
a path where you know for the first like

2677
01:49:45,118 --> 01:49:48,238
10 20 times it gave me incredible

2678
01:49:47,158 --> 01:49:50,698
anxiety

2679
01:49:48,238 --> 01:49:53,099
so check this out the conversation we're

2680
01:49:50,698 --> 01:49:55,019
having right now uh forest was talking

2681
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:58,020
about different CBD cultivars that he

2682
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:59,760
was using for Silas and that the one I

2683
01:49:58,020 --> 01:50:01,199
guess what we're figuring out here from

2684
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,460
what Wade was saying and correct me if

2685
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:04,618
I'm wrong but one of the main

2686
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:07,380
differences was terpenaline that in the

2687
01:50:04,618 --> 01:50:09,960
one that set Silas off there was a

2688
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:12,960
higher level of terpenoline Electra was

2689
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:15,300
it called Electra four had almost four

2690
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:20,039
times the amount uh in a similar

2691
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:22,139
preparation of uh terpenoline as AC DC

2692
01:50:20,039 --> 01:50:24,840
but I wonder both have very similar

2693
01:50:22,139 --> 01:50:27,060
cannabinoid profiles I wonder if that

2694
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:29,039
mechanism is similar that mechanism that

2695
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:30,780
gives people an anxiety attack and sets

2696
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:33,000
off it seemingly feels like your entire

2697
01:50:30,779 --> 01:50:33,719
central nervous system has been just

2698
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,020
like

2699
01:50:33,719 --> 01:50:38,760
like set off and I can imagine if go

2700
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:40,560
ahead for us let's say we're moving into

2701
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:43,260
speculation or maybe an Italian of

2702
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:44,820
course add to this but I would think you

2703
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:46,500
know if you look at just logic would

2704
01:50:44,819 --> 01:50:48,658
lead us to believe that when we're

2705
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:51,118
talking about epilepsy in general and

2706
01:50:48,658 --> 01:50:52,920
some other neurological conditions we're

2707
01:50:51,118 --> 01:50:55,259
talking about overexcitation at the

2708
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:57,539
presynaptic nerve right an overactive

2709
01:50:55,260 --> 01:51:01,320
nerve at the endocannabinoid system is

2710
01:50:57,539 --> 01:51:03,539
failing to bring into homeostasis so if

2711
01:51:01,319 --> 01:51:05,519
we're feeling these you know effects of

2712
01:51:03,539 --> 01:51:07,560
maybe anxiety or things like that that

2713
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:10,199
to me leads me to believe that there's

2714
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:13,739
like a higher level of bonding at that

2715
01:51:10,198 --> 01:51:15,839
at that CB1 receptor it would all lead

2716
01:51:13,738 --> 01:51:17,638
kind of into the same direction and and

2717
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:19,860
that could be something that would is

2718
01:51:17,639 --> 01:51:22,980
interesting someone much smarter than I

2719
01:51:19,859 --> 01:51:24,420
should look into that Natasha well I

2720
01:51:22,979 --> 01:51:26,579
think that's a really good call on that

2721
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:29,158
too because um you know if you you know

2722
01:51:26,579 --> 01:51:30,840
I've seen uh you know quite a few times

2723
01:51:29,158 --> 01:51:33,238
you know at different kind of you know

2724
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:34,860
big uh cannabis culture events when when

2725
01:51:33,238 --> 01:51:37,559
somebody's on almost you know being

2726
01:51:34,859 --> 01:51:40,559
served up with way too big of a dab or

2727
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:42,539
dose you know of cannabis and and you

2728
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:44,760
know kind of it almost looks like they

2729
01:51:42,539 --> 01:51:46,979
slightly start to go into a convulsive

2730
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:49,560
type situation you know or like almost

2731
01:51:46,979 --> 01:51:51,618
like a mini seizure type thing so it's

2732
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:53,940
interesting in the uh you know overex

2733
01:51:51,618 --> 01:51:55,500
excitement of the CB1 receptor over

2734
01:51:53,939 --> 01:51:57,000
stimulation the CB1 are separate because

2735
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:59,279
you know when that seems to happen it

2736
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,198
seems to you know set people off even if

2737
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:03,420
they're you know once enjoying cannabis

2738
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:05,158
you know into this path of you know kind

2739
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:07,340
of starting to become more anxiety each

2740
01:52:05,158 --> 01:52:10,738
time you do it

2741
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:13,920
also a combination of low blood sugar

2742
01:52:10,738 --> 01:52:16,439
and low blood pressure that sets people

2743
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:18,000
off like this you would agree but Sam

2744
01:52:16,439 --> 01:52:19,738
I'll tell you something okay like

2745
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,380
because you've been smoking full melts

2746
01:52:19,738 --> 01:52:24,899
the longest so you you might have a a

2747
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:28,260
faded view of the reality of the

2748
01:52:24,899 --> 01:52:30,000
situation but by 1999 when I released

2749
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:33,119
Bubble Bags okay and started making full

2750
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:36,359
mail bubble that was new to most people

2751
01:52:33,118 --> 01:52:39,738
not to you but to most people it was new

2752
01:52:36,359 --> 01:52:42,658
and I'll tell you I knocked out

2753
01:52:39,738 --> 01:52:44,698
dozens of people in those days and I did

2754
01:52:42,658 --> 01:52:46,439
not give them huge monster rips I'd just

2755
01:52:44,698 --> 01:52:48,359
be like here have a rip or up we'd roll

2756
01:52:46,439 --> 01:52:50,279
a snake into a joint here have a we go

2757
01:52:48,359 --> 01:52:52,738
to a Ben Harper concert five people in

2758
01:52:50,279 --> 01:52:55,319
one night unconscious fall down forward

2759
01:52:52,738 --> 01:52:57,839
sideways like it was a nightmare I don't

2760
01:52:55,319 --> 01:52:59,939
see it anymore I very rarely see anyone

2761
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,560
unless it's at some weird cup and

2762
01:52:59,939 --> 01:53:03,359
they're dehydrated and they haven't

2763
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:05,760
slept in two days because they've

2764
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:07,859
traveled far you see at the odd time

2765
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:09,139
there but I used to see it I mean it got

2766
01:53:07,859 --> 01:53:12,599
so bad

2767
01:53:09,139 --> 01:53:14,460
that I wanted to get pads for in front

2768
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:16,440
of my booth at the Cannabis Cup when we

2769
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:19,380
were still at the Pax party house

2770
01:53:16,439 --> 01:53:21,000
because so many people collapsed in

2771
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:22,739
front of my booth like completely

2772
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,380
collapsed and other people's booths as

2773
01:53:22,738 --> 01:53:28,198
well I seen a guy collapse on top of

2774
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:30,840
hams ham brushland had a had a little

2775
01:53:28,198 --> 01:53:33,000
glass Booth one year and this this kid

2776
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:35,400
fell literally on Ham's glass and then

2777
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,738
rolled over onto the next guy's glass

2778
01:53:35,399 --> 01:53:40,698
table just like breaking glass like you

2779
01:53:37,738 --> 01:53:40,698
wouldn't believe it was

2780
01:53:40,738 --> 01:53:46,259
what I used to see a lot was people

2781
01:53:43,319 --> 01:53:49,859
would sort of sit or Squat and take a

2782
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:51,480
hit and then they would stand up

2783
01:53:49,859 --> 01:53:53,099
yeah that's a good way to fall down

2784
01:53:51,479 --> 01:53:55,618
there's a lot we don't know a lot about

2785
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:56,880
CBD some of these other cannabinoids as

2786
01:53:55,618 --> 01:53:59,339
much as we'd like to know but one of the

2787
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:01,739
things we do know is how it modulates

2788
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:03,719
thc's ability to bond to the receptor

2789
01:54:01,738 --> 01:54:05,459
and as we learn that and then you take

2790
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:08,158
that to what people explain like oh well

2791
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:11,340
when I have THC or CBD and I introduce

2792
01:54:08,158 --> 01:54:13,500
CBD it relieves the anxiety it relieves

2793
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:15,480
some of these negative effects and you

2794
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:17,639
know what is important I think to

2795
01:54:15,479 --> 01:54:20,218
realize is that when those when THC

2796
01:54:17,639 --> 01:54:22,500
bonds to that CB1 receptor it's not just

2797
01:54:20,219 --> 01:54:25,920
a black and white response how long it

2798
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:28,920
bonds is like a a spectrum of what type

2799
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:30,899
of uh effects you're going to see and

2800
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:32,520
it's on the longer end of that bonding

2801
01:54:30,899 --> 01:54:34,920
Spectrum where you can see some of that

2802
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:36,780
panic and anxiety and those sort of

2803
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:38,940
things and I think when we hear people

2804
01:54:36,779 --> 01:54:41,099
talk about okay you know I used to smoke

2805
01:54:38,939 --> 01:54:43,198
in the 60s and 70s and it was a lot

2806
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:44,460
better we used to giggle and that was

2807
01:54:43,198 --> 01:54:46,919
just too much I get all these negative

2808
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:49,560
effects it's not just that cannabis is

2809
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:51,779
stronger in THC levels which obviously

2810
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:55,080
it is it's the company it's like it's a

2811
01:54:51,779 --> 01:54:57,059
one-two punch of more THC and less of

2812
01:54:55,079 --> 01:54:59,939
the cannabinoids that are there to

2813
01:54:57,060 --> 01:55:02,039
modulate how THC bonds to that receptor

2814
01:54:59,939 --> 01:55:05,698
so you get longer bonding times which

2815
01:55:02,039 --> 01:55:08,219
has an intense effect so these then you

2816
01:55:05,698 --> 01:55:10,618
compound that by concentrating it in in

2817
01:55:08,219 --> 01:55:12,118
other ways and yeah you're going to have

2818
01:55:10,618 --> 01:55:14,158
some now you're getting into the thing

2819
01:55:12,118 --> 01:55:16,799
yeah

2820
01:55:14,158 --> 01:55:18,179
that's therapy right there that's why I

2821
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,400
think the future of like General

2822
01:55:18,179 --> 01:55:23,579
cannabis oh

2823
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:24,479
hint out there but I think it's in that

2824
01:55:23,579 --> 01:55:25,559
um

2825
01:55:24,479 --> 01:55:29,158
you know

2826
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:31,800
six to one one to six sort of balanced

2827
01:55:29,158 --> 01:55:33,960
Spectrum more in the middle as we we've

2828
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:36,480
really pushed it out to THC but I think

2829
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:39,000
is a craft cannabis becomes more and

2830
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:40,799
more desired is we push those spectrums

2831
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,020
maybe back inward we're going to find

2832
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:45,000
more of that effect that has different

2833
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:47,520
bubble leader giggly sort of effects

2834
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,079
that people miss and it's not as risky

2835
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:51,119
you know you don't you don't take a hit

2836
01:55:49,079 --> 01:55:53,039
and have a bad experience that makes you

2837
01:55:51,118 --> 01:55:54,179
never want to come back you know I think

2838
01:55:53,039 --> 01:55:57,179
there's going to be a market in the

2839
01:55:54,179 --> 01:55:59,520
future for just some you know like the

2840
01:55:57,179 --> 01:56:01,260
you know sometimes we want Jack Daniels

2841
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:03,540
and sometimes we want a chorus light you

2842
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:05,460
know you gotta have some a little

2843
01:56:03,539 --> 01:56:09,238
storage

2844
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:12,179
can't you get really really high quality

2845
01:56:09,238 --> 01:56:15,479
cannabis or or dry sift or whatever the

2846
01:56:12,179 --> 01:56:18,179
product is and just take a smaller

2847
01:56:15,479 --> 01:56:19,500
amount rather than taking such large

2848
01:56:18,179 --> 01:56:21,539
amounts

2849
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:22,679
well I mean that's hard to do when

2850
01:56:21,539 --> 01:56:25,019
you're smoking though right isn't that

2851
01:56:22,679 --> 01:56:26,819
the hard part about taking a rip is

2852
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:29,880
because I think it's hard for the human

2853
01:56:26,819 --> 01:56:32,819
ego but I I constantly am all about

2854
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:35,159
turning people on to taking a rip

2855
01:56:32,819 --> 01:56:37,380
without having a bad experience sorry

2856
01:56:35,158 --> 01:56:39,479
micro dose people I give them the

2857
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:41,219
smallest tiniest and some people say

2858
01:56:39,479 --> 01:56:42,839
it's perfect and others are like oh I

2859
01:56:41,219 --> 01:56:44,579
didn't feel anything I said well now you

2860
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:46,319
can take another one instead of being

2861
01:56:44,579 --> 01:56:47,939
all Whited out on that chair right now

2862
01:56:46,319 --> 01:56:50,039
because you took too big a one well

2863
01:56:47,939 --> 01:56:52,559
that's what they say they said this

2864
01:56:50,039 --> 01:56:54,238
again they say dose low and titrate slow

2865
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,280
you know and and especially when you're

2866
01:56:54,238 --> 01:56:57,899
like trying to frame a positive response

2867
01:56:56,279 --> 01:56:59,819
with your endocannabinoid system because

2868
01:56:57,899 --> 01:57:01,259
I mean especially for people that have

2869
01:56:59,819 --> 01:57:03,179
post traumatic stress whether it's a vet

2870
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:05,340
or anybody that's experienced trauma

2871
01:57:03,179 --> 01:57:07,020
because from what I've seen is you know

2872
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:09,420
so typically they almost have a higher

2873
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:11,520
propensity to have this like really

2874
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:12,960
negative kind of inner you know kind of

2875
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:14,280
at least at the beginning you know

2876
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:16,800
because what you see with a lot of vets

2877
01:57:14,279 --> 01:57:20,519
is you know that are you know the the

2878
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:22,619
you know the um Iraq bets and then the

2879
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:23,880
you know Afghan war vets the ones that

2880
01:57:22,618 --> 01:57:25,738
you know come back with post-traumatic

2881
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:27,779
stress you know try to you know start

2882
01:57:25,738 --> 01:57:29,819
using cannabis you know have a really

2883
01:57:27,779 --> 01:57:32,039
high propensity to have this you know

2884
01:57:29,819 --> 01:57:34,319
incredibly negative kind of uh you know

2885
01:57:32,039 --> 01:57:36,539
effect from taking THC even in you know

2886
01:57:34,319 --> 01:57:38,039
somewhat moderate amounts but but then

2887
01:57:36,539 --> 01:57:39,420
what you see is you know that when they

2888
01:57:38,039 --> 01:57:41,219
start working with like you guys are

2889
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:43,800
saying like a you know 20 to one six to

2890
01:57:41,219 --> 01:57:46,439
one you know have you micro dosing THC

2891
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:48,000
you know having higher doses of CBD

2892
01:57:46,439 --> 01:57:49,919
going through the ritual of kind of

2893
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:52,020
rolling up a joint and grinding up some

2894
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,699
or you know kind of you know you see it

2895
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:55,380
really start to Prime people's system in

2896
01:57:53,698 --> 01:57:57,419
a in a positive way where they can start

2897
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:59,940
to you know tease out the you know

2898
01:57:57,420 --> 01:58:02,039
beneficial effects and then over time

2899
01:57:59,939 --> 01:58:04,138
start to be able to titrate up the THC

2900
01:58:02,039 --> 01:58:06,599
you know and then what you see is a flip

2901
01:58:04,139 --> 01:58:08,159
you know once somebody almost like I

2902
01:58:06,599 --> 01:58:09,659
really feel like it's a you know

2903
01:58:08,158 --> 01:58:11,579
whenever you start working with cannabis

2904
01:58:09,658 --> 01:58:13,198
you almost go through this like write a

2905
01:58:11,579 --> 01:58:14,939
passage you know because sometimes you

2906
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:17,098
got to feel weird you know you're all in

2907
01:58:14,939 --> 01:58:18,960
control of your mind and your ego and

2908
01:58:17,099 --> 01:58:20,760
sometimes like you know like you need to

2909
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:22,859
let go and the catastline like really

2910
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:24,420
humbles you out in that way you know and

2911
01:58:22,859 --> 01:58:26,639
almost like slabs you into the ground if

2912
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:28,440
you fight it you know and so I think

2913
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:29,819
it's almost something where we all need

2914
01:58:28,439 --> 01:58:31,198
to go through at some point another when

2915
01:58:29,819 --> 01:58:33,599
we're working with cannabis to truly

2916
01:58:31,198 --> 01:58:35,519
have the respect for the plant but but

2917
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:37,139
it's such a service that we have to you

2918
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,099
know set it up right for people because

2919
01:58:37,139 --> 01:58:38,940
you know we don't know what they're

2920
01:58:38,099 --> 01:58:40,500
going through and if they're going

2921
01:58:38,939 --> 01:58:41,879
through some really heavy post traumatic

2922
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:43,560
stress or what have you you know they

2923
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:45,779
might be set off forever if we give them

2924
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:47,159
too big of a dose of THC but but then

2925
01:58:45,779 --> 01:58:48,779
eventually over time once they've

2926
01:58:47,158 --> 01:58:50,638
developed that relationship and

2927
01:58:48,779 --> 01:58:51,840
established that you know right if you

2928
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:53,340
know passed through the right of passage

2929
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:55,139
with the plant and their relationship of

2930
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:56,699
the plant you see them typically flip

2931
01:58:55,139 --> 01:58:59,219
and you know if you look at the old

2932
01:58:56,698 --> 01:59:01,138
Vietnam vets and uh you know Korean war

2933
01:58:59,219 --> 01:59:02,939
vets you know typically you know they're

2934
01:59:01,139 --> 01:59:05,039
like Sam they're like [ __ ] CBD that's

2935
01:59:02,939 --> 01:59:07,379
for you know blah blah you know then

2936
01:59:05,039 --> 01:59:09,539
they they smoke like high terpenoline

2937
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:11,159
kind of sativa type feeling strains you

2938
01:59:09,539 --> 01:59:13,019
know and so so I think it's it's all

2939
01:59:11,158 --> 01:59:15,539
about you know the building up and and

2940
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:16,800
you know that you know those low titrate

2941
01:59:15,539 --> 01:59:18,179
slow things so you can you know

2942
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:20,579
experience a maximized positive effect

2943
01:59:18,179 --> 01:59:24,719
well I have a question Alec

2944
01:59:20,579 --> 01:59:27,300
um so not too long ago I I smoked um

2945
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:30,239
some some hash I think and I started

2946
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:32,340
shaking right like like I wasn't cold

2947
01:59:30,238 --> 01:59:33,899
but I felt like I was really cold and I

2948
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:36,420
was just like shaking and I was like I

2949
01:59:33,899 --> 01:59:38,158
can handle my grass you know I've ridden

2950
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:40,260
the [ __ ] snake man and I'm okay to

2951
01:59:38,158 --> 01:59:43,198
with the plan tuned into mother earth

2952
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:45,060
right but I was shaken I was shaking

2953
01:59:43,198 --> 01:59:46,919
like my hand was shaking

2954
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:48,960
I didn't know if I was like channeling a

2955
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:51,599
lot of energy at the time or if I was

2956
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:53,939
just and so I read about it online I

2957
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:57,599
went out and I checked them that so what

2958
01:59:53,939 --> 01:59:59,519
that was was that it that was a THC over

2959
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:00,900
but it's it's interesting because that's

2960
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:02,880
happened to me quite a few times it

2961
02:00:00,899 --> 02:00:04,618
hasn't happened to me uh anytime in the

2962
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:06,779
most recent time and maybe it's because

2963
02:00:04,618 --> 02:00:08,819
I'm down regulated or something but but

2964
02:00:06,779 --> 02:00:10,738
I was I used to call the stone chills

2965
02:00:08,819 --> 02:00:12,658
because like if I smoked you know

2966
02:00:10,738 --> 02:00:14,339
certain types of bed yeah so usually

2967
02:00:12,658 --> 02:00:16,559
like full body shakes like I'm almost

2968
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:18,119
like like Teeth chatter and I was like

2969
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:19,980
wow I'm like feel really cold but I'm

2970
02:00:18,118 --> 02:00:22,198
not really cold that's a real

2971
02:00:19,979 --> 02:00:24,658
interesting thing to study you're not

2972
02:00:22,198 --> 02:00:27,178
cold like like you have you could have a

2973
02:00:24,658 --> 02:00:30,059
blanket on you know but you're shaking

2974
02:00:27,179 --> 02:00:32,039
like like as if you're freezing cold and

2975
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:34,920
you're just so [ __ ] up man you know

2976
02:00:32,039 --> 02:00:38,760
that you're like shake out and what I

2977
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:40,079
read was that was a a t-h-c-o-d and that

2978
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:42,060
you if you take a little bit of the

2979
02:00:40,079 --> 02:00:44,460
Terps it'll kind of balance it up and I

2980
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:47,099
think talking uh or listening to Marcus

2981
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:50,279
earlier what he was saying about the

2982
02:00:47,099 --> 02:00:52,920
fact that he you know as as uh ingested

2983
02:00:50,279 --> 02:00:54,479
this comprehensive diversity of terpenes

2984
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:57,359
and what it did was it gave them this

2985
02:00:54,479 --> 02:00:59,819
clear crisp [ __ ] Vibe where he was

2986
02:00:57,359 --> 02:01:02,759
kind conscious collected and just

2987
02:00:59,819 --> 02:01:03,658
refined but really feeling great and he

2988
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:05,579
wasn't

2989
02:01:03,658 --> 02:01:09,259
tweak it out so maybe that has something

2990
02:01:05,579 --> 02:01:09,260
to do with it no shaking there

2991
02:01:12,738 --> 02:01:19,138
your teeth chattering both of those can

2992
02:01:15,779 --> 02:01:21,779
also be related to low blood sugar and

2993
02:01:19,139 --> 02:01:26,159
low blood pressure which can be brought

2994
02:01:21,779 --> 02:01:28,800
on by large amounts of THC quickly

2995
02:01:26,158 --> 02:01:31,019
there you go

2996
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:32,579
interesting thought well I just you guys

2997
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:35,280
were talking about people like falling

2998
02:01:32,579 --> 02:01:36,719
over and [ __ ] and maybe that that THC

2999
02:01:35,279 --> 02:01:38,039
too much of that could have something to

3000
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:40,920
do with it where there isn't a good

3001
02:01:38,039 --> 02:01:43,019
balance you know of the uh of the

3002
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:45,118
terpene or the Entourage effect right

3003
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:47,340
the combination of the terpenes with the

3004
02:01:45,118 --> 02:01:49,500
church with the THC to really regulate

3005
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:52,260
it if you're just doing straight THC

3006
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:54,800
shots maybe that could that could that

3007
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:58,560
could have something to do with it

3008
02:01:54,800 --> 02:02:00,599
help it happens easier if the right

3009
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:04,199
terpenes

3010
02:02:00,599 --> 02:02:07,380
you ever get those shakes out uh yes if

3011
02:02:04,198 --> 02:02:10,198
but it happens for me all the time if I

3012
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:13,020
have really low blood sugar uh I can't

3013
02:02:10,198 --> 02:02:15,419
regulate my body heat so easy or I will

3014
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:16,739
get shakes oh yeah it's the shake and

3015
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:18,599
bake

3016
02:02:16,738 --> 02:02:20,158
hey welcome Chimera you had something to

3017
02:02:18,599 --> 02:02:23,219
say on this

3018
02:02:20,158 --> 02:02:24,839
well not on the shaking part but um just

3019
02:02:23,219 --> 02:02:26,340
on the not people being not you know

3020
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:29,819
novel users

3021
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:31,679
um and I think two of the well for me

3022
02:02:29,819 --> 02:02:33,299
the ones that come up often are people

3023
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:35,579
that want to try canvas for the first

3024
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:37,739
time after they've been drinking you

3025
02:02:35,579 --> 02:02:39,238
know they're conditioned by Society to

3026
02:02:37,738 --> 02:02:41,039
be against it then when they've had a

3027
02:02:39,238 --> 02:02:42,959
few drinks they've got their inhibitions

3028
02:02:41,039 --> 02:02:44,698
down and they'll uh they're a little

3029
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:47,639
more likely to try it and that's not

3030
02:02:44,698 --> 02:02:49,079
really a good combination for crossfaded

3031
02:02:47,639 --> 02:02:51,599
yeah it's not a good it's not a good

3032
02:02:49,079 --> 02:02:53,579
combo for success

3033
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:55,199
um because people get the spins then

3034
02:02:53,579 --> 02:02:57,960
they you know then they're off it for

3035
02:02:55,198 --> 02:03:00,719
life like I like was saying

3036
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:01,980
um the other thing on dosing

3037
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:03,899
um and I I had this experience

3038
02:03:01,979 --> 02:03:06,118
experience with my mom once she came out

3039
02:03:03,899 --> 02:03:08,339
to visit and you know I had some some

3040
02:03:06,118 --> 02:03:10,259
pounds and kilos and

3041
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:12,000
kilos of seeds and plants and everything

3042
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:15,239
in my house it was all stashed away and

3043
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:18,060
hidden and she came out and I had had a

3044
02:03:15,238 --> 02:03:19,799
surgery and she to relax she took a

3045
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:22,500
little bit too much

3046
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:24,320
and uh you know was in my room 15

3047
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:28,639
minutes later trying to call the police

3048
02:03:24,319 --> 02:03:28,639
oh no so

3049
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:33,899
so you know and it was like I had to

3050
02:03:32,340 --> 02:03:35,219
talk her down and I knew all the signs

3051
02:03:33,899 --> 02:03:38,219
it was she had the heart you know she

3052
02:03:35,219 --> 02:03:39,599
had that fast heartbeat and uh you know

3053
02:03:38,219 --> 02:03:41,099
people when they're stoned they they

3054
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:42,659
feel that fast heartbeat that

3055
02:03:41,099 --> 02:03:45,840
tachycardia which is actually an

3056
02:03:42,658 --> 02:03:48,960
effective THC and and many of your

3057
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:51,719
friends are ever shaking too much the

3058
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:53,819
best thing to do is to uh give them a

3059
02:03:51,719 --> 02:03:56,460
large sifting bowl with a screen at the

3060
02:03:53,819 --> 02:03:58,859
bottom with a lot of Herb in it and let

3061
02:03:56,460 --> 02:04:01,319
them make cash for you

3062
02:03:58,859 --> 02:04:03,719
so any anyway anyway I forgot what I was

3063
02:04:01,319 --> 02:04:05,579
saying Ryan did she so she she was was

3064
02:04:03,719 --> 02:04:08,000
she trying to call the cops on you was

3065
02:04:05,579 --> 02:04:10,319
she turning on you no no no no

3066
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:12,179
she wanted to go to the hospital but she

3067
02:04:10,319 --> 02:04:14,579
came in and she was like we need to call

3068
02:04:12,179 --> 02:04:17,279
the police you know and it was like

3069
02:04:14,579 --> 02:04:18,658
and she had you know she was having that

3070
02:04:17,279 --> 02:04:20,460
Panic like I said when you get that

3071
02:04:18,658 --> 02:04:21,920
tachycardia

3072
02:04:20,460 --> 02:04:23,579
um and you're stoned people

3073
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:25,500
self-interpret that as something

3074
02:04:23,579 --> 02:04:28,380
catastrophic right and you know what

3075
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:30,899
Chimera even worse than that first they

3076
02:04:28,380 --> 02:04:33,599
react to it and they increase their

3077
02:04:30,899 --> 02:04:35,098
heartbeat even more and that's when they

3078
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:36,960
think they're gonna die well yeah it's a

3079
02:04:35,099 --> 02:04:40,380
self it's a self feedback loop right

3080
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:42,779
it's like you know High tachycardia they

3081
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:45,060
interpret it as catastrophic their heart

3082
02:04:42,779 --> 02:04:48,539
rate goes up even more

3083
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:51,060
here and then they get fear of the fear

3084
02:04:48,539 --> 02:04:52,319
yeah and that's what it was but it was

3085
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:54,360
actually pretty easy to bring her down

3086
02:04:52,319 --> 02:04:56,759
because you know I recognize the size

3087
02:04:54,359 --> 02:04:59,158
and I said okay look you're fine you're

3088
02:04:56,760 --> 02:05:01,199
just having tachycardia in 15 minutes

3089
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:03,118
this is going to be gone you know let's

3090
02:05:01,198 --> 02:05:05,399
go out I'll make you a glass of tea kind

3091
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:07,859
of thing and you know I was able to walk

3092
02:05:05,399 --> 02:05:10,500
her off the ledge so to speak but you

3093
02:05:07,859 --> 02:05:13,500
know I think as like the indoctrinated

3094
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:15,779
we need to be we need to be cognitive of

3095
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:17,819
who we're indoctrinated right and how we

3096
02:05:15,779 --> 02:05:19,439
indoctrinate them too you don't you

3097
02:05:17,819 --> 02:05:22,439
don't line somebody up of their first

3098
02:05:19,439 --> 02:05:25,500
time with a [ __ ] grab dab right it's

3099
02:05:22,439 --> 02:05:28,198
all about micro dosing cannabis do you

3100
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:31,079
see to a naive user like to a a system

3101
02:05:28,198 --> 02:05:33,719
that's never been primed before is a

3102
02:05:31,079 --> 02:05:35,579
really strong drug extreme yeah it's

3103
02:05:33,719 --> 02:05:37,198
it's irresponsible you know I use a

3104
02:05:35,579 --> 02:05:39,479
video there's a video on YouTube you can

3105
02:05:37,198 --> 02:05:40,919
look up and I'll I'll find the name and

3106
02:05:39,479 --> 02:05:42,899
I'll say it later so I'm not sure the

3107
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:44,639
name but it's a it's just like college

3108
02:05:42,899 --> 02:05:47,579
kids in a dorm room and they give this

3109
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:50,179
kid who's never smoked cannabis in his

3110
02:05:47,579 --> 02:05:52,920
life this huge ripping dab

3111
02:05:50,179 --> 02:05:55,859
too he gets

3112
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:58,560
um cannabinoid induced Paralysis on the

3113
02:05:55,859 --> 02:06:00,299
spot which is a real thing Dr

3114
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:03,300
O'Shaughnessy first wrote about it in

3115
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:06,000
the 1800s and finally they go to touch

3116
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:08,579
him and he snaps out of it and he goes

3117
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,198
into this I mean just huge panic attack

3118
02:06:08,579 --> 02:06:13,198
because he was conscious but couldn't

3119
02:06:10,198 --> 02:06:15,598
move yeah I've seen that video it's it's

3120
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:18,598
remarkably funny it's heartbreaking and

3121
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:20,520
I use that video when I have to have the

3122
02:06:18,599 --> 02:06:23,039
because I like to have the conversation

3123
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:25,860
about all use is medicinal use you know

3124
02:06:23,039 --> 02:06:27,179
because I think that really means that

3125
02:06:25,859 --> 02:06:29,219
there's nothing we could ever do wrong

3126
02:06:27,179 --> 02:06:31,500
and I think we can we can use this plan

3127
02:06:29,219 --> 02:06:33,599
you can use anything irresponsibly and

3128
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:36,658
that video really is a great example

3129
02:06:33,599 --> 02:06:38,219
because that kid is likely ruined ruined

3130
02:06:36,658 --> 02:06:39,960
from ever having some sort of healthy

3131
02:06:38,219 --> 02:06:42,000
relationship with cannabis in his life

3132
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:43,679
because the people who were with him

3133
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,939
thought to be funny I thought it would

3134
02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:46,639
be cool and we're just using

3135
02:06:44,939 --> 02:06:49,500
irresponsible

3136
02:06:46,639 --> 02:06:51,420
drugs are a choice like you don't you

3137
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:52,920
can't be dosing people that don't you

3138
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:54,239
can't be sandbagging people we used to

3139
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:55,920
call it we call it sandbagging you know

3140
02:06:54,238 --> 02:06:57,839
loading somebody up with a bunch of LSD

3141
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:59,940
when they aren't expecting a hit but I

3142
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:02,219
think it's totally wrong um drugs are a

3143
02:06:59,939 --> 02:07:03,960
choice right like your state of mind is

3144
02:07:02,219 --> 02:07:05,460
a choice and you have to be prepared for

3145
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:06,960
that state of mind and that altered

3146
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:07,980
state of mind well you know and that's

3147
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:10,380
one of the things that you know because

3148
02:07:07,979 --> 02:07:12,000
I I um and I I might have even mentioned

3149
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:13,739
this before on House Church but you know

3150
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,300
I do a lot of education training kind of

3151
02:07:13,738 --> 02:07:16,799
for Bud tenders and I really try to

3152
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:18,900
impart like how much of a responsibility

3153
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:20,940
is because you know I mean everybody

3154
02:07:18,899 --> 02:07:22,979
since they have such varying levels of

3155
02:07:20,939 --> 02:07:25,138
endocannabinoid system tone and kind of

3156
02:07:22,979 --> 02:07:27,299
Tolerance you know I mean you know

3157
02:07:25,139 --> 02:07:29,159
that's you know and doing it drunk and

3158
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:30,960
you get crossfaded or you know just the

3159
02:07:29,158 --> 02:07:32,819
slightest bit having such a you know

3160
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:34,920
lighting off effect of all your CB1

3161
02:07:32,819 --> 02:07:36,420
receptors but you know one of the

3162
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:38,219
trippiest parts about it is you know I

3163
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:39,359
mean most people that I've you know come

3164
02:07:38,219 --> 02:07:41,460
across I mean it's so fascinating how

3165
02:07:39,359 --> 02:07:43,500
many people say oh it's not for me you

3166
02:07:41,460 --> 02:07:46,618
know or oh the Cannabis these days is so

3167
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:48,599
strong you know I I used to smoke Canada

3168
02:07:46,618 --> 02:07:50,279
was back there I loved it you know but

3169
02:07:48,599 --> 02:07:51,480
and and so it happens to people that are

3170
02:07:50,279 --> 02:07:53,340
first-time users that happens to people

3171
02:07:51,479 --> 02:07:55,319
that take you know significant breaks in

3172
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:57,060
between for months or years and then it

3173
02:07:55,319 --> 02:07:58,799
happens to people one day that just are

3174
02:07:57,060 --> 02:08:00,900
steady users that take all of a sudden a

3175
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:02,520
full gram dab and and then flip the

3176
02:08:00,899 --> 02:08:04,319
script and then they're freaking out for

3177
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:06,599
the rest of the time and so it's a

3178
02:08:04,319 --> 02:08:08,219
really really interesting interval I

3179
02:08:06,599 --> 02:08:09,719
don't know I I really hope that you know

3180
02:08:08,219 --> 02:08:11,039
there's a lot of research around this

3181
02:08:09,719 --> 02:08:14,158
topic because it seems like it happens

3182
02:08:11,039 --> 02:08:15,960
very almost uh

3183
02:08:14,158 --> 02:08:17,759
um predictable for so many different

3184
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:19,439
types of these you know you know

3185
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:20,940
patients coming into contact or coming

3186
02:08:19,439 --> 02:08:22,500
into use with cannabis and so it's like

3187
02:08:20,939 --> 02:08:24,299
of that much more of an importance to

3188
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:25,800
set it up right because well let's face

3189
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:27,719
it I mean it's not supposed to use or

3190
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:28,920
somebody's like intended in their

3191
02:08:27,719 --> 02:08:31,020
lifetime to use it for this certain

3192
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:32,219
autoimmune condition that they have you

3193
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:34,860
know but this little 18 year old

3194
02:08:32,219 --> 02:08:37,319
bartender gives them like a you know 28

3195
02:08:34,859 --> 02:08:39,299
you know High terpening dominant ghost

3196
02:08:37,319 --> 02:08:40,799
train Haze or something you know that

3197
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:42,060
person probably won't ever smoke again

3198
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:44,219
you know and then then that person

3199
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:46,260
pretty much has that on his karma or her

3200
02:08:44,219 --> 02:08:48,239
karma because that person might have

3201
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:49,980
been intended to kind of come into a

3202
02:08:48,238 --> 02:08:51,658
relationship with this plant in a you

3203
02:08:49,979 --> 02:08:52,919
know really respectful awesome way to

3204
02:08:51,658 --> 02:08:54,479
where they could have you know

3205
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:56,940
eventually gotten to enjoy that type of

3206
02:08:54,479 --> 02:08:58,919
a dose or that type of a terpene yeah I

3207
02:08:56,939 --> 02:09:01,519
I think partly it's also due to the fact

3208
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:04,319
that we live in a CR an incredibly

3209
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:05,639
amateur market right

3210
02:09:04,319 --> 02:09:07,259
um we don't have it's not a complete

3211
02:09:05,639 --> 02:09:08,819
Market you don't have all the chemotypes

3212
02:09:07,260 --> 02:09:10,139
that are possible in the species on the

3213
02:09:08,819 --> 02:09:12,000
market you don't have all these

3214
02:09:10,139 --> 02:09:13,440
different you know percentages like you

3215
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,420
said like where is there like an eight

3216
02:09:13,439 --> 02:09:17,460
percent finding dominant variety on the

3217
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:19,440
market dispensaries wouldn't buy it

3218
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:21,000
right which is really the worst possible

3219
02:09:19,439 --> 02:09:22,319
thing because there's a whole class of

3220
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,779
people that would really benefit from

3221
02:09:22,319 --> 02:09:26,219
that type of product so I think as we

3222
02:09:24,779 --> 02:09:28,019
move forward you know even if they're

3223
02:09:26,219 --> 02:09:31,198
feeding they're feeding the prohibition

3224
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:34,260
Market yeah well they're it's these are

3225
02:09:31,198 --> 02:09:37,460
echoes of the of prohibition right

3226
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:37,460
um but like I said

3227
02:09:37,939 --> 02:09:43,919
as we move into a you know a more

3228
02:09:41,219 --> 02:09:45,359
developed and mature Marketplace I think

3229
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:47,039
that all these products will have a

3230
02:09:45,359 --> 02:09:48,839
place in the market

3231
02:09:47,039 --> 02:09:51,060
um we're going to start seeing you know

3232
02:09:48,840 --> 02:09:52,980
like these these non-measing dominant

3233
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:56,460
type twos of different types and and

3234
02:09:52,979 --> 02:09:59,039
other cannabinoid combinations that are

3235
02:09:56,460 --> 02:10:01,079
essentially THC with another cannabinoid

3236
02:09:59,039 --> 02:10:02,880
and the other cannabinoid can act as a

3237
02:10:01,079 --> 02:10:05,399
buffer

3238
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:06,960
um and and so it's really we're at the

3239
02:10:05,399 --> 02:10:08,279
again I get excited by this stuff

3240
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:09,719
because we're at the beginning of this

3241
02:10:08,279 --> 02:10:11,340
journey

3242
02:10:09,719 --> 02:10:13,859
um getting on these paths and having

3243
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:16,020
these you know more tools that we can

3244
02:10:13,859 --> 02:10:17,460
use you know like like we're talking

3245
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:19,800
about when we're indoctrinating new

3246
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:22,079
people into the market or into the into

3247
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:23,760
the the ceremony essentially into the

3248
02:10:22,079 --> 02:10:26,279
that's interesting too because with CBD

3249
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:28,440
CBD with THC is kind of almost like a

3250
02:10:26,279 --> 02:10:30,539
buffer cannabinoid for the novice or

3251
02:10:28,439 --> 02:10:33,479
inexperienced user as opposed to like a

3252
02:10:30,539 --> 02:10:35,519
propyl like thcv combined with THC which

3253
02:10:33,479 --> 02:10:38,098
might be like blast off uh you know

3254
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:41,880
added freakout or something like that

3255
02:10:38,099 --> 02:10:43,260
yeah or CBG or you know maybe even CBC

3256
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:46,800
so

3257
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:48,420
um did you say THC v b

3258
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:49,560
yeah I mean that was speculative you

3259
02:10:48,420 --> 02:10:50,779
probably know more about that I was just

3260
02:10:49,560 --> 02:10:53,539
saying

3261
02:10:50,779 --> 02:10:57,359
like a one-to-one THC

3262
02:10:53,539 --> 02:10:59,880
thcb does not get you high at all it's a

3263
02:10:57,359 --> 02:11:03,000
CBD one antagonist

3264
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:05,099
really THC doesn't I thought I was I

3265
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:07,319
always heard it was kind of like uh yeah

3266
02:11:05,099 --> 02:11:12,139
we all did that's what we always heard

3267
02:11:07,319 --> 02:11:12,139
but it's not true so really

3268
02:11:15,500 --> 02:11:25,800
and I also created varieties that were

3269
02:11:19,039 --> 02:11:29,099
20 30 40 uh 80 89 uh thcv

3270
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:31,380
whoa so and so you said it's it's a CB1

3271
02:11:29,099 --> 02:11:33,779
receptor antagonist

3272
02:11:31,380 --> 02:11:38,599
it's a neutral as a neutral antagonist

3273
02:11:33,779 --> 02:11:38,599
correct it's a neutral antagonist whoa

3274
02:11:42,479 --> 02:11:48,959
so it's more similar to CBD

3275
02:11:45,479 --> 02:11:50,399
so so micro dosing is the way from what

3276
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:54,779
you guys are saying as professionals

3277
02:11:50,399 --> 02:11:58,019
within the industry uh to to kind of uh

3278
02:11:54,779 --> 02:12:01,559
bring bring new users into the the

3279
02:11:58,020 --> 02:12:05,580
efficacy of the plan don't don't hand a

3280
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:07,619
14 year old a bottle of 151 proof and

3281
02:12:05,579 --> 02:12:09,179
not only 14 year olds I wish Hillary was

3282
02:12:07,618 --> 02:12:11,579
in the room right now because she works

3283
02:12:09,179 --> 02:12:14,340
with elderly people people in their 70s

3284
02:12:11,579 --> 02:12:16,139
80s 90s and even 100 year old people who

3285
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:18,719
are using cannabis for the first time

3286
02:12:16,139 --> 02:12:21,118
and Hillary black the founder of the BC

3287
02:12:18,719 --> 02:12:23,698
Compassion Club who now works uh through

3288
02:12:21,118 --> 02:12:25,380
bedroom con through canopy growth that's

3289
02:12:23,698 --> 02:12:26,698
what she does she works with uh she

3290
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:28,618
works with a lot of different elderly

3291
02:12:26,698 --> 02:12:30,960
people she told the story on the uh

3292
02:12:28,618 --> 02:12:33,658
all-female hash Church panel there where

3293
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:36,420
she turned her grandma on to I think her

3294
02:12:33,658 --> 02:12:39,059
Grandma's like 101 now

3295
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:41,520
um it's awesome yeah really really cool

3296
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:43,619
cool stories but I mean the same thing

3297
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:46,380
you're not going to take a 90 year old

3298
02:12:43,618 --> 02:12:48,479
person or a 100 year old person and give

3299
02:12:46,380 --> 02:12:50,520
them a half gram dab like that is or

3300
02:12:48,479 --> 02:12:53,098
just some crazy huge edible like

3301
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:55,920
puddling somebody like maniacal no

3302
02:12:53,099 --> 02:12:57,840
maniacal for sure dude and even we got

3303
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:59,940
to be careful with experienced users too

3304
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:01,679
because if you've taken a break from

3305
02:12:59,939 --> 02:13:04,019
Cannabis and have it consumed in a while

3306
02:13:01,679 --> 02:13:06,239
and then think your dose is where it

3307
02:13:04,020 --> 02:13:08,219
used to be you're gonna be on your butt

3308
02:13:06,238 --> 02:13:09,779
and also with new roots of

3309
02:13:08,219 --> 02:13:11,880
administration

3310
02:13:09,779 --> 02:13:14,658
um we all know smoking is very different

3311
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:17,340
than eating which is different than

3312
02:13:14,658 --> 02:13:18,899
suppositories so again someone being

3313
02:13:17,340 --> 02:13:21,060
introduced to a different method of

3314
02:13:18,899 --> 02:13:24,179
consumption I know a lot of people don't

3315
02:13:21,060 --> 02:13:26,039
want to consume it by smoking and so a

3316
02:13:24,179 --> 02:13:27,658
lot of new users their first experience

3317
02:13:26,039 --> 02:13:29,279
is with eating it and they're like oh

3318
02:13:27,658 --> 02:13:31,799
it's just a cookie it's just a brownie

3319
02:13:29,279 --> 02:13:34,198
and then go into full mode panic attack

3320
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:36,420
and yeah you don't think they're dying

3321
02:13:34,198 --> 02:13:38,879
and wanna never wanna eat cannabis again

3322
02:13:36,420 --> 02:13:41,158
even the smell of it um grosses them out

3323
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:42,779
so yeah Natasha we do not want to give

3324
02:13:41,158 --> 02:13:44,638
people that experience yeah that's why I

3325
02:13:42,779 --> 02:13:47,039
also like to always try to you know get

3326
02:13:44,639 --> 02:13:48,779
people to you know kind of yeah create

3327
02:13:47,039 --> 02:13:50,698
like a ritual out of it you know because

3328
02:13:48,779 --> 02:13:52,319
you know they see just you know the act

3329
02:13:50,698 --> 02:13:54,238
of sitting there and grinding up an herb

3330
02:13:52,319 --> 02:13:55,859
and you know kind of going through the

3331
02:13:54,238 --> 02:13:57,779
process of you know almost like praying

3332
02:13:55,859 --> 02:13:59,519
to it or putting your intentions into it

3333
02:13:57,779 --> 02:14:01,500
and you know learning how to roll a

3334
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:03,060
joint you know with it and even though

3335
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:04,679
your maker does a THC you're still going

3336
02:14:03,060 --> 02:14:06,719
through all these actions that seem in

3337
02:14:04,679 --> 02:14:08,520
some way to you know Prime you know I'm

3338
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:10,380
sure at least with Placebo or something

3339
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:11,760
I'm gonna start to you know do something

3340
02:14:10,380 --> 02:14:13,980
with your endocrine system I mean that's

3341
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:15,239
part of speculation but I think you know

3342
02:14:13,979 --> 02:14:16,919
the more we bring kind of I guess

3343
02:14:15,238 --> 02:14:18,598
ceremony or ritual into most of our

3344
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:21,060
practices you know the federal

3345
02:14:18,599 --> 02:14:24,000
experience you know well intention also

3346
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:26,639
if you're if you're using cannabis and

3347
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:29,158
expecting it to go badly it's going to

3348
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:32,039
go badly so if you're have a high

3349
02:14:29,158 --> 02:14:34,679
anxious feeling about using it and

3350
02:14:32,039 --> 02:14:36,539
Chimera brought up um first users a lot

3351
02:14:34,679 --> 02:14:38,340
of the time as a cannabis because the

3352
02:14:36,539 --> 02:14:40,738
officer is with alcohol because alcohol

3353
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:42,239
lowers your inhibitions and so you'll

3354
02:14:40,738 --> 02:14:43,919
try cannabis where before you wouldn't

3355
02:14:42,238 --> 02:14:45,419
have tried it and then you have a bad

3356
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:47,699
experience where you feel too dizzy you

3357
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:49,980
get too sleepy it ruins your party and

3358
02:14:47,698 --> 02:14:53,059
and they blame the kids yes they blame

3359
02:14:49,979 --> 02:14:53,059
the Cannabis they don't blame them

3360
02:14:53,118 --> 02:14:58,500
yes they are going into this experience

3361
02:14:56,099 --> 02:15:00,599
with billions upon billions of dollars

3362
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:01,578
of propaganda that have gotten them so

3363
02:15:00,599 --> 02:15:05,940
terrified

3364
02:15:01,578 --> 02:15:07,738
terrified at the idea of being high that

3365
02:15:05,939 --> 02:15:10,879
many people still to this day will

3366
02:15:07,738 --> 02:15:14,879
choose massive surgeries chemotherapies

3367
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:17,639
radiation therapies over the even trying

3368
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:19,199
a plant first they're too afraid to get

3369
02:15:17,639 --> 02:15:22,859
high they're like I would rather have my

3370
02:15:19,198 --> 02:15:25,198
arm removed than get high and that's

3371
02:15:22,859 --> 02:15:26,698
serious propaganda that's a serious

3372
02:15:25,198 --> 02:15:29,698
[ __ ] propaganda when you have people

3373
02:15:26,698 --> 02:15:32,399
that afraid that they will do surgery on

3374
02:15:29,698 --> 02:15:34,500
their body before trying a benign herb

3375
02:15:32,399 --> 02:15:37,319
that may or may not work

3376
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:38,698
yeah we got to remember too I mean I've

3377
02:15:37,319 --> 02:15:41,158
seen this a bunch of times when people

3378
02:15:38,698 --> 02:15:43,198
get up there in age

3379
02:15:41,158 --> 02:15:45,118
um it's threatening to their whole world

3380
02:15:43,198 --> 02:15:48,238
to start believing that the things that

3381
02:15:45,118 --> 02:15:50,219
they were told and believed is true are

3382
02:15:48,238 --> 02:15:53,218
actually not true because it it makes

3383
02:15:50,219 --> 02:15:55,618
them question their whole reality and so

3384
02:15:53,219 --> 02:15:57,899
it's uh it's really

3385
02:15:55,618 --> 02:16:00,179
it's it's a tough thing to deal with you

3386
02:15:57,899 --> 02:16:02,339
know but again I think what Alec was

3387
02:16:00,179 --> 02:16:04,560
saying from the beginning is is that

3388
02:16:02,340 --> 02:16:06,719
whole start low and go slow thing with

3389
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:09,480
this type of user is really important

3390
02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:11,760
because it can be a powerful drug and

3391
02:16:09,479 --> 02:16:14,279
you want it to be a nice soft Landing

3392
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:15,659
you don't want it to be like rip roaring

3393
02:16:14,279 --> 02:16:17,939
High running down the beach kind of

3394
02:16:15,658 --> 02:16:19,920
thing right what's what's so refreshing

3395
02:16:17,939 --> 02:16:22,319
and listening to you all of you guys you

3396
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:24,118
Professionals in the industry is that uh

3397
02:16:22,319 --> 02:16:26,399
you know to know that there's an

3398
02:16:24,118 --> 02:16:28,380
alternative because when I you know when

3399
02:16:26,399 --> 02:16:31,198
I first started smoking grass when I was

3400
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:33,840
you know 17 18 years old a long time ago

3401
02:16:31,198 --> 02:16:36,299
like 20 years ago or so

3402
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:39,120
um we just smoked the whole joint you

3403
02:16:36,299 --> 02:16:40,379
know and got really high really fast and

3404
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:42,899
that's all we did that's what everybody

3405
02:16:40,379 --> 02:16:44,518
did so now to really know that the

3406
02:16:42,898 --> 02:16:47,638
industry has evolved to a point of

3407
02:16:44,519 --> 02:16:51,059
Competency where where people can really

3408
02:16:47,638 --> 02:16:53,218
get the education on how exactly to

3409
02:16:51,058 --> 02:16:55,679
micro dose to take just a very small

3410
02:16:53,218 --> 02:16:57,898
amount so that you're getting the

3411
02:16:55,679 --> 02:16:59,819
healing and all the benefits of this of

3412
02:16:57,898 --> 02:17:03,000
this plant being able to use it being

3413
02:16:59,819 --> 02:17:06,000
able to acclimate it with acclimate to

3414
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:08,280
it correctly to to get to a point where

3415
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:10,200
where you can actually understand it

3416
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:12,920
better instead of being turned off like

3417
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:15,300
I could have been when I was younger yes

3418
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:17,099
and you know another consideration too

3419
02:17:15,299 --> 02:17:21,659
which is such a trip you know I've got

3420
02:17:17,099 --> 02:17:23,579
such deep uh respect and admiration and

3421
02:17:21,659 --> 02:17:25,319
um yeah everything for you know those

3422
02:17:23,579 --> 02:17:26,819
that are you know kind of working with

3423
02:17:25,319 --> 02:17:29,398
cancer patients working with terminally

3424
02:17:26,819 --> 02:17:30,898
ill patients and and it's so crazy you

3425
02:17:29,398 --> 02:17:32,519
know kind of in my experience with is

3426
02:17:30,898 --> 02:17:34,679
with it without is like Valerie Corral

3427
02:17:32,519 --> 02:17:36,239
Wham and you know the experience that

3428
02:17:34,679 --> 02:17:38,638
she has in the service that she kind of

3429
02:17:36,239 --> 02:17:40,619
embodies to be in service to people that

3430
02:17:38,638 --> 02:17:42,898
are sick and poor and dying you know but

3431
02:17:40,620 --> 02:17:44,939
when somebody's you know especially uh

3432
02:17:42,898 --> 02:17:46,799
you know cancer patient that is you know

3433
02:17:44,939 --> 02:17:48,359
trying to you know kind of utilize

3434
02:17:46,799 --> 02:17:49,978
cannabis as maybe the number one

3435
02:17:48,359 --> 02:17:53,040
resource instead of taking chemo

3436
02:17:49,978 --> 02:17:54,718
radiation you know you know kind of that

3437
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:57,380
you know I mean if somebody's never used

3438
02:17:54,718 --> 02:18:00,119
cannabis before they have such a virgin

3439
02:17:57,379 --> 02:18:01,920
endocannabinoid receptor system and then

3440
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:03,240
this tiniest amount of THC is going to

3441
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:05,579
have such a lighting off effect of the

3442
02:18:03,239 --> 02:18:07,978
CB1 receptors that then you know they

3443
02:18:05,579 --> 02:18:10,019
almost have this you know kind of you

3444
02:18:07,978 --> 02:18:12,478
know mountain of hash oil that's

3445
02:18:10,019 --> 02:18:14,579
decarboxylated or you know combined with

3446
02:18:12,478 --> 02:18:16,500
CBD or what have you and and it's like

3447
02:18:14,579 --> 02:18:19,138
okay well there there's a mountain of

3448
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:20,340
hash oil not you have to eat it all in

3449
02:18:19,138 --> 02:18:22,500
in the next hundred days or something

3450
02:18:20,340 --> 02:18:23,639
and you know and I know you know people

3451
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:25,439
would

3452
02:18:23,638 --> 02:18:28,079
um you know cringe at me saying that but

3453
02:18:25,439 --> 02:18:31,139
you know I mean the the way to the most

3454
02:18:28,079 --> 02:18:33,478
uh harm reductive space that Valerie has

3455
02:18:31,138 --> 02:18:35,339
found that has the most optimal balance

3456
02:18:33,478 --> 02:18:37,379
and effect is you know just what we're

3457
02:18:35,340 --> 02:18:39,420
talking about it's it's starting on an

3458
02:18:37,379 --> 02:18:42,239
oil that you're you know ingesting

3459
02:18:39,420 --> 02:18:44,760
that's higher in CBD much higher in CBD

3460
02:18:42,239 --> 02:18:47,340
in the ratio of CBD THC and and their

3461
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:49,800
micro dosing THC to build a baseline

3462
02:18:47,340 --> 02:18:51,478
tolerance to the psychoactive effect and

3463
02:18:49,799 --> 02:18:53,638
then yeah over time start to build up

3464
02:18:51,478 --> 02:18:56,699
you know to to where you know there's an

3465
02:18:53,638 --> 02:18:57,959
optimal kind of ratio and and you know

3466
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:59,880
Valerie finds for a lot of different

3467
02:18:57,959 --> 02:19:03,299
types of cancer you know the ratio

3468
02:18:59,879 --> 02:19:05,218
ultimately ends up at a higher THC to

3469
02:19:03,299 --> 02:19:07,319
CBD ratio but it's still pretty

3470
02:19:05,218 --> 02:19:09,419
significant you know like you know five

3471
02:19:07,319 --> 02:19:12,359
to one six to something like that around

3472
02:19:09,420 --> 02:19:13,920
THC to CBD but you know to the point

3473
02:19:12,359 --> 02:19:15,840
where you know these these these

3474
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:17,939
patients that are like trying to truly

3475
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:19,920
take bring out bring out and invoke the

3476
02:19:17,939 --> 02:19:21,898
medicinal benefit of this plant you know

3477
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:25,138
have to go through I mean I could I

3478
02:19:21,898 --> 02:19:26,879
could only imagine how heavy of an

3479
02:19:25,138 --> 02:19:28,379
experience that is while you're you know

3480
02:19:26,879 --> 02:19:30,598
kind of dealing with the existential

3481
02:19:28,379 --> 02:19:32,819
crisis of the fact that you know you've

3482
02:19:30,599 --> 02:19:34,739
got an appropriate facing death yeah

3483
02:19:32,819 --> 02:19:37,260
you're taking cannabis in a way where

3484
02:19:34,739 --> 02:19:39,840
you have to just fully let go and

3485
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:42,359
release you know any controls or things

3486
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:43,139
in your ego and and and eventually you

3487
02:19:42,359 --> 02:19:45,659
know get to the point where you're

3488
02:19:43,138 --> 02:19:47,699
taking you know in excess of 500 to 1000

3489
02:19:45,659 --> 02:19:49,619
milligrams of THC a day and same thing I

3490
02:19:47,700 --> 02:19:51,840
know people might like cringe you know

3491
02:19:49,620 --> 02:19:54,180
that type of a dose but that's you know

3492
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:55,500
it's crazy how you know various and

3493
02:19:54,180 --> 02:19:57,420
certain types of people end up getting

3494
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:59,579
to that dose range and and then when

3495
02:19:57,420 --> 02:20:01,020
they you know sustain on that dose you

3496
02:19:59,579 --> 02:20:03,180
know kind of over you know x amount of

3497
02:20:01,020 --> 02:20:05,340
time they they you know these incredible

3498
02:20:03,180 --> 02:20:07,200
benefits and you know apoptotic or

3499
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:09,120
anti-proliferative effects et cetera et

3500
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:12,060
cetera but it's just amazing because you

3501
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:15,180
know I mean if you know this entire

3502
02:20:12,059 --> 02:20:16,859
panel you know 1500 milligrams of THC

3503
02:20:15,180 --> 02:20:18,420
between us would would probably all get

3504
02:20:16,859 --> 02:20:20,340
pretty blasted you know maybe with an

3505
02:20:18,420 --> 02:20:21,898
exception of a couple of us but it's

3506
02:20:20,340 --> 02:20:24,059
just crazy to think of what somebody

3507
02:20:21,898 --> 02:20:26,639
asked about there's a couple of us who

3508
02:20:24,059 --> 02:20:29,398
who have eaten several times 1500

3509
02:20:26,639 --> 02:20:32,119
milligrams in a single day and that

3510
02:20:29,398 --> 02:20:34,799
looks for recreational use

3511
02:20:32,120 --> 02:20:37,140
it was for cosmonaut years let's be

3512
02:20:34,799 --> 02:20:39,259
honest yes I go not

3513
02:20:37,139 --> 02:20:41,579
that's definitely psycho

3514
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:45,739
and it's and what's crazy to me is like

3515
02:20:41,579 --> 02:20:49,920
I mean I'm more scared of the the the

3516
02:20:45,739 --> 02:20:51,600
high-dose THC effects because of what I

3517
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:54,059
felt from that than I am from you know

3518
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:56,159
doing a high dose like psilocybin or

3519
02:20:54,059 --> 02:20:58,680
something like that you know

3520
02:20:56,159 --> 02:20:59,939
yeah well I like man I get it I gotta

3521

02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:04,140
been friends for a long time

3549
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:06,720
it'd be great to have them on at some

3550
02:22:04,139 --> 02:22:08,939
point would love to

3551
02:22:06,719 --> 02:22:11,459
have just talked to Valerie yesterday

3552
02:22:08,939 --> 02:22:13,559
because we're gonna do it cannabis

3553
02:22:11,459 --> 02:22:15,659
restored episode here pretty much but I

3554
02:22:13,559 --> 02:22:19,019
met her in a speaking event as well and

3555
02:22:15,659 --> 02:22:21,239
you can't you can't not be inspired with

3556
02:22:19,020 --> 02:22:23,220
what she does when you when you hear her

3557
02:22:21,239 --> 02:22:25,020
talk about it well Natasha we have to

3558
02:22:23,219 --> 02:22:27,059
put that together and I think when the

3559
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:28,739
correct if we get Valerie and Mike we

3560
02:22:27,059 --> 02:22:31,139
definitely got to invite Hillary that

3561
02:22:28,739 --> 02:22:33,299
day as well I think uh she was a huge

3562
02:22:31,139 --> 02:22:35,818
they were a huge inspiration to Hillary

3563
02:22:33,299 --> 02:22:37,739
uh in the starting of the BC Compassion

3564

[Music]

02:24:12,059 --> 02:24:15,059
America

3602
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:20,280
okay yep and now it's gone just like

3603
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:21,960
that

3604
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:24,120
all right well what a great conversation

3605
02:24:21,959 --> 02:24:25,619
today so far man we've got into a whole

3606
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:27,180
bunch of different things I love it I

3607
02:24:25,620 --> 02:24:29,700
love when the conversation is just

3608
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:31,559
flowing freely and natural and it's

3609
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:34,680
interesting to see the levels too you

3610
02:24:31,559 --> 02:24:36,840
know the way we can go from this there's

3611
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:38,939
it's just always been a plant and

3612
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:41,700
variety it's always been a very long

3613
02:24:38,939 --> 02:24:43,318
stick that you can go on either way with

3614
02:24:41,700 --> 02:24:45,060
cannabis and even in the conversation

3615
02:24:43,318 --> 02:24:48,199
when you're talking about

3616
02:24:45,059 --> 02:24:50,760
you know [ __ ] basically inducing

3617
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:53,520
paralysis and seizures upon their

3618
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:56,520
friends and then like Angels like Forest

3619
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:59,579
trying to help people use cannabis as a

3620
02:24:56,520 --> 02:25:02,280
medicine to avoid seizures and paralysis

3621
02:24:59,579 --> 02:25:03,840
like that's [ __ ] crazy

3622
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:05,700
I think we're in this new we're just

3623
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:09,059
coming into a new time you know we have

3624
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:11,220
the freedom now to really explore the

3625
02:25:09,059 --> 02:25:13,379
whole spectrum of types of relationships

3626
02:25:11,219 --> 02:25:15,779
we can have with cannabis and I think

3627
02:25:13,379 --> 02:25:18,719
prohibition has really robbed us of that

3628
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:20,340
you know we just we have one or a few

3629
02:25:18,719 --> 02:25:22,679
different types of relationships with

3630
02:25:20,340 --> 02:25:25,079
cannabis because it just wasn't to have

3631
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:27,359
more minor or different sort of

3632
02:25:25,079 --> 02:25:29,459
integrated relationships it wasn't worth

3633
02:25:27,359 --> 02:25:31,979
the risk involved

3634
02:25:29,459 --> 02:25:33,839
to explore it and and you know and so

3635
02:25:31,978 --> 02:25:35,579
what was available to be produced was

3636
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:38,460
certain types of cannabis for certain

3637
02:25:35,579 --> 02:25:40,079
types of relationships and I think in 10

3638
02:25:38,459 --> 02:25:41,818
years from now we're going to see a

3639
02:25:40,079 --> 02:25:42,420
completely different

3640
02:25:41,818 --> 02:25:44,579
um

3641
02:25:42,420 --> 02:25:46,439
set of options and ways we can integrate

3642
02:25:44,579 --> 02:25:48,898
cannabis into our life that has just

3643
02:25:46,439 --> 02:25:51,000
been you know it's been hindered by

3644
02:25:48,898 --> 02:25:54,420
prohibition and for me it's just a

3645
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:56,579
really exciting time you know it's

3646
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:58,318
something that with the podcast that I'm

3647
02:25:56,579 --> 02:26:00,719
working on that's 100 of what we're

3648
02:25:58,318 --> 02:26:02,279
exploring is what are these different

3649
02:26:00,719 --> 02:26:04,858
relationships and stories that we can

3650
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:08,579
have as if you know they have been

3651
02:26:04,859 --> 02:26:10,620
hindered by prohibition and it's really

3652
02:26:08,579 --> 02:26:12,719
exciting for me and not not just

3653
02:26:10,620 --> 02:26:17,240
prohibition hindered by prohibition and

3654
02:26:12,719 --> 02:26:20,340
continued by Big Business yeah yeah

3655
02:26:17,239 --> 02:26:25,079
which one of our panelists just posted

3656
02:26:20,340 --> 02:26:27,059
the uh thcb uh binding article that that

3657
02:26:25,079 --> 02:26:30,600
would be me thank you very much

3658
02:26:27,059 --> 02:26:32,699
okay well that may be true but try

3659
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:35,100
smoking it then tell me what you think

3660
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:37,859
oh no I'm just pointing out this is

3661
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:39,479
Roger perdue's article so

3662
02:26:37,859 --> 02:26:42,559
I'm just telling you you know what's

3663
02:26:39,478 --> 02:26:42,559
what's in the literature

3664
02:26:43,398 --> 02:26:47,579
Dan would probably know that better than

3665
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:49,680
that I wonder if there's value in the

3666
02:26:47,579 --> 02:26:51,840
scientists puffing and understanding the

3667
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:54,300
bioassay versus the test and seeing

3668
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:57,478
whether they are arrived about any

3669
02:26:54,299 --> 02:27:00,420
scientists that would not put out of

3670
02:26:57,478 --> 02:27:02,279
curiosity to the substance he's been

3671
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:06,120
studying for years and years and years

3672
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:08,460
but uh I I know Roger personally and

3673
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:10,560
he's a really really nice guy

3674
02:27:08,459 --> 02:27:12,539
awesome it's a it's a reminded me of

3675
02:27:10,559 --> 02:27:13,818
like it does it even lift bro yeah but

3676
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:17,700
does he lift

3677
02:27:13,818 --> 02:27:19,619
does he lift Sam we wanna know I'm

3678
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:22,800
joking does he what

3679
02:27:19,620 --> 02:27:24,899
well it's metaphor for does he puff it's

3680
02:27:22,799 --> 02:27:27,239
like this thing where it's hard to

3681
02:27:24,898 --> 02:27:32,299
explain but does he even lift it's like

3682
02:27:27,239 --> 02:27:35,459
a meme yeah I I let's turn around

3683
02:27:32,299 --> 02:27:37,559
that's what they want to do you would

3684
02:27:35,459 --> 02:27:40,259
have loved the sift means Sam because

3685
02:27:37,559 --> 02:27:42,719
the do you even lift turned into do you

3686
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:45,719
even sift and it would show like old

3687
02:27:42,719 --> 02:27:48,299
minors and like gold sifters in the like

3688
02:27:45,719 --> 02:27:50,579
Panhandle with their long beards their

3689
02:27:48,299 --> 02:27:53,398
overalls and holding screens over the

3690
02:27:50,579 --> 02:27:55,579
water do you even sift bro

3691
02:27:53,398 --> 02:27:55,579
foreign

3692
02:27:59,818 --> 02:28:04,699
yeah exactly we have a water sifting I

3693
02:28:02,340 --> 02:28:08,100
should have used that in the uh

3694
02:28:04,700 --> 02:28:09,420
Link in the chat for the YouTube folks

3695
02:28:08,100 --> 02:28:11,840
so they could see the paper we're

3696
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:11,840
talking about

3697
02:28:12,478 --> 02:28:16,549
which one

3698
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:17,880
the thcv pharmacology paper

3699
02:28:16,549 --> 02:28:20,099
[Music]

3700
02:28:17,879 --> 02:28:22,438
I should say for the record Roger perch

3701
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:24,120
we is an absolute Gem of a man and I

3702
02:28:22,439 --> 02:28:26,398
don't think he does consume but he is

3703
02:28:24,120 --> 02:28:29,460
definitely a supporter of people using

3704
02:28:26,398 --> 02:28:30,840
cannabis and uh he's a he's an

3705
02:28:29,459 --> 02:28:33,659
incredible researcher he's been doing

3706
02:28:30,840 --> 02:28:35,880
this longer than almost anybody and he

3707
02:28:33,659 --> 02:28:38,180
really is a fantastic person that's

3708
02:28:35,879 --> 02:28:38,179
awesome

3709
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:45,420
his papers are very well written and

3710
02:28:42,898 --> 02:28:48,239
very easy to read I mean at least I find

3711
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:50,760
them easy and very easy to follow a very

3712
02:28:48,239 --> 02:28:54,299
he's a good scientific writer he writes

3713
02:28:50,760 --> 02:28:56,818
yeah Roger he's top tier like Rogers uh

3714
02:28:54,299 --> 02:28:59,818
top of the Cannabis scientist realm he's

3715
02:28:56,818 --> 02:29:01,519
doing amazing work Roger pertwe hertry

3716
02:28:59,818 --> 02:29:04,199
is that who I say his last name yeah

3717
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:06,420
there's not me yeah

3718
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:08,460
hahaha

3719
02:29:06,420 --> 02:29:10,859
he's at the uh he's at the University of

3720
02:29:08,459 --> 02:29:12,898
Aberdeen in uh Northern Scotland

yeah and like very very knowledgeable

3723
02:29:16,020 --> 02:29:21,960
very good at um explaining complex

3724
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:23,760
material into ways that are easy to

3725
02:29:21,959 --> 02:29:26,159
understand he always does the

3726
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:27,960
presentation at conferences where he's

3727
02:29:26,159 --> 02:29:29,398
like similar to Ethan where they've got

3728
02:29:27,959 --> 02:29:31,079
so much material and they're just like

3729
02:29:29,398 --> 02:29:34,858
you guys need to know this you need to

3730
02:29:31,079 --> 02:29:36,719
know this like he's very he's very um

3731
02:29:34,859 --> 02:29:38,700
he wants people to understand his work

3732
02:29:36,719 --> 02:29:40,199
even though his work is complicated

3733
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:43,380
that's awesome

3734
02:29:40,200 --> 02:29:46,200
isn't Mary abood from aberleen as well

3735
02:29:43,379 --> 02:29:48,539
or University Avenue

3736
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:51,920
I'm sorry she's from Temple University

3737
02:29:48,540 --> 02:29:51,920
okay who's the other one

3738
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:58,380
sorry never mind is not still active

3739
02:29:56,059 --> 02:30:01,439
academically is she

3740
02:29:58,379 --> 02:30:05,219
I think so I think she is oh okay she

3741
02:30:01,439 --> 02:30:07,920
was Jehan Marcus PhD advisor and then

3742
02:30:05,219 --> 02:30:09,840
boss okay Ruth Ross is Ruth Ross one of

3743
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:12,799
them maybe um I think she was another

3744
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:15,299
GPR 55 researcher I think that I really

3745
02:30:12,799 --> 02:30:18,619
research nerds I love it they got all

3746
02:30:15,299 --> 02:30:23,939
the stats I got her base I got her card

3747
02:30:18,620 --> 02:30:25,100
but uh she wrote 37 papers in 2011 alone

3748
02:30:23,940 --> 02:30:28,140
[Music]

3749
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:30,420
it reminds me of the drug sniffing dog

3750
02:30:28,139 --> 02:30:32,099
cards that Sam and uh Rob had back in

3751
02:30:30,420 --> 02:30:33,898
the day with like pictures of these dogs

3752
02:30:32,100 --> 02:30:35,579
they've had their name underneath and

3753
02:30:33,898 --> 02:30:37,019
then on the back there'd be stats of how

3754
02:30:35,579 --> 02:30:38,760
much cocaine and Herb they were

3755
02:30:37,020 --> 02:30:41,280
responsible for getting busted at

3756
02:30:38,760 --> 02:30:44,398
airports and roadblocks and [ __ ] that's

3757
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:46,500
pretty funny yeah collector's items man

3758
02:30:44,398 --> 02:30:51,059
those are like memes before memes or

3759
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:52,659
memes exactly I still have like a drug

3760
02:30:51,059 --> 02:30:54,199
sipping card collection

3761
02:30:52,659 --> 02:30:57,119
[Music]

3762
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:59,520
that is an unbelievable statement like

3763
02:30:57,120 --> 02:31:02,399
just to hear you say that

3764
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:05,939
I still have my drug sniffing dog card

3765
02:31:02,398 --> 02:31:08,099
collection that is so ridiculous so did

3766
02:31:05,939 --> 02:31:11,100
you guys talk anything about the uh GPR

3767
02:31:08,100 --> 02:31:12,780
119 and the bacteria uh affecting the

3768
02:31:11,100 --> 02:31:19,020
cannabinoid receptor

3769
02:31:12,780 --> 02:31:19,020
no no let's get into it bacteria effects

3770
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:25,079
Natasha did you read that one

3771
02:31:21,478 --> 02:31:26,398
no I saw you sent it uh you informed me

3772
02:31:25,079 --> 02:31:27,780
of it last night but I haven't had a

3773
02:31:26,398 --> 02:31:29,519
chance to read it yet so can you give us

3774
02:31:27,780 --> 02:31:31,380
a summary and after that I want to tell

3775
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:33,720
you guys about another study but let's

3776
02:31:31,379 --> 02:31:36,420
get into this first

3777
02:31:33,719 --> 02:31:38,039
yeah I mean I I didn't actually delve

3778
02:31:36,420 --> 02:31:39,659
too deeply into it so I was kind of

3779
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:42,359
hoping that you had

3780
02:31:39,659 --> 02:31:44,100
um I'll prep for next week yeah

3781
02:31:42,359 --> 02:31:46,200
essentially what it is is that the

3782
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:47,880
they're finding now that gut bacteria

3783
02:31:46,200 --> 02:31:49,500
are producing compounds that are

3784
02:31:47,879 --> 02:31:52,679
actually stimulating

3785
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:54,780
uh some of the Le the less known 400

3786
02:31:52,680 --> 02:31:56,159
receptors yeah orphan receptors that are

3787
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:59,579
associated with the endocannabinoid

3788
02:31:56,159 --> 02:32:01,500
system wow that's amazing microbiota

3789
02:31:59,579 --> 02:32:04,260
yeah it's the whole right it's the whole

3790
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:06,478
microbiome thing it's the it's this we

3791
02:32:04,260 --> 02:32:10,500
have a community of Life of bacteria

3792
02:32:06,478 --> 02:32:12,659
that live with us you know in case

3793
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:15,420
people haven't haven't heard you know

3794
02:32:12,659 --> 02:32:18,840
there's more cells of of bacteria in

3795
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:22,020
your body than there are cells of you

3796
02:32:18,840 --> 02:32:23,760
right so that the interplay of that

3797
02:32:22,020 --> 02:32:25,920
community and how that what they have

3798
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:28,859
living in you know as they go about

3799
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:31,559
their daily lives it has a huge impact

3800
02:32:28,859 --> 02:32:33,120
on your you know our two our two systems

3801
02:32:31,559 --> 02:32:35,459
they cross there's a lot of crosstalk

3802
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:36,600
right they intercommunicate with each

3803
02:32:35,459 --> 02:32:38,938
other

3804
02:32:36,600 --> 02:32:40,380
so anyhow we're just anyhow we're just

3805
02:32:38,939 --> 02:32:42,840
the point is that we're starting to

3806
02:32:40,379 --> 02:32:43,858
understand now how

3807
02:32:42,840 --> 02:32:45,780
um

3808
02:32:43,859 --> 02:32:47,700
these systems interact with each other

3809
02:32:45,780 --> 02:32:50,579
to create health

3810
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:52,859
who is the research group that did the

3811
02:32:50,579 --> 02:32:54,959
work I I haven't even looked it up yet

3812
02:32:52,859 --> 02:32:56,579
I'm sorry I don't I can't say

3813
02:32:54,959 --> 02:32:58,339
okay well that's definitely incredible

3814
02:32:56,579 --> 02:33:01,139
though

3815
02:32:58,340 --> 02:33:02,939
two receptors in the gut right and you

3816
02:33:01,139 --> 02:33:04,500
know kind of you know apparently you

3817
02:33:02,939 --> 02:33:06,600
know kind of from you know I know that

3818
02:33:04,500 --> 02:33:08,639
that uh what John John mcparley and

3819
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:11,939
Karen feeding paper kind of you know got

3820
02:33:08,639 --> 02:33:14,939
into how kind of probiotics you know in

3821
02:33:11,939 --> 02:33:16,979
you know in your gut like help to you

3822
02:33:14,939 --> 02:33:19,680
know upregulate CB2 receptor expression

3823
02:33:16,978 --> 02:33:22,318
and and it's crazy how much kind of you

3824
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:23,939
know from you know gut dysbiosis you

3825
02:33:22,318 --> 02:33:25,439
know kind of I would imagine comes so

3826
02:33:23,939 --> 02:33:27,898
many different types of disease and

3827
02:33:25,439 --> 02:33:30,000
disorder and and you know also like uh

3828
02:33:27,898 --> 02:33:32,459
with psychosomatic type

3829
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:34,559
you know illness also manifests kind of

3830
02:33:32,459 --> 02:33:36,419
from you know your second brain in your

3831
02:33:34,559 --> 02:33:37,680
gut being out of balance and not you

3832
02:33:36,420 --> 02:33:39,318
know kind of working right to produce

3833
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:41,639
the right kind of you know

3834
02:33:39,318 --> 02:33:44,219
neurotransmitters and and now I guess

3835
02:33:41,639 --> 02:33:45,840
what also endocannabinoids

3836
02:33:44,219 --> 02:33:47,398
or lighting off the endocannabinoid

3837
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:49,559
system that's fascinating

3838
02:33:47,398 --> 02:33:51,898
I think it's why it's so important for

3839
02:33:49,559 --> 02:33:52,939
cannabis to be cultivated in organic

3840
02:33:51,898 --> 02:33:55,920
practices

3841
02:33:52,939 --> 02:33:57,659
uh the soil biology contributes to

3842
02:33:55,920 --> 02:33:59,340
what's happening on the plant's surfaces

3843
02:33:57,659 --> 02:34:01,680
I know that we all work with

3844
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:06,079
concentrates but I think the source

3845
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:09,239
material having a full biota if you will

3846
02:34:06,079 --> 02:34:10,379
uh is really an essential part of making

3847
02:34:09,239 --> 02:34:12,000
medicine

3848
02:34:10,379 --> 02:34:14,639
that's so awesome you said that because

3849
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:16,439
I just I just listened to this podcast

3850
02:34:14,639 --> 02:34:19,500
um I'll post it here in a second it's on

3851
02:34:16,439 --> 02:34:22,559
this guy Dave asprey's um he has this uh

3852
02:34:19,500 --> 02:34:24,719
show called The bulletproof radio and um

3853
02:34:22,559 --> 02:34:27,779
there's this doctor Dr Maya

3854
02:34:24,719 --> 02:34:29,938
um she treat Klein and she's like a

3855
02:34:27,780 --> 02:34:31,680
neurologist herbalist and author of a

3856
02:34:29,939 --> 02:34:35,639
book called dirt here healthy food

3857
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:37,800
healthy gut healthy children and um and

3858
02:34:35,639 --> 02:34:40,559
yeah in it kind of it's all about how

3859
02:34:37,799 --> 02:34:42,299
kind of you know yeah like being out and

3860
02:34:40,559 --> 02:34:44,519
I mean not being you know the opposite

3861
02:34:42,299 --> 02:34:46,679
of being you know the the hypochondriac

3862
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:48,420
that puts on you know anti-microbial

3863
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:50,460
kind of hand sanitizers you know five

3864
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:52,500
times a day you know but actually from

3865
02:34:50,459 --> 02:34:55,139
kids playing out in the dirt and from

3866
02:34:52,500 --> 02:34:58,020
you know being out gardening and

3867
02:34:55,139 --> 02:35:00,239
consuming organically grown crops that

3868
02:34:58,020 --> 02:35:02,819
have you know these probiotic kind of

3869
02:35:00,239 --> 02:35:05,459
soil micro kind of you know soil food

3870
02:35:02,818 --> 02:35:06,779
web kind of balance you know organisms

3871
02:35:05,459 --> 02:35:08,459
you know kind of getting

3872
02:35:06,780 --> 02:35:10,800
um small tiny amounts of that actually

3873
02:35:08,459 --> 02:35:13,079
does wonders for our own you know

3874
02:35:10,799 --> 02:35:15,059
microbiome you know and and even also

3875
02:35:13,079 --> 02:35:17,280
like you know what you know in this she

3876
02:35:15,059 --> 02:35:19,859
describes how kind of you know almost

3877
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:22,020
being in the dirt and consuming plants

3878
02:35:19,859 --> 02:35:24,659
that are organically grown and

3879
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:27,479
um almost have more of a beneficial

3880
02:35:24,659 --> 02:35:29,459
um assistance to helping balance our

3881
02:35:27,478 --> 02:35:31,318
soil microbiome with the right types of

3882
02:35:29,459 --> 02:35:33,119
microbes than even just going to Whole

3883
02:35:31,318 --> 02:35:35,159
Foods and popping these like you know

3884
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:36,960
lactobacillus or these different you

3885
02:35:35,159 --> 02:35:39,659
know refrigerated probiotics that we get

3886
02:35:36,959 --> 02:35:41,219
in stores and pay so much money for you

3887
02:35:39,659 --> 02:35:43,559
know it's actually you know you can kind

3888
02:35:41,219 --> 02:35:44,760
of get the same and better from just uh

3889
02:35:43,559 --> 02:35:47,100
you know actually being in healthy

3890
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:49,500
environment soil and gardening different

3891
02:35:47,100 --> 02:35:51,300
bacteria right so like there's all these

3892
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:53,280
different types of bacteria and we also

3893
02:35:51,299 --> 02:35:54,840
have to look at bacteria for you can

3894
02:35:53,280 --> 02:35:57,000
take certain types of bacteria for

3895
02:35:54,840 --> 02:36:00,239
certain purposes but most people don't

3896
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:02,219
understand that there's actual ways that

3897
02:36:00,239 --> 02:36:04,260
we're communicating with bacteria so the

3898
02:36:02,219 --> 02:36:05,879
lab that I worked in uh during my grad

3899
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:08,398
school who was sorry

3900
02:36:05,879 --> 02:36:10,619
exactly but they there's these receptors

3901
02:36:08,398 --> 02:36:12,719
on our cells called folic receptors and

3902
02:36:10,620 --> 02:36:14,220
so they actually recognize

3903
02:36:12,719 --> 02:36:16,139
um basically different sugars on the

3904
02:36:14,219 --> 02:36:17,579
surface of bacteria so most like a lot

3905
02:36:16,139 --> 02:36:20,340
of people will talk about LPS or

3906
02:36:17,579 --> 02:36:22,200
lipopolysaccharide that's a immune

3907
02:36:20,340 --> 02:36:24,000
marker or that some that's a bacteria

3908
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:25,500
product that can stimulate your immune

3909
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:27,540
response in a bad way and give you

3910
02:36:25,500 --> 02:36:29,639
overactive inflammation and so a lot of

3911
02:36:27,540 --> 02:36:32,040
people have uh little bits of this

3912
02:36:29,639 --> 02:36:33,840
compound this bacteria compound LPS kind

3913
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:36,180
of floating around under your gut and

3914
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:37,978
kind of talking to your immune cells and

3915
02:36:36,180 --> 02:36:40,200
such and so there's this receptor on our

3916
02:36:37,978 --> 02:36:42,420
cell called tollec receptor four that

3917
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:44,460
specifically recognizes this bacteria

3918
02:36:42,420 --> 02:36:47,700
product and so what's interesting is

3919
02:36:44,459 --> 02:36:49,799
it's not only a live bacteria that our

3920
02:36:47,700 --> 02:36:53,640
cells can recognize and talk to they

3921
02:36:49,799 --> 02:36:56,039
also recognize the bacteria DNA and the

3922
02:36:53,639 --> 02:36:58,500
products from when the bacteria are dead

3923
02:36:56,040 --> 02:37:01,380
so this even brings up concerns with

3924
02:36:58,500 --> 02:37:03,659
like um say pasteurization right so say

3925
02:37:01,379 --> 02:37:05,579
you're drinking uh milk and you're not

3926
02:37:03,659 --> 02:37:07,978
really sure of the source it's from I

3927
02:37:05,579 --> 02:37:10,318
mean we're Lucky in Canada anyway I mean

3928
02:37:07,978 --> 02:37:12,719
America is similar you have access to

3929
02:37:10,318 --> 02:37:15,420
clean milk that's been properly properly

3930
02:37:12,719 --> 02:37:16,559
processed to avoid bacteria but

3931
02:37:15,420 --> 02:37:18,719
something that people don't understand

3932
02:37:16,559 --> 02:37:20,039
is even if that back that milk or

3933
02:37:18,719 --> 02:37:22,199
whatever food product has been

3934
02:37:20,040 --> 02:37:24,720
pasteurized or treated and there

3935
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:26,880
actually is no live bacteria just having

3936
02:37:24,719 --> 02:37:30,299
that bacterial DNA and the bacterial

3937
02:37:26,879 --> 02:37:33,478
byproducts can still cause an immune

3938
02:37:30,299 --> 02:37:35,340
activation cause inflammation and so

3939
02:37:33,478 --> 02:37:38,279
it's not just live bacteria that can

3940
02:37:35,340 --> 02:37:39,239
interact with our body it's also the

3941
02:37:38,280 --> 02:37:41,579
Dead

3942
02:37:39,239 --> 02:37:43,139
dead bacteria and so we can think of

3943
02:37:41,579 --> 02:37:45,539
bacteria again as like good bacteria and

3944
02:37:43,139 --> 02:37:47,279
bad bacteria so even the good bacteria

3945
02:37:45,540 --> 02:37:49,200
interact through these similar receptors

3946
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:51,060
and what's interesting is they interact

3947
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:53,399
through the same receptors but they can

3948
02:37:51,059 --> 02:37:55,500
tell our immune system to calm down and

3949
02:37:53,398 --> 02:37:57,059
chill out and everything's okay and so

3950
02:37:55,500 --> 02:37:57,780
that's why there's certain

3951
02:37:57,059 --> 02:37:59,459
um

3952
02:37:57,780 --> 02:38:01,500
studies where they're feeding people

3953
02:37:59,459 --> 02:38:03,659
with immune disorders certain types of

3954
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:05,459
bacteria that can Target these

3955
02:38:03,659 --> 02:38:07,799
anti-inflammatory processes and actually

3956
02:38:05,459 --> 02:38:09,419
get their inflammation under control and

3957
02:38:07,799 --> 02:38:11,340
so it's absolutely essential when we

3958
02:38:09,420 --> 02:38:13,379
think of the bacteria we're using to

3959
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:15,898
feed our plants our Foods because those

3960
02:38:13,379 --> 02:38:17,818
bacteria are getting into US interacting

3961
02:38:15,898 --> 02:38:20,459
with us and either providing beneficial

3962
02:38:17,818 --> 02:38:23,219
or harmful effects so it all very

3963
02:38:20,459 --> 02:38:25,199
holistic right very holistic but so

3964
02:38:23,219 --> 02:38:27,059
awesome it's kind of As Above So Below

3965
02:38:25,200 --> 02:38:29,100
thing you know it's like the idea of uh

3966
02:38:27,059 --> 02:38:30,719
you know recreating the perfect soil

3967
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:33,659
through kind of you teeming with

3968
02:38:30,719 --> 02:38:35,099
microbes kind of is I like I like what

3969
02:38:33,659 --> 02:38:36,719
you're saying there because if you if

3970
02:38:35,100 --> 02:38:39,359
you think of it and even imagine it like

3971
02:38:36,719 --> 02:38:41,938
that like the interior living on you you

3972
02:38:39,359 --> 02:38:43,439
are their planet and and are you a good

3973
02:38:41,939 --> 02:38:45,300
Planet are you feeding them good food

3974
02:38:43,439 --> 02:38:47,460
are you encouraging good bacteria to

3975
02:38:45,299 --> 02:38:49,199
grow or are you feeding them bad food or

3976
02:38:47,459 --> 02:38:51,659
you know let bad lifestyle practices are

3977
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:53,159
you over stressed are you overtired and

3978
02:38:51,659 --> 02:38:54,478
I know Tom McCormick talked a lot about

3979
02:38:53,159 --> 02:38:57,420
it when he was

3980
02:38:54,478 --> 02:38:59,639
um doing his plants and learning how to

3981
02:38:57,420 --> 02:39:02,398
feed and nutrition Plant Nutrition and

3982
02:38:59,639 --> 02:39:04,139
soil issues and he was realizing that

3983
02:39:02,398 --> 02:39:05,939
hey I'm like giving my plant the best

3984
02:39:04,139 --> 02:39:08,398
vitamins and the best nutrients why

3985
02:39:05,939 --> 02:39:10,739
don't I do that for myself right so it's

3986
02:39:08,398 --> 02:39:12,239
great to think about that also yeah and

3987
02:39:10,739 --> 02:39:14,039
you know and you know and also kind of

3988
02:39:12,239 --> 02:39:15,600
goes then further to that whole you know

3989
02:39:14,040 --> 02:39:17,640
Secret Life planting and the fact that

3990
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:18,960
we have implants and or you know even to

3991
02:39:17,639 --> 02:39:20,279
that Michael pollen coevolution thing

3992
02:39:18,959 --> 02:39:22,139
how much the plants are having effect on

3993
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:23,520
us and so it's like not just you know

3994
02:39:22,139 --> 02:39:25,858
how the plants are having Effectiveness

3995
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:28,020
but how the the plants that are made

3996
02:39:25,859 --> 02:39:29,880
available through the you know through

3997
02:39:28,020 --> 02:39:31,920
the mycorrhizal kind of network

3998
02:39:29,879 --> 02:39:34,739
connecting the world and then the

3999
02:39:31,920 --> 02:39:36,478
microbes that are like almost inhabiting

4000
02:39:34,739 --> 02:39:38,760
all these different plants that we

4001
02:39:36,478 --> 02:39:40,920
choose to take or not also then you know

4002
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:43,260
so it's like it's almost like how much

4003
02:39:40,920 --> 02:39:45,000
of us is us how much of us is micro our

4004
02:39:43,260 --> 02:39:46,739
microbes that we're consuming from the

4005
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:49,379
other plants that we choose to eat or

4006
02:39:46,739 --> 02:39:50,579
from living a life that's sterile and uh

4007
02:39:49,379 --> 02:39:52,559
you know kind of just being on and off

4008
02:39:50,579 --> 02:39:54,059
serious antibiotics all the time and you

4009
02:39:52,559 --> 02:39:56,579
know being a product of a factory farm

4010
02:39:54,059 --> 02:39:59,279
human system of eating processed [ __ ]

4011
02:39:56,579 --> 02:40:00,780
and you know tons of sugar and killing

4012
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:02,640
off all your microbiome and then just

4013
02:40:00,780 --> 02:40:05,100
repeatedly kind of just being almost

4014
02:40:02,639 --> 02:40:07,680
dull and like you know

4015
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:09,120
yeah you know kind of droned out you

4016
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:10,979
know just kind of further consuming

4017
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:13,380
being a product of a con system of

4018
02:40:10,978 --> 02:40:15,779
consumption is almost you know

4019
02:40:13,379 --> 02:40:17,818
speaking of poop have you seen the uh

4020
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:19,979
research and the studies about uh people

4021
02:40:17,818 --> 02:40:21,619
who are exposed to cat poop

4022
02:40:19,978 --> 02:40:24,420
um are exposed to a certain type of

4023
02:40:21,620 --> 02:40:26,460
plasmosis yeah and it can actually

4024
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:28,620
affect your mood your behavior I mean

4025
02:40:26,459 --> 02:40:31,438
it's it's and cats are necessary for the

4026
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:32,399
breeding cycle so we can make like rats

4027
02:40:31,439 --> 02:40:34,500
more

4028
02:40:32,398 --> 02:40:36,840
um with which are a natural

4029
02:40:34,500 --> 02:40:38,818
um whatever their natural enemies and it

4030
02:40:36,840 --> 02:40:40,859
can make the rats

4031
02:40:38,818 --> 02:40:42,299
want to be friends with the cats and so

4032
02:40:40,859 --> 02:40:44,700
uh there's some really interesting the

4033
02:40:42,299 --> 02:40:46,438
virus gets to rats it makes the rats

4034
02:40:44,700 --> 02:40:48,240
more impulsive and just like walking

4035
02:40:46,439 --> 02:40:50,520
right up to a cat the cat will eat it

4036
02:40:48,239 --> 02:40:52,619
the cat will get the virus and then the

4037
02:40:50,520 --> 02:40:54,180
cats give it humans from interaction and

4038
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:56,640
kind of the other feces and et cetera

4039
02:40:54,180 --> 02:40:58,139
and the original sources cats though I

4040
02:40:56,639 --> 02:40:59,579
looked into it one time because there's

4041
02:40:58,139 --> 02:41:01,500
also this what's sorry what's the

4042
02:40:59,579 --> 02:41:04,139
password the original doctor is cats to

4043
02:41:01,500 --> 02:41:06,600
us right yes yes but but it's mice to

4044
02:41:04,139 --> 02:41:08,879
cats but the cats if there's something

4045
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:11,100
specific about the cat and how the the

4046
02:41:08,879 --> 02:41:12,420
pathogen breeds in the cat because I

4047
02:41:11,100 --> 02:41:14,100
went down a rabbit hole looking at it

4048
02:41:12,420 --> 02:41:16,020
because it it's also an issue with

4049
02:41:14,100 --> 02:41:17,880
certain types of meat and can be

4050
02:41:16,020 --> 02:41:20,040
contaminated on other animals and I know

4051
02:41:17,879 --> 02:41:21,779
Joe Rogan was tweeting about it and I

4052
02:41:20,040 --> 02:41:23,520
was like it's not just cats and then I

4053
02:41:21,780 --> 02:41:25,079
looked into it and for some reason the

4054
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:27,359
cats actually are essential to their

4055
02:41:25,079 --> 02:41:29,219
breeding cycle you know but that's

4056
02:41:27,359 --> 02:41:30,840
what's crazy too is you know it feeds

4057
02:41:29,219 --> 02:41:33,119
into that old cat lady thing you know

4058
02:41:30,840 --> 02:41:36,180
because or old cat dude you know because

4059
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:37,439
it's like if you are you know um in and

4060
02:41:36,180 --> 02:41:39,359
around cats all the time and you know

4061
02:41:37,439 --> 02:41:41,100
they actually say one in four people or

4062
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:44,100
something like that in Europe in the

4063
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:47,280
European Union have uh toxoplasmosis and

4064
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:50,100
yeah and it very markedly kind of you

4065
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:51,840
know it uh shifts people's behavior in

4066
02:41:50,100 --> 02:41:54,600
certain ways to become more Reckless and

4067
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:56,219
impulsive and higher propensity become

4068
02:41:54,600 --> 02:41:59,520
addicted to gambling and certain things

4069
02:41:56,219 --> 02:42:00,959
like that but yeah in the podcast I just

4070
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:03,180
sent about you know listen to talking

4071
02:42:00,959 --> 02:42:05,459
dirty about spiritual plants and

4072
02:42:03,180 --> 02:42:07,559
microbial biodiversity they kind of get

4073
02:42:05,459 --> 02:42:09,179
into and it's the first time I'd ever

4074
02:42:07,559 --> 02:42:10,260
heard it but this neurologist is getting

4075
02:42:09,180 --> 02:42:13,260
into

4076
02:42:10,260 --> 02:42:15,478
um viruses and parasites and how

4077
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:19,318
um you know viruses and parasites also

4078
02:42:15,478 --> 02:42:21,358
in certain ways all that aren't all bad

4079
02:42:19,318 --> 02:42:24,000
um but have certain other weird kind of

4080
02:42:21,359 --> 02:42:26,399
down down Trail or Downstream kind of

4081
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:28,020
beneficial effects so I I don't really

4082
02:42:26,398 --> 02:42:30,840
know what possibly could be beneficial

4083
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:32,220
about toxoplasmosis but but um they get

4084
02:42:30,840 --> 02:42:34,859
into basically these different types of

4085
02:42:32,219 --> 02:42:37,019
disease and viruses that you know

4086
02:42:34,859 --> 02:42:39,540
um similarly I guess have some type of

4087
02:42:37,020 --> 02:42:41,460
weird symbiotic relationship where they

4088
02:42:39,540 --> 02:42:44,880
kind of come and take over the host or

4089
02:42:41,459 --> 02:42:46,559
or impact us and people have them but

4090
02:42:44,879 --> 02:42:48,420
then there is also some other weird

4091
02:42:46,559 --> 02:42:51,478
interesting kind of effects from them

4092
02:42:48,420 --> 02:42:54,000
that are beneficial I guess also it's a

4093
02:42:51,478 --> 02:42:56,398
lot different in people with suppressed

4094
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:58,439
immune system with a strong immune

4095
02:42:56,398 --> 02:43:00,898
system you you can pretty much ignore it

4096
02:42:58,439 --> 02:43:04,500
when when you have suppressed immune

4097
02:43:00,898 --> 02:43:06,239
system it can be uh yeah very very very

4098
02:43:04,500 --> 02:43:08,280
dangerous well and that's and that's

4099
02:43:06,239 --> 02:43:10,139
actually why um you know because and and

4100
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:11,939
that's that's a really awesome segue I

4101
02:43:10,139 --> 02:43:13,439
think Sam um because

4102
02:43:11,939 --> 02:43:15,359
you know because everybody's freaked out

4103
02:43:13,439 --> 02:43:17,220
about microbes on cannabis and it's like

4104
02:43:15,359 --> 02:43:19,859
which ones are good which ones are bad

4105
02:43:17,219 --> 02:43:21,840
and should we regulate all of them you

4106
02:43:19,859 --> 02:43:23,100
know and and so and and and and I'm

4107
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:25,079
really happy to see kind of you know

4108
02:43:23,100 --> 02:43:26,399
Californian you know kind of you

4109
02:43:25,079 --> 02:43:29,280
becoming more educated and how they're

4110
02:43:26,398 --> 02:43:32,039
approaching targeting um you know uh

4111
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:33,840
what microbes to test for because you

4112
02:43:32,040 --> 02:43:36,060
know when you're just testing for you

4113
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:37,920
know total aerobic bacteria total in you

4114
02:43:36,059 --> 02:43:39,199
know total yeast and mold certain things

4115
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:41,280
that are more like indicator

4116
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:43,620
microorganisms that you know of things

4117
02:43:41,280 --> 02:43:45,600
like shelf life and quality and and uh

4118
02:43:43,620 --> 02:43:48,359
stuff like that you know I mean it would

4119
02:43:45,600 --> 02:43:50,340
be very almost ignorant to kind of over

4120
02:43:48,359 --> 02:43:52,200
regulate those because you know we come

4121
02:43:50,340 --> 02:43:53,639
in contact with those every day from

4122
02:43:52,200 --> 02:43:55,800
Foods we eat and like the different

4123
02:43:53,639 --> 02:43:57,719
things we're in you know um interacting

4124
02:43:55,799 --> 02:43:59,279
with in our environment and microbes are

4125
02:43:57,719 --> 02:44:01,139
ubiquitous in our environment you know

4126
02:43:59,280 --> 02:44:02,579
so it's like what microbes are bad you

4127
02:44:01,139 --> 02:44:04,799
know but then yeah I think it's a really

4128
02:44:02,579 --> 02:44:07,200
important thing to distinguish is okay

4129
02:44:04,799 --> 02:44:10,379
well for your average person that has a

4130
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:13,200
semi quasi-strong or relatively strong

4131
02:44:10,379 --> 02:44:15,179
you know microbiome in their gut you

4132
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:16,920
know yeah the presence of kind of you

4133
02:44:15,180 --> 02:44:18,720
know any foreign Invader that you know

4134
02:44:16,920 --> 02:44:20,460
even is potentially

4135
02:44:18,719 --> 02:44:22,679
um pathogenic you know can oftentimes

4136
02:44:20,459 --> 02:44:24,478
get crushed out by this Army of microbes

4137
02:44:22,680 --> 02:44:27,720
that are you know in your gut ready to

4138
02:44:24,478 --> 02:44:29,760
just wage war against anything bad you

4139
02:44:27,719 --> 02:44:31,199
know and so so you know but but but such

4140
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:33,180
a quite distinct different situation

4141
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:34,800
whenever somebody's undergone chemo and

4142
02:44:33,180 --> 02:44:37,139
radiation and serious after series of

4143
02:44:34,799 --> 02:44:39,539
antibiotics and they have no stomach

4144
02:44:37,139 --> 02:44:41,398
stomach microbiota you know essentially

4145
02:44:39,540 --> 02:44:43,080
and so it's like so those you know those

4146
02:44:41,398 --> 02:44:45,840
types of patients should almost choose

4147
02:44:43,079 --> 02:44:48,539
their cannabis medicine based more off

4148
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:50,340
sterility you know than they should

4149
02:44:48,540 --> 02:44:52,319
um you know anything else uh you know

4150
02:44:50,340 --> 02:44:54,239
whether you know that's taste or flavor

4151
02:44:52,318 --> 02:44:55,680
or kind of you know terpene I mean

4152
02:44:54,239 --> 02:44:57,959
almost in a certain just in a certain

4153
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:59,880
capacity for safety because yeah you

4154
02:44:57,959 --> 02:45:01,379
know like you know and that's that's the

4155
02:44:59,879 --> 02:45:03,420
difference we try to distinguish is just

4156
02:45:01,379 --> 02:45:05,818
you know people that are you know stage

4157
02:45:03,420 --> 02:45:07,859
four cancer you know unless their herbs

4158
02:45:05,818 --> 02:45:09,539
essentially sterilized and you know or

4159
02:45:07,859 --> 02:45:12,300
like tested and you're very confident

4160
02:45:09,540 --> 02:45:13,859
that it's very low cfu of anything or

4161
02:45:12,299 --> 02:45:15,239
you know or screened and kind of for

4162
02:45:13,859 --> 02:45:16,439
mycotoxins and all that stuff they

4163
02:45:15,239 --> 02:45:18,799
probably shouldn't they should choose

4164
02:45:16,439 --> 02:45:21,540
more off like these you know sterile

4165
02:45:18,799 --> 02:45:23,398
extracted oils that are standardized

4166
02:45:21,540 --> 02:45:24,720
milligram dose you know so that they can

4167
02:45:23,398 --> 02:45:25,858
I mean because those types of patients

4168
02:45:24,719 --> 02:45:28,260
are you know almost going to benefit

4169
02:45:25,859 --> 02:45:31,220
more from that type of treatment you

4170
02:45:28,260 --> 02:45:31,219
know than you know

4171
02:45:31,439 --> 02:45:37,020
but better can makes gamma-ray

4172
02:45:34,559 --> 02:45:38,939
sterilized material which lowers the

4173
02:45:37,020 --> 02:45:41,399
terpenes has no effect on the

4174
02:45:38,939 --> 02:45:43,739
cannabinoids but it does slightly lower

4175
02:45:41,398 --> 02:45:45,239
the terpene content

4176
02:45:43,739 --> 02:45:46,978
that's right gamma radiation that's

4177
02:45:45,239 --> 02:45:49,199
right but but but again you know it's

4178
02:45:46,978 --> 02:45:51,239
like is is a patient I mean sure if a

4179
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:53,700
patient gets gamma irradiated weed that

4180
02:45:51,239 --> 02:45:55,139
slightly turbos apps you know and you

4181
02:45:53,700 --> 02:45:57,060
know they're smoking it but they have

4182
02:45:55,139 --> 02:45:58,978
stage four Clinic you know stage four

4183
02:45:57,059 --> 02:46:01,139
cancer or something I mean again they

4184
02:45:58,978 --> 02:46:03,179
should probably be more trying to ramp

4185
02:46:01,139 --> 02:46:04,739
up high-dose milligram oils you know

4186
02:46:03,180 --> 02:46:06,479
than than you know kind of thinking that

4187
02:46:04,739 --> 02:46:10,559
they're going to smoke like a you know

4188
02:46:06,478 --> 02:46:12,659
15 total cannabinoid bud in a joint and

4189
02:46:10,559 --> 02:46:14,279
burn it and then you know lose half of

4190
02:46:12,659 --> 02:46:16,500
it or more you know from the combustion

4191
02:46:14,280 --> 02:46:18,000
process you know so so you know that's

4192
02:46:16,500 --> 02:46:19,920
the kind of thing I'm trying to try to

4193
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:21,420
differentiate oftentimes whenever you

4194
02:46:19,920 --> 02:46:23,280
know I'm working with dispensaries to

4195
02:46:21,420 --> 02:46:24,478
train their blood tenders it's like you

4196
02:46:23,280 --> 02:46:25,620
know whenever you're assessing and

4197
02:46:24,478 --> 02:46:27,179
working with a patient to understand

4198
02:46:25,620 --> 02:46:29,100
where they're at and what they're

4199
02:46:27,180 --> 02:46:31,200
looking for and how level of you know or

4200
02:46:29,100 --> 02:46:33,180
how deep of a you know illness or

4201
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:34,979
disease they're they have it's like you

4202
02:46:33,180 --> 02:46:37,139
know it's important to to help guide

4203
02:46:34,978 --> 02:46:38,699
people to the right type of thing and if

4204
02:46:37,139 --> 02:46:40,559
if you know somebody's looking for

4205
02:46:38,700 --> 02:46:42,720
cannabis and they're trying to kind of

4206
02:46:40,559 --> 02:46:46,139
take on you know major you know kind of

4207
02:46:42,719 --> 02:46:48,179
treatment of a disease I mean you know

4208
02:46:46,139 --> 02:46:49,920
you should almost kind of educate them

4209
02:46:48,180 --> 02:46:51,239
about the the micro thing the

4210
02:46:49,920 --> 02:46:53,340
microbiology thing because you know even

4211
02:46:51,239 --> 02:46:54,898
if you know it's just the East and mold

4212
02:46:53,340 --> 02:46:56,520
and aerobic bacteria that you know if

4213
02:46:54,898 --> 02:46:58,139
somebody has no immune system they

4214
02:46:56,520 --> 02:47:00,300
probably shouldn't smoke it you know

4215
02:46:58,139 --> 02:47:02,159
they they should choose another way of

4216
02:47:00,299 --> 02:47:04,799
ingesting it you know so where they can

4217
02:47:02,159 --> 02:47:07,079
maximize the treatment and minimize the

4218
02:47:04,799 --> 02:47:09,059
potential pathogenic or harmful you know

4219
02:47:07,079 --> 02:47:10,978
things that can be introduced to

4220
02:47:09,059 --> 02:47:13,019
and keep in mind also as I was saying

4221
02:47:10,978 --> 02:47:16,079
before back with the pasteurization same

4222
02:47:13,020 --> 02:47:19,560
with if the plants are treated to kill

4223
02:47:16,079 --> 02:47:21,420
all the microbes those um the DNA and

4224
02:47:19,559 --> 02:47:24,239
the micro products are still there even

4225
02:47:21,420 --> 02:47:26,398
though the bacteria is dead so I also

4226
02:47:24,239 --> 02:47:29,579
worry if some and you see the presence

4227
02:47:26,398 --> 02:47:31,978
of four of dead DNA or of dead microbes

4228
02:47:29,579 --> 02:47:34,139
about DNA on its own has has a negative

4229
02:47:31,978 --> 02:47:37,159
effect you're saying right exactly and

4230
02:47:34,139 --> 02:47:39,779
so if we're um sometimes I worry about

4231
02:47:37,159 --> 02:47:41,280
uh plant producers or Growers thinking

4232
02:47:39,780 --> 02:47:43,140
that they can still have a dirty product

4233
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:45,180
and then just irradiate it at the end

4234
02:47:43,139 --> 02:47:47,159
and then it's magically okay like that's

4235
02:47:45,180 --> 02:47:48,898
not the case we still need especially

4236
02:47:47,159 --> 02:47:50,760
for things like mycotoxins too because

4237
02:47:48,898 --> 02:47:53,340
they're like byproducts of certain

4238
02:47:50,760 --> 02:47:55,559
pathogens they are not destroyed by

4239
02:47:53,340 --> 02:47:58,260
gamma-ray sterilization right the

4240
02:47:55,559 --> 02:48:00,059
organisms may be but not the microtoxins

4241
02:47:58,260 --> 02:48:01,500
they produce so these products almost

4242
02:48:00,059 --> 02:48:03,180
have to go through some type of or

4243
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:05,879
anything with these levels I guess to

4244
02:48:03,180 --> 02:48:07,800
truly create a significant medicinal

4245
02:48:05,879 --> 02:48:09,358
standardized oil it would have to go

4246
02:48:07,799 --> 02:48:12,299
through various steps some

4247
02:48:09,359 --> 02:48:15,120
post-processing to filter out and

4248
02:48:12,299 --> 02:48:17,699
separate out potential mycotoxins or any

4249
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:19,680
other DNA I mean I guess you might not

4250
02:48:17,700 --> 02:48:21,780
be able to remove it all but

4251
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:23,100
you almost need to take that on in a

4252
02:48:21,780 --> 02:48:25,079
certain capacity if you're trying to

4253
02:48:23,100 --> 02:48:27,780
create a product for you know the ultra

4254
02:48:25,079 --> 02:48:29,280
sick what about when you're putting soil

4255
02:48:27,780 --> 02:48:31,439
microbes in

4256
02:48:29,280 --> 02:48:33,180
um are those just staying in the soil or

4257
02:48:31,439 --> 02:48:35,579
are the microbes coming up the plant

4258
02:48:33,180 --> 02:48:36,800
getting in the flowers like how is that

4259
02:48:35,579 --> 02:48:39,180
working

4260
02:48:36,799 --> 02:48:41,059
if they're if you know oftentimes

4261
02:48:39,180 --> 02:48:43,380
compost teas and you know beneficial

4262
02:48:41,059 --> 02:48:45,299
microbes you know are used to you know

4263
02:48:43,379 --> 02:48:47,339
as you know as bio fungicides or

4264
02:48:45,299 --> 02:48:49,318
bioinsecticides to spray on the foliage

4265
02:48:47,340 --> 02:48:51,540
of the plants you know but I mean if

4266
02:48:49,318 --> 02:48:53,100
they're being sprayed full you know into

4267
02:48:51,540 --> 02:48:54,540
Fuller application then yeah they're

4268
02:48:53,100 --> 02:48:56,280
going to inoculate the leaf surfaces

4269
02:48:54,540 --> 02:48:57,720
they're going to be present there

4270
02:48:56,280 --> 02:48:59,340
um you know but but I mean if they're

4271
02:48:57,719 --> 02:49:01,679
not going to necessarily kind of come up

4272
02:48:59,340 --> 02:49:02,639
with root drench or you know feed the

4273
02:49:01,680 --> 02:49:04,800
the

4274
02:49:02,639 --> 02:49:06,539
the inner part of the plant

4275
02:49:04,799 --> 02:49:07,559
or the I guess the roots of the plaque

4276
02:49:06,540 --> 02:49:09,300
they're not going to kind of yeah

4277
02:49:07,559 --> 02:49:11,398
systemically you know kind of transfer

4278
02:49:09,299 --> 02:49:13,879
but if you you know but but if to not

4279
02:49:11,398 --> 02:49:16,920
use systemic homicides

4280
02:49:13,879 --> 02:49:19,079
biological you know inoculants and so so

4281
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:22,620
it's you know so most people are using

4282
02:49:19,079 --> 02:49:24,299
at least in veg or you know very very

4283
02:49:22,620 --> 02:49:25,680
very very very beginning of flower you

4284
02:49:24,299 --> 02:49:27,898
know people will still kind of spray

4285
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:29,939
things like actinovade or forage which

4286
02:49:27,898 --> 02:49:32,639
are strepalomyces beneficial fungus or

4287
02:49:29,939 --> 02:49:34,859
you know BT or BS or different types of

4288
02:49:32,639 --> 02:49:38,219
bacteria

4289
02:49:34,859 --> 02:49:39,479
yeah the the rhizobacterias uh will stay

4290
02:49:38,219 --> 02:49:41,159
on the root and then there's certain

4291
02:49:39,478 --> 02:49:44,519
types of strains that will encumber the

4292
02:49:41,159 --> 02:49:46,619
plant itself but rhizobacterias they

4293
02:49:44,520 --> 02:49:47,640
just colonize and grow on the root

4294
02:49:46,620 --> 02:49:49,319
itself

4295
02:49:47,639 --> 02:49:50,519
so yeah you're absolutely right and

4296
02:49:49,318 --> 02:49:51,898
Bravo

4297
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:54,000
with uh

4298
02:49:51,898 --> 02:49:55,680
that's awesome you've said man you're

4299
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:57,120
you're right on point with so many great

4300
02:49:55,680 --> 02:49:58,800
things it's nice to listen to you

4301
02:49:57,120 --> 02:50:01,140
brother yeah you've been going off hard

4302
02:49:58,799 --> 02:50:03,420
today Alec I gotta say as well I've been

4303
02:50:01,139 --> 02:50:04,858
really enjoying everything uh that

4304
02:50:03,420 --> 02:50:06,898
you've shared so far

4305
02:50:04,859 --> 02:50:10,260
it's a yeah it's a beautiful honor to be

4306
02:50:06,898 --> 02:50:14,779
in this group of amazing mentors

4307
02:50:10,260 --> 02:50:14,780
the hats he wears are too straight

4308
02:50:16,280 --> 02:50:21,840
oh Sam yeah

4309
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:23,640
I like this super straight last time he

4310
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:26,719
was on hash church he was like snuffing

4311
02:50:23,639 --> 02:50:26,719
at Pina or something

4312
02:50:26,780 --> 02:50:31,079
I love it

4313
02:50:28,859 --> 02:50:32,640
I do love it yeah that's great good

4314
02:50:31,079 --> 02:50:34,379
conversation guys everyone in the chat

4315
02:50:32,639 --> 02:50:37,019
is absolutely enjoying it there was

4316
02:50:34,379 --> 02:50:38,879
someone that asked a question to you Sam

4317
02:50:37,020 --> 02:50:40,800
and I don't know if I can find it if it

4318
02:50:38,879 --> 02:50:43,619
was it was something about what did you

4319
02:50:40,799 --> 02:50:46,799
mean by needing a thousand plants to

4320
02:50:43,620 --> 02:50:50,160
perverse to preserve genetic diversity

4321
02:50:46,799 --> 02:50:51,539
okay well if you're trying to save a

4322
02:50:50,159 --> 02:50:54,719
land race

4323
02:50:51,540 --> 02:50:57,000
then you have one or two plants picked

4324
02:50:54,719 --> 02:50:59,938
out of it and you reproduce it in a

4325
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:03,600
closet under a light all you're doing is

4326
02:50:59,939 --> 02:51:06,300
you're reproducing that a a couple of

4327
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:09,899
plants from because from the variety

4328
02:51:06,299 --> 02:51:13,139
because uh if you want to keep all of

4329
02:51:09,898 --> 02:51:15,898
the traits and save all of the genes in

4330
02:51:13,139 --> 02:51:19,318
that land race variety you need at least

4331
02:51:15,898 --> 02:51:22,799
a thousand females and a thousand males

4332
02:51:19,318 --> 02:51:25,260
if a higher count is better but at least

4333
02:51:22,799 --> 02:51:29,340
if you have 2 000 plants you're

4334
02:51:25,260 --> 02:51:32,159
preserving 99.9 or some ridiculously

4335
02:51:29,340 --> 02:51:34,559
high amount uh percent of the genes are

4336
02:51:32,159 --> 02:51:36,478
conserved each time you reproduce the

4337
02:51:34,559 --> 02:51:38,398
variety

4338
02:51:36,478 --> 02:51:40,379
so we're talking about the genetic

4339
02:51:38,398 --> 02:51:42,059
expression so when people who are

4340
02:51:40,379 --> 02:51:44,039
watching this when you get a pack of

4341
02:51:42,059 --> 02:51:45,779
seeds you'll notice that you get a

4342
02:51:44,040 --> 02:51:47,399
different expression of genetics in

4343
02:51:45,780 --> 02:51:49,319
those individual seeds even if they're

4344
02:51:47,398 --> 02:51:50,818
from the same plant so

4345
02:51:49,318 --> 02:51:53,959
that's kind of what

4346
02:51:50,818 --> 02:51:53,959
we're talking about there

4347
02:51:57,020 --> 02:52:05,579
the plants are not identical it's a soup

4348
02:52:01,379 --> 02:52:09,358
of of genes that are compatible and work

4349
02:52:05,579 --> 02:52:11,760
together and are reproducible as a as a

4350
02:52:09,359 --> 02:52:13,380
collective whole but when you start

4351
02:52:11,760 --> 02:52:16,079
breaking up little pieces and

4352
02:52:13,379 --> 02:52:19,438
reproducing it it doesn't have

4353
02:52:16,079 --> 02:52:21,478
everything that the big suit has you

4354
02:52:19,439 --> 02:52:23,760
know you know something pretty pretty

4355
02:52:21,478 --> 02:52:25,619
interesting um yeah so I just got back

4356
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:28,200
from Oregon I was up in Oregon for the

4357
02:52:25,620 --> 02:52:29,880
past week and uh and there's this big

4358
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:30,960
issue that you know I mean people have

4359
02:52:29,879 --> 02:52:32,219
been talking about for a long time that

4360
02:52:30,959 --> 02:52:33,778
I think it's just about to like really

4361
02:52:32,219 --> 02:52:36,299
popping all over you know in California

4362
02:52:33,779 --> 02:52:37,979
too but you know all these producers who

4363
02:52:36,299 --> 02:52:39,959
are growing in greenhouse and outdoor

4364
02:52:37,978 --> 02:52:42,059
you know are essentially getting seeded

4365
02:52:39,959 --> 02:52:45,119
pretty hard by the or Southern Oregon

4366
02:52:42,059 --> 02:52:47,159
hemp farms and so so you have all these

4367
02:52:45,120 --> 02:52:49,020
like really chronic kind of you know

4368
02:52:47,159 --> 02:52:51,119
sense Mia strains that people have been

4369
02:52:49,020 --> 02:52:53,040
breeding and working with bring out THC

4370
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:54,960
and to create these really high profile

4371
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:57,420
strains and they're essentially getting

4372
02:52:54,959 --> 02:52:59,099
dusted by these feral hemp type

4373
02:52:57,420 --> 02:53:00,059
cultivars

4374
02:52:59,100 --> 02:53:03,120
um you know which I think you know which

4375
02:53:00,059 --> 02:53:04,199
people are super super chapped about but

4376
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:05,460
um I think it's really fascinating

4377
02:53:04,200 --> 02:53:06,899
because you know it's almost like you

4378
02:53:05,459 --> 02:53:08,879
know again through that like idea of the

4379
02:53:06,898 --> 02:53:10,559
you know I guess like uh Botany of

4380
02:53:08,879 --> 02:53:12,358
Desire or something you know it's like

4381
02:53:10,559 --> 02:53:15,239
the plant itself is kind of almost

4382
02:53:12,359 --> 02:53:17,520
through this interesting kind of open

4383
02:53:15,239 --> 02:53:20,219
pollination project you know it's gonna

4384
02:53:17,520 --> 02:53:22,939
be like receding all these high THC

4385
02:53:20,219 --> 02:53:25,379
cultivars you know with novel kind of

4386
02:53:22,939 --> 02:53:26,760
because so much in the ha is I think so

4387
02:53:25,379 --> 02:53:28,259
many of the minor cannabinoids and you

4388
02:53:26,760 --> 02:53:31,020
know even interesting really unique

4389
02:53:28,260 --> 02:53:33,359
terpenes so much are are also locked up

4390
02:53:31,020 --> 02:53:35,100
in the in The Hemp stock or the feral

4391
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:37,318
kind of cannabis stock and then also in

4392
02:53:35,100 --> 02:53:39,000
and you know you know um yeah rare land

4393
02:53:37,318 --> 02:53:41,519
race kind of you know cultivars and

4394
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:44,040
stuff on another note how [ __ ]

4395

we've almost been going for three hours

4432
02:55:06,299 --> 02:55:10,679
I'm glad to continue going if we have

4433
02:55:08,700 --> 02:55:12,060
things to talk about them I want to

4434
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:13,739
bring up another study I don't know if

4435
02:55:12,059 --> 02:55:16,079
you guys talked about it earlier it was

4436
02:55:13,739 --> 02:55:18,659
a new uh human trial double-blind

4437
02:55:16,079 --> 02:55:21,920
placebo-controlled trial with oral

4438
02:55:18,659 --> 02:55:26,340
uh cannabidiol CBD looking at its effect

4439
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:29,340
on anxiety and so they used healthy

4440
02:55:26,340 --> 02:55:30,719
people I didn't read the whole trial I

4441
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:33,719
just saw people tweeting about it and

4442
02:55:30,719 --> 02:55:35,699
saying like oh CBD so overrated it's the

4443
02:55:33,719 --> 02:55:39,239
biggest Placebo ever and like kind of

4444
02:55:35,700 --> 02:55:41,159
you know trolling CBD medicine

4445
02:55:39,239 --> 02:55:42,478
um for anxiety anyway

4446
02:55:41,159 --> 02:55:44,459
um but some issues with the study is

4447
02:55:42,478 --> 02:55:46,260
they looked at healthy people and so

4448
02:55:44,459 --> 02:55:49,139
they found no effect and the doses they

4449
02:55:46,260 --> 02:55:51,960
were giving were 300 milligrams 600

4450
02:55:49,139 --> 02:55:57,119
milligrams or 900 milligrams compared to

4451
02:55:51,959 --> 02:56:01,799
uh no CBD and so the trial design was

4452
02:55:57,120 --> 02:56:03,600
good but I think spray or oral I think

4453
02:56:01,799 --> 02:56:05,818
it was oral I have to read the whole uh

4454
02:56:03,600 --> 02:56:07,318
trial I'll post it uh it just came out

4455
02:56:05,818 --> 02:56:09,059
or it came to my attention just

4456
02:56:07,318 --> 02:56:10,439
yesterday so I haven't had a chance to

4457
02:56:09,059 --> 02:56:12,119
read the whole thing yet but I'm just

4458
02:56:10,439 --> 02:56:13,500
curious what people think

4459
02:56:12,120 --> 02:56:14,819
um I'm wondering if they repeated the

4460
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:17,459
trial with people who actually had

4461
02:56:14,818 --> 02:56:20,000
anxiety if they would show the benefits

4462
02:56:17,459 --> 02:56:22,679
or

4463
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:24,719
anxiety on people who don't have anxiety

4464
02:56:22,680 --> 02:56:27,420
like is that what I'm hearing yeah so

4465
02:56:24,719 --> 02:56:28,978
they did they did these different tests

4466
02:56:27,420 --> 02:56:31,079
um I'm not totally familiar with the

4467
02:56:28,978 --> 02:56:34,079
test so just from the abstract what I

4468
02:56:31,079 --> 02:56:35,340
got is their tests where it's like to

4469
02:56:34,079 --> 02:56:37,799
evoke

4470
02:56:35,340 --> 02:56:39,540
um like Stress and Anxiety in a normal

4471
02:56:37,799 --> 02:56:42,358
person and then they kind of test your

4472
02:56:39,540 --> 02:56:44,700
responses and so they're looking to see

4473
02:56:42,359 --> 02:56:47,399
um and keep in mind this is a clinical

4474
02:56:44,700 --> 02:56:49,260
test so they're trying to uh make

4475
02:56:47,398 --> 02:56:52,019
comparisons so they can say yes it works

4476
02:56:49,260 --> 02:56:54,359
or yes or not so this is so contrived

4477
02:56:52,020 --> 02:56:56,100
type of experiment so do they they

4478
02:56:54,359 --> 02:56:57,960
basically put a bunch of weed in the

4479
02:56:56,100 --> 02:56:59,579
trunk of your car dump Terps on you and

4480
02:56:57,959 --> 02:57:02,119
send you through roadblocks is that how

4481
02:56:59,579 --> 02:57:02,120
it's yeah

4482
02:57:02,898 --> 02:57:06,000
this is why I think it's kind of

4483
02:57:04,859 --> 02:57:08,640
[ __ ] is because they did another

4484
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:10,379
study with 300 milligrams oral and they

4485
02:57:08,639 --> 02:57:12,358
looked at people and they put them

4486
02:57:10,379 --> 02:57:13,978
actually in a test of social anxiety

4487
02:57:12,359 --> 02:57:16,200
where they had to public speak just in

4488
02:57:13,978 --> 02:57:18,179
front of the group so I think that was a

4489
02:57:16,200 --> 02:57:19,620
better test of an anxiety situation

4490
02:57:18,180 --> 02:57:21,659
because most people are terrified of

4491
02:57:19,620 --> 02:57:24,000
public speaking where this one they kind

4492
02:57:21,659 --> 02:57:25,200
of expose them to some imagery and it

4493
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:27,059
looked like they kind of measured like

4494
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:28,260
eye movements and things but I'm just

4495
02:57:27,059 --> 02:57:29,939
wondering if they repeated it with

4496
02:57:28,260 --> 02:57:31,559
people with actual anxiety or different

4497
02:57:29,939 --> 02:57:33,359
tests that they would see an effect and

4498
02:57:31,559 --> 02:57:34,579
maybe they're just showing hey CBD

4499
02:57:33,359 --> 02:57:37,318
doesn't

4500
02:57:34,579 --> 02:57:38,818
alter your Baseline responses in a

4501
02:57:37,318 --> 02:57:40,199
normal healthy person so wouldn't that

4502
02:57:38,818 --> 02:57:41,699
be a good thing

4503
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:43,620
um but yeah so a lot of people were just

4504
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:45,540
saying oh CBD for anxiety that's

4505
02:57:43,620 --> 02:57:47,660
[ __ ] and I don't believe that to be

4506
02:57:45,540 --> 02:57:47,660
true

4507
02:57:48,978 --> 02:57:58,199
it's caused by too much too too fast THC

4508
02:57:53,459 --> 02:58:01,199
then CBD is affected for other things uh

4509
02:57:58,200 --> 02:58:03,840
I don't know you know I'm curious

4510
02:58:01,200 --> 02:58:07,560
well I mean I I have two things come to

4511
02:58:03,840 --> 02:58:09,239
mind one is that this drive for CBD only

4512
02:58:07,559 --> 02:58:10,978
I don't even understand I mean for

4513
02:58:09,239 --> 02:58:13,260
science yeah let's keep looking at it

4514
02:58:10,978 --> 02:58:15,898
the animal studies human trials

4515
02:58:13,260 --> 02:58:19,139
everything has shown that CBD by itself

4516
02:58:15,898 --> 02:58:22,079
is not as effective as CBD imbalance

4517
02:58:19,139 --> 02:58:23,219
with other cannabinoids but you know you

4518
02:58:22,079 --> 02:58:24,180
have

4519
02:58:23,219 --> 02:58:26,099
um

4520
02:58:24,180 --> 02:58:30,120
this

4521
02:58:26,100 --> 02:58:33,180
drive to to try this High CBD on people

4522
02:58:30,120 --> 02:58:36,079
who you're trying to induce anxiety from

4523
02:58:33,180 --> 02:58:39,659
and I would think that someone who has

4524
02:58:36,079 --> 02:58:42,478
uh endocannabinoid regulatory issue

4525
02:58:39,659 --> 02:58:44,760
chronically where it causes long-term

4526
02:58:42,478 --> 02:58:48,299
consequences that may be inducing panic

4527
02:58:44,760 --> 02:58:49,800
attacks or or mood shifts is going to

4528
02:58:48,299 --> 02:58:51,478
interact differently than somebody with

4529
02:58:49,799 --> 02:58:53,039
a healthy functioning endocannabinoid

4530
02:58:51,478 --> 02:58:55,079
system where you just try to induce

4531
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:57,300
stress for someone who has a healthy

4532
02:58:55,079 --> 02:58:59,100
functioning system I don't understand

4533
02:58:57,299 --> 02:59:01,858
why that would seem like it would

4534
02:58:59,100 --> 02:59:03,779
correlate when we know enough about the

4535
02:59:01,859 --> 02:59:05,880
endocannabinoid system endocannabinoid

4536
02:59:03,779 --> 02:59:08,100
deficiency disorders and how some of

4537
02:59:05,879 --> 02:59:10,398
these cannabinoids interact with it and

4538
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:12,779
assume that those are

4539
02:59:10,398 --> 02:59:14,219
interchangeable because it doesn't seem

4540
02:59:12,779 --> 02:59:16,319
like it would be to me so I'm not

4541
02:59:14,219 --> 02:59:17,409
surprised at the results

4542
02:59:16,318 --> 02:59:19,439
hmm

4543
02:59:17,409 --> 02:59:21,959
[Music]

4544
02:59:19,439 --> 02:59:24,020
interesting that's my thought yeah and I

4545
02:59:21,959 --> 02:59:27,119
totally agree with you that CBD alone

4546
02:59:24,020 --> 02:59:28,859
like let's evolve past that because we

4547
02:59:27,120 --> 02:59:31,439
all know it works better with even small

4548
02:59:28,859 --> 02:59:33,840
amounts of THC with even little bits of

4549
02:59:31,439 --> 02:59:36,659
other uh terpenes or I'm assuming other

4550
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:38,279
compounds it works best with other

4551
02:59:36,659 --> 02:59:40,799
compounds and I know that especially

4552
02:59:38,279 --> 02:59:42,659
from the work that I've looked into with

4553
02:59:40,799 --> 02:59:45,299
Crohn's and Colitis I mean they just

4554
02:59:42,659 --> 02:59:48,719
came out with a study with 10 milligrams

4555
02:59:45,299 --> 02:59:50,579
of CBD only orally for patients with

4556
02:59:48,719 --> 02:59:53,159
crohn's disease and showed that it

4557
02:59:50,579 --> 02:59:54,959
wasn't helpful which isn't surprising

4558
02:59:53,159 --> 02:59:58,559
because a lot of the patients are using

4559
02:59:54,959 --> 03:00:00,599
THC and CBD in a one-to-one and I

4560
02:59:58,559 --> 03:00:03,299
um totally agree with you forest and I

4561
03:00:00,600 --> 03:00:06,540
mean I've seen Bonnie Goldstein do many

4562
03:00:03,299 --> 03:00:08,039
talks on her patient population and same

4563
03:00:06,540 --> 03:00:10,979
thing that's the thing that people don't

4564
03:00:08,040 --> 03:00:12,779
want to know is kids also need THC with

4565
03:00:10,978 --> 03:00:15,000
some of these

4566
03:00:12,779 --> 03:00:17,579
they don't they absolutely do I mean

4567
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:19,859
every study has shown that take and

4568
03:00:17,579 --> 03:00:22,620
let's just stick with peer-reviewed or

4569
03:00:19,859 --> 03:00:24,960
double-blind studies the epidiolex

4570
03:00:22,620 --> 03:00:27,779
aesthetic right the GW Pharmaceuticals

4571
03:00:24,959 --> 03:00:30,000
did on meniscuso and Gervais syndrome

4572
03:00:27,779 --> 03:00:31,800
kids we had the doctors coming back to

4573
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:34,859
you know cbd's not as effective as you

4574
03:00:31,799 --> 03:00:37,500
parents said it was but none of us were

4575
03:00:34,859 --> 03:00:40,500
using purified CBD and they looked at a

4576
03:00:37,500 --> 03:00:44,219
clinical dose in those studies at around

4577
03:00:40,500 --> 03:00:46,680
10 milligrams per kilogram right huge

4578
03:00:44,219 --> 03:00:49,858
doses of CBD before they saw any

4579
03:00:46,680 --> 03:00:51,960
efficacy in I was speaking to the head

4580
03:00:49,859 --> 03:00:53,579
of pediatric neurology at UCSF and he's

4581
03:00:51,959 --> 03:00:55,978
like well see this that's what you need

4582
03:00:53,579 --> 03:00:57,719
to do and cbd's not as effective as we

4583
03:00:55,978 --> 03:00:59,519
thought and I had to tell him it's like

4584
03:00:57,719 --> 03:01:02,398
I'm sorry doc but you guys are years

4585
03:00:59,520 --> 03:01:04,319
behind you know awesome that purified

4586
03:01:02,398 --> 03:01:07,278
see you're you're having those results

4587
03:01:04,318 --> 03:01:10,139
because you're using uh

4588
03:01:07,279 --> 03:01:13,739
essentially and it just doesn't work

4589
03:01:10,139 --> 03:01:15,778
that way you know you need to have THC

4590
03:01:13,739 --> 03:01:17,818
and the other cannabinoids in there that

4591
03:01:15,779 --> 03:01:20,340
interact with the receptors differently

4592
03:01:17,818 --> 03:01:22,859
than CBD does and that's why we're using

4593
03:01:20,340 --> 03:01:25,680
10 and 20 milligram doses for some

4594
03:01:22,859 --> 03:01:28,559
people it's saying more uh efficacy than

4595
03:01:25,680 --> 03:01:30,840
you're having at 500 and 700 milligram

4596
03:01:28,559 --> 03:01:33,420
doses well that and that's what I really

4597
03:01:30,840 --> 03:01:35,478
really love kind of about this plant is

4598
03:01:33,420 --> 03:01:37,680
it it almost seems like it's

4599
03:01:35,478 --> 03:01:39,239
unpharmaceuticalizable in a certain to a

4600
03:01:37,680 --> 03:01:41,159
certain level you know because like

4601
03:01:39,239 --> 03:01:43,739
because there's so many people that

4602
03:01:41,159 --> 03:01:45,180
think that the move is to you know kind

4603
03:01:43,739 --> 03:01:46,920
of like and it's weird because like

4604
03:01:45,180 --> 03:01:48,359
there's there's a high demand right now

4605
03:01:46,920 --> 03:01:50,460
I don't know why people are paying for

4606
03:01:48,359 --> 03:01:53,220
it but a lot of people are creating

4607
03:01:50,459 --> 03:01:55,019
um these these these these kind of white

4608
03:01:53,219 --> 03:01:56,760
powders or crystallits you know so

4609
03:01:55,020 --> 03:01:59,640
they're like refining fractionally

4610
03:01:56,760 --> 03:02:01,739
distilling thca and they are this thca

4611
03:01:59,639 --> 03:02:03,239
Crystal and it looks like a drug it's

4612
03:02:01,739 --> 03:02:05,398
like straight white powder and then

4613
03:02:03,239 --> 03:02:07,619
people have the white distal it or you

4614
03:02:05,398 --> 03:02:09,778
can't distill thca

4615
03:02:07,620 --> 03:02:11,399
you can't facilitate to see it well not

4616
03:02:09,779 --> 03:02:12,659
distill not just excuse me I mean well

4617
03:02:11,398 --> 03:02:14,340
whatever it is they're doing like you

4618
03:02:12,659 --> 03:02:15,779
know ethanol and kind of like you know

4619
03:02:14,340 --> 03:02:17,279
kind of just doing some type of

4620
03:02:15,779 --> 03:02:18,600
distillation or not maybe not

4621
03:02:17,279 --> 03:02:19,739
distillation this license with heat I

4622
03:02:18,600 --> 03:02:21,899
get it

4623
03:02:19,739 --> 03:02:24,478
but a recrystallization from an

4624
03:02:21,898 --> 03:02:25,818
extraction yeah or doing it by the rosin

4625
03:02:24,478 --> 03:02:28,260
method or yeah

4626
03:02:25,818 --> 03:02:30,059
right I just mean like yeah and yeah

4627
03:02:28,260 --> 03:02:31,859
excuse me it's like I'm I'm wrong and

4628
03:02:30,059 --> 03:02:36,299
how it's being extracted but they're

4629
03:02:31,859 --> 03:02:38,040
making the like 98 99 thca Crystal or

4630
03:02:36,299 --> 03:02:39,778
you what have you or they're making kind

4631
03:02:38,040 --> 03:02:43,100
of you know the CBD

4632
03:02:39,779 --> 03:02:46,140
um that's you know fully exactly

4633
03:02:43,100 --> 03:02:48,600
the chemist is in me is excited I mean

4634
03:02:46,139 --> 03:02:50,818
you're taking the active ingredient from

4635
03:02:48,600 --> 03:02:53,279
the plant and you're purifying it I mean

4636
03:02:50,818 --> 03:02:55,318
that's heroic and Champion for a whole

4637
03:02:53,279 --> 03:02:56,819
different level no it is it is it is you

4638
03:02:55,318 --> 03:02:58,500
know and I'm not trying to necessarily

4639
03:02:56,818 --> 03:02:59,879
knock on it but I think and I think I

4640
03:02:58,500 --> 03:03:02,159
think it's very unique and interesting

4641
03:02:59,879 --> 03:03:04,199
and novel to be able to take that and

4642
03:03:02,159 --> 03:03:06,359
then you know kind of combine it in

4643
03:03:04,200 --> 03:03:08,040
unique amounts and ratios to really you

4644
03:03:06,359 --> 03:03:10,739
know in some capacity you know nail

4645
03:03:08,040 --> 03:03:11,819
Sometimes some type of a you know you

4646
03:03:10,739 --> 03:03:13,318
know because that's that's what doctors

4647
03:03:11,818 --> 03:03:15,659
are missing and research University are

4648
03:03:13,318 --> 03:03:17,519
missing are the standardized to you know

4649
03:03:15,659 --> 03:03:19,379
but if you think you're gonna get it and

4650
03:03:17,520 --> 03:03:21,899
have an efficacy just by using one

4651
03:03:19,379 --> 03:03:23,519
single molecule isolated compound you

4652
03:03:21,898 --> 03:03:25,199
know it's it's it's exciting to me that

4653
03:03:23,520 --> 03:03:26,880
it's not working in so many of these

4654
03:03:25,200 --> 03:03:28,979
ways and and you know it's having such

4655
03:03:26,879 --> 03:03:31,318
low efficacy in comparison to even just

4656
03:03:28,978 --> 03:03:34,019
having you know you know a tenth amount

4657
03:03:31,318 --> 03:03:37,139
or a 20th the amount of you know a minor

4658
03:03:34,020 --> 03:03:39,600
compound in there let's face it uh thca

4659
03:03:37,139 --> 03:03:42,180
is the Pavarotti in front of this

4660
03:03:39,600 --> 03:03:43,859
Orchestra of other compounds and the

4661
03:03:42,180 --> 03:03:46,020
orchestra of other compounds or

4662
03:03:43,859 --> 03:03:48,300
flavonoids terpenes some other

4663
03:03:46,020 --> 03:03:49,560
cannabinoids other but the star of the

4664
03:03:48,299 --> 03:03:52,259
show

4665
03:03:49,559 --> 03:03:54,659
is thca sorry that's just the way it is

4666
03:03:52,260 --> 03:03:56,579
with this plant right yeah okay now some

4667
03:03:54,659 --> 03:03:58,939
plants don't make THC because they have

4668
03:03:56,579 --> 03:04:01,620
another synthase that helps them make

4669
03:03:58,939 --> 03:04:04,739
cbda and we talked about those earlier

4670
03:04:01,620 --> 03:04:07,740
hemp varieties low THC varieties but

4671
03:04:04,739 --> 03:04:10,139
yeah I mean thca is the star of the show

4672
03:04:07,739 --> 03:04:12,180
so everything else sort of surrounds it

4673
03:04:10,139 --> 03:04:14,699
in kind of like the symphony and we were

4674
03:04:12,180 --> 03:04:18,300
talking before I love using the symphony

4675
03:04:14,700 --> 03:04:20,700
analogy because so so important because

4676
03:04:18,299 --> 03:04:23,039
you might hear

4677
03:04:20,700 --> 03:04:25,140
you know the trumpet and you might hear

4678
03:04:23,040 --> 03:04:27,420
one or two elements of the brass but

4679
03:04:25,139 --> 03:04:29,818
then there's the whole undertone of the

4680
03:04:27,420 --> 03:04:32,219
brass which brings the whole level of

4681
03:04:29,818 --> 03:04:34,318
the orchestra up to a whole different

4682
03:04:32,219 --> 03:04:37,379
level that wouldn't be there if you were

4683
03:04:34,318 --> 03:04:39,778
just listening to a a trumpet and a and

4684
03:04:37,379 --> 03:04:41,699
a trombone player like a small group

4685
03:04:39,779 --> 03:04:44,399
Jazz which I told a lot of two and

4686
03:04:41,700 --> 03:04:46,319
that's why like Ensemble or sympathy is

4687
03:04:44,398 --> 03:04:48,599
almost better than Entourage you know

4688
03:04:46,318 --> 03:04:51,719
absolutely The Ensemble effect because

4689
03:04:48,600 --> 03:04:54,059
they all work together in creating this

4690
03:04:51,719 --> 03:04:57,420
overall fragrance or Essence that you

4691
03:04:54,059 --> 03:05:00,000
know attracts humans yeah

4692
03:04:57,420 --> 03:05:02,219
but make no bones about it it's not just

4693
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:04,318
you know how you grow it and whether

4694
03:05:02,219 --> 03:05:07,260
it's indoors whether it's Sun grown

4695
03:05:04,318 --> 03:05:09,000
Outdoors roots in the ground Outdoors is

4696
03:05:07,260 --> 03:05:11,818
different in Roots in a pot outdoors

4697
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:15,120
everything makes a difference because as

4698
03:05:11,818 --> 03:05:17,398
you very nicely point out we live in a

4699
03:05:15,120 --> 03:05:19,200
microbial world like it or not we're

4700
03:05:17,398 --> 03:05:21,719
just microbes

4701
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:24,000
everywhere on our plants on us

4702
03:05:21,719 --> 03:05:25,858
everywhere everywhere everywhere hey I

4703
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:28,379
wanted to also just throw a wrench in

4704
03:05:25,859 --> 03:05:31,559
the works you know that whole number of

4705
03:05:28,379 --> 03:05:34,099
how many bugs are on us I've heard that

4706
03:05:31,559 --> 03:05:36,539
sort of tend to one there's ten to one

4707
03:05:34,100 --> 03:05:39,540
microbial cells for every human cells

4708
03:05:36,540 --> 03:05:42,060
that thing is more like about one to one

4709
03:05:39,540 --> 03:05:44,220
folks it really really is so because

4710
03:05:42,059 --> 03:05:49,559
there's more recent studies that show

4711
03:05:44,219 --> 03:05:51,778
it's about 1.1 the 1.9 the one so it's

4712
03:05:49,559 --> 03:05:54,478
really close to one to one in terms of

4713
03:05:51,779 --> 03:05:57,479
microbial mass and your human body mass

4714
03:05:54,478 --> 03:06:00,119
so it's not ten to one as was previously

4715
03:05:57,478 --> 03:06:03,260
thought yeah what if you smoke weed

4716
03:06:00,120 --> 03:06:05,880
every day in regards to so yeah

4717
03:06:03,260 --> 03:06:08,520
I was just gonna say this is the

4718
03:06:05,879 --> 03:06:11,639
exception for those of us who are full

4719
03:06:08,520 --> 03:06:14,880
of [ __ ] those people have a lot of money

4720
03:06:11,639 --> 03:06:18,318
when we lived in caves I'm sure it was

4721
03:06:14,879 --> 03:06:18,318
more like ten to one

4722
03:06:21,200 --> 03:06:25,680
bacteria within the human body it's like

4723
03:06:23,340 --> 03:06:26,818
a ratio of ten to one but it's like no

4724
03:06:25,680 --> 03:06:28,620
it's been it's definitely been

4725
03:06:26,818 --> 03:06:30,420
overestimated that ten to one because

4726
03:06:28,620 --> 03:06:32,819
when I started my grad school program

4727
03:06:30,420 --> 03:06:34,978
and I was in a bacteria expert lab like

4728
03:06:32,818 --> 03:06:37,079
Leading The Way with toll like receptive

4729
03:06:34,978 --> 03:06:39,059
research we were all saying 10 to 1 10

4730
03:06:37,079 --> 03:06:41,039
to 1 and by the end we were toning down

4731
03:06:39,059 --> 03:06:42,840
because yeah it was overestimated it's

4732
03:06:41,040 --> 03:06:45,600
still a significant amount but ten to

4733
03:06:42,840 --> 03:06:47,340
one is not the appropriate number yeah I

4734
03:06:45,600 --> 03:06:48,960
think that the take-home point is that

4735
03:06:47,340 --> 03:06:50,340
there's a significant amount I mean

4736
03:06:48,959 --> 03:06:52,139
whether we're saying ten to one or one

4737
03:06:50,340 --> 03:06:54,180
to one it really doesn't change the

4738
03:06:52,139 --> 03:06:55,920
point that there's a huge interaction

4739
03:06:54,180 --> 03:06:58,079
between the microbiome and the body

4740
03:06:55,920 --> 03:06:59,879
that's all yeah and what's what's

4741
03:06:58,079 --> 03:07:03,659
interesting that is that my best friends

4742
03:06:59,879 --> 03:07:07,019
are bacteria 2016 you know and we're

4743
03:07:03,659 --> 03:07:09,420
just beginning to actually fully realize

4744
03:07:07,020 --> 03:07:11,340
and understand the human microbiome you

4745
03:07:09,420 --> 03:07:14,420
know I mean that's when we started it in

4746
03:07:11,340 --> 03:07:17,159
2016 is when they started I believe

4747
03:07:14,420 --> 03:07:19,739
2015-16 when they began the human body

4748
03:07:17,159 --> 03:07:22,920
biome this should and that's just when

4749
03:07:19,739 --> 03:07:25,859
they started it yeah I mean so new it's

4750
03:07:22,920 --> 03:07:27,719
so new that this data is is trailblazing

4751
03:07:25,859 --> 03:07:29,700
right now yeah like how lucky are we

4752
03:07:27,719 --> 03:07:32,039
that we can actually sit here and debate

4753
03:07:29,700 --> 03:07:34,500
whether it's the Ensemble effect or the

4754
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:36,420
Entourage effect or like if it's ten to

4755
03:07:34,500 --> 03:07:37,559
one or one to one I mean we've come a

4756
03:07:36,420 --> 03:07:39,478
long way and we've got a lot of

4757
03:07:37,559 --> 03:07:41,039
knowledge and I think that you know

4758
03:07:39,478 --> 03:07:43,139
sharing that knowledge is the important

4759
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:45,899
thing of getting stuck up on the

4760
03:07:43,139 --> 03:07:48,119
semantics of isant is Ensemble versus

4761
03:07:45,898 --> 03:07:50,778
Entourage really like much better I mean

4762
03:07:48,120 --> 03:07:54,479
to me those points are kind of moved but

4763
03:07:50,779 --> 03:07:58,040
have you guys looked into the report Dr

4764
03:07:54,478 --> 03:07:58,039
Russo put out this week

4765
03:08:05,840 --> 03:08:10,680
The Usual Suspects a few promising leads

4766
03:08:08,818 --> 03:08:12,420
yeah that's a paper that he's published

4767
03:08:10,680 --> 03:08:14,700
yeah it's a paper paper he published

4768
03:08:12,420 --> 03:08:16,020
with jhan Marco that was just published

4769
03:08:14,700 --> 03:08:18,359
what's it called it's a book chapter

4770
03:08:16,020 --> 03:08:20,819
it's not a paper yeah it's the chapter

4771
03:08:18,359 --> 03:08:22,979
but it's a cannabis pharmacology it's on

4772
03:08:20,818 --> 03:08:25,079
PubMed uh Usual Suspects and a few

4773
03:08:22,978 --> 03:08:27,179
promising leads

4774
03:08:25,079 --> 03:08:30,000
um read the abstract they haven't bought

4775
03:08:27,180 --> 03:08:32,159
the rest of it yet but has anyone

4776
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:33,840
checked it out yeah but yeah I haven't I

4777
03:08:32,159 --> 03:08:35,279
didn't I saw I read the abstract I

4778
03:08:33,840 --> 03:08:38,340
didn't even try to look her for it on

4779
03:08:35,279 --> 03:08:41,279
the side Hub if you go on Reddit I liked

4780
03:08:38,340 --> 03:08:43,020
it okay usually those those type of

4781
03:08:41,279 --> 03:08:44,399
Publications aren't shared around when

4782
03:08:43,020 --> 03:08:47,880
they're chapters from a book they're not

4783
03:08:44,398 --> 03:08:50,818
as easily accessible unless you're Sam

4784
03:08:47,879 --> 03:08:54,358
yeah it's 30 bucks I mean it's not too

4785
03:08:50,818 --> 03:08:55,859
bad luckily on Sam it's not it's not the

4786
03:08:54,359 --> 03:08:58,140
30 bucks for me it's that like that's

4787
03:08:55,859 --> 03:09:00,479
one of a thousand articles I'm always

4788
03:08:58,139 --> 03:09:01,978
looking for right so I I look I don't

4789
03:09:00,478 --> 03:09:03,478
look at it the same as just 30 bucks

4790
03:09:01,978 --> 03:09:05,398
it's like it's like is this another one

4791
03:09:03,478 --> 03:09:07,318
that I want to buy yeah

4792
03:09:05,398 --> 03:09:09,000
another one that came out just to put on

4793
03:09:07,318 --> 03:09:12,059
everyone's radar if you're working with

4794
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:14,340
patients is a a new study on

4795
03:09:12,059 --> 03:09:16,939
interactions between Canada and commonly

4796
03:09:14,340 --> 03:09:19,439
used anti-epileptic drugs so

4797
03:09:16,939 --> 03:09:21,779
who are working with people coming in

4798
03:09:19,439 --> 03:09:23,340
for seizures and spasms I think it's

4799
03:09:21,779 --> 03:09:26,159
really critical that we've known for a

4800
03:09:23,340 --> 03:09:29,639
long time how the camera dial working on

4801
03:09:26,159 --> 03:09:30,739
cytochrome what is it p450 uh affects

4802
03:09:29,639 --> 03:09:33,840
the metabolism of certain

4803
03:09:30,739 --> 03:09:36,299
benzodiazepines like uh clove exam and

4804
03:09:33,840 --> 03:09:38,219
comfy but now they have a list of like

4805
03:09:36,299 --> 03:09:40,259
six other drugs that they've shown that

4806
03:09:38,219 --> 03:09:42,299
it interacts the drug levels in the body

4807
03:09:40,260 --> 03:09:44,159
so something to look for if you're

4808
03:09:42,299 --> 03:09:46,379
working with patients for sure that just

4809
03:09:44,159 --> 03:09:47,818
came out earlier this week Boris do you

4810
03:09:46,379 --> 03:09:49,679
see uh this is a random quick question

4811
03:09:47,818 --> 03:09:52,619
do you see um uh the benefit of

4812
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:54,779
ketogenic diet a lot with the epileptic

4813
03:09:52,620 --> 03:09:56,340
kids or patients that you work with yeah

4814
03:09:54,779 --> 03:09:57,960
certain kinds I mean you're just it's

4815
03:09:56,340 --> 03:10:00,359
all about changing brain chemistry yeah

4816
03:09:57,959 --> 03:10:01,978
right so kind of with with those

4817
03:10:00,359 --> 03:10:03,239
families certain adults or kids or

4818
03:10:01,978 --> 03:10:05,818
anyone dealing with those sort of things

4819
03:10:03,239 --> 03:10:08,100
and I think that's too much for Focus

4820
03:10:05,818 --> 03:10:09,420
yeah is that a sentence and they too

4821
03:10:08,100 --> 03:10:11,180
heavily focus on those sort of things

4822
03:10:09,420 --> 03:10:14,159
but just epilepsy I think any

4823
03:10:11,180 --> 03:10:16,200
neurological sort of condition albeit

4824
03:10:14,159 --> 03:10:17,818
depression or other things we see it

4825
03:10:16,200 --> 03:10:19,620
affected with with diet because you're

4826
03:10:17,818 --> 03:10:22,879
changing the chemistry in the body but

4827
03:10:19,620 --> 03:10:25,079
yeah we go through all diets and

4828
03:10:22,879 --> 03:10:26,879
supplements and cannabinoid

4829
03:10:25,079 --> 03:10:29,398
phytocannabinoid supplements are really

4830
03:10:26,879 --> 03:10:30,839
where we aim for with those kids and you

4831
03:10:29,398 --> 03:10:32,159
know you just you get lucky with some

4832
03:10:30,840 --> 03:10:34,318
and not with others they're all

4833
03:10:32,159 --> 03:10:36,299
individuals

4834
03:10:34,318 --> 03:10:38,159
there's also for those who are curious

4835
03:10:36,299 --> 03:10:40,139
there's the ketogenic diet is a high

4836
03:10:38,159 --> 03:10:42,359
protein high fat site then there's the

4837
03:10:40,139 --> 03:10:43,858
gaps diet and modified Atkins all three

4838
03:10:42,359 --> 03:10:45,180
of those kind of create different

4839
03:10:43,859 --> 03:10:47,399
effects and they can all be really

4840
03:10:45,180 --> 03:10:50,040
beneficial they're all similar in low

4841
03:10:47,398 --> 03:10:51,898
carb right low processed grain low kind

4842
03:10:50,040 --> 03:10:54,960
of bean and legume and all that stuff

4843
03:10:51,898 --> 03:10:56,760
yeah yeah yep

4844
03:10:54,959 --> 03:10:58,679
yeah and then and you know maybe maybe

4845
03:10:56,760 --> 03:11:00,059
this is also a you know topic I guess

4846
03:10:58,680 --> 03:11:01,979
for another conversation I don't know if

4847
03:11:00,059 --> 03:11:04,680
it seems like it's probably kind of

4848
03:11:01,978 --> 03:11:07,559
wrapping up but I would really love at

4849
03:11:04,680 --> 03:11:10,620
some point to like have a deep House

4850
03:11:07,559 --> 03:11:12,359
Church dive into kind of the

4851
03:11:10,620 --> 03:11:14,880
um you know like almost inviting like

4852
03:11:12,359 --> 03:11:16,559
you know maybe like Mark Lewis Mike

4853
03:11:14,879 --> 03:11:18,659
baucus you know and then maybe some of

4854
03:11:16,559 --> 03:11:20,760
the genetic dudes like the phyllo Skies

4855
03:11:18,659 --> 03:11:23,639
or motorcycle skies I mean it'd be kind

4856
03:11:20,760 --> 03:11:26,219
of a Royal Rumble you know of uh of a

4857
03:11:23,639 --> 03:11:27,420
hash church but I think I mean you know

4858
03:11:26,219 --> 03:11:29,699
they're you know just with that that

4859
03:11:27,420 --> 03:11:31,920
recent kind of article that came out the

4860
03:11:29,700 --> 03:11:34,079
great pop Monopoly you know kind of all

4861
03:11:31,920 --> 03:11:36,120
around the you know you know the Utility

4862
03:11:34,079 --> 03:11:37,439
Patent reality of some of the type 2

4863
03:11:36,120 --> 03:11:39,300
stuff happening

4864
03:11:37,439 --> 03:11:40,979
you know and then you know on the on the

4865
03:11:39,299 --> 03:11:42,840
other end then you have like the people

4866
03:11:40,978 --> 03:11:45,119
and the genetic testing Realm of the

4867
03:11:42,840 --> 03:11:48,059
world that are you know seeking to kind

4868
03:11:45,120 --> 03:11:49,800
of sequence and you know claim to you

4869
03:11:48,059 --> 03:11:51,239
know open source a lot of stuff but you

4870
03:11:49,799 --> 03:11:53,159
know I just have a lot of questions

4871
03:11:51,239 --> 03:11:54,719
about the potential of you know data

4872
03:11:53,159 --> 03:11:57,000
aggregating genetic data in the future

4873
03:11:54,719 --> 03:11:58,619
you know of all this information that's

4874
03:11:57,000 --> 03:12:01,200
being given out just

4875
03:11:58,620 --> 03:12:02,399
you know you know to you know from all

4876
03:12:01,200 --> 03:12:03,600
these breeding conditions across the

4877
03:12:02,398 --> 03:12:04,739
world to all the you know to these

4878
03:12:03,600 --> 03:12:06,359
companies that are you know kind of

4879
03:12:04,739 --> 03:12:08,520
eventually have a lot of power to

4880
03:12:06,359 --> 03:12:10,318
Aggregate and like look at and notice

4881
03:12:08,520 --> 03:12:12,060
unique interesting things about the

4882
03:12:10,318 --> 03:12:14,159
genetics of the plan just whether or not

4883
03:12:12,059 --> 03:12:15,778
it's all like malevolent or benevolent

4884
03:12:14,159 --> 03:12:17,100
you know and and you know I just think

4885
03:12:15,779 --> 03:12:19,500
it's a really fascinating topic that

4886
03:12:17,100 --> 03:12:21,120
most people don't really understand and

4887
03:12:19,500 --> 03:12:23,398
so since we don't understand it we

4888
03:12:21,120 --> 03:12:25,500
almost take it offensively I think it's

4889
03:12:23,398 --> 03:12:27,420
not either malevolent or benevolent it's

4890
03:12:25,500 --> 03:12:29,100
just the way it is it's business and

4891
03:12:27,420 --> 03:12:31,020
this is now that cannabis is in the

4892
03:12:29,100 --> 03:12:32,818
world which is Major like uh

4893
03:12:31,020 --> 03:12:34,800
philosophical like kind of ethical

4894
03:12:32,818 --> 03:12:35,939
conversation you know yeah yeah I agree

4895
03:12:34,799 --> 03:12:38,219
with you but I had this conversation

4896
03:12:35,939 --> 03:12:39,960
with Mowgli this week I spent the funnel

4897
03:12:38,219 --> 03:12:42,000
with I spent an hour on the phone with

4898
03:12:39,959 --> 03:12:44,579
them talking about it and I'd love to

4899
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:46,318
rapidly offline I I think part of this

4900
03:12:44,579 --> 03:12:48,898
is that you know these grievances that

4901
03:12:46,318 --> 03:12:51,539
people have towards the way this [ __ ] is

4902
03:12:48,898 --> 03:12:54,299
playing out are not grievances they have

4903
03:12:51,540 --> 03:12:57,120
actually towards a given company or set

4904
03:12:54,299 --> 03:12:59,159
of individuals that are carrying out the

4905
03:12:57,120 --> 03:13:01,260
way normal business does normal business

4906
03:12:59,159 --> 03:13:03,478
really if you have gripes with Pat

4907
03:13:01,260 --> 03:13:05,398
utility patents then you need to talk to

4908
03:13:03,478 --> 03:13:08,039
the Utility Patent officer the people in

4909
03:13:05,398 --> 03:13:10,439
America or the courts and change the way

4910
03:13:08,040 --> 03:13:12,540
that the USPTO Works which isn't going

4911
03:13:10,439 --> 03:13:13,920
to happen well but that's but that's the

4912
03:13:12,540 --> 03:13:16,200
thing though and it's like to take that

4913
03:13:13,920 --> 03:13:18,600
hatred that you have or that lack of

4914
03:13:16,200 --> 03:13:20,340
respect that you have for a system and

4915
03:13:18,600 --> 03:13:22,079
then put it on the shoulders of one

4916
03:13:20,340 --> 03:13:23,579
group that is operating within the legal

4917
03:13:22,079 --> 03:13:25,978
mechanism of the system I think is

4918
03:13:23,579 --> 03:13:27,659
misplaced no I and I agree with that you

4919
03:13:25,978 --> 03:13:30,719
know and it's interesting because I I

4920
03:13:27,659 --> 03:13:32,219
have uh you know I I'm like this I have

4921
03:13:30,719 --> 03:13:35,519
this like Switzerland type thing I'm

4922
03:13:32,219 --> 03:13:37,019
trying to represent you know in in

4923
03:13:35,520 --> 03:13:39,120
um not you know because I don't

4924
03:13:37,020 --> 03:13:41,640
understand really too much of either

4925
03:13:39,120 --> 03:13:44,160
side I understand you know pretty vastly

4926
03:13:41,639 --> 03:13:46,920
the implications of the the utility

4927
03:13:44,159 --> 03:13:48,180
patents you know um you know and I think

4928
03:13:46,920 --> 03:13:49,379
you know I have a lot of qualms with it

4929
03:13:48,180 --> 03:13:50,520
on its own

4930
03:13:49,379 --> 03:13:52,559
um you know just you know

4931
03:13:50,520 --> 03:13:54,120
philosophically blah blah but then on

4932
03:13:52,559 --> 03:13:56,519
top of that you know then like there's

4933
03:13:54,120 --> 03:13:57,960
there's the the claim means you know

4934
03:13:56,520 --> 03:14:00,540
purpose and service of the genetic

4935
03:13:57,959 --> 03:14:02,459
testing services that are sequencing the

4936
03:14:00,540 --> 03:14:04,200
Cannabis genome and and they're also

4937
03:14:02,459 --> 03:14:05,579
going to be qualms and concerns with

4938
03:14:04,200 --> 03:14:07,380
that too Hey listen they're doing

4939
03:14:05,579 --> 03:14:09,600
bioinformatics screening it says it

4940
03:14:07,379 --> 03:14:11,159
pretty much right in there yeah your

4941
03:14:09,600 --> 03:14:12,840
your your contract that you sign when

4942
03:14:11,159 --> 03:14:14,760
you submit a sample yeah and you know

4943
03:14:12,840 --> 03:14:17,460
it's not like let's be honest it's no

4944
03:14:14,760 --> 03:14:19,439
different from FC Labs I mean SC Labs

4945
03:14:17,459 --> 03:14:21,059
gets to sample the market from a

4946
03:14:19,439 --> 03:14:22,620
chemical basis and you get to see things

4947
03:14:21,059 --> 03:14:24,778
before anybody else even knows they're

4948
03:14:22,620 --> 03:14:26,700
going on well but but but if we're but

4949
03:14:24,779 --> 03:14:28,620
if we're a specific third-party testing

4950
03:14:26,700 --> 03:14:31,859
laboratory that doesn't have Holdings in

4951
03:14:28,620 --> 03:14:34,020
genetic development or like you know r d

4952
03:14:31,859 --> 03:14:36,120
or you know kind of creating genetics or

4953
03:14:34,020 --> 03:14:38,100
kind of making products you know and and

4954
03:14:36,120 --> 03:14:39,420
and also it's like a very limited uh

4955
03:14:38,100 --> 03:14:41,220
fingerprint of what we're getting you

4956
03:14:39,420 --> 03:14:42,719
know the key no no I hear you I'm just

4957
03:14:41,219 --> 03:14:44,818
saying I'm just amazed like what could

4958
03:14:42,719 --> 03:14:46,978
be pulled out bioinformatically from you

4959
03:14:44,818 --> 03:14:49,739
know long sniff sequencing or from you

4960
03:14:46,978 --> 03:14:51,840
know whatever let me tell you the honest

4961
03:14:49,739 --> 03:14:55,739
truth uh

4962
03:14:51,840 --> 03:14:59,159
it has a huge value you can say look at

4963
03:14:55,739 --> 03:15:02,100
here's a plant that has lots of THC no

4964
03:14:59,159 --> 03:15:08,459
CBD has lots of

4965
03:15:02,100 --> 03:15:12,239
and it has uh pinene and uh vital

4966
03:15:08,459 --> 03:15:15,299
I mean there's a lot of value that and

4967
03:15:12,239 --> 03:15:17,760
not to you at this moment but there will

4968
03:15:15,299 --> 03:15:19,500
be people to who that will be a gold

4969
03:15:17,760 --> 03:15:21,359
mine because they're looking for

4970
03:15:19,500 --> 03:15:22,978
particular things yeah and let me let me

4971
03:15:21,359 --> 03:15:24,239
say something else I like on that point

4972
03:15:22,978 --> 03:15:25,978
I mean

4973
03:15:24,239 --> 03:15:28,079
listen this is the same thing that

4974
03:15:25,978 --> 03:15:30,059
happens with with big business like

4975
03:15:28,079 --> 03:15:31,680
Monsanto but I'm not saying that you're

4976
03:15:30,059 --> 03:15:34,920
Monsanto but but what I am saying is

4977
03:15:31,680 --> 03:15:37,079
that you guys are collecting data and I

4978
03:15:34,920 --> 03:15:38,818
mean we can take this one end of the

4979
03:15:37,079 --> 03:15:41,340
spectrum that you grow old and when

4980
03:15:38,818 --> 03:15:43,978
you're 70 you pass the the business down

4981
03:15:41,340 --> 03:15:45,960
to your children or potentially you get

4982
03:15:43,978 --> 03:15:48,659
bought out right and so all that data

4983
03:15:45,959 --> 03:15:49,858
gets bought out too right

4984
03:15:48,659 --> 03:15:51,600
um and these are just things that happen

4985
03:15:49,859 --> 03:15:53,520
in the world of real business right it's

4986
03:15:51,600 --> 03:15:55,559
like there's consequences when we start

4987
03:15:53,520 --> 03:15:57,239
providing a service and collecting data

4988
03:15:55,559 --> 03:15:58,920
I mean Google makes all their money on

4989
03:15:57,239 --> 03:16:00,719
Analytics

4990
03:15:58,920 --> 03:16:02,398
right like that's the whole point it's

4991
03:16:00,719 --> 03:16:04,019
like you you get to access a whole bunch

4992
03:16:02,398 --> 03:16:05,699
of people search data and you understand

4993
03:16:04,020 --> 03:16:07,140
what they like and what they want and

4994
03:16:05,700 --> 03:16:10,020
then from that you can make decisions

4995
03:16:07,139 --> 03:16:12,119
based on their on what you can Market to

4996
03:16:10,020 --> 03:16:13,800
them right so it's it's really no

4997
03:16:12,120 --> 03:16:16,200
different you know in all of these

4998
03:16:13,799 --> 03:16:18,000
perspectives right well well I mean so I

4999
03:16:16,200 --> 03:16:19,200
mean I mean I kind of I kind of see what

5000
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:21,600
you're talking about to a certain point

5001
03:16:19,200 --> 03:16:23,700
but whenever you know with 98

5002
03:16:21,600 --> 03:16:26,040
predictability anything that we test

5003
03:16:23,700 --> 03:16:28,380
having one of three or four primary

5004
03:16:26,040 --> 03:16:31,080
terpenes an additional like two or three

5005
03:16:28,379 --> 03:16:32,519
four you know secondary sesquite

5006
03:16:31,079 --> 03:16:33,840
terpenes or you know uh you know

5007
03:16:32,520 --> 03:16:35,340
whatever

5008
03:16:33,840 --> 03:16:37,200
um you know it's you know most

5009
03:16:35,340 --> 03:16:38,639
everything that comes through I mean

5010
03:16:37,200 --> 03:16:41,340
yeah there are these you know one

5011
03:16:38,639 --> 03:16:43,318
percent outliers that have really rare

5012
03:16:41,340 --> 03:16:44,818
Unique Kind of certain

5013
03:16:43,318 --> 03:16:46,559
um primary terpenes that never really

5014
03:16:44,818 --> 03:16:48,478
show up in any significant statistical

5015
03:16:46,559 --> 03:16:50,159
amount but you know most everything kind

5016
03:16:48,478 --> 03:16:51,599
of falls into this range of you know

5017
03:16:50,159 --> 03:16:54,180
what's there but you know we're talking

5018
03:16:51,600 --> 03:16:56,880
about you know one typically one climate

5019
03:16:54,180 --> 03:16:59,880
cannabinoid thca and then like you know

5020
03:16:56,879 --> 03:17:01,858
two to three collections that are

5021
03:16:59,879 --> 03:17:04,019
important because you want to sit

5022
03:17:01,859 --> 03:17:07,559
through it to find those little tiny

5023
03:17:04,020 --> 03:17:09,479
flakes of gold well well I mean like our

5024
03:17:07,559 --> 03:17:11,760
whole like you know kind of vision for

5025
03:17:09,478 --> 03:17:14,159
that is the how exciting of a tool that

5026
03:17:11,760 --> 03:17:16,340
is than to help people that are breeding

5027
03:17:14,159 --> 03:17:19,260
and focusing on genetics to identify

5028
03:17:16,340 --> 03:17:21,898
what on the rainbow of what on the

5029
03:17:19,260 --> 03:17:24,120
rainbow of uniqueness do they have and

5030
03:17:21,898 --> 03:17:26,760
what can they fill in and then from

5031
03:17:24,120 --> 03:17:28,260
there what unique combinations can they

5032
03:17:26,760 --> 03:17:29,520
breed out through combining this one

5033
03:17:28,260 --> 03:17:31,500
from this side of the rainbow to this

5034
03:17:29,520 --> 03:17:33,180
one to the side let me call through

5035
03:17:31,500 --> 03:17:35,100
breeding people can you know start to

5036
03:17:33,180 --> 03:17:36,300
fill in the holes where you know maybe a

5037
03:17:35,100 --> 03:17:37,380
lot of the eradication kind of has

5038
03:17:36,299 --> 03:17:39,358
happened over the last you know 100

5039
03:17:37,379 --> 03:17:41,219
years that might have gotten rid of a

5040
03:17:39,359 --> 03:17:43,020
lot of the unique interesting stuff but

5041
03:17:41,219 --> 03:17:44,398
it's all for the purpose of further

5042
03:17:43,020 --> 03:17:46,079
being able to pull out and breed out and

5043
03:17:44,398 --> 03:17:48,420
kind of bring about the diversity that

5044
03:17:46,079 --> 03:17:49,978
this planet has but but and then just

5045
03:17:48,420 --> 03:17:51,779
real quick then you know because because

5046
03:17:49,978 --> 03:17:53,938
I'm like in my opinion that's a you know

5047
03:17:51,779 --> 03:17:55,620
that's a small amount of information you

5048
03:17:53,939 --> 03:17:58,260
know but it's a lot of ability to help

5049
03:17:55,620 --> 03:18:00,779
kind of you know the public value of

5050
03:17:58,260 --> 03:18:03,180
data help drive a lot of work kind of

5051
03:18:00,779 --> 03:18:04,460
future breeding or or you know

5052
03:18:03,180 --> 03:18:07,439
identification

5053
03:18:04,459 --> 03:18:09,299
but my question is is how's you know

5054
03:18:07,439 --> 03:18:10,979
because I I would think and maybe I'm

5055
03:18:09,299 --> 03:18:13,438
just ignorant but I would think that

5056
03:18:10,978 --> 03:18:15,239
that amount of data is you know like you

5057
03:18:13,439 --> 03:18:18,239
know on a certain level valuable yeah I

5058
03:18:15,239 --> 03:18:20,398
feel you but but if you're we're not

5059
03:18:18,239 --> 03:18:22,859
taking and sequencing the not entire

5060
03:18:20,398 --> 03:18:24,959
genetic kind of expression of the plan

5061
03:18:22,859 --> 03:18:27,120
you know so that you know one day

5062
03:18:24,959 --> 03:18:30,299
potentially we can notice unique really

5063
03:18:27,120 --> 03:18:32,520
trippy synthase genes or or certain

5064
03:18:30,299 --> 03:18:34,679
environmental characteristics that might

5065
03:18:32,520 --> 03:18:36,600
help explain through reverse engineering

5066
03:18:34,680 --> 03:18:39,239
certain Appalachian Tendencies or

5067
03:18:36,600 --> 03:18:40,559
qualities let me comment on that

5068
03:18:39,239 --> 03:18:42,539
um

5069
03:18:40,559 --> 03:18:44,639
this and this is the weakness of all

5070
03:18:42,540 --> 03:18:46,439
those genetic tests okay so when Mowgli

5071
03:18:44,639 --> 03:18:49,260
was on here he said you know we're doing

5072
03:18:46,439 --> 03:18:51,479
this open cannabis product project and

5073
03:18:49,260 --> 03:18:53,818
what we need is all the labs to donate

5074
03:18:51,478 --> 03:18:56,039
their chemical data right which made me

5075
03:18:53,818 --> 03:18:58,260
laugh because essentially they're

5076
03:18:56,040 --> 03:19:00,899
charging for their service they're not

5077
03:18:58,260 --> 03:19:02,880
giving it away for free and why should

5078
03:19:00,898 --> 03:19:05,519
why should SC Labs right or anybody else

5079
03:19:02,879 --> 03:19:07,920
that's in that game too

5080
03:19:05,520 --> 03:19:10,260
um the second thing is that the genetic

5081
03:19:07,920 --> 03:19:12,659
data on its own is completely useless

5082
03:19:10,260 --> 03:19:15,000
without understanding what

5083
03:19:12,659 --> 03:19:16,680
bioinformatics yeah well no well you can

5084
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:18,420
do the bioinformatics but it's like once

5085
03:19:16,680 --> 03:19:19,859
you can if you have the genetic data and

5086
03:19:18,420 --> 03:19:21,840
you can't correlate it to a set of

5087
03:19:19,859 --> 03:19:24,059
traits so that you can start following

5088
03:19:21,840 --> 03:19:26,398
those genetic markers and traits over

5089
03:19:24,059 --> 03:19:28,739
Generations you can't tie them together

5090
03:19:26,398 --> 03:19:31,019
right so there's an inherent flaw in

5091
03:19:28,739 --> 03:19:32,639
only accepting dispensory samples and

5092
03:19:31,020 --> 03:19:34,140
trying to do genetic work you have to

5093
03:19:32,639 --> 03:19:36,180
have a breeding program that goes along

5094
03:19:34,139 --> 03:19:38,039
beside it so that you can understand how

5095
03:19:36,180 --> 03:19:39,960
those traits are inherited whether

5096
03:19:38,040 --> 03:19:42,240
they're scored phenotypically or scored

5097
03:19:39,959 --> 03:19:43,679
hematical leave through a lab so say

5098
03:19:42,239 --> 03:19:45,898
they get all that

5099
03:19:43,680 --> 03:19:48,239
who are well no no I'm saying I'm saying

5100
03:19:45,898 --> 03:19:50,519
so so yeah so it seems like the

5101
03:19:48,239 --> 03:19:52,799
chemotherapy data would be incredible

5102
03:19:50,520 --> 03:19:54,479
important absolutely it's totally tied

5103
03:19:52,799 --> 03:19:56,099
together some of the genetic realities

5104
03:19:54,478 --> 03:19:57,420
of the story you can't have it's you

5105
03:19:56,100 --> 03:19:59,818
don't have the full story unless you

5106
03:19:57,420 --> 03:20:02,460
have both pieces well okay but what I

5107
03:19:59,818 --> 03:20:05,100
mean but but if say if like over time

5108
03:20:02,459 --> 03:20:07,318
any genetic company were to collect

5109
03:20:05,100 --> 03:20:09,479
thousands and thousands of chemotype

5110
03:20:07,318 --> 03:20:11,519
data kind of imprints to then overlap

5111
03:20:09,478 --> 03:20:13,799
with you know the same genetic kind of

5112
03:20:11,520 --> 03:20:15,899
stuff I mean what is what can they come

5113
03:20:13,799 --> 03:20:17,639
out with I mean what and and this is

5114
03:20:15,898 --> 03:20:19,139
again this is more from a space of

5115
03:20:17,639 --> 03:20:21,358
ignorance than it is anything else

5116
03:20:19,139 --> 03:20:24,959
because I'm like [ __ ] dude I think like

5117
03:20:21,359 --> 03:20:27,540
my ultimate like dystopian view you know

5118
03:20:24,959 --> 03:20:30,239
would be you know in the future you have

5119
03:20:27,540 --> 03:20:33,960
like some people that figured out how to

5120
03:20:30,239 --> 03:20:35,818
[ __ ] you know like bio hack the plant

5121
03:20:33,959 --> 03:20:36,959
and then like all of a sudden you know

5122
03:20:35,818 --> 03:20:38,159
across the United States you have all

5123
03:20:36,959 --> 03:20:40,799
the pharmaceutical companies with

5124
03:20:38,159 --> 03:20:42,719
[ __ ] acres carved out of like insulin

5125
03:20:40,799 --> 03:20:45,000
growing cannabis through the trichomes

5126
03:20:42,719 --> 03:20:46,799
or [ __ ] Obits growing out of the

5127
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:48,420
trichomes of cannabis plants you know or

5128
03:20:46,799 --> 03:20:50,159
whatever and I mean that's kind of a

5129
03:20:48,420 --> 03:20:52,620
stupid kind of uh Terminator type trip

5130
03:20:50,159 --> 03:20:54,600
reality of where it could go but I'm

5131
03:20:52,620 --> 03:20:56,220
just not at all I mean listen that's not

5132
03:20:54,600 --> 03:20:58,079
a bad thing you remember the Ebola thing

5133
03:20:56,219 --> 03:21:00,719
that went off crazy in Africa like about

5134
03:20:58,079 --> 03:21:03,239
18 months ago or whatever I'm just fine

5135
03:21:00,719 --> 03:21:05,639
yeah they were making they grew the

5136
03:21:03,239 --> 03:21:07,559
Ebola vaccine in tobacco

5137
03:21:05,639 --> 03:21:09,539
okay it's like it's way faster to

5138
03:21:07,559 --> 03:21:12,239
transfect Tobacco than it is to create a

5139
03:21:09,540 --> 03:21:13,620
strain and start ramping it up in a a

5140
03:21:12,239 --> 03:21:15,420
bioreactor it's like it's actually

5141
03:21:13,620 --> 03:21:17,460
tobacco is one of the easiest plants to

5142
03:21:15,420 --> 03:21:18,960
transform and you can put proteins into

5143
03:21:17,459 --> 03:21:21,119
it and grow them really quick and clone

5144
03:21:18,959 --> 03:21:23,938
them up and then extract them so the

5145
03:21:21,120 --> 03:21:25,560
future yeah maybe there is to like

5146
03:21:23,939 --> 03:21:27,300
produce all kinds of pharmaceutical

5147
03:21:25,559 --> 03:21:28,859
drugs through the trichomes absolutely

5148
03:21:27,299 --> 03:21:31,199
there's a guy I can't remember if they

5149
03:21:28,859 --> 03:21:32,880
do DMT would I be into it there's a guy

5150
03:21:31,200 --> 03:21:34,920
on uh

5151
03:21:32,879 --> 03:21:38,159
there's a TED Talk and if you if you go

5152
03:21:34,920 --> 03:21:40,680
to Google and you search TED Talks homo

5153
03:21:38,159 --> 03:21:43,340
evolutists so like think Homo sapiens

5154
03:21:40,680 --> 03:21:47,398
but homo evolutists so

5155
03:21:43,340 --> 03:21:49,139
evolutis yeah that's awesome and

5156
03:21:47,398 --> 03:21:51,000
essentially it's his argument is that

5157
03:21:49,139 --> 03:21:53,099
we're no longer Homo sapiens we're now a

5158
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:54,719
different species that are instead of

5159
03:21:53,100 --> 03:21:57,720
altering the environment like we have

5160
03:21:54,719 --> 03:21:59,699
done over the past 10 000 years we now

5161
03:21:57,719 --> 03:22:02,219
alter the genomes of the other organisms

5162
03:21:59,700 --> 03:22:03,960
around us and ourselves is inevitably

5163
03:22:02,219 --> 03:22:05,579
where it's coming to

5164
03:22:03,959 --> 03:22:07,739
um but yeah crispr cannabis is coming

5165
03:22:05,579 --> 03:22:09,779
soon there's only people in God there's

5166
03:22:07,739 --> 03:22:11,879
already people working on it

5167
03:22:09,779 --> 03:22:13,140
um and and you know what cannabis is

5168
03:22:11,879 --> 03:22:16,139
actually pretty special because there's

5169
03:22:13,139 --> 03:22:18,420
not many plants that produce 30 percent

5170
03:22:16,139 --> 03:22:19,920
um of one compound in a given you know

5171
03:22:18,420 --> 03:22:22,318
like you said an expression system like

5172
03:22:19,920 --> 03:22:23,818
the Tricom so if we find out how to

5173
03:22:22,318 --> 03:22:25,379
hijack it then you know what we can

5174
03:22:23,818 --> 03:22:26,719
actually use cannabis to produce all

5175
03:22:25,379 --> 03:22:29,818
these different things

5176
03:22:26,719 --> 03:22:31,379
and then who is I mean and then so I

5177
03:22:29,818 --> 03:22:33,840
guess what I mean and what does that do

5178
03:22:31,379 --> 03:22:34,858
to bug in Monsanto then

5179
03:22:33,840 --> 03:22:37,079
yeah

5180
03:22:34,859 --> 03:22:38,460
well I think again it's like that stupid

5181
03:22:37,079 --> 03:22:39,959
article it's like they you know they

5182
03:22:38,459 --> 03:22:41,398
paint this image that it's monster well

5183
03:22:39,959 --> 03:22:44,159
no and well you know well I'm I'm

5184
03:22:41,398 --> 03:22:45,898
wondering who did Monsanto the guys the

5185
03:22:44,159 --> 03:22:48,239
article is talking about or the guys

5186
03:22:45,898 --> 03:22:50,340
that put like the article in the ear of

5187
03:22:48,239 --> 03:22:52,559
the journalist you know and that's

5188
03:22:50,340 --> 03:22:54,478
what's funny dude they're everybody I

5189
03:22:52,559 --> 03:22:56,219
mean everybody's Monsanto don't say that

5190
03:22:54,478 --> 03:22:57,840
I'm not yeah they are because I mean in

5191
03:22:56,219 --> 03:23:00,539
the article too they talk about Ziggy

5192
03:22:57,840 --> 03:23:02,579
right Ziggy and Jeff and jodery up in uh

5193
03:23:00,540 --> 03:23:04,439
in Humboldt and uh how they said they'd

5194
03:23:02,579 --> 03:23:06,000
patent their stuff too right so it's

5195
03:23:04,439 --> 03:23:07,800
like everybody would do it if they could

5196
03:23:06,000 --> 03:23:10,079
but I think a lot of people are you know

5197
03:23:07,799 --> 03:23:11,519
kind of don't fully understand you know

5198
03:23:10,079 --> 03:23:13,439
their people just don't want their [ __ ]

5199
03:23:11,520 --> 03:23:15,238
to get jacked you know and and a lot I

5200
03:23:13,439 --> 03:23:18,238
think a lot of people have okay but wait

5201
03:23:15,238 --> 03:23:20,459
wait a second of the type 2 non-mirison

5202
03:23:18,238 --> 03:23:21,898
dominant strains somehow is going to

5203
03:23:20,459 --> 03:23:23,879
infringe on their development of their

5204
03:23:21,898 --> 03:23:25,920
genetics which it's not okay but what

5205
03:23:23,879 --> 03:23:27,898
happens but real quick what happens when

5206
03:23:25,920 --> 03:23:30,180
what happens when all these THC

5207
03:23:27,898 --> 03:23:31,799
cultivars or thca cultivars that are

5208
03:23:30,180 --> 03:23:34,020
grown in Oregon are getting back and

5209
03:23:31,799 --> 03:23:36,478
randomly accidentally seated by this

5210
03:23:34,020 --> 03:23:38,640
Hemp stock uh these hemp crops that are

5211
03:23:36,478 --> 03:23:41,340
in southern Oregon and then like if they

5212
03:23:38,639 --> 03:23:42,778
happen to props pop some seeds you know

5213
03:23:41,340 --> 03:23:45,238
all of a sudden what if they got like a

5214
03:23:42,779 --> 03:23:47,640
terpenolene or like a limonene dominant

5215
03:23:45,238 --> 03:23:49,398
type too accidentally from that is is

5216
03:23:47,639 --> 03:23:51,719
that now infringing

5217
03:23:49,398 --> 03:23:53,639
if you take it and you Market it

5218
03:23:51,719 --> 03:23:57,299
intentionally because it's alignment

5219
03:23:53,639 --> 03:23:59,879
type too hell yeah that's tricky it's

5220
03:23:57,299 --> 03:24:03,000
not gonna accidentally pop up and just

5221
03:23:59,879 --> 03:24:05,579
be dominant in the field you might have

5222
03:24:03,000 --> 03:24:07,500
one plant that way but it's not going to

5223
03:24:05,579 --> 03:24:09,000
happen now these things are these things

5224
03:24:07,500 --> 03:24:11,219
are the result of intentional breeding

5225
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:12,659
and it's got kind of you know call me

5226
03:24:11,219 --> 03:24:14,519
biased but I kind of laugh at it a

5227
03:24:12,659 --> 03:24:16,139
little bit because it's like these

5228
03:24:14,520 --> 03:24:18,238
things really are Innovations people

5229
03:24:16,139 --> 03:24:19,799
don't they're huge Innovations but they

5230
03:24:18,238 --> 03:24:21,600
don't exist on the market so it's like

5231
03:24:19,799 --> 03:24:23,459
how can you sit there as a part of the

5232
03:24:21,600 --> 03:24:25,020
community and say well it's unfair that

5233
03:24:23,459 --> 03:24:26,639
those guys did all that breeding work

5234
03:24:25,020 --> 03:24:28,140
and develop something that I didn't do

5235
03:24:26,639 --> 03:24:30,059
you know what I mean well and it's

5236
03:24:28,139 --> 03:24:32,099
disingenuous and it's also disingenuous

5237
03:24:30,059 --> 03:24:34,500
to then try to sell a service like

5238
03:24:32,100 --> 03:24:36,000
trying to scare people that this patent

5239
03:24:34,500 --> 03:24:38,159
is going to crush their ability to grow

5240
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:40,620
what they've grown all their life

5241
03:24:38,159 --> 03:24:42,119
yeah and I mean I talked about this with

5242
03:24:40,620 --> 03:24:44,100
my ugly and I talked about it with Kevin

5243
03:24:42,120 --> 03:24:45,960
before and it's like it's like I said to

5244
03:24:44,100 --> 03:24:48,600
Malibu this week it's I find it a little

5245
03:24:45,959 --> 03:24:51,358
bit disingenuous that these guys are

5246
03:24:48,600 --> 03:24:53,220
listen Mowgli and Kevin are Super Hyper

5247
03:24:51,359 --> 03:24:54,899
intelligent people and and they're good

5248
03:24:53,219 --> 03:24:56,398
guys too like they're like I consider

5249
03:24:54,898 --> 03:24:59,699
them like I really like both of them

5250
03:24:56,398 --> 03:25:02,278
yeah yeah so but I mean again they're

5251
03:24:59,700 --> 03:25:04,319
coming into a game that some of us have

5252
03:25:02,279 --> 03:25:06,899
been playing a lot longer than they have

5253
03:25:04,318 --> 03:25:08,818
and then essentially they're saying so

5254
03:25:06,898 --> 03:25:10,920
they're hella paranoid

5255
03:25:08,818 --> 03:25:12,659
yeah once it's there I mean dude we're

5256
03:25:10,920 --> 03:25:14,818
Rebels and people like the whole the

5257
03:25:12,659 --> 03:25:16,139
whole class of us are people that live

5258
03:25:14,818 --> 03:25:17,760
on the edge of society so we're

5259
03:25:16,139 --> 03:25:19,379
untrusting of the government as it is

5260
03:25:17,760 --> 03:25:21,238
right we're untrusting of big

5261
03:25:19,379 --> 03:25:22,500
corporations

5262
03:25:21,238 --> 03:25:24,359
um

5263
03:25:22,500 --> 03:25:26,159
and anyhow I I mean I don't know it's

5264
03:25:24,359 --> 03:25:27,720
like I I do also agree with you I feel

5265
03:25:26,159 --> 03:25:28,920
it's a little bit disingenuous to be

5266
03:25:27,719 --> 03:25:31,619
saying that

5267
03:25:28,920 --> 03:25:33,540
they're essentially the Protectors of

5268
03:25:31,620 --> 03:25:35,040
They're Gonna Save the Cannabis

5269
03:25:33,540 --> 03:25:36,660
Community from the big evil Corporation

5270
03:25:35,040 --> 03:25:38,819
well especially when like they have

5271
03:25:36,659 --> 03:25:41,700
sponsored and promoted and kind of like

5272
03:25:38,818 --> 03:25:43,680
Instagram and Facebook posts with the

5273
03:25:41,700 --> 03:25:47,640
great pop Monopoly on the pit on the as

5274
03:25:43,680 --> 03:25:49,500
the posting you know as a as a [ __ ]

5275
03:25:47,639 --> 03:25:51,180
like almost like a article to sell the

5276
03:25:49,500 --> 03:25:52,680
service you know and it's not and it's

5277
03:25:51,180 --> 03:25:54,779
not drawing distinction one way or

5278
03:25:52,680 --> 03:25:56,279
another good bad whatever I'm just again

5279
03:25:54,779 --> 03:25:58,620
trying to just figure it out because

5280
03:25:56,279 --> 03:25:59,640
like I think intention matters a lot and

5281
03:25:58,620 --> 03:26:01,380
you know I just think a lot of people

5282
03:25:59,639 --> 03:26:03,358
don't really understand the whole

5283
03:26:01,379 --> 03:26:04,738
reality of what's happening or or you

5284
03:26:03,359 --> 03:26:07,680
know and I think there's a lot of um you

5285
03:26:04,738 --> 03:26:09,779
know using fears of patents to like kind

5286
03:26:07,680 --> 03:26:11,579
of you know just I don't know yeah we

5287
03:26:09,779 --> 03:26:13,560
listen we had Newton Malibu on here I

5288
03:26:11,579 --> 03:26:16,379
think it's pretty obvious to anybody and

5289
03:26:13,559 --> 03:26:18,600
Mark dude uh Mark's not coming but um

5290
03:26:16,379 --> 03:26:19,920
Mowgli had a uh you know I think it was

5291
03:26:18,600 --> 03:26:22,500
pretty clear from the way he came on

5292
03:26:19,920 --> 03:26:24,059
that he's mowgli's an idealist and he's

5293
03:26:22,500 --> 03:26:26,040
a beautiful human being and I don't

5294
03:26:24,059 --> 03:26:28,619
think that there is evil intent in in

5295
03:26:26,040 --> 03:26:31,680
their work I think he truly wants to

5296
03:26:28,620 --> 03:26:33,120
um stand the molecular genetics of

5297
03:26:31,680 --> 03:26:34,620
cannabis in order to be to be able to

5298
03:26:33,120 --> 03:26:36,300
exploit them or help other breeders

5299
03:26:34,620 --> 03:26:38,160
exploit them I mean that's clearly their

5300
03:26:36,299 --> 03:26:40,619
business plan that's mckernan's business

5301
03:26:38,159 --> 03:26:42,119
plan as well too it's anybody's business

5302
03:26:40,620 --> 03:26:44,160
plan that's working let them or let

5303
03:26:42,120 --> 03:26:47,460
others exploit them or help others

5304
03:26:44,159 --> 03:26:49,738
exploit right very exploitive terms well

5305
03:26:47,459 --> 03:26:52,159
they're not but I mean exploit I mean um

5306
03:26:49,738 --> 03:26:55,680
I mean Expressions

5307
03:26:52,159 --> 03:26:58,200
to take advantage of Kevin's coming up

5308
03:26:55,680 --> 03:27:00,898
with Hands-On laboratory Diagnostics

5309
03:26:58,200 --> 03:27:02,819
that look to be quite useful in the

5310
03:27:00,898 --> 03:27:05,398
industry I don't see that happen over at

5311
03:27:02,818 --> 03:27:07,139
mabley's uh I don't know I don't want to

5312
03:27:05,398 --> 03:27:08,818
get into that conversation I won for I

5313
03:27:07,139 --> 03:27:10,818
for one totally disagree with you

5314
03:27:08,818 --> 03:27:13,859
they're both they're both in business

5315
03:27:10,818 --> 03:27:16,619
they're both in business the smoke could

5316
03:27:13,859 --> 03:27:18,420
join and look at the Galaxy yeah but

5317
03:27:16,620 --> 03:27:20,279
listen they're both in business they're

5318
03:27:18,420 --> 03:27:22,559
both our corporations they're both going

5319
03:27:20,279 --> 03:27:25,200
to find any way to take the knowledge

5320
03:27:22,559 --> 03:27:28,079
that they gain through their sequencing

5321
03:27:25,200 --> 03:27:30,180
um their sequencing foray and find a way

5322
03:27:28,079 --> 03:27:32,039
to turn profit about that I mean that's

5323
03:27:30,180 --> 03:27:33,779
that's what they do right it's the same

5324
03:27:32,040 --> 03:27:36,660
thing that SC Labs does in offering a

5325
03:27:33,779 --> 03:27:37,800
service for uh the the lab service that

5326
03:27:36,659 --> 03:27:39,840
you guys offer and it's the same thing

5327
03:27:37,799 --> 03:27:41,699
that I do and offering seeds to the

5328
03:27:39,840 --> 03:27:42,420
market in Europe so

5329
03:27:41,700 --> 03:27:45,120
um

5330
03:27:42,420 --> 03:27:46,620
I I I I I have a problem when people

5331
03:27:45,120 --> 03:27:48,960
start pointing at the other guy's stack

5332
03:27:46,620 --> 03:27:50,819
and saying it's unfair that you did this

5333
03:27:48,959 --> 03:27:53,219
to make that money

5334
03:27:50,818 --> 03:27:54,420
um those are you know and and listen the

5335
03:27:53,219 --> 03:27:56,398
reality is Alex that you're talking

5336
03:27:54,420 --> 03:27:58,079
about this dystopia

5337
03:27:56,398 --> 03:28:00,358
um it is the future and I don't think it

5338
03:27:58,079 --> 03:28:02,039
is it's dystopia I think that it's just

5339
03:28:00,359 --> 03:28:03,659
these are the tools that exist in the

5340
03:28:02,040 --> 03:28:05,040
marketplace and of course those tools

5341
03:28:03,659 --> 03:28:07,020
are going to be used to investigate

5342
03:28:05,040 --> 03:28:08,880
cannabis and of course people are going

5343
03:28:07,020 --> 03:28:10,979
to take that information that they glean

5344
03:28:08,879 --> 03:28:12,179
from their experimentation and they're

5345
03:28:10,978 --> 03:28:14,579
going to try and find a way to profit

5346
03:28:12,180 --> 03:28:15,960
from it and uh and it's going to happen

5347
03:28:14,579 --> 03:28:17,579
on the Philo side it's going to happen

5348
03:28:15,959 --> 03:28:18,959
on the medicinal genomic side and it's

5349
03:28:17,579 --> 03:28:21,059
going to happen on those guys that we're

5350
03:28:18,959 --> 03:28:22,259
doing the patent side so

5351
03:28:21,059 --> 03:28:23,159
um but if you look at those people I

5352
03:28:22,260 --> 03:28:24,898
mean it's like people like Michael

5353
03:28:23,159 --> 03:28:26,879
Backus and he's not involved anymore but

5354
03:28:24,898 --> 03:28:29,459
he was and you know he's the guy's an

5355
03:28:26,879 --> 03:28:31,920
industry leader so he's been doing it

5356
03:28:29,459 --> 03:28:34,379
for a long time I mean he's 100 and he's

5357
03:28:31,920 --> 03:28:37,978
one of the he's straight he's straight

5358
03:28:34,379 --> 03:28:40,379
up oh gee right so

5359
03:28:37,978 --> 03:28:42,179
I have a little bit of a hard time this

5360
03:28:40,379 --> 03:28:44,398
is my first connection of selling packs

5361
03:28:42,180 --> 03:28:46,380
to whenever I first came into the

5362
03:28:44,398 --> 03:28:48,299
Cannabis Community they developed one of

5363
03:28:46,379 --> 03:28:50,699
the first truly medical dispensaries in

5364
03:28:48,299 --> 03:28:52,318
La so I mean come on so I have a hard

5365
03:28:50,700 --> 03:28:54,720
time when these other guys to join the

5366
03:28:52,318 --> 03:28:57,238
game later say we're gonna save the

5367
03:28:54,719 --> 03:28:59,219
industry from these long term it's not

5368
03:28:57,238 --> 03:29:01,020
it's not Monsanto it's these are like

5369
03:28:59,219 --> 03:29:02,760
old school people that are probably the

5370
03:29:01,020 --> 03:29:05,159
most advanced in the field right and

5371
03:29:02,760 --> 03:29:06,300
they did some super Kick-Ass work and

5372
03:29:05,159 --> 03:29:07,680
then the community is going to get

5373
03:29:06,299 --> 03:29:08,818
pissed off because they've created a

5374
03:29:07,680 --> 03:29:11,040
bunch of things that nobody else has

5375
03:29:08,818 --> 03:29:12,719
ever created before I mean I just I I

5376
03:29:11,040 --> 03:29:15,660
can't I can't empathize with it you know

5377
03:29:12,719 --> 03:29:17,579
what I mean and uh maybe I'm biased and

5378
03:29:15,659 --> 03:29:20,340
maybe it's some too into the genetics to

5379
03:29:17,579 --> 03:29:22,260
see it but you know what that's we're in

5380
03:29:20,340 --> 03:29:23,700
a different world folks it's no longer a

5381
03:29:22,260 --> 03:29:25,579
bunch of hippies up on the hill sharing

5382
03:29:23,700 --> 03:29:28,560
medicine we're in a business where

5383
03:29:25,579 --> 03:29:30,539
cannabis is legalized and in Canada it's

5384
03:29:28,559 --> 03:29:32,100
not just you know legalized like this in

5385
03:29:30,540 --> 03:29:33,840
California I mean we got big Banks and

5386
03:29:32,100 --> 03:29:36,238
investment Banks throwing

5387
03:29:33,840 --> 03:29:37,738
tens if not hundreds of millions of

5388
03:29:36,238 --> 03:29:41,100
dollars into these companies to do

5389
03:29:37,738 --> 03:29:43,318
research and uh develop proprietary

5390
03:29:41,100 --> 03:29:44,460
methods and of course this is the type

5391
03:29:43,318 --> 03:29:47,639
of thing that is going to come out of

5392
03:29:44,459 --> 03:29:49,919
those forays so being scared of people

5393
03:29:47,639 --> 03:29:51,059
collecting data on the genetics dude you

5394
03:29:49,920 --> 03:29:52,978
don't want you don't want your DNA

5395
03:29:51,059 --> 03:29:55,199
getting out the door that don't sell the

5396
03:29:52,978 --> 03:29:56,760
herb right because if you put the herb

5397
03:29:55,200 --> 03:29:59,040
out the door I can collect it and take

5398
03:29:56,760 --> 03:30:00,779
your DNA or at least look at your DNA if

5399
03:29:59,040 --> 03:30:02,939
I have the skills to do that right just

5400
03:30:00,779 --> 03:30:05,040
like I can if you give me a butt I can

5401
03:30:02,939 --> 03:30:08,460
take it to a lab and have the chemotype

5402
03:30:05,040 --> 03:30:11,399
analyzed also explaining that if you let

5403
03:30:08,459 --> 03:30:13,738
it out the door then you no longer have

5404
03:30:11,398 --> 03:30:15,898
the right to patent it if that's what

5405
03:30:13,738 --> 03:30:17,760
you wanted to do well that that is true

5406
03:30:15,898 --> 03:30:18,959
but I think that the the way that the

5407
03:30:17,760 --> 03:30:20,340
patents and the thing that you think the

5408
03:30:18,959 --> 03:30:21,599
people don't like about the patents is

5409
03:30:20,340 --> 03:30:23,639
you don't even have to let it at the

5410
03:30:21,600 --> 03:30:26,880
door for these people to stake claims to

5411
03:30:23,639 --> 03:30:28,139
these chemotypic classes right right and

5412
03:30:26,879 --> 03:30:29,699
that's a trip that's a trip because it's

5413
03:30:28,139 --> 03:30:31,318
about showing that there hasn't been

5414
03:30:29,700 --> 03:30:32,939
anything in existence up to that point

5415
03:30:31,318 --> 03:30:34,500
right right but let's flip the script

5416
03:30:32,939 --> 03:30:36,840
again for a second it's like this kind

5417
03:30:34,500 --> 03:30:39,120
of like me saying I want to develop a

5418
03:30:36,840 --> 03:30:41,880
handheld device that sends email I can

5419
03:30:39,120 --> 03:30:43,739
watch YouTube make phone calls and text

5420
03:30:41,879 --> 03:30:45,959
messages and store music and all these

5421
03:30:43,738 --> 03:30:47,520
kind of things and it's going to have a

5422
03:30:45,959 --> 03:30:49,379
touch screen and blah blah blah and then

5423
03:30:47,520 --> 03:30:51,300
I turn around and I say oh it's unfair

5424
03:30:49,379 --> 03:30:53,278
that Google or Apple patented it right

5425
03:30:51,299 --> 03:30:55,139
well it's like I'm late to the game I

5426
03:30:53,279 --> 03:30:57,238
came up with with the idea too late

5427
03:30:55,139 --> 03:31:00,778
right you don't see people freaking out

5428
03:30:57,238 --> 03:31:02,520
about oh we're it suppresses innovation

5429
03:31:00,779 --> 03:31:04,439
no it doesn't suppress Innovation it

5430
03:31:02,520 --> 03:31:07,800
suppresses innovation in the same field

5431
03:31:04,439 --> 03:31:09,359
that they're innovating in right that's

5432
03:31:07,799 --> 03:31:11,398
the whole point they've developed these

5433
03:31:09,359 --> 03:31:13,559
products

5434
03:31:11,398 --> 03:31:14,699
right so if you have a problem that

5435
03:31:13,559 --> 03:31:17,340
they've gone ahead and developed these

5436
03:31:14,700 --> 03:31:20,700
products I I don't know what to say like

5437
03:31:17,340 --> 03:31:23,639
I I don't buy the argument that

5438
03:31:20,700 --> 03:31:25,560
I can't compete right there's lots of

5439
03:31:23,639 --> 03:31:27,119
room to innovate in cannabis and if if

5440
03:31:25,559 --> 03:31:28,559
you're going to be like a follower and

5441
03:31:27,120 --> 03:31:30,120
you're going to go around and try to do

5442
03:31:28,559 --> 03:31:32,879
the same things that other people have

5443
03:31:30,120 --> 03:31:35,579
been done and then complain that they've

5444
03:31:32,879 --> 03:31:38,278
patented or they've they've secured IP

5445
03:31:35,579 --> 03:31:41,459
property in in on on those things I

5446
03:31:38,279 --> 03:31:44,700
don't know I just I don't buy it

5447
03:31:41,459 --> 03:31:46,259
nice so but yeah it is the world's

5448
03:31:44,700 --> 03:31:47,939
Common Man I mean if you let your

5449
03:31:46,260 --> 03:31:49,800
flowers out the door and these

5450
03:31:47,939 --> 03:31:51,359
bioinformatics companies and the cost of

5451
03:31:49,799 --> 03:31:54,179
sequencing is coming down down down down

5452
03:31:51,359 --> 03:31:55,800
down every day so it's getting cheaper

5453
03:31:54,180 --> 03:31:56,939
for them to do the work

5454
03:31:55,799 --> 03:31:59,099
um yeah they're going to start screening

5455
03:31:56,939 --> 03:32:00,840
and looking at traits in your plant and

5456
03:31:59,100 --> 03:32:03,180
you know trying to figure out how they

5457
03:32:00,840 --> 03:32:04,978
can they can benefit them and you know

5458
03:32:03,180 --> 03:32:06,840
what to me that's not a bad thing that's

5459
03:32:04,978 --> 03:32:09,599
a great thing because we're going to

5460
03:32:06,840 --> 03:32:11,279
have more tools upon which to improve

5461
03:32:09,600 --> 03:32:13,020
the species that I love you know just

5462
03:32:11,279 --> 03:32:15,600
like the labs are the same thing I mean

5463
03:32:13,020 --> 03:32:17,040
when I first start getting access to a

5464
03:32:15,600 --> 03:32:19,140
lab

5465
03:32:17,040 --> 03:32:21,180
well I was able to make significant

5466
03:32:19,139 --> 03:32:22,920
progress you know it's a it's an

5467
03:32:21,180 --> 03:32:25,020
incredible tool and it's it's having

5468
03:32:22,920 --> 03:32:27,299
access to that tool is not something

5469
03:32:25,020 --> 03:32:30,060
terrible it's a dream

5470
03:32:27,299 --> 03:32:33,898
not only do I agree with you but if you

5471
03:32:30,059 --> 03:32:35,939
think of the arch types or uh super

5472
03:32:33,898 --> 03:32:39,299
terpene classes whatever you want to

5473
03:32:35,939 --> 03:32:41,460
call them right once these all exist

5474
03:32:39,299 --> 03:32:44,219
then they can be given to different

5475
03:32:41,459 --> 03:32:46,978
patients for different illnesses and we

5476
03:32:44,219 --> 03:32:49,639
can find out what helps what that much

5477
03:32:46,978 --> 03:32:49,639
quicker right

5478
03:32:49,799 --> 03:32:53,519
it's the future this is the future and

5479
03:32:51,478 --> 03:32:55,019
it's like the future is already here in

5480
03:32:53,520 --> 03:32:56,700
corn and it's already here in wheat and

5481
03:32:55,020 --> 03:32:58,140
Mark Sheldon talked about this the first

5482
03:32:56,700 --> 03:32:58,939
time I came out of church I think this

5483
03:32:58,139 --> 03:33:01,439
episode

5484
03:32:58,939 --> 03:33:03,059
66 or something but

5485
03:33:01,439 --> 03:33:05,220
um he said the same thing you know like

5486
03:33:03,059 --> 03:33:06,719
one day biotechnology is going to be

5487
03:33:05,219 --> 03:33:08,219
this tool that we can do all these

5488
03:33:06,719 --> 03:33:10,019
things that we do in corn and wheat and

5489
03:33:08,219 --> 03:33:11,760
soy and all these other crops and you

5490
03:33:10,020 --> 03:33:15,238
know what that world

5491
03:33:11,760 --> 03:33:17,700
thankfully thank Jah that we live in a

5492
03:33:15,238 --> 03:33:21,478
world where legalization exists

5493
03:33:17,700 --> 03:33:24,120
and we as farmers and breeders can

5494
03:33:21,478 --> 03:33:25,139
actually access all that information you

5495
03:33:24,120 --> 03:33:26,340
know to me I think that that's

5496
03:33:25,139 --> 03:33:28,318
incredible I don't think it's something

5497
03:33:26,340 --> 03:33:28,978
to be scared of

5498
03:33:28,318 --> 03:33:30,659
um

5499
03:33:28,978 --> 03:33:32,818
the one thing that I really got to hit

5500
03:33:30,659 --> 03:33:34,619
home is this public domain commentary

5501
03:33:32,818 --> 03:33:37,019
the art of that article again painted

5502
03:33:34,620 --> 03:33:38,340
this image that public domain is good

5503
03:33:37,020 --> 03:33:40,260
you know nobody's gonna be able to grow

5504
03:33:38,340 --> 03:33:42,420
weed and we're all going to be locked up

5505
03:33:40,260 --> 03:33:44,700
by big business that is absolute

5506
03:33:42,420 --> 03:33:46,260
[ __ ] there all right good seeing my

5507
03:33:44,700 --> 03:33:48,060
question there's nothing true that

5508
03:33:46,260 --> 03:33:50,040
there's nothing true there at all if

5509
03:33:48,059 --> 03:33:51,778
it's documented in the public domain and

5510
03:33:50,040 --> 03:33:53,520
SC Labs has been instrumental in

5511
03:33:51,779 --> 03:33:55,800
documenting things in the public domain

5512
03:33:53,520 --> 03:33:57,420
by releasing that data out that you guys

5513
03:33:55,799 --> 03:33:59,699
were releasing at one point in time and

5514
03:33:57,420 --> 03:34:01,700
probably hopefully will again

5515
03:33:59,700 --> 03:34:04,979
um

5516
03:34:01,700 --> 03:34:07,260
of releasing the chemical data onto the

5517
03:34:04,978 --> 03:34:09,719
market and showing what exists like

5518
03:34:07,260 --> 03:34:11,760
nobody can come and take blue dreams

5519
03:34:09,719 --> 03:34:13,858
nobody can come and take OG nobody can

5520
03:34:11,760 --> 03:34:16,439
come and take anything other than the

5521
03:34:13,859 --> 03:34:18,600
name of Gorilla Glue floor for nobody

5522
03:34:16,439 --> 03:34:19,559
nobody can take train wreck nobody can

5523
03:34:18,600 --> 03:34:21,960
take

5524
03:34:19,559 --> 03:34:25,139
Jack Herer right Northern Lights Afghani

5525
03:34:21,959 --> 03:34:27,059
Juan skunk on and on and on and on these

5526
03:34:25,139 --> 03:34:30,478
varieties because they were taken by

5527
03:34:27,059 --> 03:34:32,340
people by SL like Sam and you know other

5528
03:34:30,478 --> 03:34:35,219
seed breeders that release these things

5529
03:34:32,340 --> 03:34:37,920
into the world only that is the basis of

5530
03:34:35,219 --> 03:34:39,358
the chemical the the public domain and

5531
03:34:37,920 --> 03:34:41,520
it's you know what it's an incredibly

5532
03:34:39,359 --> 03:34:43,979
strange situation that we find ourselves

5533
03:34:41,520 --> 03:34:46,439
in like there's no other planet in

5534
03:34:43,978 --> 03:34:49,318
history that has been sequestered and

5535
03:34:46,439 --> 03:34:52,020
prevented from being

5536
03:34:49,318 --> 03:34:53,398
like worked on like any other crop right

5537
03:34:52,020 --> 03:34:55,800
except for cannabis and everything was

5538
03:34:53,398 --> 03:34:57,898
done underground and now it needs to

5539
03:34:55,799 --> 03:35:00,898
find its way into the public domain but

5540
03:34:57,898 --> 03:35:02,519
what what what these labs are doing in

5541
03:35:00,898 --> 03:35:04,260
demonstrating that these chemotypes

5542
03:35:02,520 --> 03:35:07,020
exist is they're proving the public

5543
03:35:04,260 --> 03:35:08,579
domain you're essentially scribes that

5544
03:35:07,020 --> 03:35:10,500
are documenting what exists in the

5545
03:35:08,579 --> 03:35:12,898
public domain and anything that exists

5546
03:35:10,500 --> 03:35:15,299
in the public domain can't be taken by

5547
03:35:12,898 --> 03:35:16,680
another group and patented you just

5548
03:35:15,299 --> 03:35:18,778
can't do it that's the way the patent

5549
03:35:16,680 --> 03:35:20,639
laws work so that's a bit disagree you

5550
03:35:18,779 --> 03:35:23,880
do something new with it like

5551
03:35:20,639 --> 03:35:25,978
hydrogenated yeah or make or make type 2

5552
03:35:23,879 --> 03:35:28,559
non-measing dominant greater than one

5553
03:35:25,978 --> 03:35:30,659
percent terpene plants I mean is it

5554
03:35:28,559 --> 03:35:32,879
right well you can do that can you

5555
03:35:30,659 --> 03:35:34,799
you're reshuffling the existing deck

5556
03:35:32,879 --> 03:35:38,599
chairs and all these are common

5557
03:35:34,799 --> 03:35:38,599
molecules that are already known

5558
03:35:39,020 --> 03:35:44,520
my example points any direction it's

5559
03:35:42,120 --> 03:35:47,160
that the plant has done heavy lifting to

5560
03:35:44,520 --> 03:35:49,620
make these molecules what can we do now

5561
03:35:47,159 --> 03:35:52,139
to make them better to make them

5562
03:35:49,620 --> 03:35:55,439
different to make them you know what how

5563
03:35:52,139 --> 03:35:57,778
can we take nature as an inspiration to

5564
03:35:55,439 --> 03:35:59,700
make other new molecules yeah well

5565
03:35:57,779 --> 03:36:01,079
listen you and I yeah you and I are you

5566
03:35:59,700 --> 03:36:02,880
and I are completely in agreement but

5567
03:36:01,079 --> 03:36:05,520
also completely at loggerheads one

5568
03:36:02,879 --> 03:36:07,019
because you look at it from a chemistry

5569
03:36:05,520 --> 03:36:09,238
point of view and I look at it from a

5570
03:36:07,020 --> 03:36:11,100
biology genetics point of view so it

5571
03:36:09,238 --> 03:36:12,959
puts us at different Vantage points but

5572
03:36:11,100 --> 03:36:15,659
I think we're all really saying the same

5573
03:36:12,959 --> 03:36:19,978
thing you know when you can get a plant

5574
03:36:15,659 --> 03:36:24,959
that can produce 20 uh by weight of a

5575
03:36:19,978 --> 03:36:27,299
Target gee whizzakers gee whiskers

5576
03:36:24,959 --> 03:36:31,500
you can you can aim it towards whatever

5577
03:36:27,299 --> 03:36:35,398
you want I mean THC that's obvious uh

5578
03:36:31,500 --> 03:36:41,040
CBD you can get more than 20 percent uh

5579
03:36:35,398 --> 03:36:44,039
CBC CBG thcv cbdb all of these things

5580
03:36:41,040 --> 03:36:46,319
you can get 10 20 percent of well one

5581
03:36:44,040 --> 03:36:48,660
way I mean I don't think

5582
03:36:46,318 --> 03:36:51,359
I had the same discussion in regards to

5583
03:36:48,659 --> 03:36:54,119
Ohio Lake soybean oil and when they saw

5584
03:36:51,359 --> 03:36:57,540
uh levels of oleic acid exceeding 80

5585
03:36:54,120 --> 03:36:59,640
percent I'm like oh my God 80 oleic acid

5586
03:36:57,540 --> 03:37:02,060
and soybean oil what can we do with that

5587
03:36:59,639 --> 03:37:05,760
oh my God it starts to look like yeah

5588
03:37:02,059 --> 03:37:08,639
with modern biotechnology we can do just

5589
03:37:05,760 --> 03:37:10,020
about anything or teach plants to do

5590
03:37:08,639 --> 03:37:12,898
just about anything

5591
03:37:10,020 --> 03:37:14,579
yeah really

5592
03:37:12,898 --> 03:37:16,858
huh

5593
03:37:14,579 --> 03:37:18,719
but you know where plants leave off

5594
03:37:16,859 --> 03:37:21,300
where biochemistry leaves off that's

5595
03:37:18,719 --> 03:37:23,879
where chemistry starts and as we know

5596
03:37:21,299 --> 03:37:26,639
you know a big piece of the industry as

5597
03:37:23,879 --> 03:37:28,259
it exists today is is is concentrates

5598
03:37:26,639 --> 03:37:31,318
and just to go back to analogies

5599
03:37:28,260 --> 03:37:33,478
remember that Vineyards while they rely

5600
03:37:31,318 --> 03:37:36,478
on good genetics and good grapes they

5601
03:37:33,478 --> 03:37:39,478
don't sell grapes they sell wine

5602
03:37:36,478 --> 03:37:42,599
so how you make you know fruit of the

5603
03:37:39,478 --> 03:37:45,000
vine work of human hand to get biblical

5604
03:37:42,600 --> 03:37:48,479
um it's the work of the human hand where

5605
03:37:45,000 --> 03:37:51,059
the value is in creating sort of high

5606
03:37:48,478 --> 03:37:54,059
quality cannabis products and Craft

5607
03:37:51,059 --> 03:37:57,059
products like you know single malt

5608
03:37:54,059 --> 03:37:59,639
scotch I think is you know with a lot of

5609
03:37:57,059 --> 03:38:01,738
uh you know the market today going

5610
03:37:59,639 --> 03:38:04,199
towards just sort of like a more generic

5611
03:38:01,738 --> 03:38:07,859
thing there'll hopefully still be some

5612
03:38:04,200 --> 03:38:10,140
value for creating really high value

5613
03:38:07,859 --> 03:38:12,300
you know whole plant extracts that have

5614
03:38:10,139 --> 03:38:13,920
a lot of good terpenes and everything

5615
03:38:12,299 --> 03:38:17,778
that the plant all the heady goodness

5616
03:38:13,920 --> 03:38:21,000
from the plant and as as far as I know

5617
03:38:17,779 --> 03:38:24,359
flavonoids when they're smoked have no

5618
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:27,719
effect but they the heat destroys them

5619
03:38:24,359 --> 03:38:30,120
it I know with oral flavonoids could be

5620
03:38:27,719 --> 03:38:33,179
important have you ever heard of anybody

5621
03:38:30,120 --> 03:38:35,399
trying to take flavonoids with THC to

5622
03:38:33,180 --> 03:38:38,220
understand how they would modify it

5623
03:38:35,398 --> 03:38:40,318
orally or or smoke they thermally

5624
03:38:38,219 --> 03:38:42,478
degrade right they don't yeah I don't

5625
03:38:40,318 --> 03:38:44,579
think yeah well and I think and what's

5626
03:38:42,478 --> 03:38:46,858
funny too is about most ingested or

5627
03:38:44,579 --> 03:38:49,379
infused products you know where most

5628
03:38:46,859 --> 03:38:52,020
people decarboxylate their oils prior to

5629
03:38:49,379 --> 03:38:54,238
kind of infusing it into an edible you

5630
03:38:52,020 --> 03:38:55,260
know it's like that you know and yeah I

5631
03:38:54,238 --> 03:38:56,579
think we've been talking about this on

5632
03:38:55,260 --> 03:38:58,200
here before but it's you know it's funny

5633
03:38:56,579 --> 03:39:01,318
how many products are labeled Indica

5634
03:38:58,200 --> 03:39:02,700
edible or sativa edible you know when in

5635
03:39:01,318 --> 03:39:05,818
actuality there's no terpenes or

5636
03:39:02,700 --> 03:39:07,800
flavonoids remaining bingo The American

5637
03:39:05,818 --> 03:39:09,359
Canadian markets the same way it's all

5638
03:39:07,799 --> 03:39:10,619
hilarious that's hilarious because

5639
03:39:09,359 --> 03:39:13,140
nobody's nobody's like adding

5640
03:39:10,620 --> 03:39:14,640
significant terpenes to orally ingested

5641
03:39:13,139 --> 03:39:16,199
kind of products that have been the

5642
03:39:14,639 --> 03:39:17,879
thing that's hilarious is that the

5643
03:39:16,200 --> 03:39:19,439
market can't even the market still

5644
03:39:17,879 --> 03:39:21,898
thinks that they're by that there's a

5645
03:39:19,439 --> 03:39:23,700
difference right oh I buy the sativa oil

5646
03:39:21,898 --> 03:39:25,619
for the morning and I use the Indica oil

5647
03:39:23,700 --> 03:39:27,540
for how much is Placebo well and you

5648
03:39:25,620 --> 03:39:29,399
know that that word that a little paper

5649
03:39:27,540 --> 03:39:31,380
that uh that really great paper that

5650
03:39:29,398 --> 03:39:33,000
Adrian davidley and Martin Lee put out

5651
03:39:31,379 --> 03:39:34,978
um through kind of Ocean's project CBD

5652
03:39:33,000 --> 03:39:38,639
about like Mind Over Matter over mind

5653
03:39:34,978 --> 03:39:40,379
and it's about how the the belief in uh

5654
03:39:38,639 --> 03:39:42,420
treatment is going to work Placebo or

5655
03:39:40,379 --> 03:39:45,000
the non-belief treatment is not going to

5656
03:39:42,420 --> 03:39:46,799
work no sibo you know in in substantial

5657
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:49,200
ways across many different systems are

5658
03:39:46,799 --> 03:39:50,938
also mediated or

5659
03:39:49,200 --> 03:39:53,040
um enhanced kind of by the

5660
03:39:50,939 --> 03:39:55,979
endocannabinoid system releasing off and

5661
03:39:53,040 --> 03:39:58,380
firing off in certain ways certain ways

5662
03:39:55,978 --> 03:40:00,840
yeah yeah I think most I think most with

5663
03:39:58,379 --> 03:40:03,238
animal dose has to do with I mean in you

5664
03:40:00,840 --> 03:40:04,859
know the how much is somebody taking on

5665
03:40:03,238 --> 03:40:06,600
a full stomach empty stomach overactive

5666
03:40:04,859 --> 03:40:08,640
underactive immune system you know

5667
03:40:06,600 --> 03:40:09,899
sedentary or active lifestyle where

5668
03:40:08,639 --> 03:40:11,519
there's so many different variables in

5669
03:40:09,898 --> 03:40:14,000
how the same dose is going to hit

5670
03:40:11,520 --> 03:40:14,000
different people

5671
03:40:15,500 --> 03:40:20,760
yeah but yeah no um and and and so and

5672
03:40:19,318 --> 03:40:23,579
and to something you're saying uh just a

5673
03:40:20,760 --> 03:40:26,340
little bit ago Chimera um you know we so

5674
03:40:23,579 --> 03:40:28,559
we we had this uh site on our or this

5675
03:40:26,340 --> 03:40:31,799
this tab on our website where it was

5676
03:40:28,559 --> 03:40:33,059
just it said scl tested and so anytime

5677
03:40:31,799 --> 03:40:35,039
um somebody paid it you know because

5678
03:40:33,059 --> 03:40:37,260
because anything tested with us is is

5679
03:40:35,040 --> 03:40:40,739
the you know the ownership of the people

5680
03:40:37,260 --> 03:40:43,200
that are doing the testing and and so if

5681
03:40:40,738 --> 03:40:45,000
they make up sample public then back in

5682
03:40:43,200 --> 03:40:47,520
the day you know it could be viewed if

5683
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:49,500
you just click on SC Labs tested

5684
03:40:47,520 --> 03:40:51,720
um and I mean and you know it can still

5685
03:40:49,500 --> 03:40:53,579
be viewed regardless when people use QR

5686
03:40:51,719 --> 03:40:55,799
codes or kind of you know print labels

5687
03:40:53,579 --> 03:40:57,180
or you know do this or that you know um

5688
03:40:55,799 --> 03:40:59,519
you know because it'll take people to

5689
03:40:57,180 --> 03:41:02,279
the page but but we have since

5690
03:40:59,520 --> 03:41:04,380
essentially taken away the scl tested

5691
03:41:02,279 --> 03:41:06,540
side of it because we found out there

5692
03:41:04,379 --> 03:41:09,059
was like three or four different groups

5693
03:41:06,540 --> 03:41:11,279
that were basically like uh what do they

5694
03:41:09,059 --> 03:41:13,379
call it um they were they were speeding

5695
03:41:11,279 --> 03:41:14,760
kitties yeah they were they were they

5696
03:41:13,379 --> 03:41:17,099
were mining your data yeah there are

5697
03:41:14,760 --> 03:41:19,318
mining and yeah scraping anything that

5698
03:41:17,100 --> 03:41:21,000
would go um would be public and so so

5699
03:41:19,318 --> 03:41:22,318
you know they were kind of like yeah in

5700
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:24,540
their way like you know just like

5701
03:41:22,318 --> 03:41:26,039
jacking pirating all our data you know

5702
03:41:24,540 --> 03:41:27,779
and and it's like and you know to a

5703
03:41:26,040 --> 03:41:29,700
certain extent I don't know how valuable

5704
03:41:27,779 --> 03:41:30,840
that data is period because you know

5705
03:41:29,700 --> 03:41:33,239
it's just showing kind of you know

5706
03:41:30,840 --> 03:41:36,120
what's it out and around but you know no

5707
03:41:33,238 --> 03:41:38,398
but again the quest the thing is is

5708
03:41:36,120 --> 03:41:40,380
and I I gotta put it back to you in this

5709
03:41:38,398 --> 03:41:42,599
in this context when you release

5710
03:41:40,379 --> 03:41:45,599
something into the public domain it

5711
03:41:42,600 --> 03:41:47,939
becomes available for all to use so it's

5712
03:41:45,600 --> 03:41:50,340
it's again if you guys are going to make

5713
03:41:47,939 --> 03:41:52,800
the choice to release that information

5714
03:41:50,340 --> 03:41:54,238
out there or the or your clients are

5715
03:41:52,799 --> 03:41:56,398
making that choice by clicking the box

5716
03:41:54,238 --> 03:41:57,659
or checking the Box

5717
03:41:56,398 --> 03:41:58,500
um we have to be aware that there's

5718
03:41:57,659 --> 03:42:00,000
gonna be people that are going to

5719
03:41:58,500 --> 03:42:01,978
aggregate that data and they're going to

5720
03:42:00,000 --> 03:42:04,799
use that data to do analysis and try to

5721
03:42:01,978 --> 03:42:07,459
understand Trends and find norms and

5722
03:42:04,799 --> 03:42:12,119
find uh unique things right yeah

5723
03:42:07,459 --> 03:42:14,579
thinking about it it's a great subject a

5724
03:42:12,120 --> 03:42:17,220
taping policy right The Grateful Dead

5725
03:42:14,579 --> 03:42:19,978
taping policy was not like the favorite

5726
03:42:17,219 --> 03:42:22,260
Child of the record industry which says

5727
03:42:19,978 --> 03:42:24,238
look if you're trying to stop records

5728
03:42:22,260 --> 03:42:26,760
you shouldn't let people come to your

5729
03:42:24,238 --> 03:42:28,680
concerts and tape you but by people

5730
03:42:26,760 --> 03:42:32,219
coming to the concerts and taping them

5731
03:42:28,680 --> 03:42:34,380
all that information got out and all the

5732
03:42:32,219 --> 03:42:37,318
tape trading and the whole Grateful Dead

5733
03:42:34,379 --> 03:42:39,599
culture grew because they they had this

5734
03:42:37,318 --> 03:42:41,939
taping thing so it's kind of like again

5735
03:42:39,600 --> 03:42:44,520
putting stuff out in the open domain

5736
03:42:41,939 --> 03:42:46,200
Garcia used to say hey man when we're

5737
03:42:44,520 --> 03:42:48,300
done playing with it they can have it

5738
03:42:46,200 --> 03:42:50,520
you know like they've already played

5739
03:42:48,299 --> 03:42:53,340
those notes and it's nothing labels

5740
03:42:50,520 --> 03:42:55,079
hated that [ __ ] yeah well and that's I I

5741
03:42:53,340 --> 03:42:57,260
gotta point it I gotta point out the big

5742
03:42:55,079 --> 03:43:00,059
difference there is that that was an art

5743
03:42:57,260 --> 03:43:02,100
and there was a business of Science and

5744
03:43:00,059 --> 03:43:03,539
cannabis and and if you if you fail to

5745
03:43:02,100 --> 03:43:05,159
recognize that then you're missing the

5746
03:43:03,540 --> 03:43:06,779
whole point oh listen it's just like

5747
03:43:05,159 --> 03:43:08,459
anything you can choose to give it away

5748
03:43:06,779 --> 03:43:10,079
or you can choose to keep it that

5749
03:43:08,459 --> 03:43:12,959
doesn't matter what you're involved in

5750
03:43:10,079 --> 03:43:15,359
Elon Musk gave his patents away billions

5751
03:43:12,959 --> 03:43:17,818
of dollars in value because no no let's

5752
03:43:15,359 --> 03:43:19,939
let's be honest he gave some patents

5753
03:43:17,818 --> 03:43:22,139
away

5754
03:43:19,939 --> 03:43:24,359
but he also kept a bunch for himself

5755
03:43:22,139 --> 03:43:26,039
right and it's a business decision I

5756
03:43:24,359 --> 03:43:27,720
mean and it's it's listen it's whoever

5757
03:43:26,040 --> 03:43:29,160
[ __ ] collects and makes the data's

5758
03:43:27,719 --> 03:43:30,659
decision to do that on their own I mean

5759
03:43:29,159 --> 03:43:32,219
why are you gonna why are you gonna go

5760
03:43:30,659 --> 03:43:34,559
spend a bunch of time figuring something

5761
03:43:32,219 --> 03:43:35,818
out for a business purpose right and

5762
03:43:34,559 --> 03:43:38,398
then give it away for free to everybody

5763
03:43:35,818 --> 03:43:39,659
else that makes no sense I mean Alec

5764
03:43:38,398 --> 03:43:41,459
you're not going to come up to Canada

5765
03:43:39,659 --> 03:43:44,238
and teach us how to set up a lab with

5766
03:43:41,459 --> 03:43:46,619
your protocols and yours

5767
03:43:44,238 --> 03:43:49,520
within that mechanism but it makes yeah

5768
03:43:46,620 --> 03:43:51,240
we would people

5769
03:43:49,520 --> 03:43:52,500
it happens

5770
03:43:51,239 --> 03:43:54,659
[Music]

5771
03:43:52,500 --> 03:43:56,459
yeah it does happen but I'm just saying

5772
03:43:54,659 --> 03:43:58,139
it's again it's a it's a it's a

5773
03:43:56,459 --> 03:44:01,318
difference in

5774
03:43:58,139 --> 03:44:04,500
business style and yes I think that it's

5775
03:44:01,318 --> 03:44:06,719
also one that's like it's heavily argued

5776
03:44:04,500 --> 03:44:10,139
by the people that aren't doing this

5777
03:44:06,719 --> 03:44:12,059
type of work right I mean everybody was

5778
03:44:10,139 --> 03:44:13,318
hey man I really like that shirt that

5779
03:44:12,059 --> 03:44:15,600
you weared why don't you make me one of

5780
03:44:13,318 --> 03:44:16,738
those shirts or like you know like I

5781
03:44:15,600 --> 03:44:19,318
don't know

5782
03:44:16,738 --> 03:44:21,659
I I again I find I think a lot of this

5783
03:44:19,318 --> 03:44:24,180
hippie stuff comes off as uh as

5784
03:44:21,659 --> 03:44:27,119
disingenuous right hey and check this

5785
03:44:24,180 --> 03:44:30,300
out in wired they actually posted that

5786
03:44:27,120 --> 03:44:32,819
Tesla gave away all of his patents right

5787
03:44:30,299 --> 03:44:35,639
yeah they posted that and wired yeah if

5788
03:44:32,818 --> 03:44:37,920
you Google it Tesla just gave away all

5789
03:44:35,639 --> 03:44:41,719
its patents away to its competitors

5790
03:44:37,920 --> 03:44:43,020
using the term all it happens

5791
03:44:41,719 --> 03:44:45,000
[Music]

5792
03:44:43,020 --> 03:44:46,979
and the guy's still worth what three

5793
03:44:45,000 --> 03:44:49,379
four bill

5794
03:44:46,978 --> 03:44:50,639
wow I don't think it heard him yet but

5795
03:44:49,379 --> 03:44:51,959
then again there's bands like the

5796
03:44:50,639 --> 03:44:53,760
Grateful Dead and fish that gave away

5797
03:44:51,959 --> 03:44:56,699
their music that at the time they were

5798
03:44:53,760 --> 03:44:58,738
doing it the mechanism for profit only

5799
03:44:56,700 --> 03:45:01,079
existed in keeping it and selling it

5800
03:44:58,738 --> 03:45:03,659
back to the fans they shattered through

5801
03:45:01,079 --> 03:45:05,639
that and created something that a lot of

5802
03:45:03,659 --> 03:45:08,219
us would argue is better

5803
03:45:05,639 --> 03:45:09,898
yeah well they I mean listen bands make

5804
03:45:08,219 --> 03:45:11,459
their money bands bands don't make money

5805
03:45:09,898 --> 03:45:13,978
through selling records bands make money

5806
03:45:11,459 --> 03:45:15,719
by touring no but record labels used to

5807
03:45:13,978 --> 03:45:17,639
make money so I know they did but the

5808
03:45:15,719 --> 03:45:19,318
bands did themselves I mean you know

5809
03:45:17,639 --> 03:45:20,519
I've cut an album and talked to record

5810
03:45:19,318 --> 03:45:22,978
companies and I know a little bit about

5811
03:45:20,520 --> 03:45:24,120
how it works and it's like where if

5812
03:45:22,978 --> 03:45:25,619
you're an artist dealing with the record

5813
03:45:24,120 --> 03:45:27,840
companies it's not you don't make any

5814
03:45:25,620 --> 03:45:30,000
money you make money on your touring you

5815
03:45:27,840 --> 03:45:32,040
make money on on your merchandising

5816
03:45:30,000 --> 03:45:34,500
rights and whatever but you might you

5817
03:45:32,040 --> 03:45:37,739
know you might be lucky if you get 50 60

5818
03:45:34,500 --> 03:45:39,659
70 cents for a compact disc so well I

5819
03:45:37,738 --> 03:45:42,359
think they could also shut down a lot of

5820
03:45:39,659 --> 03:45:44,760
videos on uh YouTube you know there's

5821
03:45:42,359 --> 03:45:47,460
videos just about of every band other

5822
03:45:44,760 --> 03:45:49,020
than prince who had his police go

5823
03:45:47,459 --> 03:45:52,079
through there and completely take off

5824
03:45:49,020 --> 03:45:54,540
all Prince content from YouTube but the

5825
03:45:52,079 --> 03:45:56,579
argument is that the people who post

5826
03:45:54,540 --> 03:45:59,700
those YouTube videos a lot of them are

5827
03:45:56,579 --> 03:46:02,459
pirated are not the owners of that

5828
03:45:59,700 --> 03:46:04,800
copyrighted music information but the

5829
03:46:02,459 --> 03:46:08,219
people who have the copyright aren't

5830
03:46:04,799 --> 03:46:11,639
rushing to take that stuff down because

5831
03:46:08,219 --> 03:46:14,278
it provides publicity for them and

5832
03:46:11,639 --> 03:46:17,398
ultimately gains and values so if like

5833
03:46:14,279 --> 03:46:19,620
you let a strain out or variety out and

5834
03:46:17,398 --> 03:46:22,799
it wins a Cannabis Cup and Everyone

5835
03:46:19,620 --> 03:46:24,960
likes it and all the Growers want it

5836
03:46:22,799 --> 03:46:27,719
and you just decide hey we're just going

5837
03:46:24,959 --> 03:46:30,119
to kind of like let this go that can be

5838
03:46:27,719 --> 03:46:32,099
a much more powerful business model in

5839
03:46:30,120 --> 03:46:34,680
cannabis kind of like in the same way

5840
03:46:32,100 --> 03:46:36,359
you know don't you think

5841
03:46:34,680 --> 03:46:37,920
yeah I mean there's lots of ways to

5842
03:46:36,359 --> 03:46:39,840
protect IP I mean since the Coca-Cola

5843
03:46:37,920 --> 03:46:41,639
secret Coca-Cola is never registered the

5844
03:46:39,840 --> 03:46:43,439
Coca-Cola secret you know

5845
03:46:41,639 --> 03:46:45,059
don't go to the patent office and say

5846
03:46:43,439 --> 03:46:47,040
this is how we do it you're gonna get

5847
03:46:45,059 --> 03:46:48,539
not a pad yeah yeah you don't teach you

5848
03:46:47,040 --> 03:46:50,460
don't teach your competitors how to do

5849
03:46:48,540 --> 03:46:52,380
it and the way that cannabis is

5850
03:46:50,459 --> 03:46:54,959
regulated and it's so tightly controlled

5851
03:46:52,379 --> 03:46:57,059
at least in these regulated systems that

5852
03:46:54,959 --> 03:46:59,519
are developing in Germany Australia and

5853
03:46:57,059 --> 03:47:01,680
Canada and other countries that are

5854
03:46:59,520 --> 03:47:03,180
doing Federal legalization you're not

5855
03:47:01,680 --> 03:47:05,159
walking out of a facility with a plan

5856
03:47:03,180 --> 03:47:06,479
okay you're just not going to do it

5857
03:47:05,159 --> 03:47:08,700
you're not going to be able to do it and

5858
03:47:06,478 --> 03:47:09,898
if you're a big company you're also not

5859
03:47:08,700 --> 03:47:11,640
going to label it from the production

5860
03:47:09,898 --> 03:47:14,579
room you're not going to call it this is

5861
03:47:11,639 --> 03:47:17,039
my CD CBG dominant you know type

5862
03:47:14,579 --> 03:47:18,299
whatever type 2 terpineline plant you're

5863
03:47:17,040 --> 03:47:20,000
not going to label the plant it's going

5864
03:47:18,299 --> 03:47:22,978
to be

5865
03:47:20,000 --> 03:47:24,120
x7496316 and and the people that are

5866
03:47:22,978 --> 03:47:25,619
doing the production they're only going

5867
03:47:24,120 --> 03:47:26,640
to know that plant is that tag and

5868
03:47:25,620 --> 03:47:28,319
they're never going to know what it is

5869
03:47:26,639 --> 03:47:29,760
in the output so because it doesn't

5870
03:47:28,318 --> 03:47:31,559
matter to them they're just making a

5871
03:47:29,760 --> 03:47:33,898
product they're just a worker in a a

5872
03:47:31,559 --> 03:47:35,100
production line so there's lots of ways

5873
03:47:33,898 --> 03:47:37,680
that you can protect these things you

5874
03:47:35,100 --> 03:47:39,180
don't need to go out and Pad stuff you

5875
03:47:37,680 --> 03:47:41,579
can develop unique things and profit

5876
03:47:39,180 --> 03:47:43,260
from them without doing that and that's

5877
03:47:41,579 --> 03:47:46,500
a choice that every individual business

5878
03:47:43,260 --> 03:47:49,800
is going to make on their own yeah

5879
03:47:46,500 --> 03:47:52,379
well said Chimera well said

5880
03:47:49,799 --> 03:47:54,420
controversial topic awesome appreciate

5881
03:47:52,379 --> 03:47:55,799
it yeah yeah it really is I like it it's

5882
03:47:54,420 --> 03:47:57,000
uh it's you know what I like having

5883
03:47:55,799 --> 03:47:58,799
conversations that people are

5884
03:47:57,000 --> 03:48:01,978
uncomfortable to have that in this day

5885
03:47:58,799 --> 03:48:03,840
and age and conversations that trigger

5886
03:48:01,978 --> 03:48:05,519
uh things that try to shut the

5887
03:48:03,840 --> 03:48:07,500
conversation down to me means there's

5888
03:48:05,520 --> 03:48:09,420
value in that conversation and it's one

5889
03:48:07,500 --> 03:48:11,100
we should be having yeah and you know

5890
03:48:09,420 --> 03:48:12,659
what you guys have been very respectful

5891
03:48:11,100 --> 03:48:14,279
in the way that that conversation has

5892
03:48:12,659 --> 03:48:16,559
played out today I mean I've seen this

5893
03:48:14,279 --> 03:48:18,720
conversation unfold online and the

5894
03:48:16,559 --> 03:48:20,760
immediate thing is those [ __ ] they

5895
03:48:18,719 --> 03:48:22,920
are doing this and that and they're

5896
03:48:20,760 --> 03:48:24,659
Monsanto I mean the article the title of

5897
03:48:22,920 --> 03:48:27,420
the article is Monsanto it's not

5898
03:48:24,659 --> 03:48:29,459
Monsanto these are like all-time

5899
03:48:27,420 --> 03:48:31,079
researchers but that's the ultimate

5900
03:48:29,459 --> 03:48:32,938
trigger word if you want to shut someone

5901
03:48:31,079 --> 03:48:34,680
down and you want people not to look too

5902
03:48:32,939 --> 03:48:38,460
deep and you just want to shut it right

5903
03:48:34,680 --> 03:48:40,260
down then then Monsanto is your they're

5904
03:48:38,459 --> 03:48:42,238
your guys just right so what's the

5905
03:48:40,260 --> 03:48:44,818
agenda of the person that started the

5906
03:48:42,238 --> 03:48:46,680
article what's the agenda of the author

5907
03:48:44,818 --> 03:48:49,318
right I mean it's like we can start

5908
03:48:46,680 --> 03:48:51,600
questioning everybody's agenda yeah 100

5909
03:48:49,318 --> 03:48:53,340
and and that's the thing it goes back to

5910
03:48:51,600 --> 03:48:55,620
that that whole reality that the things

5911
03:48:53,340 --> 03:48:57,960
that we don't understand we often

5912
03:48:55,620 --> 03:49:00,359
viscerally will reject or you know take

5913
03:48:57,959 --> 03:49:02,759
offensively you know and it's so much

5914
03:49:00,359 --> 03:49:04,559
more complicated and complex topic you

5915
03:49:02,760 --> 03:49:06,359
know and I think a lot of people in the

5916
03:49:04,559 --> 03:49:08,639
same positions would would you know

5917
03:49:06,359 --> 03:49:09,899
absolutely go that direction of you know

5918
03:49:08,639 --> 03:49:11,818
going

5919
03:49:09,898 --> 03:49:14,039
to file intellectual property around the

5920
03:49:11,818 --> 03:49:15,420
pad you know around their work but yeah

5921
03:49:14,040 --> 03:49:17,160
I don't know it's just it's an it's an

5922
03:49:15,420 --> 03:49:20,159
it's an interesting thing because you

5923
03:49:17,159 --> 03:49:21,659
know my uh you know I mean if they're

5924
03:49:20,159 --> 03:49:23,039
smart enough to have done that and

5925
03:49:21,659 --> 03:49:25,439
already locked up all the type 2

5926
03:49:23,040 --> 03:49:27,899
non-mercine strains you know it's like

5927
03:49:25,439 --> 03:49:30,059
we're so it's like is there anybody else

5928
03:49:27,898 --> 03:49:32,099
that is gonna go figure out like the pen

5929
03:49:30,059 --> 03:49:34,680
tools before them or or all the other

5930
03:49:32,100 --> 03:49:36,420
super unique Pathways before them well

5931
03:49:34,680 --> 03:49:38,520
think of this Alex think of it this way

5932
03:49:36,420 --> 03:49:39,840
imagine they lock up all this stuff and

5933
03:49:38,520 --> 03:49:41,760
stuff that people didn't even know

5934
03:49:39,840 --> 03:49:43,680
existed but now they do they're late to

5935
03:49:41,760 --> 03:49:45,359
the game and now they're looking for

5936
03:49:43,680 --> 03:49:47,279
things that are specifically not those

5937
03:49:45,359 --> 03:49:50,040
things that got locked up they're gonna

5938
03:49:47,279 --> 03:49:51,840
unveil things that are even further and

5939
03:49:50,040 --> 03:49:53,640
deeper down the rabbit hole no that's

5940
03:49:51,840 --> 03:49:55,200
awesome that's and that that's actually

5941
03:49:53,639 --> 03:49:56,879
the perfect answer I think you know

5942
03:49:55,200 --> 03:49:58,800
because you know when it all comes down

5943
03:49:56,879 --> 03:50:00,659
to it doesn't [ __ ] matter you know

5944
03:49:58,799 --> 03:50:02,818
philosophically ethically whatever as

5945
03:50:00,659 --> 03:50:05,760
long as it's there and available at some

5946
03:50:02,818 --> 03:50:07,920
point even if it's being licensed you

5947
03:50:05,760 --> 03:50:09,659
know then then it's still still the

5948
03:50:07,920 --> 03:50:11,700
still the move I mean it's still it's

5949
03:50:09,659 --> 03:50:14,340
still progressing the whole agenda of

5950
03:50:11,700 --> 03:50:16,079
the plant yeah I always have faith in

5951
03:50:14,340 --> 03:50:17,639
cannabis listen it's like the bubble

5952
03:50:16,079 --> 03:50:19,500
bags I mean the bubble bag you know they

5953
03:50:17,639 --> 03:50:21,180
came out and now you pay a licensing fee

5954
03:50:19,500 --> 03:50:23,760
to the guy who had the patent on it

5955
03:50:21,180 --> 03:50:25,380
right yeah so

5956
03:50:23,760 --> 03:50:26,520
you know that's that's what's going to

5957
03:50:25,379 --> 03:50:28,318
happen I mean I don't think these guys

5958
03:50:26,520 --> 03:50:30,000
are it's it's I think there's actually

5959
03:50:28,318 --> 03:50:33,119
laws around you can't patent stuff and

5960
03:50:30,000 --> 03:50:34,500
then withhold licensing right yeah so

5961
03:50:33,120 --> 03:50:37,260
you have to you have to license it to

5962
03:50:34,500 --> 03:50:40,260
people yeah exactly

5963
03:50:37,260 --> 03:50:42,000
and it's fine like I I fought it for the

5964
03:50:40,260 --> 03:50:43,738
longest time and the more I looked at it

5965
03:50:42,000 --> 03:50:45,359
the more I realized as I followed the

5966
03:50:43,738 --> 03:50:48,238
history back that it was like listen

5967
03:50:45,359 --> 03:50:51,059
this was like the for 100 sure the bags

5968
03:50:48,238 --> 03:50:52,920
themselves were developed based on this

5969
03:50:51,059 --> 03:50:55,439
machine that Reinhardt had patented

5970
03:50:52,920 --> 03:50:58,559
regardless of any other part of the

5971
03:50:55,439 --> 03:51:01,079
story the bags that I made my bags from

5972
03:50:58,559 --> 03:51:03,420
were created based on reinhardt's

5973
03:51:01,079 --> 03:51:06,059
machine literally staring at his machine

5974
03:51:03,420 --> 03:51:09,600
watching it work can't really get around

5975
03:51:06,059 --> 03:51:12,359
that to me that is the birth of the bags

5976
03:51:09,600 --> 03:51:13,920
were the reinhardt's ice cold extractor

5977
03:51:12,359 --> 03:51:17,100
machine and

5978
03:51:13,920 --> 03:51:18,779
I'm happy to have paid the royalties out

5979
03:51:17,100 --> 03:51:22,140
uh from the beginning I didn't just

5980
03:51:18,779 --> 03:51:24,960
start in like 2013. I paid from 1999

5981
03:51:22,139 --> 03:51:28,199
from the day the company was created all

5982
03:51:24,959 --> 03:51:30,059
the way till you know the future next

5983
03:51:28,200 --> 03:51:31,319
hundred years plus dude that's

5984
03:51:30,059 --> 03:51:33,719
fascinating because you've actually been

5985
03:51:31,318 --> 03:51:35,039
through the whole reality dude I went

5986
03:51:33,719 --> 03:51:37,978
through a seven year court case with

5987
03:51:35,040 --> 03:51:39,720
Reinhardt oh we're like now we're like

5988
03:51:37,978 --> 03:51:41,699
partnered up on some projects and I've

5989
03:51:39,719 --> 03:51:43,619
paid him his money for the patent and I

5990
03:51:41,700 --> 03:51:45,300
try to tell other people that are you

5991
03:51:43,620 --> 03:51:46,620
know selling bags and just like look you

5992
03:51:45,299 --> 03:51:48,539
know you might want to look into this

5993
03:51:46,620 --> 03:51:50,760
it's not worth the litigation that it's

5994
03:51:48,540 --> 03:51:53,760
the guy's superly not greedy but he'll

5995
03:51:50,760 --> 03:51:56,520
hit you hard if you if you try to [ __ ]

5996
03:51:53,760 --> 03:51:59,100
with him for a decade won't his patent

5997
03:51:56,520 --> 03:52:02,040
be over in a couple of years he's got an

5998
03:51:59,100 --> 03:52:03,720
end to his patent in 2018 but if you

5999
03:52:02,040 --> 03:52:05,580
look into patents there's all sorts of

6000
03:52:03,719 --> 03:52:08,000
different ways to extend them

6001
03:52:05,579 --> 03:52:11,579
yeah

6002
03:52:08,000 --> 03:52:13,500
Brave New World they never really end if

6003
03:52:11,579 --> 03:52:16,260
they don't want them to

6004
03:52:13,500 --> 03:52:18,299
and how much yeah and patents are only

6005
03:52:16,260 --> 03:52:20,219
as good as their ability to be enforced

6006
03:52:18,299 --> 03:52:22,438
and uh but you know that's the thing

6007
03:52:20,219 --> 03:52:24,659
people are getting pretty sophisticated

6008
03:52:22,439 --> 03:52:27,059
with that whole set of litigation [ __ ]

6009
03:52:24,659 --> 03:52:28,439
too and no what people are used to a

6010
03:52:27,059 --> 03:52:29,879
world where you pay a hundred bucks you

6011
03:52:28,439 --> 03:52:31,020
get 10 seeds and then you do what you

6012
03:52:29,879 --> 03:52:33,599
want with them the rest of your life

6013
03:52:31,020 --> 03:52:35,520
yeah well it's wild wild west dude

6014
03:52:33,600 --> 03:52:37,079
cannabis industry for the longest time

6015
03:52:35,520 --> 03:52:38,939
is like the wild wild west where people

6016
03:52:37,079 --> 03:52:41,760
just do whatever they want however they

6017
03:52:38,939 --> 03:52:43,200
want and now the legal mechanism says

6018
03:52:41,760 --> 03:52:44,639
well actually there's a whole bunch of

6019
03:52:43,200 --> 03:52:46,380
things you have to change if you want to

6020
03:52:44,639 --> 03:52:48,299
play in the legal mechanism that only

6021
03:52:46,379 --> 03:52:50,099
fit in your prohibition based model

6022
03:52:48,299 --> 03:52:52,019
you're gonna have to leave a lot of this

6023
03:52:50,100 --> 03:52:53,579
stuff behind like these are the

6024
03:52:52,020 --> 03:52:55,140
mechanisms of business that are

6025
03:52:53,579 --> 03:52:57,059
available they're all different tools

6026
03:52:55,139 --> 03:52:58,978
yeah well let's can I can I interject

6027
03:52:57,059 --> 03:53:00,959
there too and and extend it to say it's

6028
03:52:58,978 --> 03:53:03,238
not even the mechanism of business it's

6029
03:53:00,959 --> 03:53:05,039
like guys we got to stop spraying Mike

6030
03:53:03,238 --> 03:53:07,879
labutenil on your plants you got to stop

6031
03:53:05,040 --> 03:53:11,880
[ __ ] spraying by phenization

6032
03:53:07,879 --> 03:53:13,500
forbid 4f and Avid it's like it's these

6033
03:53:11,879 --> 03:53:16,259
are also things that we have to learn

6034
03:53:13,500 --> 03:53:19,200
leave behind it's it's not okay to

6035
03:53:16,260 --> 03:53:21,540
assume and say this is how I've gotten

6036
03:53:19,200 --> 03:53:23,700
by for the last 50 years I'm not willing

6037
03:53:21,540 --> 03:53:25,620
to change because you know what we have

6038
03:53:23,700 --> 03:53:27,840
to accept the new paradigm we have to in

6039
03:53:25,620 --> 03:53:29,760
order to be taken seriously and treat

6040
03:53:27,840 --> 03:53:31,978
our clients with respect we have to

6041
03:53:29,760 --> 03:53:34,620
adapt we have to everybody needs to

6042
03:53:31,978 --> 03:53:36,599
raise their game like everybody and and

6043
03:53:34,620 --> 03:53:37,859
treat the plant with the most respect

6044
03:53:36,600 --> 03:53:40,260
and integrity because otherwise it'll

6045
03:53:37,859 --> 03:53:43,380
shake your ass off yep

6046
03:53:40,260 --> 03:53:44,818
and the market will too I mean look what

6047
03:53:43,379 --> 03:53:47,398
happened with these companies that have

6048
03:53:44,818 --> 03:53:49,439
been spanked in Canada for having dude

6049
03:53:47,398 --> 03:53:52,439
the microbutanol thing is destroying

6050
03:53:49,439 --> 03:53:54,000
some folks I mean to me I mean

6051
03:53:52,439 --> 03:53:57,000
organogram I mean that was a brand

6052
03:53:54,000 --> 03:53:58,620
killer it was an absolute brand killer

6053
03:53:57,000 --> 03:54:01,799
you know wasn't there a huge public

6054
03:53:58,620 --> 03:54:02,660
removal of the CEO and everything oh

6055
03:54:01,799 --> 03:54:06,238
yeah

6056
03:54:02,659 --> 03:54:07,920
yes it wasn't pretty it wasn't pretty

6057
03:54:06,238 --> 03:54:09,840
but it wasn't the CEO's fault you know

6058
03:54:07,920 --> 03:54:11,818
that they actually they were a little

6059
03:54:09,840 --> 03:54:13,139
bit of victim themselves and you know

6060
03:54:11,818 --> 03:54:16,199
they're negligent because they didn't

6061
03:54:13,139 --> 03:54:19,019
monitor it but they hired a production

6062
03:54:16,200 --> 03:54:20,939
company to come in and run their grow oh

6063
03:54:19,020 --> 03:54:22,439
wow right I mean that's that's the

6064
03:54:20,939 --> 03:54:24,779
reality though it's a really difficult

6065
03:54:22,439 --> 03:54:28,380
thing to grow cannabis especially in

6066
03:54:24,779 --> 03:54:30,060
like abundance and on huge scale you

6067
03:54:28,379 --> 03:54:32,278
know if you don't have incredible

6068
03:54:30,059 --> 03:54:33,898
knowledge doing IPM and organic you know

6069
03:54:32,279 --> 03:54:35,520
prevention stuff you know yeah and

6070
03:54:33,898 --> 03:54:37,198
protocol I think it's going to weed most

6071
03:54:35,520 --> 03:54:39,840
people out on their own right based off

6072
03:54:37,199 --> 03:54:42,779
their like chasing of Fool's goals you

6073
03:54:39,840 --> 03:54:44,398
know to like rap too quick yeah and it's

6074
03:54:42,779 --> 03:54:45,659
the same thing with the mites and it

6075
03:54:44,398 --> 03:54:47,398
happened to the black market and you're

6076
03:54:45,659 --> 03:54:50,279
seeing this and you guys have published

6077
03:54:47,398 --> 03:54:52,379
these great graphs that I use on Twitter

6078
03:54:50,279 --> 03:54:53,880
um that show you know the level of

6079
03:54:52,379 --> 03:54:56,519
contamination but this is what happens

6080
03:54:53,879 --> 03:54:59,099
is people they see a past like week two

6081
03:54:56,520 --> 03:55:02,100
and they gray and it ends up in the

6082
03:54:59,100 --> 03:55:03,540
flowers and it's it's too much of an

6083
03:55:02,100 --> 03:55:05,880
investment for that person to lose

6084
03:55:03,540 --> 03:55:08,160
they've got their future wrapped up in

6085
03:55:05,879 --> 03:55:09,778
their forty thousand dollars or eighty

6086
03:55:08,159 --> 03:55:11,398
thousand dollars it's coming down out of

6087
03:55:09,779 --> 03:55:13,738
the crop even if it's five thousand

6088
03:55:11,398 --> 03:55:15,599
dollars you know people are they're so

6089
03:55:13,738 --> 03:55:17,639
counting on that money

6090
03:55:15,600 --> 03:55:20,120
so you can't buy they've already spent

6091
03:55:17,639 --> 03:55:22,799
it dude or maybe maybe yeah

6092
03:55:20,120 --> 03:55:24,479
listen it's not always a problem it's

6093
03:55:22,799 --> 03:55:26,639
not always Ferraris sometimes it's rent

6094
03:55:24,478 --> 03:55:28,799
you know I mean or food right it's like

6095
03:55:26,639 --> 03:55:31,260
to these people this is sometimes it's a

6096
03:55:28,799 --> 03:55:33,238
25 000 glass pieces

6097
03:55:31,260 --> 03:55:35,460
yeah but sometimes it's like the ability

6098
03:55:33,238 --> 03:55:37,680
to eat right or the ability to pay your

6099
03:55:35,459 --> 03:55:40,619
rent or your mortgage right so there's

6100
03:55:37,680 --> 03:55:43,800
there's heavily heavy incentive to

6101
03:55:40,620 --> 03:55:45,660
to protect with your investment and um

6102
03:55:43,799 --> 03:55:49,259
and that's why we need regulation right

6103
03:55:45,659 --> 03:55:50,939
it's because as we've seen

6104
03:55:49,260 --> 03:55:53,340
just leaving it to the market and

6105
03:55:50,939 --> 03:55:55,020
letting people do what they want and

6106
03:55:53,340 --> 03:55:57,478
expecting that they're gonna act

6107
03:55:55,020 --> 03:56:00,120
responsibly has been shown that it

6108
03:55:57,478 --> 03:56:01,559
doesn't work right we need regulation we

6109
03:56:00,120 --> 03:56:04,020
need to have a set of rules that

6110
03:56:01,559 --> 03:56:06,978
everybody has to play by if you want to

6111
03:56:04,020 --> 03:56:06,979
participate in the market

6112
03:56:09,120 --> 03:56:12,540
there it is you know I know people don't

6113
03:56:11,100 --> 03:56:15,000
like hearing that but it's the truth

6114
03:56:12,540 --> 03:56:18,239
it's like it's not okay to me I like

6115
03:56:15,000 --> 03:56:20,699
hearing it it's it's not okay to put on

6116
03:56:18,238 --> 03:56:23,398
um Michael abutinol weed or Avid weed or

6117
03:56:20,699 --> 03:56:25,500
by phenocate weed or you know whatever

6118
03:56:23,398 --> 03:56:26,959
Flora might wheat on the market it's not

6119
03:56:25,500 --> 03:56:29,040
okay

6120
03:56:26,959 --> 03:56:30,539
well that's just one of the trippiest

6121
03:56:29,040 --> 03:56:33,300
parts kind of you know it's I mean

6122
03:56:30,540 --> 03:56:34,920
because a lot of you know because back

6123
03:56:33,299 --> 03:56:36,659
in the day before we opened up SC Labs I

6124
03:56:34,920 --> 03:56:39,299
worked at uh you know big Hydro Store

6125
03:56:36,659 --> 03:56:41,398
kind of chain in Santa Cruz and uh

6126
03:56:39,299 --> 03:56:42,898
and yeah I mean you see you really you

6127
03:56:41,398 --> 03:56:45,000
know there's a divide you see really

6128
03:56:42,898 --> 03:56:47,939
well-intentioned people that are so of

6129
03:56:45,000 --> 03:56:50,699
this plat and like this doodle harm and

6130
03:56:47,939 --> 03:56:52,318
would never even imagine spraying one of

6131
03:56:50,699 --> 03:56:54,120
those things you know but then there's

6132
03:56:52,318 --> 03:56:55,920
other people that you know are well

6133
03:56:54,120 --> 03:56:58,199
intentioned um and they're trying to do

6134
03:56:55,920 --> 03:57:00,840
good but but yeah man this is a this is

6135
03:56:58,199 --> 03:57:02,520
a cash crop and you know crop loss you

6136
03:57:00,840 --> 03:57:04,020
know even the smallest amounts so huge

6137
03:57:02,520 --> 03:57:06,380
to people that are living grow to grow

6138
03:57:04,020 --> 03:57:09,120
dude

6139
03:57:06,379 --> 03:57:10,438
you know if you go there's even further

6140
03:57:09,120 --> 03:57:11,460
the people that just don't give a [ __ ]

6141
03:57:10,439 --> 03:57:13,260
because they're trying to make as much

6142
03:57:11,459 --> 03:57:14,519
money as they can you know and so I

6143
03:57:13,260 --> 03:57:16,859
think I think that that that's

6144
03:57:14,520 --> 03:57:18,120
significant spectrum of the type of

6145
03:57:16,859 --> 03:57:20,760
person that's working with this plant

6146
03:57:18,120 --> 03:57:22,920
it's gonna dude if you go into a Hydra

6147
03:57:20,760 --> 03:57:25,079
store pretty much anywhere in Canada not

6148
03:57:22,920 --> 03:57:27,000
all of them but almost all of them and

6149
03:57:25,079 --> 03:57:29,818
you asked for Nova under the counter

6150
03:57:27,000 --> 03:57:31,260
they'll sell it to you no tax cash sale

6151
03:57:29,818 --> 03:57:32,939
no receipt

6152
03:57:31,260 --> 03:57:34,559
you know and it's they're not allowed to

6153
03:57:32,939 --> 03:57:37,020
do that it's like it's against the

6154
03:57:34,559 --> 03:57:39,359
[ __ ] pesticide regulations for them

6155
03:57:37,020 --> 03:57:41,819
to sell it to anybody that's not you

6156
03:57:39,359 --> 03:57:44,040
know that's not a trained most hydro

6157
03:57:41,818 --> 03:57:46,198
stores do and are and have it

6158
03:57:44,040 --> 03:57:48,479
historically in the past also been the

6159
03:57:46,199 --> 03:57:51,180
biggest slangers of like pgrs you know

6160
03:57:48,478 --> 03:57:53,579
and and it's because the significant

6161
03:57:51,180 --> 03:57:55,500
demand for those exists and if you don't

6162
03:57:53,579 --> 03:57:57,120
have them so go to the neighboring Hydro

6163
03:57:55,500 --> 03:57:58,559
Store yeah they're beholden to their

6164
03:57:57,120 --> 03:58:00,540
customer listen any industry where

6165
03:57:58,559 --> 03:58:02,340
they're beholden to the customer you

6166
03:58:00,540 --> 03:58:04,920
know like even even doctors writing

6167
03:58:02,340 --> 03:58:06,779
prescriptions for uh opioids or whatever

6168
03:58:04,920 --> 03:58:08,639
you know the doctor in the states at

6169
03:58:06,779 --> 03:58:10,800
least it's not as bad in other countries

6170
03:58:08,639 --> 03:58:12,059
where it's not a privatized Health Care

6171
03:58:10,799 --> 03:58:14,519
System but it's one thing I definitely

6172
03:58:12,059 --> 03:58:17,039
noticed in the states is that the the

6173
03:58:14,520 --> 03:58:19,079
doctor is beholden to the client and the

6174
03:58:17,040 --> 03:58:21,180
customer is the patient in that case

6175
03:58:19,079 --> 03:58:25,379
he's the one that's paying the bill if

6176
03:58:21,180 --> 03:58:29,040
you go in and you ask for Zoloft or t3s

6177
03:58:25,379 --> 03:58:30,719
or or even Oxycontin yeah they'll give

6178
03:58:29,040 --> 03:58:32,460
it to you right because they're beholden

6179
03:58:30,719 --> 03:58:34,019
to you it's like they you want you're

6180
03:58:32,459 --> 03:58:35,698
their client they're making money off

6181
03:58:34,020 --> 03:58:36,779
you you're paying their rent you're

6182
03:58:35,699 --> 03:58:38,279
paying their they're putting the bread

6183
03:58:36,779 --> 03:58:40,738
on their table oh you're right that's a

6184
03:58:38,279 --> 03:58:42,960
significant flaw in the ability for I

6185
03:58:40,738 --> 03:58:45,000
don't know yeah no it makes me nervous

6186
03:58:42,959 --> 03:58:46,799
about how many dispensaries we have that

6187
03:58:45,000 --> 03:58:49,020
aren't forced to test you know if

6188
03:58:46,799 --> 03:58:51,539
they're not forced to test will they

6189
03:58:49,020 --> 03:58:54,079
test or will a lot of that product get

6190
03:58:51,540 --> 03:58:57,660
sold to people that are you know

6191
03:58:54,079 --> 03:58:59,159
patients man I'd listen I I Yap about

6192
03:58:57,659 --> 03:59:01,619
this on Twitter all the time but like

6193
03:58:59,159 --> 03:59:03,478
I'd love to be I'd love to be on side of

6194
03:59:01,620 --> 03:59:06,180
the Canadian dispensaries and I

6195
03:59:03,478 --> 03:59:08,278
unfortunately can't because most of them

6196
03:59:06,180 --> 03:59:10,500
refuse to test roast most of them refuse

6197
03:59:08,279 --> 03:59:13,560
to demand testing from their Mar Growers

6198
03:59:10,500 --> 03:59:15,600
and uh it's [ __ ] because I've seen

6199
03:59:13,559 --> 03:59:17,579
cities like I've seen you know how

6200
03:59:15,600 --> 03:59:19,800
California's done it I've seen how

6201
03:59:17,579 --> 03:59:22,379
Berkeley California has done it I mean

6202
03:59:19,799 --> 03:59:24,478
they have a dispensary Market where it's

6203
03:59:22,379 --> 03:59:26,759
it's member patient cultivators it's all

6204
03:59:24,478 --> 03:59:27,898
home Growers right it's like the same

6205
03:59:26,760 --> 03:59:30,238
type of people that are supplying the

6206
03:59:27,898 --> 03:59:32,760
dispensaries in Canada but they demand

6207
03:59:30,238 --> 03:59:34,799
they require wire that you test the

6208
03:59:32,760 --> 03:59:37,978
medicine to show that it's clean before

6209
03:59:34,799 --> 03:59:40,318
it ends up on the shelves and um and it

6210
03:59:37,978 --> 03:59:42,959
can be done and those people can produce

6211
03:59:40,318 --> 03:59:45,778
and and patients can make money they can

6212
03:59:42,959 --> 03:59:47,459
be part of the industry but creating a

6213
03:59:45,779 --> 03:59:49,199
situation and calling it a dispensary

6214
03:59:47,459 --> 03:59:51,478
where you're allowing untested medicine

6215
03:59:49,199 --> 03:59:54,000
on the market I just I'm sorry I can't

6216
03:59:51,478 --> 03:59:56,039
get behind it I would never buy

6217
03:59:54,000 --> 03:59:56,818
dispensary weed in Canada I wouldn't do

6218
03:59:56,040 --> 03:59:59,340
it

6219
03:59:56,818 --> 04:00:00,478
right well you know there's also this

6220
03:59:59,340 --> 04:00:02,340
really huge kind of thing happening in

6221
04:00:00,478 --> 04:00:04,139
California right now um

6222
04:00:02,340 --> 04:00:07,500
I mean it's turned into like one of the

6223
04:00:04,139 --> 04:00:10,198
biggest like social media like Troll

6224
04:00:07,500 --> 04:00:12,238
Wars that I've ever seen take place and

6225
04:00:10,199 --> 04:00:13,979
uh you know basically there was this um

6226
04:00:12,238 --> 04:00:15,959
you know I don't know if you any of you

6227
04:00:13,978 --> 04:00:17,519
are familiar with but there's this uh in

6228
04:00:15,959 --> 04:00:21,599
California there's this proposition

6229
04:00:17,520 --> 04:00:23,939
called prop 65 and prop 65 uh makes you

6230
04:00:21,600 --> 04:00:25,859
basically have to label and put up signs

6231
04:00:23,939 --> 04:00:27,420
that say you know this product is known

6232
04:00:25,859 --> 04:00:30,238
to the state of California to cause

6233
04:00:27,420 --> 04:00:32,699
cancer and birth defects and blah blah

6234
04:00:30,238 --> 04:00:35,279
blah and um and and so what you have are

6235
04:00:32,699 --> 04:00:37,620
these like ambulance chasing lawyers

6236
04:00:35,279 --> 04:00:40,079
that will basically

6237
04:00:37,620 --> 04:00:41,939
um go and document like repeated kind of

6238
04:00:40,079 --> 04:00:44,639
violations of not having signs in

6239
04:00:41,939 --> 04:00:48,120
certain retail spaces you know to say

6240
04:00:44,639 --> 04:00:49,680
that type of prop 65 claim and and so

6241
04:00:48,120 --> 04:00:51,779
you know in a lot of Industries the prop

6242
04:00:49,680 --> 04:00:54,059
65 thing is really it's a really kind of

6243
04:00:51,779 --> 04:00:57,238
lame kind of lawyer chasing kind of like

6244
04:00:54,059 --> 04:00:59,519
litigation scam kind of thing but but

6245
04:00:57,238 --> 04:01:02,279
what they're what just happened is they

6246
04:00:59,520 --> 04:01:04,859
they just um on the California attorney

6247
04:01:02,279 --> 04:01:07,800
General websites you know they just

6248
04:01:04,859 --> 04:01:11,579
published like 650 lawsuits like for

6249
04:01:07,799 --> 04:01:12,659
prop 65 to a lot of the biggest [ __ ]

6250
04:01:11,579 --> 04:01:14,760
Brands and companies throughout

6251
04:01:12,659 --> 04:01:16,500
California because there are all these

6252
04:01:14,760 --> 04:01:19,318
samples I guess that were independently

6253
04:01:16,500 --> 04:01:22,020
just pulled off shelves and then tested

6254
04:01:19,318 --> 04:01:24,000
and then have found to have pesticides

6255
04:01:22,020 --> 04:01:26,659
in them and then they basically used the

6256
04:01:24,000 --> 04:01:30,299
pesticides as a way to do this prop 65

6257
04:01:26,659 --> 04:01:33,719
uh litigation claim in cannabis in

6258
04:01:30,299 --> 04:01:36,179
cannabis and uh and so so yeah so it's

6259
04:01:33,719 --> 04:01:38,278
it's crazy so you know there's these uh

6260
04:01:36,180 --> 04:01:40,318
these spreadsheets basically that have

6261
04:01:38,279 --> 04:01:42,479
like almost in all of the biggest like

6262
04:01:40,318 --> 04:01:44,519
you know cartridge companies and stuff

6263
04:01:42,478 --> 04:01:46,559
in California and they're you know they

6264
04:01:44,520 --> 04:01:48,319
just all on the spreadsheet and have

6265
04:01:46,559 --> 04:01:51,000
like what pesticides they all failed for

6266
04:01:48,318 --> 04:01:52,680
and so so you know you basically people

6267
04:01:51,000 --> 04:01:54,359
are like just reposting it reposting

6268
04:01:52,680 --> 04:01:55,738
reposting on Instagram when they have

6269
04:01:54,359 --> 04:01:58,199
thousands or hundreds of thousands of

6270
04:01:55,738 --> 04:02:00,359
followers and uh and you know just

6271
04:01:58,199 --> 04:02:01,739
creating these huge kind of Wars where

6272
04:02:00,359 --> 04:02:04,380
these trolls are basically then going

6273
04:02:01,738 --> 04:02:06,600
and do doing like these Mass attacks on

6274
04:02:04,379 --> 04:02:08,099
these different brand Pages you know of

6275
04:02:06,600 --> 04:02:09,899
all these people saying you're poisoning

6276
04:02:08,100 --> 04:02:12,120
patients you're poisoning patients and

6277
04:02:09,898 --> 04:02:14,039
then you know in return you know all

6278
04:02:12,120 --> 04:02:16,319
these different companies are you know

6279
04:02:14,040 --> 04:02:18,899
posting all these these clean lab

6280
04:02:16,318 --> 04:02:21,420
results trying to be like we test clean

6281
04:02:18,898 --> 04:02:23,039
we test clean you know and so and it's

6282
04:02:21,420 --> 04:02:25,020
funny because you know most people that

6283
04:02:23,040 --> 04:02:27,120
you know cast clean you know probably

6284
04:02:25,020 --> 04:02:29,220
have more failing tests and they have

6285
04:02:27,120 --> 04:02:31,319
clean tests you know but there's um

6286
04:02:29,219 --> 04:02:33,478
there's not this uh you know that's one

6287
04:02:31,318 --> 04:02:35,219
of the the holes in uh the the way

6288
04:02:33,478 --> 04:02:36,539
testing currently exists you know

6289
04:02:35,219 --> 04:02:39,719
because whenever and when that's

6290
04:02:36,540 --> 04:02:42,239
listening isn't 100 being done by like a

6291
04:02:39,719 --> 04:02:44,398
State Certified sampling agent or you

6292
04:02:42,238 --> 04:02:46,139
know somebody of non kind of biased

6293
04:02:44,398 --> 04:02:47,579
potential you know then you know you

6294
04:02:46,139 --> 04:02:49,619
could test anything and then anything

6295
04:02:47,579 --> 04:02:51,299
can be posted and you know there's no

6296
04:02:49,620 --> 04:02:54,060
kind of necessarily Integrity I guess

6297
04:02:51,299 --> 04:02:57,719
based in you know the full testing you

6298
04:02:54,059 --> 04:02:59,278
know uh scheme you know but but that's

6299
04:02:57,719 --> 04:03:01,738
what it's going to be you know kind of

6300
04:02:59,279 --> 04:03:03,479
uh you know definitely you know believe

6301
04:03:01,738 --> 04:03:05,398
is going to be fixed with kind of the

6302
04:03:03,478 --> 04:03:07,438
regulation of California coming up

6303
04:03:05,398 --> 04:03:09,180
because that similar way oriented is

6304
04:03:07,439 --> 04:03:12,960
they you know they require you know the

6305
04:03:09,180 --> 04:03:14,639
lab or a State Certified sampling lab

6306
04:03:12,959 --> 04:03:16,379
um that just does that on its own to

6307
04:03:14,639 --> 04:03:18,000
kind of then you know basically do the

6308
04:03:16,379 --> 04:03:19,978
statistically valid sampling of the

6309
04:03:18,000 --> 04:03:21,659
batches and then you know tamper-proof

6310
04:03:19,978 --> 04:03:23,398
ceiling of the packaging and then you

6311
04:03:21,659 --> 04:03:24,898
know lab results are then or a lot you

6312
04:03:23,398 --> 04:03:26,039
know send samples are going to the lab

6313
04:03:24,898 --> 04:03:28,559
you know through the chain of custody

6314
04:03:26,040 --> 04:03:29,880
process blah blah results ultimately go

6315
04:03:28,559 --> 04:03:31,920
through the quality system to be

6316
04:03:29,879 --> 04:03:34,379
ultimately released and then on the

6317
04:03:31,920 --> 04:03:36,059
release you know the with the clean like

6318
04:03:34,379 --> 04:03:37,379
bill of health or whatever I guess uh

6319
04:03:36,059 --> 04:03:39,840
the certificate of analysis of clean

6320
04:03:37,379 --> 04:03:42,000
herb then it can go into the regulated

6321
04:03:39,840 --> 04:03:43,318
market to be sold yeah and that's you

6322
04:03:42,000 --> 04:03:45,420
know that's one thing that California's

6323
04:03:43,318 --> 04:03:47,818
done really well Canada has kind of

6324
04:03:45,420 --> 04:03:49,978
tried to do this and you have to record

6325
04:03:47,818 --> 04:03:52,260
batch numbers and you have to Archive

6326
04:03:49,978 --> 04:03:55,019
batch samples even

6327
04:03:52,260 --> 04:03:57,478
um so that if there is a future issue

6328
04:03:55,020 --> 04:03:59,699
that the the regulator can come in and

6329
04:03:57,478 --> 04:04:02,398
access your your archive essentially and

6330
04:03:59,699 --> 04:04:04,199
pull it the corresponding sample

6331
04:04:02,398 --> 04:04:08,159
um the Canadian failure though is that

6332
04:04:04,199 --> 04:04:09,720
they've allowed companies to do first

6333
04:04:08,159 --> 04:04:12,359
party lab testing as opposed to

6334
04:04:09,719 --> 04:04:14,039
third-party labs for huge problems and

6335
04:04:12,359 --> 04:04:16,439
that's a mistake so there are some

6336
04:04:14,040 --> 04:04:18,239
companies like Aurora for example that

6337
04:04:16,439 --> 04:04:19,680
still choose to do third-party lab

6338
04:04:18,238 --> 04:04:21,619
testing

6339
04:04:19,680 --> 04:04:24,600
um you know they have an in-house

6340
04:04:21,620 --> 04:04:26,340
research lab but the information that

6341
04:04:24,600 --> 04:04:28,500
ends up on their package is done by a

6342
04:04:26,340 --> 04:04:30,600
third party test of lab and I invest and

6343
04:04:28,500 --> 04:04:32,219
I I advise all my clients to always do

6344
04:04:30,600 --> 04:04:34,380
third party for your test book about

6345
04:04:32,219 --> 04:04:35,818
because it takes that impression out

6346
04:04:34,379 --> 04:04:38,719
that you could be manipulating results

6347
04:04:35,818 --> 04:04:38,719
right

6348
04:04:40,159 --> 04:04:44,579
when we do Educational Services through

6349
04:04:42,659 --> 04:04:46,318
the graduates Network it's one of the

6350
04:04:44,579 --> 04:04:48,000
first things we teach families is if

6351
04:04:46,318 --> 04:04:50,760
there's a company that won't provide

6352
04:04:48,000 --> 04:04:52,680
third-party testing or won't share their

6353
04:04:50,760 --> 04:04:55,520
test results then you just don't use

6354
04:04:52,680 --> 04:04:58,260
them bingo bingo

6355
04:04:55,520 --> 04:05:00,420
because clean testing is something to be

6356
04:04:58,260 --> 04:05:02,939
proud of so yeah they're either doing it

6357
04:05:00,420 --> 04:05:04,260
or they have some value yeah so if you

6358
04:05:02,939 --> 04:05:07,079
have clean yes you're showing them

6359
04:05:04,260 --> 04:05:08,159
because it's great you know well listen

6360
04:05:07,079 --> 04:05:10,799
there's a little bit of a financial

6361
04:05:08,159 --> 04:05:12,719
thing at play too I mean in California

6362
04:05:10,799 --> 04:05:14,099
there's so many testing Labs that the

6363
04:05:12,719 --> 04:05:15,238
prices come down and it's quite

6364
04:05:14,100 --> 04:05:17,100
competitive

6365
04:05:15,238 --> 04:05:19,920
um in Canada there's not that level of

6366
04:05:17,100 --> 04:05:21,600
access and uh there's actually extra

6367
04:05:19,920 --> 04:05:22,738
tests that are required like heavy

6368
04:05:21,600 --> 04:05:24,180
metals

6369
04:05:22,738 --> 04:05:26,100
um that are actually much more expensive

6370
04:05:24,180 --> 04:05:27,960
to perform than just but not a thousand

6371
04:05:26,100 --> 04:05:30,300
[ __ ] dollars dude there's like

6372
04:05:27,959 --> 04:05:32,339
poaching happening up there dude no well

6373
04:05:30,299 --> 04:05:34,398
for a full battery of tests like a full

6374
04:05:32,340 --> 04:05:37,020
full battery of tests including

6375
04:05:34,398 --> 04:05:38,579
aflatoxins and

6376
04:05:37,020 --> 04:05:42,000
um you know cannabinoids terpenes

6377
04:05:38,579 --> 04:05:43,859
alphotoxins microbial

6378
04:05:42,000 --> 04:05:46,020
um heavy metals yeah it cost a thousand

6379
04:05:43,859 --> 04:05:48,059
bucks it's still tax though that's

6380
04:05:46,020 --> 04:05:51,079
almost like yeah that's that's really I

6381
04:05:48,059 --> 04:05:54,619
mean you know that that full thing

6382
04:05:51,079 --> 04:05:57,478
our thousand bucks is like 700 of yours

6383
04:05:54,620 --> 04:05:59,279
ah oh yeah no that that helps because I

6384
04:05:57,478 --> 04:06:00,898
was gonna say like four to five hundred

6385
04:05:59,279 --> 04:06:02,220
you know I think is kind of around where

6386
04:06:00,898 --> 04:06:04,439
that would be that's where it's kind of

6387
04:06:02,219 --> 04:06:07,198
evening out in Oregon like 50 more

6388
04:06:04,439 --> 04:06:09,540
expensive up here but we know everything

6389
04:06:07,199 --> 04:06:11,239
is 30 more expensive because of the

6390
04:06:09,540 --> 04:06:15,420
exchange

6391
04:06:11,238 --> 04:06:19,159
and alcohol is like doubly expensive

6392
04:06:15,420 --> 04:06:19,159
yeah even more than doubly

6393
04:06:19,318 --> 04:06:24,600
no I'm with John Mayer alcohol is a con

6394
04:06:21,779 --> 04:06:25,800
yeah he's gone that's awesome use for it

6395
04:06:24,600 --> 04:06:29,600
in my life

6396
04:06:25,799 --> 04:06:32,159
awesome that's a great answer

6397
04:06:29,600 --> 04:06:34,140
there's no spiritual significance though

6398
04:06:32,159 --> 04:06:36,539
yeah well that's also why it's twice the

6399
04:06:34,139 --> 04:06:38,519
price it's all tax right it's just it's

6400
04:06:36,540 --> 04:06:39,899
the government trying to like convince

6401
04:06:38,520 --> 04:06:41,340
you not to do it and if you are going to

6402
04:06:39,898 --> 04:06:43,019
do it they're going to tax you on it now

6403
04:06:41,340 --> 04:06:44,760
so that when you end up in the Health

6404
04:06:43,020 --> 04:06:47,600
Care System later on you've already paid

6405
04:06:44,760 --> 04:06:50,520
into it oh that's hilarious

6406
04:06:47,600 --> 04:06:53,340
it's true it's the reality though I mean

6407
04:06:50,520 --> 04:06:54,840
that's the way it works we want those

6408
04:06:53,340 --> 04:06:56,520
people drinking booze to pay for our

6409
04:06:54,840 --> 04:06:58,680
health care well they pay for their

6410
04:06:56,520 --> 04:07:01,880
health care is what they do right well

6411
04:06:58,680 --> 04:07:01,880
but they pay for ours too

6412
04:07:04,398 --> 04:07:10,318
anyway I think that was a solid four

6413
04:07:08,100 --> 04:07:13,159
hours and seven minutes

6414
04:07:10,318 --> 04:07:16,318
um great conversation guys wonderful

6415
04:07:13,159 --> 04:07:18,420
past church today it was we're too away

6416
04:07:16,318 --> 04:07:20,760
from three year anniversary so hopefully

6417
04:07:18,420 --> 04:07:23,040
in the next week or so I'll have a plan

6418
04:07:20,760 --> 04:07:25,139
set up hopefully with Natasha because

6419
04:07:23,040 --> 04:07:27,300
she's much better at plans than I am

6420
04:07:25,139 --> 04:07:29,760
plus she's like really good at that sort

6421
04:07:27,299 --> 04:07:31,920
of uh don't make the tattoo your

6422
04:07:29,760 --> 04:07:33,960
secretary she's a doctor oh gosh no

6423
04:07:31,920 --> 04:07:36,299
she's not my secretary but she is a

6424
04:07:33,959 --> 04:07:38,278
amazing facilitator of hash church I

6425
04:07:36,299 --> 04:07:40,340
think of her more as

6426
04:07:38,279 --> 04:07:42,779
um like a producer

6427
04:07:40,340 --> 04:07:44,818

was gonna get the guy who had his bong

6430
04:07:47,100 --> 04:07:50,699
taken away in Ontario and then was like

6431
04:07:48,959 --> 04:07:52,318
he was standing out in front of the

6432
04:07:50,699 --> 04:07:54,359
police station in his underwear puff and

6433
04:07:52,318 --> 04:07:56,459
Bong rips and I was kind of like maybe

6434
04:07:54,359 --> 04:07:58,159
you should interview him before we just

6435
04:07:56,459 --> 04:08:01,318

04:08:01,318 --> 04:08:06,059
of interviews with him and the guy knows

6438
04:08:02,939 --> 04:08:08,398
the rules to the AC MPR and he's he's

6439
