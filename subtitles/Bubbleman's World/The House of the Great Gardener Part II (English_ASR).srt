awesome very good yeah it's a great

72
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:55,719
strain I smoked the resin anyway and uh

73
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:59,719
very very nice aromatic flavors and very

74
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:59,719
full complex

75
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,399
Rich you see the sort of seeds all

76
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,760
developing in

77
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,480
there oh wow

78
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,479
beautiful on the top

79
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,319
there very nice probably got a couple

80
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,319
more weeks to go

81
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,519
though and this is the same this is the

82
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,120
same sort of Barber but uh just didn't

83
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,120
take cake as

84
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:39,478
well

85
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:41,519
femine it's difficult sometimes hey is

86
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:44,560
actually one of the ones that we had a

87
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,758
lot of difficulty just because the buds

88
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,199
are so tight and nuggety that when uh

89
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,160
when the U male anthers show up instead

90
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,478
of sort of opening up and

91
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,960
dangling on the tighter indicia buds it

92
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,399
would just get stuck in the bud it

93
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,719
wouldn't open up so it's been it's been

94
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:06,560
quite the learning process to figure out

95
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:11,039
how to get them to open up

96
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,038
interesting Good Times yeah

97
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,720

can absolutely beautiful room I haven't

112
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,520
found with the lights but the

113
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,919
temperature is really the air movement

114
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:59,959
everything is good they've got their

115
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:03,038
balance tie they've got incredible um

116
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,799
can't open every 10 ft there's three

117
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,680
giant ones plus they got one on their

118
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,000
outake and their intake all around the

119
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,319
room's really comfortable I like the way

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,639
they've got it set up for hand uh hand

121
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,479
watering or the wig system that the drip

122
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,199
emitters that can you know of course

123
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,240
feed the entire room in a short period

124
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,160
of

125
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,840
time it's a it's an impressive layout

126
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,919
that they have with the rooms flowering

127
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,359
bedrooms the strains are topnotch that

128
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:34,439
the breeder really knows what he's doing

129
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,479
and it shows in the resin even in the

130
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:39,839
10minute dry SI 10minute we did a

131
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:42,598
10-minute run and it was still probably

132
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,478
40 to 50% heads which is really unheard

133
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:48,079
of there's a lot of beautifully

134
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:52,079
well-grown glandular heads on the great

135
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:56,038
Gardener cannabis so just wanted to sh

138
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,680
room and uh maybe we'll walk over next

[Music]

141
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,038
hour all right so here's a room they've

142
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:38,559
already topped they've taken the tops

143
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:41,559
off of the majority of these plants

144
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,718
there's a fine sativa right

145
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,479
there I remember him telling me that

146
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,240
these were seedsman Hayes in the corner

147
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,120
here he's got some nice big tall

148
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,320
sativas really beautifully done I really

149
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,320
like when a sativas accurately grown to

150
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,040
to its actual you know genetic and

151
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,600
climatic climactic region these are

152
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,719
sparse and Airy and they've grown

153
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,159
tall see if I can get in there a little

154
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,480
bit better on this back one is really

155
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,838
nice the rest of these plants he's

156
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,240
topped and I guess he's just now letting

157
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,360
the bottoms fill in a little bit

158
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,000
increase resin

159
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,759
production and

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,879
uh yeah I'm sure he'll be making hash

161
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,879
from a lot of this material

162
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:44,039
[Music]

163
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:54,320

164
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:59,480
six and it is at 62 I would

165
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:02,560
take I'll take 62 61 oh yeah

166
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,519
little floating pH pen like that get

167
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,319
sick of holding on to it and you're

168
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,440
supposed to keep it wet anyway it in

169
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,278
there yeah you want yeah well cuz one

170
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,360
reservoir is for water and one one

171
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:15,159
reservoir is for food I noticed that you

172
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,480
had H2 yeah so every room I have the

173
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:21,240
capabilities and plus every table has a

174
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,839
switch so I can feed one table water

175
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,159
another

176
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,040
table that's awesome so I can have

177
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:29,719
different strains on different tables

178
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:33,199
you have different flowering times keep

179
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:36,519
up some stuff on food seven on water

180
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,759
seven seven nice size reservoirs

181
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,759
here yeah I think they're 200

182
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,800
gallon we were worried in the summer if

183
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,399
that heated up too much started pregn

184
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,199
out and not get their shade back cuz

185
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,039
they're supposed to be they're always

186
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,600
meant to be used on the side but we got

187
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:58,278
a we had a guy weld the hole in it they

188
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,000
make it cuz there's always a hole in

189
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:04,240
right in the top right so they I guess

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,839
they can weld plastic just yep so they

191
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,519
welded it clo so we can so we can put

192
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,279
them up vertically like CU otherwise it

193
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,278
would have took up

194
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,278
like no this is great this is nice I

195
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,360
like the way they're uh with the way

196
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:23,120
they're laid out yeah totally opens this

197
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,919
whole room up in a way that yeah would

198
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,919
not be the case otherwise

199
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,040
WR everything

200
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,440
down it

201
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,940
[Music]

202
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,600

203
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,399
all right so this is some super silver

00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:13,079
haze this for a

205
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:17,120
while Airy kind of

206
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,958
herb we just uh breaking the buds off of

207
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,839
it right

208
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,838
now getting it ready for some

209
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,000
tumbling of course when you do this it's

210
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,079
always a good idea idea to do it on

211
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,559
screens cuz there's always going to be

212
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:36,559
some lost

213
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:48,440
resin all right

214
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,440
that's good old AR sativa

215
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:15,559
not the feel of the sativa just a

216
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:15,559
different kind of sparse

217
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:22,639
hairy beautiful

218
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,360
Tarpin always been a fan of this super

219
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,879
silver

220
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,879
resin not a big can smoker

221
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,480
the

222
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,480
spe

223
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:04,319
spe is defin they been at the

224
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:08,399
bottom the garbage bag for a

225
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,399
bit almost flattened

226
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,920
nuts you can see the resin exploding off

227
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,919
of the buds as I strip

228
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,439
them oh good idea which was something I

229
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,039
was talking about earlier is when you're

230
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,519
dry sifting it's good to get your

231
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,078
sleeves anything that's dangling like

232
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,839
these that might get in the resin at a

233
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:38,758
later time necklaces even like these

234
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:42,079
Keys anything that's around your neck um

235
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:44,800
get it tucked in make sure that you're

236
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,319
not about droopy clothing leaning over

237
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,879
because the the stuff is extremely

238
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,959
sticky and it's going to attract uh

239
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,320
fibers hairs dirt debris and most of us

240
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,119
aren't thinking about these things but

241
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,800
when you see it under the macro

242
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,198
lens you get the understanding of why

243
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,758
every every once in a while in the Blue

244
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:04,439
Moon you get a hit that tastes a little

245
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,199
funny and you're not sure why something

246
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,120
ended up in that final product it wasn't

247
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,319
supposed

248
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,440
to sometimes it doesn't have to be very

249
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,240
big to

250
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,199
affect

251
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,079
Dam it's uh Matt great Gardener is in

252
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,838
the background he's uh going through the

253
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:22,319
freezer full of fresh Frozen right now I

254
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:24,880
believe he's pulling out some

255
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,720
catatonic uh some catonic and we're

256
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,278
going to do a 20 gallon run in a little

257
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,278
bit but in the meantime we're going to

258
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:32,159
continue to break up up this bag of herb

259
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:34,240
over the screens see if we can collect a

260
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,439
little something to card and then run

261
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,318
the rest of the bud through the tumble

262
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,319
now so catch up with you in a

263
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,720
bit

264
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,039
gently okay to go

265
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,440

270
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,440
monster really sparse fluffy sativa

271
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,919
can't say enough about the the smell on

272
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,360
this one uh we sifted it gently through

273
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:30,919
the large 4x2 screens and we came up

274
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,919
with

275
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,440

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,839
hits so we'll

280
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:56,239
uh take the material that's on top and

281
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,959
probably put it in the tumble now here

282
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,159
