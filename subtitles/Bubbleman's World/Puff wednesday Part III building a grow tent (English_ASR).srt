over we lost we lost the game Bubble

117

man's a failure all right so

118
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:28,639
that Reservoir this is going to be the

119
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,319
goods right here this is our

120
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,720
Dome

121
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:39,960
I saw basically how um this fits into

122
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,759
here like this it kind of drops in here

123
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:46,318
and all the Jets are fit in and it

124
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,560
basically this is the the

125
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,080
cords nice and that just sits right on

126
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,918
top and then the Dome so well let's

127
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:54,959
check it out I got the trusty old Dodge

128
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,198
key on they sent us uh prices for all

129
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,198
the different reservoirs sizes we've got

130
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,120
white and black 10 gon 20 20 gallon and

131
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,680
40 gallon if you can imagine big old 40

132
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,280
gallers what is that like 125 sights or

133
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,639
something this a little

134
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:13,478
mepr thing these are the pucks yeah

135
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,400
these are little bit cicare stuff in

136
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:16,918
here to inspire root though all right

137
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:19,519
well I'm thinking I might listen to my

138
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,758
buddy Kingston who's got the uh recipe

139
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,879
down on lock so this is risos spere root

140
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,960
inoculant for seedling and transplants

141
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,680
and then the aqua shield and power clone

142
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:34,079
both from Botanicare Solutions

143
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,759
all right so we get the pump ging book

144
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:39,478
of course general purpose utility pump

145
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,400
perfect hoses the hoses and these will

146
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,758
probably be the air pucks and maybe the

147
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,198
other pump these would be the little

148
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,479
power cord for the pump there we go oh

149
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,639
you got the emitters the little Jets

150
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:51,639
there you go okay

151
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:56,800
[Music]

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,478
so here's the

153
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,199
instructions and we're just going to

154
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,159
follow the instructions cuz what a great

155
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,439
idea to follow the instructions what a

156
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,759
concept power cable for the uh power

157
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:11,199
cord for the yeah no it's just a little

158
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,479
pump oh yeah for the airstones

159
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,919
for the airstones yeah I saw it had

160
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:19,038
airstones as well as this pump that uh

161
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,399
you know Jets out the uh so we'll leave

162
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,759
those in

163
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,560
there let's see what we got going here

164
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,520
so we've got the reservoir and clone

165
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,240
tray the hum the humidome uh the

166
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,598
manifold which is this little guy right

167
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,160
here the clear tubing which is right

168
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,639
here we've got our food right here we've

169
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,560
got the mag pump the mag Drive pump the

170
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,079
single air pump that you just had in

171
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,240
your hand there we've got 13 yellow

172
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,639
sprayers 15 yellow sprayers and 35

173
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,759
yellow sprayers so I'm not sure which

174
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,319
one we got I think the 13 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

175
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,319
8 9 10 11 12 13 14

176
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,918
15 14 so it's probably 13 with an extra

177
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,158
one it's always nice if they want an

178
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,560
extra one 45 neoprene inserts I'm not

179
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:02,879
going to count those and then the

180
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,598
airstones are the only thing I didn't

181
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,199
see that must be in here yes there they

182

excellent Johnny is a since he smacked

184
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,598
his head he's real good with numbers

185
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,000
like real good with numbers hey what are

186
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,519
the lottery uh winning numbers going to

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,800

bowl that's $200 million win we only

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,280
expect about a 2% return on that if you

190
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,960
wouldn't mind sending that to Cara

191
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:29,679
bubble man's world Johnny pimp lappa B

192
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:32,759
for fellow and uh Bubble Man Marcus G

193
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,918
williger anyway let's get into this here

194
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,278
John okay run water through the manifold

195
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:38,759
rinse power cloner Parts make sure

196
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,080
you're cloner is clean and debris free

197
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,559
before using this can be done by rinsing

198
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,278
all conon prior to use no problem we

199
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,518
have a hose right over there we'll do

200
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,039
that once we've rinsed this out which

201
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,240
I'll go do right now we're going to

202
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:52,278
insert the sprayers

203
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,200
Johnny insert the

204
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:56,200
sprayers oh

205
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,360
wow that was

206
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,320
awesome well it fell pretty good

207
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,919
distance but I it was still kind of

208
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,320
protected so

209
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,519
yeah so he's rinting things off there

210
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,720
right now and you know what I'm going to

211
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,759
take a better look at this just want to

212
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,240
take a quick look they said he watched

213
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:17,559
the video on it so I haven't actually we

214
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,200
set one up at work was quite easy oxy

215
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:20,199
was uh

216
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:28,360
down all right so it looks as though all

217
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:31,440
the Jets are clear and free there we

218
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,159
go spin these all over there that looks

219
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,040
like yeah nice and nice job yeah you

220
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:39,199
know got the hose right

221
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,958
there all right so a little bit of water

222
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,240
in that which is okay that's of the

223
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:46,239
sweets down

224
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,240
here

225
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,559
so now it's literally about putting all

226
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,120
of those little guys into there so if

227
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,319
you want to pass me a

228
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:01,240
handful we can both just

229
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,640
uh what did I do with the directions

230
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,519
there they are so here we go gently

231
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,799
thread a sprayer into each side on the

232
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,759
manifold they are all the way in in the

233
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,359
pictures they said gently so they said

234
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,639
gently but yet in the pictures they're

235
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,600
all the way in so what do you think

236
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,600
there do we we keep

237
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,880
going I'm going to go wait until the

238
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,879
arrow

239
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,440
is it gets pretty tough on the hands

240
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,440
doesn't it yeah see that way can't do it

241
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,399
so oh this one's good I guess it depends

242
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,519
on if you've come in at a strange

243
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,519
angle if you did your fingers are going

244
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,639
to

245
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,639
hurt try to close them

246
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,200
out all right

247
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,000
so we've rinsed our manifold we've

248
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,639
installed our sprayers use the yellow

249
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,519
hole punch wrench the yellow hole punch

250
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,120
wrench to

251
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,879
tighten the sprayers until snug make

252
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,440
sure your arrows are pointed away from

253
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,799
the reservoir wall do not overtighten as

254
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,240
this inst strip thread so this is the

255
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,559
tool this makes and total sense this is

256
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,839
wonderful reading the instructions all

257
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,000
of us you know what John I love doing

258
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,000
this stuff with you because I'm kind of

259
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,360
the same way I don't really you know

260
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,320
always pay full attention to what's

261
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,159
going on

262
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
with's yeah we're just like how could I

263
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,600
not be able to do this yeah it's quite

264
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,278
easy oh wait but once again we just put

265
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,159
it in very Loosely it's quite easy oh I

266
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,639
did it completely wrong you know we did

267
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:31,319
fine usually I do it completely wrong

268
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,519
and then so I'm going to screw in these

269
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,000
little bottoms on the on this pump here

270
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,320
so it sticks into the bottom of the r CU

271
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,159
of course this is going to pump the

272
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,160
water through the

273
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:48,680
MS oh this is a great little

274
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:51,639
tool really tightens these little guys

275
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:54,679
up nicely and the fingers was not I

276
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,680
wasn't feeling that I stopped I stopped

277
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:59,078
I just stopped I was like I'm

278
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:00,439
done well it wasn't super enjoyable was

279
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:04,319
it

280
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,959
um hard little plastic piece so I'm

281
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,320
pretty excited about this guy I got to

282
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,078
say I've heard these little do it

283
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,480
yourself and easy cloners and power

284
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:13,559
cloners are all really quite nice not

285
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,079
that I had a huge problem with uh the

286
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:18,838
cloning but I need something a little

287
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:21,278
more no-brainer with my setup and this

288
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,720
seems like it could potentially be it so

289
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,720
I mean really like all the products I

290
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,199
use this is really like a review Now

291
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,320
power cloner never sent this to me I

292
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:31,759
just went and bought one and uh

293
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,680
just realize there's this nice beautiful

294
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:38,519
coach behind me yeah take a load off

295
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,159
Johnny this is kind of the uh slow

296
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,078
arduous work you're getting that done

297
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,600
taken care of oh yeah yeah a

298
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,679
man this is great soon will have the

299
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,560
ability to rock 45 clones in the blank

300
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:55,120
of an eye the best part about is going

301
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:58,000
to be um they're just basically Roots

302
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,480
just water there'll be no pucks no dirt

303
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,120
so they can go into several different

304
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,600
systems actually all systems you can

305
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,000
transplant them into anything yeah

306
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,440
exactly that's what I like so it gives

307
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,720
us a chance to actually experiment a

308
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
little bit more too and have a little

309
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,720
bit more fun at the same time um really

310
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,639
learn

311
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,519
uh I haven't I haven't had the

312
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,360
opportunity of actually getting into one

313
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,078
of these and just uh felt like it wasn't

314
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,159
too much didn't need it don't don't need

315
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:27,519
to have that many yeah totally now it's

316
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:29,519
really for me it's about sharing no no I

317
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,959
find it's just more more convenience

318
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,799
well in the sharing you know here with

319
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:38,239
the commercial uh not commercial but the

320
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:40,278
mmpr or the mm how we are able to make

321
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,759
things work for us is that we are able

322
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,360
to you know John's able to bring me a

323
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,879
medic Kush and I'm able to say here

324
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,120
legal to Congo and Doc is able to show

325
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,480
up and say Here's a Harmony and a and a

326
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,159
Northern Lights these this is key that

327
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,720
we aren't uh supposed to mother out

328
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,879
every single strain that we want to have

329
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,600
access to because we need access to more

330
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,039
than one strain you know for me I I

331
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,000
think I'm a around the 30 strain you

332
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,759
know I like to have 20 to 30 strains

333
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,480
that's just what I like to have that's a

334
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:08,600
nice thing and

335
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,039
so and I'm sure there's people out there

336
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,120
that could literally use

337
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:15,319
more I mean when you think of the

338
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,278
incredible benef turns into this yeah I

339
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,680
know isn't that great yeah this is fun

340
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:22,399
John so I just put this little filter on

341
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:24,719
the end here so nothing else gets in

342
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,559
there if any Roots come off the bottom

343
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,879
they don't get stuck in the pump so it's

344
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,159
very important that you put the filter

345
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:33,799
on the pump too yes and they've already

346
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:35,919
wrapped it which is quite nice with um

347
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:38,679
sopan tape so it's actually already got

348
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,078
the water seal attached to it all right

349
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:41,799
I just did all of these perfectly

350
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,439
perfect there we go they're all pointing

351
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:46,359
in the arrows are all pointing in spin

352
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,199
this into

353
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,079
here oops don't need it anymore dropping

354
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:54,278
the tool dropping the

355
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,439
tool so is this supposed to point a

356
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:57,838
certain way when we're done here

357
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,600
actually hold up I was going to say I'm

358
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,839
going to go through the directions I'm

359
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,320
sure that's the next thing to do um

360
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,600
connect the pump to M make sure there's

361
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,720
a Teflon tape on the pump threads it's

362
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,839
there um slowly thread the pump into the

363
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,320
manifold hand tight and gently turn

364
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,759
clockwise until the pump is snug and

365
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,759
lines up with the short end of the

366
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,600
manifold you hold that there yep I'll

367
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,600
spin this perfectly give it a spin looks

368
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,240
like a microphone it does doesn't

369
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,360
mm so that is they said hand tight so

370
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,879
okay so what's gonna happen is it's

371
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,839
going to be like the cord's going to go

372
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:34,639
into here and this piece is going to go

373
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,120
right here okay so right now I guess

374
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,759
what it'll have to do is it'll have to

375
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,120
line up something like this the other

376
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,919
way we tting it up still so we can still

377
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,000
place the air pump on a stable surface

378
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,479
outside the reservoir all the air pump

379
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,318
yeah no problem there stones this is

380
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,879
simple simple this is great

381
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:55,559
p is going to be in here like this so

382
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,439
this will point the other way the other

383
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,359
way the other way the cord needs to go

384
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,399
on the other way yeah or you probably go

385
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,959
around one full more it's got quite a

386
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:06,759
bit of threading left so with watery

387
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:09,638
objects you always go more than less how

388
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,959
we doing is that doable right to there

389
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,600
perfect and that's probably how they

390
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:18,399
designed it cuz that's just

391
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,278
slick okay so there's your cord fits in

392
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,799
there perfectly we should actually just

393
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:23,240
show you how that just went in there yep

394
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:24,919
perfect there you go they got it all

395
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,480
lined up pretty good these guys are

396
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:28,078
pretty smart on their design a no

397
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,199
brainer here and then you've got your

398
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:34,519
cord basically goes into this little

399
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,120
guard and I guess that's next up is

400
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:40,360
going to be these

401
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,240
airs that's tight go down with all of it

402
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,360
I'll be able to pull it up if we need it

403
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:49,879
out perfect so there's that next

404
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,519
up next up install the manifold we've

405
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,679
done that this is sitting in here

406
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,360
perfect make sure the filter faces away

407
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,919
from the cord guide push down firmly to

408
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,199
seal seat the manifold into the

409
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,120
reservoir so sck that like really get it

410
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:04,798
stuck install the air pumps and

411
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,279
airstones so this is super easy crack

412
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,759
those bad boys

413
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,480
up look at this ni nice little sho got a

414
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:15,798
little this a nice single one power

415
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Corner seven Great there you go thank

416
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:20,400
you sir

417
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,599
so this should be one long cord perfect

418
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,679
so we're only going to use one of the

419
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,838
stones I don't believe we need two the

420
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,319
other filter that uses two has a double

421
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,839
here there's two holes so this one only

422
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,759
has the one

423
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,199
and so attach one AirStone to end of

424
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,119
tube and the air pump is to the other

425
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,558
end so you just attach one of those to

426
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,159
there and I'll attach this to here and

427
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,798
that's literally

428
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:45,160
done that's

429
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:45,160
it that's

430
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,160
it how exciting this is just coming

431
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,038
together quite nicely it's almost things

432
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,440
worth when we put things together oh

433
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:57,798
yeah we make a little mistake here there

434
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,360
but that's I think we're do going to

435
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:01,639
have to put this up put this into here

436
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,918
so the water doesn't Splash up yeah oh

437
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,080
yeah exactly that's why you go right to

438
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,080
the

439
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:15,798
bottom yeah the AirStone in there too

440
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,799
exactly I knew there was

441
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:25,399
two great these are quite nice little

442
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:27,000
Neo HS now I'm wondering if you just I

443
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,640
guess you would plant them each time or

444
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,319
you just take them out separately that's

445
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,080
wonderful you take them out you open it

446
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,839
up you P it out and then you rinse this

447
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,960
off and you put it

448
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:38,399
back and if you only want to have this

449
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,200
many you only have to have this many but

450
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,080
you have have all the holes filled or

451
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,919
the water sprays up of course that's

452
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:47,359
what I'm I'm now we learned that the

453
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,799
hard way at work and uh we came in the

454
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,038
next day and all the water was out of it

455
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:54,558
and it was all over the floor it sprays

456
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:56,960
like a mother doesn't it yeah yeah no no

457
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,879
it just starts leaking everywhere and

458
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,319
that was just because of leaving the the

459
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,400
few of these and it's why I'm using mine

460
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:06,119
in my office and so I'm going to put

461
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,720
this on top of a table and that table is

462
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:13,399
going to sit in top inside of a 4ot by

463
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,960
4ot basically a reservoir that way if it

464
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,440
does leak but you know what even if it

465
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,079
drops the whole thing I mean this is a

466
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,440
10 gon rest for us a lot of water it was

467
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:23,240
just us starting it out and since we did

468
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,919
that put all these in we had never had a

469
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,240
problem again yeah that's you it it was

470
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,240
just that one little if you read the

471
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,599
directions funny enough I bet you it's

472
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,960
in there ah you know what you know it's

473
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,158
probably literally right in there and

474
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,200
says make sure you put all the Pucks in

475
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:38,640
I think maybe they all out and then

476
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,038
someone took a couple out or something

477
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,559
happened where if you take these pucks

478
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:43,319
out they get water every well that's a

479
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:45,240
good tip to give people yeah so make

480
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,359
sure you always was there two extra uh

481
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,079
three oh I said 47 there was 48 I yeah I

482
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,558
was

483
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:56,000
close you were darn close that's quality

484
00:19:52,558 --> 00:20:00,639
closeness so boom shab

485
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,640
boom and our little Dome

486
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:03,558
and the one we have at work is

487
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,240
completely C2 it's pretty cool so I've

488
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:08,558
never actually seen this type of model

489
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,679

532
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,278

533
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,200
you

534
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:04,640
really most of the work right here these

535
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,319
poles are really yeah just lining them

536
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,320
up and getting them

537
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,559
all that

538
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,559
it s for the

539
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,600
bottom all right I would have loved to

540
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,559
have swept the garage but I think it'll

541
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,678
be

542
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:26,839
okay we kind of know what we're doing

543
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,200
this time around kind of know what we're

544
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:32,519
doing nothing another a little bit out

545
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,240
of the way here this thing is completely

546
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,679
like

547
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,880
already did the other one come like this

548
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,080
oh yes it's

549
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,799
awesome oh yeah

550
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:46,319
right the bottom it's got the H so we

551
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:47,918
just have to open it up which I believe

552
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:52,720
we opened up the

553
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:55,600
bottom last time the bottom the bottom

554
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:00,440
yeah which goes all the way up to here

555
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,439
which is the here down there follow

556
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:10,200
right there open it

557
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,640
up yeah you got

558
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:17,400
zipper

559
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:21,240
okay zipper on that this one it goes

560
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:24,200
down to here perfect there we

561
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:28,240
go all right here we

562
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,759
go open this bad boy up all the way

563
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,319
around

564
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:38,319
around and this is what we did last time

565
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:42,798
just socks in all right no socks just no

566
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,798
shoes sh to cover the plumber

567
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,480
TR these

568
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:58,879
ones these were our top these our M

569
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:03,000
that'll be horrible sound one two for

570
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,600
camera ending four all right one two

571
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,919
what do we got for Corners

572
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:11,199
here already laid them up so we have the

573
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,159
ones that go the top the back here our

574
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,840
eyes and now put those hes across the

575
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:18,240
back directly across here right here

576
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:22,240
like going like this yeah okay so one

577
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:25,519
that's what it says here I I I I

578
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,640
perfect and and the A's are 1 2 3 four

579
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:31,960
exactly perfect so I guess best first

580
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,320
things to do is to connect the eye to a

581
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,319
corner

582
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,640
slot then we have

583
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:43,960
two well that's it so this is probably a

584
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:45,440
good idea a skirt that goes inside I use

585
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,679
this on my other one and it's best if

586
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,798
you put the frame in the bottom of the

587
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,960
skirt rather than try to put the skirt

588
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,119
in afterwards frame there you go yeah

589
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,960
want to put the skirt in there that's

590
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,678
just what I noticed last time so you get

591
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,200
the skirt laid down

592
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,360
get all this stuff lifted up so we're

593
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,360
not hiding crucial

594
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:19,918
components um it goes the other way

595
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:23,079
actually yeah it does from the velcro I

596
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,440
almost always do things the opposite way

597
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:27,798
as what they go the first time but I

598
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,519
guess as long as you get it right in the

599
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:32,918
end it's really all that

600
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:34,480
matters right see the velro on the

601
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:36,330
inside of the pieces and the corners

602
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,430
that the PS will go

603
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:39,429
[Music]

604
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,720
around

605
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:54,440
right all right so pull that into place

606
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:56,918
kind of makes it a little bit easier

607
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,919
even doesn't

608
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,359
it

609
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,159

you're going to have a bit of a harder

636
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,278
time I guess that's not connected yet

637
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:32,479

640
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:45,240
a a bit of a tough nut it's going to be

641
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,678
really tough seemingly is impossible

642
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,599
unless you can pull on that as hard as

643
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:52,679

side over on this side here I'm going to

835

have a two times XL Dominator and so

836
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:48,759
this whole side of the tent will be

837
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:49,920
Dominator that side will be HPS and

838
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,960
right in the middle we'll get a little

839
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,159
combination of the two so we mounting

840
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,639
our fans in the corners yeah let's mount

841
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:59,879
a fan or two into the corner and

842
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:02,318
yeah let's Mount one right into that

843
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,280
corner and then let's um let's fill this

844
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:05,639
tent with plants let's get some plants I

845
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,960
think there's two right there there is a

846
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:10,078
couple right there uh congales and Barb

847
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,920
so we'll get to

848
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,680
that all right guys so we were just

849
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,519
about to throw the 10 plants that are

850
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:19,239
going into the tent that we just built

851
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:21,280
and we decided you know it's best um to

852
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:23,199
put these in in a 3 gallon pot rather

853
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,880
than a two I'm not looking to stretch

854
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,519
them out Beyond stretch out but I really

855
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,880
believe in the power of the roots having

856
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:30,119
somewhere to go right before you put

857
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,760
them into bloom it really gives that

858
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:34,680
plant a happy beginning so yeah just

859
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,079
pull off the Barb tag there buddy there

860
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:39,118

861
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,440

862
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,119

864
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,480

865
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,119

some uh nice cocoa fiber and PR

869
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,720
mix that John had me doing when he first

870
00:37:56,358 --> 00:38:00,440

871
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,719
right

872
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,480

buddy yeah nice drop it in oh perfect I

875
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,159
like the way the sides fell apart and

876
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:16,480
filled in the bottom

877
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:18,039
hole I think he looks like we were

878
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,159
professionals he almost looks like we

879
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:21,119
know what we're doing here it almost

880
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:23,598
looks like we know what we're doing here

881
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,318
all right so yeah usually with the sides

882
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,480
you got to do this whole finger thing

883
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:28,679
but these are pretty much packed already

884

1093
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:05,720
sobly don't have to put too too much in

1094
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:07,759
here with these little guys suspect they

1096
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,760
there for that guy let's see what we got

1097
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:16,558
with Harmony same

1098
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,720
same so one two SS yeah you could

1099
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,800
probably use even a little bit more

1100
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:20,679
you'll see that they're a little bit

1101
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,160
lower than

1102
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:26,358
anticipated all right so this one is the

1103
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:28,719
harmony oh I always got paper in there

1104
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:32,199
that's interesting in huh I'm going to

1105
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:33,679
take it off think the roots kind of

1106
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:36,480
they're not really grown into it very

1107
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:38,318
well that's for sure little bit of Chunk

1108
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,519
right there it's organic matter it's

1109
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:41,679
okay yeah just I'm going to do the my

1110
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:43,159
little I want I don't want to worry

1111
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:45,000
about any rot these roots are a little

1112
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:46,399
bit uh a little bit Brown they look like

1113
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,318
they could use a lot of

1114
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:52,720
Loven so mine are nice and wet yeah this

1115
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:55,039
one's very wet as

1116
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,759
well oh I got a really high

1117
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,759
concentration of cocoa this time around

1118
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,079
if you've noticed on my material there

1119
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:05,119
yeah I really loaded it up I think it's

1120
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:07,720
maybe even like 40 to 50% there you go

1121
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,960
yeah got to experiment and play yeah

1122
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:10,759
well I like the idea of having better

1123
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,798
drainage there's nothing wrong with that

1124
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,079
in my opinion the best part about it you

1125
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:17,759
got to be able to get everything in and

1126
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:20,160
out all right

1127
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,839

NL medic cush what's that medic cush

1144
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,039
medic

1145
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,558
cush we like the medic cush nice and

1146
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:16,759
little root B there we got white roots

1147
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,920
in the bottom this one brown too though

1148
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:22,119
eh yeah jeez we really got to get these

1149
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,480
roots healthier well you know what this

1150
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:28,440
has been in this one gon pot for like 3

1151
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,838
months Oreo that's what so high should

1152
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,039
been transplanted here and you can see

1153
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:32,599
the purple stock it was a little

1154
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,358
stressed because all those roots were

1155
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:37,440
all bound up in the bottom yep yep so

1156
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:38,838
maybe that's why the paper's in there

1157
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,679
maybe that's why might be a trick we

1158
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:42,400
should ask him about that yeah I mean I

1159
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:44,558
don't know about it myself so that's why

1160
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,599
I'm releasing it I just try to keep it

1161
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,359
real simple I know what I know and it's

1162
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:51,079
kind of a simple sort of method which is

1163
00:50:48,358 --> 00:50:52,400
just I'm curious I've never seen that

1164
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:55,000
and there must be a reason to it that

1165
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,240
this Dr Atomic so yeah well you know

1166
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,440
when you do something for 30 or 40 years

1167
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:01,838
sometimes that's the

1168
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,559
reason that just might be the reason you

1169
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:05,199
know it seems like it worked and I've

1170
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:06,760
been doing it for 20 or 30 years we'll

1171
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:08,838
ask the doc we'll get him on camera and

1172
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:11,280
we'll find out what his what his

1173
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:13,880
reasoning is with paper secret of the

1174
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,559
paper yes I mean it's hard to say if

1175
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,838
this plant was healthier looking I would

1176
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:19,359
maybe believe that it was doing

1177
00:51:16,838 --> 00:51:21,480
something good but the plant is a little

1178
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:23,279
bit sickly it's stressed beyond belief

1179
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,159
it's producing only three levers if

1180
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,960
you've

1181
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,759
noticed there's not actually many five

1182
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,720
or seven levers on the plant but we'll

1183
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,119
get it back to health we're going to

1184
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:34,759
bring it back real nice I'm super

1185
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,000
excited to have it in this

1186
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:40,839
stable so there's the NL there we go

1187
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,039

1188
