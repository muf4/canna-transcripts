2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,879
there is going to be a post Forum event

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,560

5
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:32,519

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,920
to be at the Blackbird Public House

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,520
which is at 905 dunsmir so it's a couple

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,239
blocks away so I will say that again

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,480
because I'm sure no one remember what I

10
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,199
just

11
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,479
said um as well I'm sure you'll notice

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,399
that we don't have any representation

13
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,119
here from Vancouver Council and we did

14
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,198
invite them to come but unfortunately

15
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,718
because of the consultation process that

16
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,280
they're in right now they can't come to

17
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,600
events they can only come to their own

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,198
consultation that's not my rule but

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,359
that's they received so they did want to

20
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,359

38
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,759
moderated by the beautiful Hillary black

39
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,239
um so that you don't have to look at me

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,079
for much longer so I'm going to start

41
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,319
out by introducing our first speaker so

42
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,038

46
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,839

00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,560
person in this

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,360

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,039
stuff he's been suffering from new daily

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,400

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,280
therapies and interventions Jonathan

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,680

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,878
marijuana he has received much media

58
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,519
insurance coverage and I believe you're

59
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,920
the first in Canada to get that sort of

60
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,120
coverage so awesome um in December 2014

62
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,318
found in December 2014 he founded a

66
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,239

67
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,330
challenges associated with the mmpr

68
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,180

00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:22,079
being U making it possible for me to be

75
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,360
here on April 22nd 2007 at the age of 14

76
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,959
I woke up with a headache today at the

77
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,120
age of 22 I woke up with that exact same

78
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,239
headache this constant unremitting

79
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,200
neurolog condition known as New daily

80
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,480
persistent headache is said to be one of

81
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,079
the toughest pain conditions to treat at

82
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,079
first the headache was so sensitive to

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,120
noise I could barely leave the house and

84
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,599
was forced to drop out of grade eight my

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,239
high school experience consisted of

86
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,238
going to a school where I worked

87
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,438
one-on-one with a teacher and would go

88
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,959
straight back home to put it simply I

89
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:52,239
had no quality of

90
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,878
life even though there were no known

91
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,519
treatments or cares doctors prescrib me

92
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,840
48 off Lael prescription Pharmaceuticals

93
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,640
as well as multiple other interventions

94
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,920
I had heard medical marijuana could be

95
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,438
useful for people in chronic pain and

96
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,919
with migraines but there was no evidence

97
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:10,479
of it working for my condition on top of

98
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,839
that I was young so Physicians were

99
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,158
unwilling to hear me out after moving to

100
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,238
waterl Ontario for University I decided

101
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:18,839
to give marijuana better try and obtain

102
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,879
it from dealers and for the purpose of

103
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,239
treating my headache in some weeks my

104
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,800
dealer would have strains that helped

105
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,319
tremendously but he would run out of

106
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,840
them the next week and I couldn't rely

107
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,279
on this illegal source of access for my

108
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,079
medication I heard stories in the news

109
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,159
about the introduction of the marijuana

110
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,758
for medical purpose regulations B mmpr

111
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,840
and waited until April 2014 to find a

112
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,439
physician who would be willing to

113
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:44,719
prescribe on April 22nd 2014 my

114
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,199
seven-year headache anniversary I

115
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,520
received my first prescription for

116
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,720
medical marijuana I initially struggled

117
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:52,799
with access through the mm and found my

118
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,320
original licensed producer unable to

119
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,560
supply enough medicine to all of their

120
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,279
registered patients my physician left

121
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,280
his practice and transferring to another

122
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,918
licensed producer was under the mm

123
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,918
around the same time I realized my bills

124
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,599
for medical marijuana were adding up to

125
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,599
be more expensive than any student could

126
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,400
reasonbly afford the 48 drugs I tried

127
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,560
before receiving medical marijuana cost

128
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,758
me nothing out of pocket as my two

129
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,639
Health Plans paid for them with no

130
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,520
questions asked even though medical

131
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,918
marijuana was cheaper than many of these

132
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,799
drugs it personally was costing me much

133
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,560
more money after making a few calls I

134
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,960
quickly became aware that insurance

135
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,759
company staff had no idea about coverage

136
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,680
of medical Marana they said that because

137
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,199
it had no drug identification number

138
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,000
they couldn't add it on to their plant

139
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,319
access to medical marijuana is our right

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,478
but it seemed like few patients

141
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,039
including myself were able to pay for

142
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:45,680
this right I was submitted a restricted

143
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,240
drug use form to the University of

144
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,840
waterl students Health Plan committee

145
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,960
initially they were completely opposed

146
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,758
to the idea of covering medical

147
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,239
marijuana for a student but after some

148
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,800
convincing they agreed to a meeting I

149
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,160
came back to the meeting prepared with a

150
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,120
speech and evidence to back up my claims

151
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,280
the evidence included studies on medical

152
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,800
marijuana and chronic pain a sleep study

153
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,079
report showing clinical signs of

154
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,680
improvement while on medical marijuana

155
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,120
and letters of support from various

156
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,038
Healthcare practitioners the next six

157
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,519
months were full of emails calls

158
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,478
promises and disappointments I had to

159
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,240
convince the health plan committee that

160
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:20,680
medical marijuana was an affordable drug

161
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,879
that should be treated like any other

162
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,918
prescription that is typically covered

163
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,519
this past December the university health

164
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,478
insurance committee finally came to the

165
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,439
conclusion that medical marijuana should

166
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,399
be treated like other prescription

167
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:34,639
pharmaceutical drugs and decided to

168
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,079
cover it under the Student Health Plan

169
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,360
through sound Life

170
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,680
Financial when analyzing the case the

171
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,000
university looked at three things cost

172
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,879
use and public response they thought the

173
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,639
cost of medical obtained from licensed

174
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,000
producers was not only reasonable but

175
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,918
inexpensive compared to other

176
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,519
pharmaceutical drugs the school

177
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,198
concluded that my medical marijuana

178
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,198
would be beneficial to my academic

179
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,639
success they realized that the reaction

180
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,720
by other students and the public could

181
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,000
be perceived in a negative way but they

182
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,680
decided to me and in the end my peers in

183
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,639
the community were unquestionably

184
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,598
supportive I was ecstatic that the

185
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,160
Student Union agree to coverage but at

186
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:10,560
the same time I knew many other people

187
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,479
under the mmpr were struggling to afford

188
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,839
their medication in my heart I knew it

189
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:15,399
wasn't right that they people were

190
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,159
choosing between buying their medicine

191
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,519
and their groceries I decided to start a

192
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,439
federal nonprofit patients rights group

193
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,878
called Canadians for fair access to

194
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:28,120
medical marijuana or C cam for short

195
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,160
since the insurance story was featured

196
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,319
in National media C and my cost in cost

197
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,599
coverage advocacy work has taken off

198
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,680
patients across the country have

199
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:38,839
contacted me and many of their cases are

200
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,319
looking quite promising this silent

201
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,799
revolution of medical marijuana

202
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,639
insurance coverage is just at the

203
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,240
beginning the cases that I'm helping

204
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,800
with will set precedent for many other

205
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,400
patient categories such as union workers

206
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,240
and disability recipients by working

207
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,758
with various supportive organizations

208
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,360
like till and lift we will work towards

209
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,520
getting medical marijuana treated like

210
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,720
any other prescription I also serve on

211
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,839
vedric patient Advisory Board run by

212
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,440
Hillary black which is a useful tool

213
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:07,359
that allows patients to get feedback to

214
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:09,279
their LP Z is also working with ra

215
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,879
capler and Philip Lucas on merging some

216
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,519
of their resources from their old

217
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,280
organization Canadians for safe access

218
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,279
with our website Albert Einstein once

219
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,279
said it's not that I'm so smart it's

220
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,839
just that I stay with problems longer I

221
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,559
think the key to success for patients

222
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,878
going through the insurance coverage is

223
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,000
persistence you have to respect the

224
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,280
system but can't let it hold you back

225
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,200
some patients aren aw their own Advocate

226
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,079
and that's where cfam comes in by

227

229
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,319
resources we're working on building for

230
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,918
patients like you I look forward to

231
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,680
seeing and being part of a healthare

232
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,958
system that supports medical marijuana

233
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:50,199
patients by working together I'm sure we

234
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,199
can make this happen thank

235
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,120
you thank you

236
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:08,559

hear from Jonathan it really U you know

254
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:31,480
makes me remember why we're all doing

255
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,839
this um thank you to left for organizing

256
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,278
this event it's really privileged to be

257
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,320
here um my name is Emily Kirkham and I'm

258
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:44,600
VP of laboratory operations at signon

259
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,720
Corporation so we are consultants in the

260
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,240
medical marijuana field for quality

261
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,560
control and analytical chemistry I

262
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,278
promise there's not going to be any

263
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:58,000
molecular formulas in this presentation

264
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:59,799
so worries you want those later so I'm

265
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,799
just going to talk a littleit

266
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:05,799
uh the testing requirements for marijana

267
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:09,078
what uh what's what's required right now

268
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:11,519
under the M PR and what we might need

269
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:14,239
might see in the future coming down the

270
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,799
road um there many of you probably are

271
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,720
aware there's requirements right now for

272
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:22,399
testing for potency uh we have to label

273
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,240
all the the products for sale for

274
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,919
percentage of THC percentage of CBD a

275
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,600
lot of people test for potency they'll

276
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:33,799
actually look at a lot canid but they're

277
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,680
only required to show the THC and the

278
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:38,240
CBD percentages right

279
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,719
now microbiology of course is also

280
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,480
required uh and that's a a pretty big

281
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,680
concern for a lot of The Producers out

282
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,480
there uh the the requirements are pretty

283
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:49,679
stringent under the mmpr so it's a very

284
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,360
important aspect certainly for patient

285
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,719
health and safety as well heavy metals

286
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,440
that's a it's a unique test uh we don't

287
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,480
see that getting tested in a lot of

288
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,480
other jurisdictions and countries

289
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,159
pretty expensive as well whether you

290
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,360
choose to do it yourself or get it

291
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:09,240
tested at a third party

292
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,120
laboratory under the mmpr uh the

293
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,720
regulations stipulate that we cannot use

294
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,959
any pesticides uh in the growing process

295
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,839
so some producers will choose to test

296
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,479
for pesticides uh some others will say

297
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,560
well we don't use pesticides we're not

298
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,639
allowed to we're not going to test for

299
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,399
it um that's a precedent that's present

300
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,959
in the pharmaceutical industry as well

301
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,480
so it is that could change in the future

302
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,919
though that there could be a requirement

303
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,039
for pesticide testing moving forward so

304
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:41,799
what are we going to see for added on

305
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,958
tests in the future uh well there's in

306
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:46,078
in a lot of jurisdictions in the states

307
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,719
where the recreational use there is like

308
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,799
methodologies that have to be used for

309
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,839
potency testing whether it's hplc or GC

310
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:56,278
or a certain pharmacopea method a lot of

311
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,720
producers are already testing the tpin

312
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:02,120
and as those those compounds link to

313
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,160
more medical effects for patients that

314
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,320
may become a requirement as well of

315
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:10,278
course if we get into extracts uh other

316
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,879
products if that becomes part of the

317
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:14,799
mmpr then we're going to need to test

318
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:18,559
for residual solvents uh and the Edibles

319
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:22,278
and concentrates as well so one thing at

320
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:24,518
signo that we often get asked about is

321
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:26,720
um you what is the difference between

322
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,480
testing with a third party laboratory

323
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,600
versus building your own inhouse

324
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,560
Laboratory right now both are valid

325
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,320
approaches um it's very costly to test

326
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:39,399
outside on a third party laboratory

327
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,800
depending on how many strains and how

328
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,360
much product you're producing you could

329
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,519
be spending upwards of $110,000 a month

330
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,159
so that's a ongoing cost that you have

331
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,440
to incur and you're you're required to

332
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,879
do that U but it does divert the

333
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,480
liability from having that testing done

334
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,759
in house uh if you build your own lab

335
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,399
though you have complete control over

336
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:02,399
what you're doing you can have access to

337
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,839
that tting facility anytime you like um

338
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,078
so you can get you know up to-date

339
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,199
numbers on potency and micro so you have

340
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:13,439
an idea of what's going on your facility

341
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:15,159
right away so it can be very beneficial

342
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,000
uh to take that approach of course

343
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:20,078
there's also high cost upfront cost to

344
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,198
applying all this equipment getting it

345
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,719
installed setting it up Staffing

346
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:27,599
training and Method

347
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,240
validation so the third party testing

348
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,480
also may be re in the future so it's not

349
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,639
right now but that they may actually say

350
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,079
that a lot of states in the US have

351
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,560
stipulated that as well so there's a lot

352
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,719
of different things to

353
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:44,198
consider so a little bit about the

354
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,240
science of testing and what's required

355
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:49,278
um we have a table outside so if you

356
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,639
guys have any questions or want to come

357

hardworking and uh absolutely gorgeous

389
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,759
people who work so hard to medical

390
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,399
Canabis access uh possible for

391
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,639
critically and chronically old Canadians

392
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,360
so I'd like to begin by acknowledging

393
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,480
that I'm currently employed as VP of

394
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,318
patient research and services for till

395
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,759
which is a federally authorized medical

396
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:46,278
cannabis production company located in N

397
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,039
BC uh however it was not employed for

398
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:50,240
till Ray during the planning data

399
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:51,599
Gathering or analysis the camp study the

400
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,879
results of which I'm going to share with

401
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,278
you

402
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,600
today I want to start out with a brief

403
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,759
history of medical cannabis in Canada um

404
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,800
this program and and did not come around

405
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:05,599
because any of our major parties um

406
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:07,720
wanted to do something compassionate for

407
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,639
predicting chronically old Canadians it

408
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,640
came around because patients stood up uh

409
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,520
for their rights to uh gain access to

410
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,199
this medicine without fear of arrest and

411
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,400
prosecution the two main uh court cases

412
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,640
that led to the establishment of theic

413
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,319
marijuana program were spearheaded by

414
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:28,600
Terry Parker and Jim wford an MS patient

415
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:33,480
and a person suffering from HIV AIDS and

416
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:34,798
um in about 1990 20 or 1999 and 2000

417
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,319
they were able to establish a

418
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:40,000
constitutional right to choose cannabis

419
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,918
as a medicine in uh 2001 in response to

420
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,119
those Court decisions uh Health Canada

421
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,759
establish the medical marijuana access

422
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:48,479
regulations and Survey suggests that

423
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,240
about a million Canadians currently

424
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,038
claim to be using cannabis for medical

425
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,359
purposes and yet there's only about

426
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:56,558
50,000 people in the federal medical

427
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,359
marijuana program so overwhelmingly

428
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,960
medical cannabis patients in Canada are

429
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:02,558
not of program therefore therefore not

430
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,120
protect it from arrest and prosecution

431
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:07,480
and um there have been uh a lot of

432
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,599
problems with the program uh initially

433
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,440
it was a long and complex application

434
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,719
process there was a lack of uptake on a

435
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,400
very limited and poor quality Supply in

436
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,038
fact uh the supply the original Supply

437
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,559
was $5 a gr and and yet less fewer than

438
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:25,158
10% of patients were accessing that that

439
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,720
Supply under the old M there was a lot

440
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:28,080
of resistance from Gatekeepers with

441
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,159
warnings from the Kenan Medical

442
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:33,279
Association and the cmpa their Ure

443
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,320
against prescribing medical cannabis and

444
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,480
the program as a result of all this was

445
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:38,839
found unconstitutional at least 10 times

446
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,519
in as many

447
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:45,879
years after an extended consultation

448
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:49,759
period in uh March 31st 2014 the mm

449
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,960
ended and was replaced by the mmpr uh

450
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,679
which started in April 1st

451
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,159
2014 um this major policy overhaul

452
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,440
represents a significant

453
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:01,360
decentralization of the federal program

454
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,519
and Canada now acts as a regulator

455
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,519
rather than its previous role as a

456
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,679
provider of medical Canabis leaving

457
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,599
Service delivery largely in the hands of

458
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,360
large scale licensed producers and and

459
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,079
privately owned or publicly traded

460
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,918
commercial

461
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:19,038
companies the new mmpr is a significant

462
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,240
improvement over the old mme in many

463
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,798
ways there's now a simplified and

464
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,759
decentralized application process under

465
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:28,440
the old program it was a 33 page

466
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:31,319
application it would take six weeks to

467
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,519
months mon to process and under the new

468
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,158
system you can go see your doctor today

469
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,599
have him fill out a onepage form and

470
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:39,559
walk out of his office as a legal

471
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:41,599
medical marijuana user um theoretically

472
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:43,558
nurse practitioners can prescribe I say

473
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,439
theoretically because there isn't a

474
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,480
province yet that has approved nurse

475
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,038
practitioners describing but it is part

476
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,798
of the mnpr that they would be

477
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:54,440
considered as a uh as an alternative to

478
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:56,079
just Physicians being able to prescribe

479
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,919
um right now there's multiple licensed

480
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,038
producers rather than a single producer

481
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,720
producing a sing strain as a result

482
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:03,839
there's a few hundred strains available

483
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,919
to patients so strain selection has

484
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,879
improved considerably there's a

485
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,320
significant quality control which was

486
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,480
just touched on by Emily um there's

487
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:16,720
mandated lab testing for Purity and uh

488
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,480
for uh for potency and there's also an

489
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,720
increased strain symptom awareness with

490
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,279
a lot of licensed producers now uh

491
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,400
teaming with Physicians academic

492
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,519
institutions to provide and and produce

493
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,840
research on medical Canabis however

494
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,279
there are other changes that have had a

495
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,158
much more negative on some patients

496
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,480
there's the loss of personal production

497
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,000
for patients that uh took place um I'll

498
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,880
talk a bit about the court case in a

499
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
minute uh currently there's a lack of

500
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,720
alternatives to Raw cannabis there's no

501
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,960
oils tincture Sals Etc available and um

502
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,319
and there's still no front no

503
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,159
storefronts or Community Based access uh

504
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:53,480
that's ferally allowed under the

505
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,640
mmpr as a result there are currently two

506
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,640
significant core challenges the mmpr the

507
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,520
Allard and the Smith case um ultimately

508
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,559
the availability of alternatives to rock

509
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:06,359
cannabis is something that both patients

510
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:07,960
and healthare providers are calling for

511
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,158
and it's likely subject to both Court

512
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,840
decisions like the Smith case recently

513
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,200
here in the Supreme Court as well as

514
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,599
deliberate policy decisions um And in

515
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,120
regards to the right to patients to

516
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:20,319
produce their own medicine there's there

517
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,359
that's also currently in the hands of

518
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,359
the courts with a decision expected

519
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:26,558
later this year no matter what the

520
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:28,319
outcome the outed case would likely be

521
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,240
appealed to the Supreme Court by the

522
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,079
Govern or the patients who initiated

523
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,400
this court proceeding as for storefronts

524
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:36,839
it's really interesting to note that

525
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,720
since the launch of the mmpr uh there's

526
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:41,359
been a proliferation of dispensaries in

527
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,880
areas where reinforcement has not been a

528
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:47,558
community priority with Vancouver alone

529
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,559
now quite famously going from over uh

530
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:52,000
from fewer than 10 Community Based

531
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:54,639
dispensaries three years ago to over 80

532
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,960
today I had a chance to pass by quite a

533
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,320
few of them today on way the town it's

534
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,038
certainly chase a landscape despite

535
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,759
these ongoing challenges to the federal

536
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,960
program the mmpr presents a tightly

537
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,919
regulated system that's complex it's

538
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,519
novel and it's unlike anything else in

539
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,880
the world today ultimately like the mmaa

540
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,759
that preceded it the mmpr will likely

541
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,200
evolve over time in response to both

542
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,839
core challenges and feedback by key

543
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,840
stakeholders and as such this should

544
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,639
really be viewed as a starting point

545
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,918
rather than a final policy on medical

546
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,960
canas access in Canada so far there are

547
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,159
approximately 20 companies licensed to

548
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,000
produce

549
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,480
uh and distribute cannabis in Canada and

550
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,240
uh and a handful more with parcial

551
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,400
licenses allowing them to produce uh but

552
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,798
not yet distributed these privately

553
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,159
owned or publicly traded companies act

554
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,558
as both the pharmaceutical company in

555
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:47,200
developing the drug product and and as

556
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:49,519
the pharmacy in distributing it directly

557
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,319
to patients which is kind of an unusual

558
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,158
relationship um I'd like to take you on

559
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:54,759
a brief tour of my employer till R you

560
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,400
can get a sense of the size scope and

561
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:59,038
the sophistication of a Fally authorized

562
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,159
liced producer

563
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:06,158
so we're located in an NC in a 60,000 ft

564
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,840
uh facility in an industrial area this

565
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,360
is what it looked like when I started in

566
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:12,038
February of

567
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,158
2014 and over the last year we've seen

568
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:18,278
quite a change that's our vault being

569
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,760
built it's 8 in C concrete on 6 in uh

570
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:22,720
rebar um here's one of our production

571
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,798
rooms in construction and this is what

572
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,519
it looks like when it's uh when it's

573
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,440
finished out without plants in it I'd

574
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:30,440
love to show you plants but Health C do

575
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,120
um that's a view into the Vault and uh

576
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,960
through one of our

577
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:39,239
hallways and over here you can get a

578
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,519
better sense of the tail R facility in

579
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,839
terms of um the size and scope of what

580
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,798
we're talking about' about 32 uh

581
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:49,079
production rooms in operation right now

582
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:50,720
about 35,000 plants in total in those uh

583
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:53,639
in the facility as it

584
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,079
stands that's a picture of our first uh

585
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,440
member she's uh our first patient her

586
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,119
name is Maria she's a former RCMP offic

587
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,000
officer and she uses cannabis in the

588
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:05,558
treatment of uh both chronic pain and

589
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,159
PTSD um she says it changed her life

590
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:08,480
because allowed her to give up all the

591
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:10,440
prescription opas that we're really

592
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,519
having negative impact on

593
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:16,919
her um the mmpr authorizes us to form

594
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,720
and other LPS to perform uh all of the

595
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,640
following activities so we can basically

596
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,400
produce from seed all the way up to uh

597
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,360
to shipping and uh we can also perform

598
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,559
some testing and some R&amp;D development as

599
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:34,278
well so in in summary um we've got a

600
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:36,079
65,000 ft facility with about 34,000 ft

601
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:39,079
of production space that's been

602
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:42,158
investment of over $25 million we

603
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:43,599
currently have an employee 178,000

604
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,520
full-time employees we're the fourth

605
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:49,639
biggest employer in IMO and um we've

606
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,359
contributed significantly local tax base

607
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,080
and in fact we just one my invting

608
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,558
business of the Year award by the

609
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:58,558
Chamber of

610
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,558
Commerce unsurprising

611
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:07,480
it's that time isn't it um and finally T

612
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,398
currently has over 50 strains of

613
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,240
cannabis available for National and

614
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:12,719
international research including a

615
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,000
number of high CBD strains and we're

616
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,200
teaming with Canadian International

617
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,038
researchers to supply or initiate

618
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,720
clinical trials examining paent patterns

619
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:24,798
of use strain symptom correlations and

620
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,519
the impact of cannabis of different

621
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,879
chemical compositions on a number of

622
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,319
chronic conditions for example till has

623
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,600
partnered with the University of British

624
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,079
Columbia to conduct a phase 2 clinical

625
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:35,879
trial examining the therapeutic

626
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,678
potential of cannabis and the treatment

627
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,520
of PTSD uh that will focus on military

628
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:43,480
and police veterans and victims of

629
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:45,240
violent sexual assault it's the biggest

630
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,880
uh clinical trial on medical cannabis

631
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,720
that's taken place in Canada over 30

632
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,520
years we're very excited to get it

633
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,960
started additionally we currently have

634
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:55,440
studies on the use of high CBD cannabis

635
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,798
oil and the treatment of pediatric and

636
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,798
adult epilepsy under development in in

637
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,720
New York state we've just been short

638
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:06,720
listed for a pediatric epilepsy study in

639
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,960
uh in Sydney Australia we have other

640
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,519
research projects focus on cancer pain

641
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,200
HIV AIDS and patient patterns of use and

642
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,278
they're all the preliminary stages of

643
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,200
cooperation with a number of academic

644
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,440
institutions and research organizations

645
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,360
while these the results from these

646
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,360
studies are still to come I'd like to

647
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,398
present some historical data on the

648
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,119
Canadian patient population stemming

649
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:30,759
from the Canadian access for medical

650
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:33,319
purposes surve known as camps camps is

651
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:35,079
the largest polling of medical cannabis

652
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,879
uh patients to date the principal

653
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:40,480
investigator of the study is uh Dr Zach

654
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,159
Walsh and his research was reviewed and

655
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,720
approved by the behavioral research

656
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,880
ethics board at the University of

657
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,319
British Columbia uh camps is a 414

658
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,200
question cross-sectional survey that was

659
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:54,720
available online in writing and in

660
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,600
person in 2011 and 2012 and so it

661
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,159
predates the implementation of the mmpr

662
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,119
so all this data as prepr you'll see

663
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,880
that at some good results the study

664
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,959
gathered detailed information on

665
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,200
demographics medical conditions and

666
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,798
symptoms and patterns of cannabis use

667
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,120
from 628 self-identified Canadian

668
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,038
medical cannabis

669
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:16,479
patients I think a lot of people in this

670
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:18,519
room took the serve uh in regards to

671
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,759
demographics comparisons to the sample

672
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:25,319
to values drawn from the Canadian 2006

673
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:27,919
census population indicated that Nails

674
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,359
whites and aboriginals participants were

675
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,480
over representative in the uh survey

676
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:35,158
population medical cannabis patients

677
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,679
were also younger had a higher income

678
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:38,320
were more likely to have completed High

679
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:41,519
School than the average Canadian and

680
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,359
much much better looking and okay the

681
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,359
last one I'm making out but it does all

682
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:47,240
fly in the face a little bit about the

683
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,158
the um some of the stereotypes around

684
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,000
who uses medical cannabis when you see

685
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:53,840
these this population generally higher

686
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,720
educated generally higher income uh than

687
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,639
the Canadian

688
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,558
population uh the history of therapeutic

689
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,880
cannabis use prior to therapeutic use

690
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:06,960
was reported by 82% of participants um

691
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,559
the mean age for first use was 17 which

692
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,399
is actually higher than the Canadian

693
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:14,960
average of 15 or 16 years old um and the

694
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,678
first therapeutic use was 28 years old

695
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,600
on average so you can see the medical

696
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,278
cannabis patients clearly differentiate

697
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:21,678
between the recreational use patterns

698
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:24,440
and the medical

699
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,120
use um most participants who reported

700
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,480
prior use reported increased use with

701
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:33,479
the initiation therapeutic use 33%

702
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,839
reported a large increase 32% a small

703
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,839
increase 7% reported a large decrease

704
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:42,879
and 10% a small decrease aggregate

705
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:46,000
analyst uh analysis indicated that 40%

706
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,559
of participants used reported using more

707
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,599
than 14 gram per week and of those

708
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:54,000
reporting higher use the medium weekly

709
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:56,879
amount was 28 GR in terms of frequency

710
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,960
of use 42% of participants use Canabis

711
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,399
two to three times per day

712
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,440
when asked what the preferred method of

713
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:07,158
use were was 45% preferred smoking 33%

714
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,480
preferred vaporization and 21% for to

715
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:11,720
eat whirling chest canas and fused

716
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,798
products camps also presented an

717
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,839
opportunity to examine how legit

718
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:17,839
legitimate access to cannabis might

719
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,158
affect the use of other lit and other

720
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,558
and elicit psychoactive substances which

721
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,039
is an area that I've been researching

722
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:25,960
for a number of years now this concept

723
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:28,278
which is known as cannabis substitution

724
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,440
effect reflects the conscious un

725
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:32,278
conscious use of cannabis as an

726
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,278
alternative to Pharmaceuticals to

727
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:37,359
alcohol use and to ilicit substances and

728
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,519
as such it has significant Public Health

729
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,519
implications the camp study found that

730
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:45,558
87% of patients reported substituting

731
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:48,558
cannabis for one or more of alcohol elcd

732
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:50,278
drugs or prescription drugs with 36%

733
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:53,119
reporting substitution for a single

734
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:56,119
class of substance 25% substituting for

735
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:58,719
two and 26% substituting for all three

736
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:00,558
of these substances exam by class of

737
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,278
drug identified substitution for

738
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:07,558
prescription drugs as the most common at

739
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:10,798
80% followed by Al 52% and finally

740
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:12,440
elicit substances with 32% substitution

741
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,359
as in previous studies the most commonly

742
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,159
endorsed reasons for substitution were

743
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:18,719
less adverse side effects and better

744
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,320
symptom management and a novel Finding

745
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,880
was that younger participants were more

746
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,759
likely to report substitution than older

747
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,960
patients and this may be simply because

748
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:28,558
older patients are more fixed in their

749
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
substance use p

750
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,480
or perhaps because younger patients

751
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,240
simply use greater variety of substances

752
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,558
in the first place and therefore more

753
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,839
likely to use cannabis as a

754
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,839
substitute overall these sub these

755
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:43,158
findings suggest that the medical and

756
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:45,079
potentially recreational cannabis use

757
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:47,039
can reduce the use and the public health

758
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:49,278
and safety impacts associated with

759
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:52,119
prescription drugs alcohol and the

760
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:54,480
harmful use of some liit substances

761
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:55,918
taking together the camp study helps us

762
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,558
better understand the Canadian medical

763
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,600
cannabis patient population and kinds of

764
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,398
use additionally our findings provide

765
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:05,158
further evidence for the widespread uh

766
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:07,398
nature of cannabis substitution and

767
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:09,960
suggest potentially fruitful avenues for

768
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:12,319
research that elucidates the complex

769
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,720
relationships uh between cannabis use

770
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,759
and the use of other substances in

771
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,839
closing I'd really like to thank uh Dr

807
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:02,679
government under the new mmpr per plant

808
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,679
system supplies medical marijuana

809
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,639
through its subsidiary

810
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,278

of illegal drugs in

820
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:30,919
2005 would have made sense to write

821
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:34,600
these in order but that's not what we

822

just have to say that you can't

833
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,880
we have Jonathan Paige he's an a

834
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,639
professor at the boty department of UBC

835
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,280
he is a scientist in entrepreneur

836
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:10,358
focused on understanding the biochemical

837
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,200
and genetic secrets of medicinal plants

838
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:14,159
including cannabis he pursues This

839
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:18,799
research through an academic program at

840
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,800
UBC in Anand loves thank

841
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:30,000
you thank you if I

842
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,159
just leave it there can you all hear me

843
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,719
well great lovely to see you all there's

844
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:39,480
some new faces and some familiar faces

845
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,678
um tonight we're going to try to cover

846
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,918
quite a broad range of topics we can

847
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,440
dive into each one of these subjects for

848
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:50,239
hours of time um but we have worked hard

849
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,918
to identify some relevant and current

850
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,519
issues that need to be dug into and

851
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:56,078
solutions that we need to come to some

852
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:58,280
solutions around some of the issues that

853
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,839
are facing

854
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,960
can landscape right now so this

855
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:06,078
conversation one can look through it at

856
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,039
it through many lenses there is a

857
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,519
political agenda there's a business

858
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:13,559
agenda there is a lens of activism and

859
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,800
most importantly to me a lens of patient

860
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:17,599
needs and I think we'll probably hear a

861
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,400
variety of those

862
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,720
perspectives there is a tremendous

863
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,358
amount of expertise in this panel and

864
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:27,838
also in this room a wide variety of

865
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:30,880
exper and

866
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:32,320
Folks at gave me permission to set up a

867
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,119
structure for this

868
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,240
conversation this is what we're going to

869
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:38,960
do this is not a debate we are not

870
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:42,799
looking to come out of this room with

871
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,639
winners or losers we are here to draw on

872
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,680
the expertise that's in this room to try

873
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:49,920
to move towards creating some consensus

874
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:51,919
and some solutions together it's not

875
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,920
going to happen in an hourong

876
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,639
conversation but I think it's an

877
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,639
important shift in the mood of what's

878
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,639
happening the

879
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:05,799
so as we're asking these these questions

880
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,240
to the panel I would also ask you to

881
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,839
make not to yourself what's your answer

882
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,598
to these questions and do you have an

883
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,960
idea or a thought that we haven't talked

884
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:15,480
about is there something you really

885
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,440
agree with or something that you

886
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,000
strongly disagree with because we're

887
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,400
going to have hopefully about half an

888
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,599
hour uh to hear from you and to engage

889
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,720
you in this

890
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,440
conversation and I'm really hoping that

891
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,919
we can create a very meaningful

892
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,800
conversation

893
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,358
we are the opinion leaders and the pulse

894
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,200
of medical cannabis on the west coast

895
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,799
and there are a lot of patience looking

896
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:41,078
for us to create really good Solutions

897
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,640
and to not waste our energy and our time

898
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,599
um debating so we're not in the

899
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:49,400
parliament than

900
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:52,200
you um we're gonna cover three main

901
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,000
broad topics there's a fourth one and a

902
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:57,639
couple of bonus questions if we have

903
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,079
time so we'll see if we get there

904
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:01,799
we're going to set this up is we're

905
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:03,519
going to try to do question in about

906
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,839
five minutes it's going to be really

907
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:06,838
hard comple

908
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:16,318
questiones okay won't turn if I turn

909
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:19,039
around and guys can't hear me okay thank

910
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:21,880
you so we're gonna try to answer each

911
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:24,199
question in five minutes um the first

912
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,240
respondent try to keep it to around two

913
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:29,279
minutes if you really have more to say

914
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:31,039
you can but like to do is have two

915
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,800
minutes for the first respondent and

916
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:36,318
then one or two call what minutes and

917
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,680
again we can have some flexibility so

918
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:41,679
does that sound good okay great so the

919
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,759
first topic that we're going to get into

920
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,759
is quality control and testing and some

921
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,680
of our previous presenters have touched

922
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,359
on a couple of these subjects so there

923
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,199
might be a few things that get repeated

924
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:54,559
but rather than pulling the questions

925
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:57,519
we're going to just dig deeply into them

926
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,799
so the first thing that I think would be

927
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:00,759
to talk about because we've talk we're

928
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,920
talking a lot about quality control and

929
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:07,880
testing measures is what are the

930
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,400
potential but specific harms that are

931
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:14,280
possible um in herbal cannabis

932
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,519
particularly inhaled herbal cannabis um

933
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,000
so I know I said you only had two

934
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:22,358
minutes but I would was hoping that you

935
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,519
could touch on pesticides and fungicides

936
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:26,920
molds heavy metals and bacterias so

937
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,800
first let's talk about what the real

938
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,119
poten arms are and then we're going to

939
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,000
talk about what the measures are that

940
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:37,119
are in place to address

941
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,800
them okay so in terms of harms you know

942
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,920
I've done some digging in the scientific

943
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,400
literature can you pleas hold the mic

944
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,400
yeah thank

945
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,119
you is it on yeah um I've done some

946
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:52,559
digging in the scientific literature

947
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,920
about the types of harms and things that

948
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,599
have happened to people who have

949
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,960
consumed cannabis whether it's medically

950
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,480
or recreationally

951
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,760
and there's actually not a lot of

952
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:05,760
information about harms that have been

953
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,880
documented so as Hillary alluded to

954
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,960
there's a sort of microbiological harms

955
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:13,400
things like bacteria and fungi that can

956
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,159
be growing on the surface of the bud or

957
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,440
on the on the material and they

958
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:22,118
themselves are are viable they could

959
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,800
infect people for example um and in some

960
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:26,000
cases there's there's at least two

961
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,119
published cases of aspergilus so this

962
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,800
would be a fungus infecting immune

963
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,160
compromised patients who consume

964
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:37,680
marijuana that's that has fungus on it

965
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:41,000
so asilis will live in your lungs you

966
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,719
know the fungus will uh spread in one of

967
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,079
these published cases it's a you know

968
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:47,118
medical case report the person died and

969
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:50,318
in another case they were cured by an

970
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,880
fungal therapy so that's one example of

971
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:57,440
of documented hars of course you know we

972
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,000
we we know that you don't want bacteria

973
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,760
want on your salad greens and you

974
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,159
wouldn't want it on on your medicine

975
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,720
either but still there's there's not

976
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:09,960
that much evidence that contaminated

977
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:12,598
cannabis with microbes growing on it has

978
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,800
harmed or killed people another area

979
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,720
that Hillary mentioned is is pesticides

980
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,318
and fungicides of course in

981
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:22,480
mnpr these are being tested for actually

982
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,400
they're not allowed in the mmpr system

983
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,318
but there's still the possibility in

984
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,160
cannabis Source through other means for

985
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:31,519
examp that would have um

986
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:33,879
pesticides and you know there's things

987
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:36,920
like like spidermites that are very

988
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,680
common in medical marijuana

989
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,280
cies

990
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:42,919
um some people think that if you smoke a

991
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,560
joint and it has pesticides the

992
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,960
pesticides are inactivated by the

993
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,679
burning or heating or vaporization but

994
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,639
there is published research that shows

995
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:53,759
that's not the case that pesticides can

996
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:55,598
be inhaled so you know there are there

997
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,720
is evidence that things can be in

998
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,599
Canabis and can be harmful um but again

999
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:03,000
there's not a lot of documented evidence

1000
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:05,400
of people getting really sick from

1001
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,599
marijuana

1002
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,639
or thank you any of other one other

1003
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:12,280
panelists want to speak to potential

1004
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:15,598
harms of contaminants you think there's

1005
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,599
anything that was missed in John's

1006
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,838
answer there was the I work a lot at the

1007
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:29,559
State of Michigan and there was an

1008
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:33,078
incident in nursing they had 12 patrons

1009
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:35,480
they were using materal and other the 12

1010
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,960
in the nursing home two had to be medack

1011
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,838
for onset of mold induced ammonia so

1012
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,639
there is a risk even though it's not

1013
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:45,159
well document there is a risk it's just

1014
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:49,719
like any other biological thing there's

1015
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:51,719
risks and under the under the mm 57% of

1016
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:54,159
the patients that were using product

1017
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:56,639
under M were also using immunal

1018
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,879
suppressants so their immune systems be

1019
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:01,400
because they conditions of HIV AIDS or

1020
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,358
they had cancer and it's because of

1021
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,880
their immunosuppressed they're also a

1022
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:06,838
little higher risk in terms of

1023
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,800
vulnerability when it comes to other

1024
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:10,119
things like that so that's where the

1025
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,119
that's where the harm reduction

1026
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:14,400
potential has to be realized when

1027
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:16,240
working with with making Canabis as safe

1028
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,639
as we can for these particularly for

1029
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:22,479
this population who are

1030
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:25,879
compromised

1031
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:29,800
exactly excellent thank you di do you

1032
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,800
want to speak TOs on to the next

1033
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,559
question

1034
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:38,279
um all there seems to be a certain class

1035
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:42,400
of patient it's really far more affected

1036
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:45,160
by um any sort of uh microt toxins or

1037
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,240
other funguses or molds U but generally

1038
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:50,279
speaking um it's not as widespread as it

1039
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:52,279
once was believed um there was some

1040
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,240
research that came out ofand of the

1041
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,240
coffee shops that showed uh that there

1042
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:59,399
were things like FAL on the Canabis

1043
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:01,000
actually exists on surprisingly almost

1044
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,680
everything we interact with on a daily

1045
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,480
day-to-day basis uh I think this becomes

1046
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,039
more of an issue when we move on to

1047
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,800
derivative products like Edibles um with

1048
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:12,440
long shelf lives and lots of uh

1049
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,559
carbohydrates and things to feed them

1050
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,039
but I think we're going to touch on that

1051
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,920
a little bit later so um I I think it's

1052
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:20,079
important for those that know they very

1053
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,440
immune compromise to be aware of what

1054
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,119
they're consuming and there's no two

1055
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,400
ways about it so um those those risks

1056
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:28,599
are real in certain cases but maybe PR

1057
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,920
want

1058
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:33,359
stop thanks so we've talked about what

1059
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,838
are the harms what are the risks now

1060
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:37,799
we're going to talk about what is

1061
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:40,599
currently in place um to prevent those

1062
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,280
harms so let's first talk about the

1063
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:44,039
quality control measures that are in

1064
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,480
place for the mmpr we heard a little bit

1065
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:48,159
about it from our lovely presenter Amy

1066
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,280
thank you but maybe you can tell us a

1067
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,519
little bit more about the quality

1068
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,640
control measures that are in place in

1069
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:53,639
the

1070
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:58,199
MPR yes

1071
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:05,598
well right now after having several

1072
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,159
inspections from Canada under the new

1073
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:12,519
regulation they've only now beginning to

1074
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:14,000
think about quality control and but

1075
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:15,920
before up to this point they were all

1076
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,960
focused on division three which is all

1077
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,838
about the security under the old program

1078
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,240
the M we were governed under what's

1079
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:26,199
called GM good manufacturing practices

1080
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,439
which we had to establish a set of

1081
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:30,279
standard Opera procedures for testing

1082
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,480
protocols and that's one of the reasons

1083
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,559
we have now we say we have 281 points of

1084
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,719
quality control because every step has

1085
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:38,160
to be measured so that's and we follow a

1086
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,439
certain British

1087
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,399
pharmacopia now Health Canada came and

1088
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,000
they lamented to

1089
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,680
us three weeks ago there is no standard

1090
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,679
the pharmacopia is there's no standard

1091
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:51,358
in in the industry right now it's all

1092
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,719
over the map in terms of testing and

1093
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,719
quality control aspects so they're just

1094
00:44:53,719 --> 00:45:00,279
now I would say starting to think about

1095
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:01,959
what what parts they they thinking about

1096
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,440
what's important but they haven't really

1097
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,679
arrived anything just sort of the whole

1098
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,200
ambition of the rushing the program

1099
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:11,399
together was really to get some defined

1100
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,919
access for patients across the country

1101
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,680
now they're only starting to ask

1102
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,119
themselves the question what does it

1103
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:18,759
quality control mean we've inherited a

1104
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,640
program before that we just simply

1105
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,319
transpose over added some other

1106
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:24,519
varieties to it but I think it's really

1107
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:25,960
it's focusing on those aspects that

1108
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:27,880
where you touch on all those points we

1109
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,800
justed to question to make sure they're

1110
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:33,960
covered in in a manner that is as safe

1111
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,559
as can be we had a toxicologist that had

1112
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,400
chirped in on the kinds of levels of

1113
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:41,920
metals levels of molds and so they gave

1114
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,318
a fairly low bar because as John says

1115
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,800
there's not very much well document so

1116
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:48,838
we had to fall within that those far and

1117
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,960
it's surprisingly they bored a lot of

1118
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:52,920
the language from the N the Natural

1119
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,000
Health Products Direct in order to

1120
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,400
establish some of that Baseline stuff

1121
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
but I think it's going to be something

1122
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,639
in the fure that as they as this program

1123
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,358
evolves and as there's a need and

1124
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,118
there's other recalls that happened

1125
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:06,960
they're compelled to make it as safe as

1126
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:10,680
they can so I can see that there's

1127
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,559
Chang than you deer will you speak to

1128
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:15,679
what quality control measures are in

1129
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:15,680
place for

1130
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,559
dispensaries um like with anything in

1131
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:23,559
the dispensary world there's no single

1132
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:25,680
answer um it's U it varies from

1133
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:27,720
dispensary to dispensary so I can't

1134
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:29,279
speak with certainty to what everyone

1135
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:31,439
does but I can certainly speak to best

1136
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,440
practices that have been adopted by some

1137
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:38,039
of the older dispensaries and some of

1138
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:41,079
the newers alike um so we likewise use

1139
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:43,199
gpp and and an so so our good production

1140
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:45,000
practices are in large part how we uh

1141
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,759
guarantee that the product that we're

1142
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,760
selling is safe for our membership so

1143
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,800
although we don't have the same access

1144
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,400
to uh academics and equipment that

1145
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:57,599
licensed producers have um by having

1146
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,519
people um have with a things they can

1147
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,240
and can't do products they can use and

1148
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:04,719
can't use uh and a thorough inspection

1149
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:07,558
it goes a long way um when it comes to

1150
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:09,039
things like mold and milde do a single

1151
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:11,240
point of testing or two points of

1152
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,639
testing on a large B generally speaking

1153
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:15,159
isn't representational anyways anybody

1154
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:17,118
that's used cannabis before or worked

1155
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:19,039
with cannabis will realize that you can

1156
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,280
pull one good butt and one bad butt out

1157
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:24,000
of any batch um so uh trained employees

1158
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,079
that hand inspect every bit of product

1159
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,920
is is very important um knowing and

1160
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:30,960
having good equipment to spot that helps

1161
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,680
a lot um but when it comes to things

1162
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,480
like adulterant like pesticides where

1163
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:36,838
there's some level of trust and of

1164
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,400
course audits on our producers that uh

1165
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:40,400
they are following the rules that we've

1166
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,000
set for them um we're not able to do

1167
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,480
that testing very easily um when it

1168
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,239
comes to derivative products it's

1169
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,280
actually pretty simple most common sense

1170
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:50,318
is just you use Food and Drug standards

1171
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,079
that exist in every other industry we

1172
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:56,480
tend to not treat it so much like a like

1173
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:59,039
a a pharmaceutical it is a food product

1174
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,240
for the most part so yeah most of it is

1175
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:05,920
based on you know 20 years of experience

1176
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:10,639
in the industry and uh common sense

1177
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:12,800
one great thank you um so this is a bit

1178
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,960
more of a subjective question it's about

1179
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:18,800
how stringent does the testing need to

1180
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,159
be specifically for Herbal in cannabis

1181
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,680
so let's leave the extracts and the

1182
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:22,759
Edibles out of it for now because it's a

1183
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,960
whole other

1184
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:28,599
conversation and how stringent do we

1185
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,440
think that the quality control measures

1186
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:31,960
should be and do we think that the

1187
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,440
measures that are currently in place

1188
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:38,159
under the mmpr are appropriate should

1189
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,159
they be stricter should they be more

1190
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:44,598
LAX I can try to address that again it's

1191
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,358
it's a very unique product in the sense

1192
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:49,119
that how many other herbal medicines are

1193
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:51,719
actually vaporized or smoked where you

1194
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,720
know you're getting for example if there

1195
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:56,959
is contamination with heavy metals like

1196
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:58,919
[ __ ] or Le it's

1197
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,318
into the blood stream by the lungs and

1198
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,760
so I think we have to have a pretty high

1199
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:06,039
bar here when we're dealing with with

1200
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:09,000
cannabis just just because of the mode

1201
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:10,880
of of consumption compared to yes

1202
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,838
tobacco would be another parallel but in

1203
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,480
terms of other pharmaceutical products

1204
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:18,880
not that much to compare it to so I

1205
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:21,159
think I guess the high bar is there

1206
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,920
Health Canada I think struggled with

1207
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:25,519
where to set those tolerances and limits

1208
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,519
and went to things like the Natural

1209
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:29,159
Health

1210
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:31,199
and said you know what's what's present

1211
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:33,558
in other herbal medicines for example if

1212
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:35,598
you're taking a cania or something you

1213
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:38,798
know in a commercial sense it would be

1214
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:40,880
tested for for various things um so I

1215
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:43,119
think you know there was an attempt to

1216
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,079
adapt some of the international and

1217
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,680
National standards from other products

1218
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:49,559
that would be comparable but again you

1219
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:51,480
know with something like pesticides at

1220
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,480
some point pesticides might be allowed

1221
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:56,318
in commercial marijuana production or

1222
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,639
commercial medical cabus production and

1223
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:01,519
yet what do we know about pesticides

1224
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:03,639
being inhaled by by people smoking to

1225
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,519
VAP Rising so I think I guess the main

1226
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:08,039
thing is that we want fairly stringent

1227
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:10,880
controls and but deciding what those

1228
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:13,558
numbers are in mices or in other levels

1229
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,559
is very

1230
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,000
difficult do you want to

1231
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,640
comment we're getting some good

1232
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,639
questions for you thank you for your

1233
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,280
patience you won't feel bad for him in a

1234
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:32,239
few don't

1235
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:34,798
worry um you know that again without

1236
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:37,118
sound like a they're just inventing the

1237
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:39,880
now in terms of what the what the

1238
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,318
standard should be and they sort of I

1239
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,920
have to say that Health Canada for the

1240
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:47,159
most part has ignored the entire mm they

1241
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,159
haven't learned any lessons from it so

1242
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:50,838
right

1243
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:53,118
now we're really trying to again

1244
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:55,679
establish what those bars should be and

1245
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,519
it's really again Common Sense the says

1246
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:59,879
what's being the big thing is that

1247
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:02,480
they're what they're trying to EST is a

1248
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,400
system of accountability so there's

1249
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,760
there's an accountability change so that

1250
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,480
people who are relying on it as as

1251
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:11,079
medicine it's on the label what's on the

1252
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,798
label is important it's on the label the

1253
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:14,318
concentrations are there and then the

1254
00:51:12,798 --> 00:51:16,599
product is within the category of what

1255
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:18,039
they deem as being safe even though they

1256
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:19,760
haven't really established what that bar

1257
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:21,558
looks like they're just coming to that

1258
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,040
now so it's really about coming along

1259
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:25,680
with that system of of accountability

1260
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,279
and then and then the metal side of it

1261
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:28,838
me again that's all going to be driven

1262
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,599
by toxicologist and they could take

1263
00:51:28,838 --> 00:51:33,119
years to figure that out one thing about

1264
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:35,559
cannabis is most of you know it's the

1265
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,519
Ferrari of plants it grows very fast

1266
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:40,040
which also means that it doesn't it

1267
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:42,318
doesn't prejudice against metals that it

1268
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:46,440
takes up in fact they use the hemp lines

1269
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:48,358
and around Chernobyl to help surrender

1270
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:51,920
the land back into usefulness because it

1271
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:53,598
will take a bra nucle nucle so in other

1272
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,760
words I think for the most part we can

1273
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,000
see that it it doesn't Prejudice it'll

1274
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,040
take whatever's up that's there and so

1275
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,318
it's really a question what is what is

1276
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:04,759
the safe bench marks and again we've

1277
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:06,358
gone to the British Department some

1278
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,359
established but I can say at this point

1279
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:11,639
in time based on what I've seen with

1280
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,679
it's there isn't anything established as

1281
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:15,318
of yet it's going to be probably KNE

1282
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:16,960
driven we've had seen some Grand

1283
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:19,239
negative bacteria show up in a few

1284
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,798
recalls but I don't think uh I don't

1285
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:22,159
think that we're going to see that the

1286
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:23,719
story isn't finished being written it's

1287
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:28,358
only just

1288
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:33,358
begun thank you um derer a question for

1289
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:36,078
you um what testing is available for

1290
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,679
people who are producing under the mm or

1291
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:39,680
sell producers that are growing for

1292
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,719
dispensaries is it possible for credit

1293
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:44,679
labs to work with dispensaries and M

1294
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:46,399
Growers um some some Labs worked with mm

1295
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:49,039
Growers as long as they had a valid pink

1296
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,960
slip um there seems to have been a shift

1297
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:52,880
recently where accredited Labs that have

1298
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,960
a section 9 or section 56 have been

1299
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,559
advised to no longer accept from

1300
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,920
patients under the m under the MPR in

1301
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:01,880
some cases as well um so we're we're

1302
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,838
very limited to the relationships that

1303
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,798
we can strike up as a dispensary with

1304
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:07,159
with accreditor Labs because they they

1305
00:53:05,798 --> 00:53:09,440
they do have to go through a lot of work

1306
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:11,039
to get that clearance to be able to

1307
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,119
house and hold these products so there

1308
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:15,000
there's great deal of risk um some

1309
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,079
dispensaries like the bccs have had

1310
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,480
relationships with unlicensed labs for

1311
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:24,119
quite some time over a decade um we have

1312
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,519
uh I can't say who they are but we we've

1313
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:27,519
made some friendly relationships with

1314
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:29,599
labs in the past um but when you're

1315
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:30,960
working in an illegal industry for a

1316
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,318
product that's considered illegal which

1317
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,838
we do in the dispensary world uh it's

1318
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:37,558
very burdensome to deal with

1319
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:39,880
transportation and getting into the labs

1320
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:42,240
um so we are certainly very limited some

1321
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,079
dispensaries actually have their own GCS

1322
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:45,439
SO gas chromatographs and we've seen the

1323
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,559
price of those units drop quite

1324
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,119
drastically over the last couple years

1325
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:51,720
um but it is certainly difficult uh and

1326
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:56,119
something that we need to improve on

1327
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:58,519
over the com thank you um you talked

1328
00:53:56,119 --> 00:53:59,920
about uh Brant you talked about the

1329
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:01,679
variety of Standards within the

1330
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,798
different pharmacopia that the US

1331
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:06,358
pharmacopia and the European pharmacopia

1332
00:54:03,798 --> 00:54:08,239
have different standards and then we

1333
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:10,239
also have different testing equipment

1334
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:13,000
and different methodologies that also

1335
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:14,919
result in a variety of results even when

1336
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,239
we're trying to do c say a basic can

1337
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:19,519
avonoid

1338
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:21,318
profile so from an industry perspective

1339
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:22,838
I imagine that this could be difficult

1340
00:54:21,318 --> 00:54:24,400
what if a licensed producer's

1341
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:28,000
methodology is different than health

1342
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:30,480
Canada's methodology patient perspective

1343
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,719
I work with a mother who produces her

1344
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,240
own extract from standardized Source um

1345
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:38,439
for her you know child with seizures and

1346
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:40,118
she'll take one batch of her extract

1347
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,358
send it to three different labs and get

1348
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:43,720
three totally different sets of results

1349
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:45,480
making it very difficult for her to

1350
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:47,439
figure out her dosage for her child and

1351
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,039
this is a conundrum that she's you know

1352
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,400
asking me I'm like I don't know and so I

1353
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:54,719
think maybe again I'm kind of picking on

1354
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,639
you guys but maybe John and rent could

1355
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:01,118
speak to possible to create one uniform

1356
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:03,960
standard testing

1357
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:07,318
practice Yeah I think it is I mean the

1358
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:10,559
issue is actually mainly the potency

1359
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:12,880
testing so THC CBD we go deeper into the

1360
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,880
other can avonoids that are present and

1361
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,119
the fact that you know this is a this is

1362
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,519
a product that no government has really

1363
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:22,440
got behind Canadian government dragged

1364
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:24,239
by the courts into this area and so it's

1365
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,679
not like they' sort of said let's

1366
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:29,239
validate a method

1367
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:30,879
and tell all the licensed producers or

1368
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:33,919
tell the dispensaries that this is the

1369
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:37,838
way we're going to do it Emily mentioned

1370
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:41,079
hplc versus GC and you know would they

1371
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:42,960
mandate hplc as the goto method this is

1372
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:45,318
the method that can give you the acidic

1373
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,280
canono rather than the neutral canono

1374
00:55:45,318 --> 00:55:50,759
and decarbox and all the chemistry

1375
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:53,000
behind it but the government normally

1376
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,960
are validating such methods and in this

1377
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,960
case potency analysis is left to the

1378
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,760
industry so it's kind of you know it's

1379
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,440
Colorado it's Washington it's Canada and

1380
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,440
I really think that at some point um

1381
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:07,400
we're going to have to develop a you

1382
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,559
know a real standard that that can be we

1383
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,960
can compare against and and that doesn't

1384
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:15,519
mean that industry has to just do this

1385
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:17,199
one method everywhere there's going to

1386
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:19,599
but within certain parameters for

1387
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:21,000
example I think hlc should be the sort

1388
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:24,720
of go to

1389
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:28,318
analysis um but so far we haven't seen

1390
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:30,598
held Canada do that the the published

1391
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,440
regulations are this the method should

1392
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:35,119
be validated and it should be accurate

1393
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,240
and you should you know the most sort of

1394
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:40,039
lowest common denominator of suggestions

1395
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:41,358
for an analytical test were applied so I

1396
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:43,960
don't know Brent do you have anything to

1397
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:45,558
add to I mean are they moving you hear

1398
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:49,358
that they're moving in the direction of

1399
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:51,839
a validated method yeah the first first

1400
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:55,679
attempt on the M with health Canada was

1401
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:58,318
they wanted us to measure seven canabo

1402
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:00,598
but they they only use a GC method gas

1403
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:03,440
chromatograph and the gas chromatograph

1404
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:05,920
only really touches touches on THC and

1405
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:12,519
abcn but they wanted us to do you know

1406
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:15,079
seven you know CBD cbaa CBG cbca CBC so

1407
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:17,280
you know we said well what are you using

1408
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:18,920
your method for they had seven Labs it's

1409
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,160
drug analytical Services well it's only

1410
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,159
for drug convictions so they their only

1411
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:26,798
me their only reason for having it was

1412
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:29,199
so that they had to get about 3% to get

1413
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:30,798
a conviction so they didn't care what it

1414
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:32,598
was after that but if you're measuring

1415
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:34,920
for potency and accuracy you got to have

1416
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:37,599
a much more robust system so when we

1417
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:40,760
first were you know when in 2003 when we

1418
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:44,039
invited to then start producing based on

1419
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:47,920
the Ontario Supreme Court it's in case

1420
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:49,720
we thrust into that not to our our

1421
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,079
Ambitions but to what health Canon

1422
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:53,679
dictated so at that time then we said

1423
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,760
well we have to come up with a validated

1424
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:59,038
method and we have to we have to engage

1425
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,960
another lab and spent an enormous amount

1426
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,920
of money and time developing a validated

1427
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:06,039
method that follow the phocus and it was

1428
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,358
took three years to develop to get to a

1429
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:11,720
standard that were the where the results

1430
00:58:08,358 --> 00:58:13,279
were reliable every single time now the

1431
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:15,759
challenge was we send it up to other

1432
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,319
labs and to the experience that we had

1433
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,680
every lab came back with a different

1434
00:58:17,318 --> 00:58:22,038
potency and a different range of thcs

1435
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:23,639
and CBDs and that was a disturbing part

1436
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:25,520
we didn't get any standardization as

1437
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:27,639
part of the problem is the the systems

1438
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:29,440
didn't take consideration these high

1439
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:31,078
peaks of which THC can be with these

1440
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,960
different varieties weren't used to that

1441
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:34,960
kind of concentration those machines

1442
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,199
like the high pressure chromatography

1443
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,679
hlcs are used to measuring a very small

1444
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:41,038
but having something like 22 or 28% I

1445
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:42,078
mean the machines go crazy because

1446
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,680
they're not used to those kind of

1447
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:47,039
volumes of stuff that compound so we had

1448
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:48,639
to do a develop a method to get to that

1449
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:51,440
so you can get an accuracy that was

1450
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:54,199
reliable every single time and and it's

1451
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:58,000
not only on the machine it's also having

1452
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:59,519
a very tight amount of sampling and how

1453
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,239
you prepare it it becomes critical

1454
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:02,880
because every step in the process you

1455
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:04,598
change it one little bit and it has a

1456
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,760
direct impact so the method has to be

1457
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:07,240
standardized so the answer to the

1458
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,119
question is is there going to be a

1459
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:11,358
standardization I think so because I

1460
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,559
think patients so bring it back to

1461
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:15,759
patients they need to know what's in

1462
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:18,000
their medicine because they become

1463
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,599
relying on from a memory point when they

1464
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,880
go to use it and they Goose it and

1465
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,559
they're taking it from a doing

1466
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,400
perspective so it has to be what's on

1467
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,440
the wall should be something that's they

1468
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,920
can remember to use every single time

1469
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,318
the one only way to really do that is if

1470
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,159
they can actually that accurate precise

1471
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:34,838
measur and then I think we'll get to

1472
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:36,118
standardization me I wonder if we're

1473
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:38,599
waiting for health Canada to take

1474
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:40,559
leadership on it if maybe it's something

1475
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:42,000
that uh the industry and the community

1476
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,400
is going to have to do together to

1477
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,760
establish that oh wait I'm the moderator

1478
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,400
I'm not supposed to be

1479
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:52,000
commenting um what do you think so far

1480
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,000
interesting questions is this like they

1481
00:59:54,679 --> 01:00:00,159
kind so we're going to have another

1482
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:01,879
really simple uncomplex question next

1483
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:03,838
and I promise we're getting into the

1484
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:07,720
regulation stuff soon again thank you

1485
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:10,400
Mark so how much do we know about the

1486
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:13,719
correlation of canabo and turine

1487
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,880
profiles to to management and now that

1488
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:18,399
patients do have access to canab

1489
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,599
profiles how does that change the

1490
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,480
efficacy of the way that they're

1491
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:23,798
choosing their strains rather than the

1492
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:27,440
indic sativa classification that we have

1493
01:00:23,798 --> 01:00:27,440
been working on historically

1494
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,960
do you want me to yes dig into that I

1495
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:35,279
think we're learning we're obviously

1496
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,240
learning that Catabus consists of more

1497
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:40,680
than just THC so THC was you know the

1498
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:42,759
mole it's the most bioactive molecule

1499
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:46,318
it's the psychoactive ingredient for the

1500
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:48,200
most part CBD has reappeared on the

1501
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:50,798
scene in the last three or four years as

1502
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:52,078
an important component especially things

1503
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:55,318
like childhood

1504
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:58,720
epilepsy but I think it's clear from

1505
01:00:55,318 --> 01:01:01,759
paent feedback not necessarily published

1506
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:03,199
scientific literature that strains have

1507
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,880
different properties and different

1508
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:09,078
effects and you know there's that

1509
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:13,240
anecdotal evidence that you could have a

1510
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:15,960
177% you know heavy IND 17% THC in a

1511
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:17,838
heavy indicia versus 17% in a sativa

1512
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,318
type stream and whether I believe

1513
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:21,199
there's a real sort of genetic

1514
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:23,318
difference between SAA Inda doesn't

1515
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:25,679
really matter but that those strains

1516
01:01:23,318 --> 01:01:28,239
Smoked by or vaporized by one patient

1517
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:30,358
have different effects so there's other

1518
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:32,719
things in cannabis and it's been termed

1519
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:35,199
the Entourage effect where the you know

1520
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:37,118
THC is sort of the main player and the

1521
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:41,038
Entourage are these other components

1522
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,640
like terpenoids other minor canabo that

1523
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:45,240
we don't normally talk about was

1524
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:50,318
mentioning things like cdca and

1525
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:53,959
CDC not the television channel obviously

1526
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:56,719
um and uh you know but we still don't

1527
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,880
know what they contribute they the smell

1528
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:00,879
of cannabis in in the case of terpenoids

1529
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,519
but they're also part of the high part

1530
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,798
of the therapeutic properties maybe part

1531
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:09,239
of the stive properties of of Inda type

1532
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:12,000
what people would call Inda type strains

1533
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:15,159
and so we're really just starting to get

1534
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,199
a handle on that one of the things I've

1535
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:19,399
said in in talks I've given in the past

1536
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:22,318
is that there's this really difficult

1537
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:26,559
science Gap that with cannabis being you

1538
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:29,199
know uh prohibition since 193 s in the

1539
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,880
US the fact that universities and

1540
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:32,679
government Labs were really prevented

1541
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,798
from doing research on it it's still

1542
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:36,639
very difficult to get research licenses

1543
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:38,798
so there's these outstanding questions

1544
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:41,078
about things like the Entourage effect

1545
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:43,079
and it's really LPS dispensaries other

1546
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:45,200
people involved in and patients and

1547
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:46,720
patient advocacy groups that are going

1548
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:49,078
to be doing the research that can start

1549
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:51,759
to answer some of those questions I

1550
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:54,039
think thank you do you have something

1551
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,240
burning to say can we move on you're

1552
01:02:54,039 --> 01:03:00,559
okay

1553
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:00,558
yeah we just got to get it not it we

1554
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:09,269
[Music]

1555
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:14,480
should um say that the Inda term

1556
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,960
probably needs to go the window at least

1557
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,318
it shouldn't be the primary point for

1558
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,159
patients to interact with the plant uh I

1559
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:22,000
also think that the entage effect is

1560
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:23,598
just a theory at this point and we have

1561
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,039
these license producers with wonderful

1562
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:28,160
analytical capabilities that can look

1563
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:29,760
into the specific of these plants and

1564
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:31,480
there should be some you know it should

1565
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,920
be fairly easy to do this research to

1566
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:35,119
figure out what each one of these

1567
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:37,278
subcomponents is doing so we can

1568
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,920
actually say with certainty based on

1569
01:03:37,278 --> 01:03:42,119
that cannaboid profile and that tpine

1570
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,639
profile that this type of patient will

1571
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:45,680
will get this effect right now it's all

1572
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:47,159
based on smell so patient smells it and

1573
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:49,679
they don't I I know how that's going to

1574
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:52,639
work so yeah I was just going to say

1575
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:56,078
that you know I don't think in the are

1576
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:59,118
dead necessarily as Concepts they a good

1577
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:00,798
but know it's a useful classification by

1578
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:03,400
these sort of you know stimulating

1579
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:06,199
versus stive strains but it's being

1580
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,720
applied so inaccurately that it's very

1581
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:10,558
difficult for patients to sort of use it

1582
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:11,919
and trust it or dispensaries or LS but

1583
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,519
it's still there is this sort of

1584
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:17,079
bifurcation in in the usage of cannabis

1585
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:19,880
strains that we need to get a handle on

1586
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:22,440
and and just tighten up a lot so we can

1587
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:27,720
be used used for people selecting STS I

1588
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:27,720
think especially on scene to very

1589
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:31,359
so that was a lot of material that we

1590
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,240
just tried to cover in a short amount of

1591
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:36,038
time around um testing and constituents

1592
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:37,639
and I saw we lost some of you it was a

1593
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:39,760
little bit dry for some of you and some

1594
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:42,318
of the rest of you are like glued this

1595
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,760
exactly what you want to learn about um

1596
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:47,960
so now we're going to move on to talking

1597
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:51,400
about the regulation of distribution and

1598
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:53,400
um currently in Canada there are at

1599
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,960
least there are more than three but

1600
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:58,039
there are three main systems by are

1601
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,960
accessing medical cannabis so some

1602
01:04:58,039 --> 01:05:02,680
patients are still ACC accessing

1603
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:04,880
cannabis through the mm Growers that are

1604
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:08,078
still functioning under the allert

1605
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:10,440
injunction some patients are accessing

1606
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:13,359
medical cannabis through dispensaries

1607
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,920
and some through the mmpr and the

1608
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:17,358
ferally licensed

1609
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,760
producers so this is a whole ball wax

1610
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:20,960
we're going to try and tease it apart a

1611
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,960
little

1612
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:29,000
bit can these three systems coexist in

1613
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:31,078
Canada or should there be one uniform

1614
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,519
system of distribution and access for

1615
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:36,480
patients across the

1616
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:38,719
country

1617
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,519
um let's leave it at that I'll break

1618
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:43,239
these apart otherwise I'm going to throw

1619
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:46,639
way too much on the table so the first

1620
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:50,719
question is can these three systems

1621
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:55,038
coexist or um should there be one

1622
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:55,038
uniform system across the country

1623
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,880
Mark Hayden is our drug regulatory guy

1624
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:02,640
doesn't have his feet deep in the

1625
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,240
medical cannabis world so it's a kind of

1626
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:07,838
a safer question for him to First launch

1627
01:06:05,239 --> 01:06:09,239
into I find myself in a very OD position

1628
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:10,838
here I've been standing in front of

1629
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:13,278
audience for 30 years talking about

1630
01:06:10,838 --> 01:06:16,358
drugs and mostly I've been really

1631
01:06:13,278 --> 01:06:19,199
annoying people I've been actually can I

1632
01:06:16,358 --> 01:06:21,519
flip the

1633
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:22,919
slide oh my God fabulous I've been

1634
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,199
really annoying people with this

1635
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:26,400
particular slide behind me because I've

1636
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:29,679
been talking about the failures of drug

1637
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:31,559
prohibition for 20 years and all drugs

1638
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:33,118
I'm not particularly to be honest this

1639
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:34,640
is a confession I'm not particularly

1640
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:37,240
interested in canus I'm interested in

1641
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:38,759
all currently illegal drugs um drug

1642
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:41,199
prohibition doesn't work and we need to

1643
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,200
do something

1644
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:51,798
differently so I've been pissing off a

1645
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:54,239
lot of people talking about that and

1646
01:06:51,798 --> 01:06:56,239
um now I find myself in a very odd

1647
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:59,919
position of working with the Cannabis

1648
01:06:56,239 --> 01:07:02,719
community and annoying them talking

1649
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:05,400
about the need to regulate um so here it

1650
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:08,480
is so I I write my position is where

1651
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,960
where I sit is I teach at the UBC School

1652
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,000
of population and public health and I

1653
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,400
write papers with the medical health

1654
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,760
officer counsel the uh the people who

1655
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,599
are responsible for public health in the

1656
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,200
province of British Columbia and we kind

1657
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,079
of choose a drug and we explore what

1658
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,919
would regulatory model for this drug

1659
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:25,160
look like based on public health

1660
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:29,200
principles so just looking where does

1661
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:31,798
public Health sit if I look at the left

1662
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:33,679
hand side of this graph what I see is

1663
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:35,038
prohibition does significant harms

1664
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:38,278
because what prohibition does is give

1665
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:41,319
drugs to organized crime and bullets are

1666
01:07:38,278 --> 01:07:43,519
a public health problem

1667
01:07:41,318 --> 01:07:44,838
and high schools become primary

1668
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:47,079
distribution points of drugs in our

1669
01:07:44,838 --> 01:07:49,038
society is doesn't create safe

1670
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:51,480
communities but there's another end of

1671
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:53,039
this continum the other end is

1672
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,679
commercialization if there's one lesson

1673
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:56,880
we can learn from alcohol and tobacco if

1674
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:59,118
you give it to large companies who have

1675
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,880
the goal of increasing consumption we

1676
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:04,960
are making a huge social mistake so

1677
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,960
Public Health sits in the

1678
01:08:07,219 --> 01:08:11,118
[Music]

1679
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:13,760
middle so really the question is how do

1680
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:15,440
we regulate and control all currently

1681
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,079
illegal drugs based on public health

1682
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,838
principles in order to minimize the harm

1683
01:08:17,079 --> 01:08:20,640
to all of our society that's the kind of

1684
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:23,399
the fundamental question that drives my

1685
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,400
interest in this discuss and I also want

1686
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,119
to say I'm the chair of the board of

1687
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:29,158
maps candidate which is multid disciplin

1688
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:29,158
Association for psychedelic

1689
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,159
studies on the regulation of

1690
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:36,080
psychedelics my previous paper was the

1691
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:37,439
regulation of cannabis but how how would

1692
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:38,838
we do it and I think they're all

1693
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,238
different so had the regulation

1694
01:08:38,838 --> 01:08:41,399
psychedelically different from Cannabis

1695
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:43,439
would be different from heral and

1696
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:45,879
cocaine but let's just play with the

1697
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:50,198
Cannabis idea for a second so the model

1698
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:53,039
that we have proposed is that there is a

1699
01:08:50,198 --> 01:08:55,000
large provincial organization called a

1700
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:56,838
commission and commission is arms L from

1701
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,079
government but governments will always

1702
01:08:56,838 --> 01:09:00,559
try and maximize whatever they do they

1703
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:02,519
will always they will not be neutral

1704
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,319
governments are not neutral so you want

1705
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:07,199
an organization that is able to stay

1706
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:09,159
focused so a commission would be a

1707
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:10,559
provincial commission would oversee all

1708
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:12,559
currently illegal drugs and they'd have

1709
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:15,480
different branches there would be a

1710
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:18,159
cannabis branch and the Cannabis Branch

1711
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:20,439
would be responsible for the structure

1712
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:22,439
and sales of cannabis now so it might

1713
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:26,318
vary across Canada which is one of your

1714
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:29,119
questions um but probably not that much

1715
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:31,359
the the the model that we are proposing

1716
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:32,640
is that any adult over the age of 19

1717
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:35,920
would be able to walk in and purchase

1718
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:38,560
cannabis and a discreet looking store so

1719
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,640
it wouldn't have storefront advertising

1720
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,960
it would be it would be discreet it

1721
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,920
wouldn't be able to see products for a

1722
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:48,079
window um youth would also be able to

1723
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:50,798
access it with adults permission now the

1724
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:54,479
model we have for that is um the United

1725
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:56,359
States has um alcohol about don't know

1726
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:58,799
number six seven eight states don't

1727
01:09:56,359 --> 01:10:02,198
quote me on the number have um legal

1728
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:04,640
access to underage minors for alcohol um

1729
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,919
based on Parental approval and we

1730
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,360
thought about this long and hard for our

1731
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,679
psychedelics paper and decided that

1732
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,960
actually Aboriginal communities have

1733
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:12,600
been used psychedelics for centuries and

1734
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,719
have always included youth in a

1735
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,400
ceremonial and structural way that

1736
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:19,439
allowed them to celebrate rights of

1737
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:21,119
Passage and encourage maturity and so it

1738
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:22,960
was with parental approval and parental

1739
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:25,399
support so we would like to see the same

1740
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,279
happening in medical C or not Medical

1741
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:29,039
with cannabis generally so parental

1742
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:32,000
permission would allow youth to access

1743
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:34,519
it what you would access would be known

1744
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,760
quantities so or known quality so all

1745
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,800
the stuff that we're talking about today

1746
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:41,880
is relevant so known concentrations

1747
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:44,600
known strains known CBD profiles known

1748
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,960
um yeah the whole the whole knowledge

1749
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:48,239
that's being discussed this pic would be

1750
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,560
available to people but it be nonrandom

1751
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:52,158
if there's one lesson to be learned from

1752
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:54,080
alcohol and tobacco one lesson is if you

1753
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:57,000
allow a product to be branded it will be

1754
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:59,079
advertised and advertising has a goal

1755
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,880
and the goal is to increase consumption

1756
01:10:59,079 --> 01:11:02,760
so the goal of this new model is not to

1757
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,760
increase consumption is to allow access

1758
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:08,079
without promoting the product one of my

1759
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,560
other sticks that I do is that there's

1760
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:11,238
no such thing as a good drug there's no

1761
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,640
such thing as a bad drug any drug can be

1762
01:11:11,238 --> 01:11:15,759
used and any drug can be abused it

1763
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:17,480
doesn't matter what it is so any drug is

1764
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,600
available for abuse and any drug is

1765
01:11:17,479 --> 01:11:21,879
available for use so how do you manage

1766
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:24,320
that to allow people to access it

1767
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:26,079
without promoting it um by large

1768
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:27,759
multinational corporation is really the

1769
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:30,840
question Public Health

1770
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:33,480
asks so

1771
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,960
uh price we get last Squad how much

1772
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:36,198
would you charge for this well that's

1773
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,600
not a simple question because if it's

1774
01:11:36,198 --> 01:11:41,279
too high the black market flourishes uh

1775
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:42,960
long term Black Market is um the wrong

1776
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:45,039
term to use in a multi-racial

1777
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:47,600
multiethnic community it's the illegal

1778
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:49,319
Market the illegal Market would flourish

1779
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,000
if the price was too high the price was

1780
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:52,399
too low you're increas in consumption so

1781
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,760
essentially you need to have a fluid

1782
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:56,399
price based on the size of the illegal

1783
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,760
Market and you need to monitor the size

1784
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:58,599
of the legal market and adjust your

1785
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,440
price

1786
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,360
accordingly there will be some volume

1787
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:03,678
restrictions so me the Netherlands has

1788
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:07,759
one of the models that I looked at long

1789
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:09,399
and hard have a a 10 G per day limit and

1790
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,920
I think that's completely

1791
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:13,319
reasonable

1792
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,119
um personally I would allow these

1793
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:17,319
facilities to be set up to sell other

1794
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:19,519
drugs as well I think cannabis is just

1795
01:12:17,319 --> 01:12:21,198
one but we need to move off that frankly

1796
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:24,719
talking about the psychedelics but also

1797
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:27,079
other drugs as well um the the if there

1798
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:29,439
was an overarching goal if there's an

1799
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:33,198
overarching goal the look and the model

1800
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:35,599
the goal is to make it look

1801
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:38,039
boring if I think about why the

1802
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,760
Netherlands has 50% of the youth per

1803
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:41,560
capita consuming cannabis versus the

1804
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,520
United States they have very

1805
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:45,639
thoughtfully and quite frankly

1806
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:48,199
brilliantly allow cannabis to be sold to

1807
01:12:45,639 --> 01:12:50,279
adults in a model that that doesn't

1808
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:52,919
encourage the consumption so people can

1809
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:55,639
access it but it doesn't encourage it so

1810
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:58,719
half the Dutch youth use can in the

1811
01:12:55,639 --> 01:13:00,239
United States because they have this

1812
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:03,000
understanding of how to structure the

1813
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:05,198
process to quite frankly make it look

1814
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,279
boring um where would people be allowed

1815
01:13:05,198 --> 01:13:11,279
to consume it well in um cannabis

1816
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:13,359
consumption facilities would be

1817
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:15,880
available um people could purchase it to

1818
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:17,238
take it home absolutely would you be

1819
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,920
allowed to walk down the street Smoky

1820
01:13:17,238 --> 01:13:20,718
and joying well probably not you can't

1821
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,399
walk in the joint the the streets smoke

1822
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,399
drinking a beer right now so probably

1823
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:26,839
similar to that but would it be outdoor

1824
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:29,319
recreation facilities allowed like Parks

1825
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:31,360
well probably yes concerts probably yes

1826
01:13:29,319 --> 01:13:32,840
it' be very hard to restrict it there so

1827
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:35,238
having some thoughtful thing about where

1828
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:37,719
people are allowed to consume it slowly

1829
01:13:35,238 --> 01:13:39,678
over the years we are moving towards a

1830
01:13:37,719 --> 01:13:41,198
public health approach to the regulation

1831
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:42,359
of tobacco and certainly one of the

1832
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:44,439
things that they've done quite

1833
01:13:42,359 --> 01:13:46,839
thoughtfully around the world is to

1834
01:13:44,439 --> 01:13:48,079
reduce where it's consumed so I think a

1835
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,760
very thoughtful approach to that would

1836
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:51,198
be needed in any public health model so

1837
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,400
it wouldn't be consumed everywhere it

1838
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:55,799
would be consumed in thoughtful

1839
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:58,759
locations um

1840
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:02,520
one of the interesting questions that I

1841
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:04,199
have is how do you who grows it so the

1842
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:06,199
there's a public health principle here

1843
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:08,479
the public health principle is based on

1844
01:14:06,198 --> 01:14:11,439
a work a book named the spirit level why

1845
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:13,158
fell named Linson and it's a fascinating

1846
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:14,960
it's it's public health Made Beautiful

1847
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:17,039
statistics made beautiful for the L

1848
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,560
public and he asked a very simple

1849
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:20,039
question is what causes all the social

1850
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,800
problems that we have out there in our

1851
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:25,039
society all of them like everything from

1852
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:27,679
low birth weight babies to murders to

1853
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:30,600
addiction raat to all kinds of social

1854
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:33,239
problems 30 30 seconds and what he said

1855
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:35,360
is the biggest problem is inegalitarian

1856
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:38,039
ISM it's the difference between the rich

1857
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:39,719
and the poor so societies that have a

1858
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:42,198
massive difference between rich and poor

1859
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:43,880
people have huge problems so the goal

1860
01:14:42,198 --> 01:14:45,879
would be to spread the money around so

1861
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:48,159
not having big Growers sorry if you'll

1862
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:50,239
leave um would be the intention having

1863
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:51,960
lots of small Growers so you don't

1864
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:53,718
concentrate money that's a public health

1865
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,520
principle is having money spread out and

1866
01:14:53,719 --> 01:14:57,960
not having large Growers

1867
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:01,120
and it's based on solid solid Public

1868
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,119
Health principles I had 30

1869
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,479
seconds I have another one coming for

1870
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:16,479
you shortly so have a SI water cash

1871
01:15:13,479 --> 01:15:18,879
breath um

1872
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:21,879
for Brent and

1873
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,880
deer

1874
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:28,158
we we currently have two really two big

1875
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:30,559
systems there are three but essentially

1876
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:31,359
when we're looking at the dispensaries

1877
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,840
and the

1878
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:37,559
mmpr um

1879
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:39,719
there given the goals of Public Safety

1880
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:42,639
and patient safety and

1881
01:15:39,719 --> 01:15:44,840
accessibility should we have one uniform

1882
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:47,279
system for medical cannabis across the

1883
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:49,520
country and what should that system look

1884
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:51,158
like does it look like the mmpr does it

1885
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:55,639
look like dispensaries does it look like

1886
01:15:51,158 --> 01:15:57,119
a hybrid of the two um and

1887
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:59,239
it's a tricky question this is one of

1888
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:01,079
the tricky things that we are facing as

1889
01:15:59,238 --> 01:16:02,759
a country and as experts right now it's

1890
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:06,198
one of the things that I hope to hear

1891
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:06,199
from all of you about as

1892
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:13,199
well um yeah that is a bit of a loaded

1893
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:15,239
question um I I think it's somewhere

1894
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:16,638
down the middle so dispensaries

1895
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:18,279
generally will need to increase the

1896
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:20,359
quality of care that they're delivering

1897
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:21,880
and the consistency of the product

1898
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:23,399
there's no reason that a consumer in any

1899
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,679
Market shouldn't have faith in what

1900
01:16:23,399 --> 01:16:27,719
they're purchasing and know that

1901
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:30,239
there no two questions about that

1902
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:32,119
personally I think the mmpr is over

1903
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:33,879
restrictive and many of the regulations

1904
01:16:32,119 --> 01:16:36,800
are based on the fear of diversion

1905
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:38,560
instead of the want for quality product

1906
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,480
and I think that's an ideological issue

1907
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,560
instead of a public health issue so that

1908
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:44,079
we'll meet in the middle eventually I

1909
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,480
think storefront distribution is the

1910
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:47,760
model everywhere else in the world and

1911
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:49,399
that Canada for its own reasons and

1912
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,840
government uh decided to reinvent the

1913
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:53,879
wheel um like with the previous programs

1914
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,600
court cases will stack up against it and

1915
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:58,880
we'll see a change time but given the

1916
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:01,480
amount of power and intelligence behind

1917
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,000
the mmpr and licensed producers I think

1918
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:05,198
that they'll effectively be able to

1919
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,119
Lobby to change a lot more than anybody

1920
01:17:05,198 --> 01:17:09,399
was able to under the mm so I I think

1921
01:17:08,119 --> 01:17:12,158
we'll meet in the middle eventually

1922
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:13,679
because both have positive aspects for

1923
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:16,679
patient

1924
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,679
care

1925
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:21,079
wait you know I thought about this a

1926
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:23,319
little bit you know in some ways the

1927
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:26,079
analogy I thought of is that the

1928
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:29,198
dispensaries kind of like the explorers

1929
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:31,800
you know after since 1937 you now went

1930
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:34,000
to the new land and they explored and

1931
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:35,679
they rediscovered the land actually was

1932
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,760
discovered by the Vikings and and the

1933
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:40,199
First Nations before but it was

1934
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:42,760
rediscovered with Columbus and cook and

1935
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:44,960
so forth you know Toge large exent the

1936
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:47,840
dispensaries were the Explorers now

1937
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,800
we're in the pioneering phase where the

1938
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,400
Pioneers are setting settling the land

1939
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,119
and we're really trying to struggle to

1940
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:55,279
find our way and what it's going to look

1941
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:57,639
like what it's going to shape into and

1942
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:59,960
it's not going to look like it is today

1943
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:02,279
it's going to change very significantly

1944
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:04,079
and you know as policy developers it's

1945
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:06,039
going to be driven by all kinds of

1946
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:08,000
agendas the government has to make it

1947
01:18:06,039 --> 01:18:09,359
safe for patients there is other

1948
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,119
interest groups that need to make sure

1949
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:13,279
that they're covered there's always big

1950
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:15,039
money that's involved and that's as you

1951
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:17,158
was alluding to there's always a scare

1952
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:19,519
of that I mean there's also you know

1953
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:21,319
there's also industry that's waiting L

1954
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,239
you don't think thees are going to sit

1955
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:25,198
back forever they're looking to get into

1956
01:18:23,238 --> 01:18:26,678
the dispensing game themselves in some

1957
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:28,799
way shape or form and all it would take

1958
01:18:26,679 --> 01:18:31,560
is for health Canada to make a change

1959
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:34,719
that allows for disp for dis dispensing

1960
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:36,280
in pharmacies and it's a game changer so

1961
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:38,359
I don't think we're there yet I think

1962
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:39,679
it's eventually it's going to lead to a

1963
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:41,719
gravitational Pole where we have a

1964
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:43,840
standardized system how it's delivered

1965
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:45,639
to patients in the future I think that

1966
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,400
remains to be seen but there's going to

1967
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:50,069
be a role for everybody I think in the

1968
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:56,638
future thank you

1969
01:18:50,069 --> 01:18:58,679
[Applause]

1970
01:18:56,639 --> 01:19:02,920
so mark this one's going to be for you

1971
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:05,319
again get ready um the mmpr is federally

1972
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:07,319
regulated the delivery of Health Care

1973
01:19:05,319 --> 01:19:09,719
Services is usually under the purview of

1974
01:19:07,319 --> 01:19:13,238
the provincial government and now we

1975
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:15,560
have the Vancouver and as of today the

1976
01:19:13,238 --> 01:19:19,359
Victoria Municipal governments kind of

1977
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:21,560
waiting in to um to the conversation

1978
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:23,279
what role should the provincial and the

1979
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:25,239
municipal governments play in the

1980
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:27,719
regulation and distribution

1981
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:29,718
Med can

1982
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:31,880
any I'm going to answer that question in

1983
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:34,079
a cous way I think everybody here in

1984
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:36,279
this room should write a letter to the

1985
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:38,800
local newspapers thanking The Vancouver

1986
01:19:36,279 --> 01:19:40,559
Police Department because essentially

1987
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,679
because they have decided to not bust

1988
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,480
people for cannabis we have the

1989
01:19:42,679 --> 01:19:45,960
situation that we have and it's it's

1990
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:47,319
rare this is unusual when you live in

1991
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,079
Vancouver you kind of think this is

1992
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:51,639
normal until you travel across Canada

1993
01:19:49,079 --> 01:19:53,479
and you go this is not normal so we have

1994
01:19:51,639 --> 01:19:55,319
a very progressed police department and

1995
01:19:53,479 --> 01:19:58,638
they need to be publicly known for what

1996
01:19:55,319 --> 01:20:00,960
they're doing and

1997
01:19:58,639 --> 01:20:03,119
so your question was what role do the

1998
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:06,079
various various levels of government

1999
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:08,439
play should Municipal and provincial

2000
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:09,920
government play I would say that if you

2001
01:20:08,439 --> 01:20:13,000
look at the health authorities the the

2002
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:16,119
relationship between the city and the

2003
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,679
provincial government has been one city

2004
01:20:16,119 --> 01:20:21,000
does zoning so yes there should be

2005
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:23,399
zoning issues where where do dispens

2006
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,399
where should dispensaries exist is a

2007
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:27,279
City question they shouldn't be

2008
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:29,000
clustered I have around the corner from

2009
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:30,238
where I live there's three on one block

2010
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,319
it's kind of strange actually you don't

2011
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:33,879
need three on one block so there should

2012
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:35,559
be a zoning issue that the city plays

2013
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:37,039
but essentially it should be provincial

2014
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:38,920
the the model that I propose and the

2015
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:42,560
health office Council proposes is the is

2016
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:46,000
a provincial commission that establishes

2017
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:49,080
the overall arching goals and regulates

2018
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:51,679
the money flow and essentially alcohol

2019
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:52,519
is sold provincially so cannabis should

2020
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,440
be the

2021
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:57,199
same and really the federal government

2022
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:57,198
should at

2023
01:21:01,158 --> 01:21:07,119
all something just a question about that

2024
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:09,199
do you separate medical cannabis from

2025
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:12,719
social or recreational cannabis in this

2026
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:14,719
model is it it's does it matter um no I

2027
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:16,439
don't um if I think about the role of

2028
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:19,600
Physicians play essentially there if you

2029
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:22,638
think about why Physicians exist it's

2030
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:25,239
because most medicines have a relatively

2031
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:27,319
narrow window of advocacy point at which

2032
01:21:25,238 --> 01:21:29,119
a medicine becomes harmful is about a 1

2033
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:30,840
to six ratio and it doesn't really

2034
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:32,158
matter what medicine it is the last time

2035
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:33,840
you took a prescription medicine if you

2036
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:36,198
multiply what you took by six you've got

2037
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:39,760
a problem so it's an unusual window

2038
01:21:36,198 --> 01:21:42,638
cannabis is way outside of that so the

2039
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,960
the risk profile of it is relatively low

2040
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,079
so quite frankly I don't think we need

2041
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:48,198
it I think that we need people who have

2042
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:50,319
information and we have need to have

2043
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:51,599
knowledge but it doesn't really fit

2044
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:52,799
within the medical model and they really

2045
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,960
haven't stepped up to the plate to say

2046
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,719
we're going to embrace this so they're

2047
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:58,359
not CH get a bit to participate in this

2048
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:02,800
so I think that should be other

2049
01:21:58,359 --> 01:22:02,799
Specialists but not necessarily doctors

2050
01:22:07,319 --> 01:22:13,000
no okay so we're gonna change topics

2051
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:15,079
again um the our the next topic that

2052
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,119
we're going to cover is around the

2053
01:22:15,079 --> 01:22:19,800
destigmatization of cannabis in the

2054
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:21,439
mainstream medical community how do we

2055
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,199
continue to create more and more

2056
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:25,198
acceptance and to have the mainstream

2057
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:27,759
medical community take cannabis

2058
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:30,479
seriously to end the snickering and the

2059
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:32,520
kind of cute little pot jokes in order

2060
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:34,279
for us to be able to create access for

2061
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:37,040
more patients across the country and

2062
01:22:34,279 --> 01:22:38,479
even around the world and Brent maybe

2063
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:41,519
you can first take a stab at this

2064
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:44,319
question as you have been working with

2065
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,840
cannabis in a a pretty different culture

2066
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:47,639
than many of the people in this room

2067
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,600
have been and you've been working with

2068
01:22:47,639 --> 01:22:52,000
clinicians and mainstream medicine and

2069
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:54,239
sort of trying to give your company a

2070
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,760
very different feel where do we need to

2071
01:22:54,238 --> 01:23:01,158
go so um and just to layer one more

2072
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:04,280
question in here

2073
01:23:01,158 --> 01:23:06,960
is does it matter what the research and

2074
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:10,679
evidence is that we come up with or will

2075
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,679
the stigmatization always

2076
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:18,279
exist those are two very loaded

2077
01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:18,279
questions no

2078
01:23:19,158 --> 01:23:25,279
contact now from the college's

2079
01:23:22,679 --> 01:23:26,800
perspective on doctors and I I've talked

2080
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:28,198
to a number of doctors and and they

2081
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:31,000
always allude to the fact that they're

2082
01:23:28,198 --> 01:23:33,839
like 10 years behind the curve when it

2083
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,639
comes to this stuff and and we know that

2084
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,920
in the human system um one of the

2085
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:40,359
questions of doctors that we have

2086
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:43,760
doctors teach other doctors everyone in

2087
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:45,439
this room has canids in their system but

2088
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,000
that same question was posed to a room

2089
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:48,879
full of doctors and they asked the

2090
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,639
doctors how many of you have canabo in

2091
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:55,199
their system not one of them put up the

2092
01:23:51,639 --> 01:23:56,600
hand he said every one of you is a liar

2093
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:58,678
because they all have cannaboids in

2094
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:00,480
their system from the endoc canabo

2095
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:03,239
signaling system it's the quiet

2096
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:05,359
operating system for managing pain so

2097
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:08,000
now medical communities are are only

2098
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:10,479
beginning to learn that the endoc canabo

2099
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,079
system and cannaboids that we take

2100
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:16,039
exogenously such as from smoking Canabis

2101
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:18,800
actually mimic or subsidize the natural

2102
01:24:16,039 --> 01:24:19,920
system so this is like news flash these

2103
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,639
folks because they don't teach it in

2104
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,119
medical school they don't teach it in

2105
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:25,760
pharmacy school it's not there yet it's

2106
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:27,840
only starting to show up now in the

2107
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,719
medical the medical documents and saw

2108
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:32,440
how they're teaching how the the

2109
01:24:29,719 --> 01:24:35,319
exogenous Med canids can actually impact

2110
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:38,119
and improve an individual's well-being

2111
01:24:35,319 --> 01:24:40,279
in listening to Dr michul I'm sure many

2112
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:43,118
of you know who he is he said that when

2113
01:24:40,279 --> 01:24:45,039
he did this profile in just canaval and

2114
01:24:43,118 --> 01:24:46,679
he was had a postto and they were seeing

2115
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:49,600
how many conditions of disease

2116
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:52,399
conditions of CBD or Canad impacted in a

2117
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:55,280
positive way he stopped personally at

2118
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:57,920
19 when he had his post off do his

2119
01:24:55,279 --> 01:24:59,759
research he found was 96 disease

2120
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:02,520
conditions that CBD had a positive

2121
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:05,520
impact on people's lives it's just

2122
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:07,840
really been the under Underdog of what

2123
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:10,119
the potentiation of this drug going

2124
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:13,279
forward so the medical community can

2125
01:25:10,118 --> 01:25:14,880
Snicker for now but I think with with

2126
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:16,719
time we're going to see that science is

2127
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,239
going to leave the charge on this and

2128
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:21,399
it's not going to happen overnight it's

2129
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:23,718
the the problem is that industry is is

2130
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:25,279
co to do things with a herbal product

2131
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:27,198
because going to be able to patent

2132
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:28,960
anything that it's done you where's your

2133
01:25:27,198 --> 01:25:31,719
return going to be on that investment

2134
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:33,319
there's nothing you can get now the

2135
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:35,679
truth of the matter is it's got to be a

2136
01:25:33,319 --> 01:25:37,519
sort of a public initiative the way that

2137
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,719
we keep it out of the hands of big

2138
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,119
corporate I don't want to be big

2139
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:41,239
corporate how do you keep it is making

2140
01:25:40,118 --> 01:25:43,479
sure that there isn't anything that

2141
01:25:41,238 --> 01:25:45,638
really can be patented that then they

2142
01:25:43,479 --> 01:25:47,439
can take advantage of now if you want to

2143
01:25:45,639 --> 01:25:50,159
see if you want that means it has to

2144
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:53,118
come from the public like ultimately we

2145
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:55,799
talk about accessing canus it should be

2146
01:25:53,118 --> 01:25:57,839
done PR but it should fall under the I

2147
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:00,159
think under the formul provinces all

2148
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:03,520
have formul and that way if it's under

2149
01:26:00,158 --> 01:26:05,319
formul it access like any other drug

2150
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:07,239
that we have that we we take advantage

2151
01:26:05,319 --> 01:26:08,319
of in our system and have share in them

2152
01:26:07,238 --> 01:26:09,879
and so it's just a matter of having the

2153
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:12,158
regulation how you get in on the formul

2154
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:15,000
so that has access for everybody I don't

2155
01:26:12,158 --> 01:26:16,839
you know I I I had a hard time listening

2156
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,560
to mothers what to choose between

2157
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,560
groceries and their medicine

2158
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,679
anybody else want to

2159
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:34,239
comment um I think a lot of the stigma

2160
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:36,079
that comes along with medical cannabis

2161
01:26:34,238 --> 01:26:38,439
or cannabis in general is because it's

2162
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:40,600
it's legal and that's all that's a huge

2163
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:42,279
portion of it uh I think it shouldn't be

2164
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:44,400
on the schedule it should be removed

2165
01:26:42,279 --> 01:26:45,719
moved down to a natural health product

2166
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:48,279
and then we can treat it like any other

2167
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:50,560
herbal product um it shouldn't be

2168
01:26:48,279 --> 01:26:52,519
special so it's it's a double-edged

2169
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,320
sword when we say that this product and

2170
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:56,840
this product alone needs to be treated

2171
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:58,679
very much like your naratic and and I

2172
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:00,360
think a lot of that statement is because

2173
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:02,480
we're prescribing something that

2174
01:27:00,359 --> 01:27:06,039
although it has medical applications we

2175
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:08,000
were told for 50 years it was bad um so

2176
01:27:06,039 --> 01:27:09,880
a strong step and a strong message would

2177
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,719
be to move it where it probably deserves

2178
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:13,840
to be which would be a natural health

2179
01:27:11,719 --> 01:27:15,399
product and then we move past all of

2180
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:16,880
this regulatory Quagmire and the

2181
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:18,519
provinces could just say okay we're

2182
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,159
going to deal with that and it makes it

2183
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:22,880
a lot simpler we're trying to you know

2184
01:27:21,158 --> 01:27:25,359
Jam a square peg in a round hole and

2185
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:28,079
it's creating a bu problems around

2186
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:28,079
stigma and

2187
01:27:33,319 --> 01:27:37,158
regulation an interesting history lesson

2188
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:40,199
at the end of alcohol prohibition

2189
01:27:37,158 --> 01:27:41,638
alcohol was available on prescription

2190
01:27:40,198 --> 01:27:43,279
and eventually it just moved into a

2191
01:27:41,639 --> 01:27:46,359
different model so I think we probably

2192
01:27:43,279 --> 01:27:46,359
need the same thing

2193
01:27:49,399 --> 01:27:55,319
here I guess just one thing to add is

2194
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:57,840
that I know medical CID saw this when R

2195
01:27:55,319 --> 01:27:59,920
Ambrose was in Vancouver talking on CBC

2196
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,880
Radio a few weeks ago you know it's

2197
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:05,679
turned into a political wedge issue more

2198
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,679
so in Canada than I think in the US for

2199
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:11,118
example where you have Republicans and

2200
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:12,600
Democrats talking about it and um I mean

2201
01:28:11,118 --> 01:28:15,198
it's not going to happen but we just

2202
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:18,440
have to pry it away from that being a

2203
01:28:15,198 --> 01:28:21,719
political issue into a regulatory

2204
01:28:18,439 --> 01:28:25,919
issue health issue an economics issue

2205
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:28,039
and not somebody sort of colel to hit

2206
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,399
their political opponent with which is

2207
01:28:28,039 --> 01:28:32,359
what it's turned into and unfortunately

2208
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:34,439
we may have a few more years of that in

2209
01:28:32,359 --> 01:28:38,479
Canada but that's one thing we need to

2210
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:38,479
do is to to to fix that

2211
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:44,920
problem we have time for a bonus

2212
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:48,400
question bonus round so we're going to

2213
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:50,600
jump to a entirely other topic um and I

2214
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:54,319
know that none of you are really experts

2215
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:55,600
in this space but um we

2216
01:28:54,319 --> 01:28:57,118
this is an important conversation that

2217
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,000
should be on the radar in Canada right

2218
01:28:57,118 --> 01:29:01,479
now at least I do and some of the folks

2219
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,679
are consulted on architecting these

2220
01:29:01,479 --> 01:29:06,678
questions do we have a sense of what the

2221
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:08,960
environmental and environmental impact

2222
01:29:06,679 --> 01:29:10,760
and what the carbon footprint is of

2223
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:15,319
cannabis production in Canada between

2224
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:17,360
the mmpr and the m and um illegal

2225
01:29:15,319 --> 01:29:20,079
cultivators do we have any sense of what

2226
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:24,158
the carbon footprint is and how can we

2227
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:24,158
start reducing it

2228
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:33,079
there was a study by a engineer or

2229
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:35,238
physicist in Berkeley California a few

2230
01:29:33,079 --> 01:29:37,920
years ago guy named Evan Mills who made

2231
01:29:35,238 --> 01:29:40,039
the news for some work he did on

2232
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:42,039
analyzing the sort of carbon footprint

2233
01:29:40,039 --> 01:29:45,158
of the Cannabis industry in California

2234
01:29:42,039 --> 01:29:48,719
and extrapolating from and mainly the

2235
01:29:45,158 --> 01:29:50,359
indoor um marijuana cultivation industry

2236
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:53,000
in California and extrapolating to the

2237
01:29:50,359 --> 01:29:54,839
rest of the US and the number he came up

2238
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,639
with was something like % of the

2239
01:29:54,840 --> 01:30:00,800
electricity consumed in the US was

2240
01:29:57,639 --> 01:30:04,639
towards used um towards marijuana

2241
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:06,960
production and 3% in California and the

2242
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:08,719
calculation was something like a joint

2243
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:11,520
which he calculated at about a third of

2244
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:14,000
a gram which is you know plus okay it's

2245
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,760
kind of a small joint it's like

2246
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:20,840
leaving leaving

2247
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:23,079
a 100 wat light bulb on for 75 hours in

2248
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:25,400
terms of the amount of power that goes

2249
01:30:23,079 --> 01:30:27,039
into that joint you know how you tell

2250
01:30:25,399 --> 01:30:29,118
your kids or something like turn off the

2251
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:32,560
lights when you leave the room you know

2252
01:30:29,118 --> 01:30:35,719
75 hours is that joint and so if you

2253
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:38,239
look at what health Canada has projected

2254
01:30:35,719 --> 01:30:40,840
and obviously nmpr is not growing very

2255
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:42,599
rapidly or as rapidly as people thought

2256
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:44,920
but if they're going to hit the number

2257
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:46,440
of patients is it three or 400,000

2258
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:49,960
projected by

2259
01:30:46,439 --> 01:30:51,839
2024 and you multiply that by you know

2260
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:53,480
Gram and a quarter a day and you know

2261
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,639
all the sort of stats and we're looking

2262
01:30:53,479 --> 01:30:57,198
at you

2263
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:59,560
the carbon or the energy consumption of

2264
01:30:57,198 --> 01:31:02,319
something like the city of C I think

2265
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:05,000
when you when you calculate all that and

2266
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:07,198
so if we're really focused and you know

2267
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,960
I visited till R and phip showed some

2268
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:11,118
really nice pictures this is a wonderful

2269
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:13,439
facility and as clean as a whistle and

2270
01:31:11,118 --> 01:31:16,639
I'm sure friend facility is equally

2271
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:19,519
amazing but this is like thick concrete

2272
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:21,400
and huge numbers of lights and we're you

2273
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:24,119
know putting a lot of energy into that

2274
01:31:21,399 --> 01:31:26,000
and there is it is a plant that this

2275
01:31:24,118 --> 01:31:28,679
sort of trick it's called photosynthesis

2276
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,399
and you know comes from the Sun as well

2277
01:31:28,679 --> 01:31:35,079
so and we also we know and and R knows

2278
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:38,479
this from driving around catula as I

2279
01:31:35,079 --> 01:31:40,279
have as well there's about about 90,000

2280
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:43,559
acres of hemp being grown this is

2281
01:31:40,279 --> 01:31:45,719
Cannabis sativa outdoor you know in big

2282
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:48,080
sections of L in tkatman and Manitoba

2283
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:49,439
and Alberta and it's the same plant and

2284
01:31:48,079 --> 01:31:52,039
it's actually producing a lot of the

2285
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:58,319
same chemistry not THC mind VI but you

2286
01:31:52,039 --> 01:32:00,600
know CBD DIC AET so I think you know how

2287
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:02,639
do you reconcile quality control and

2288
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:05,360
keeping everything as clean as you want

2289
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:08,239
for patients but not having to use

2290
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:09,719
artificial lighting maybe that's towards

2291
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:12,399
extracts and other things and

2292
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:16,079
derivatives that you can have crops that

2293
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:18,920
are grown Outdoors they're extracted for

2294
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:20,439
THC and CBD and other enteroids and

2295
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:22,679
other things you want and they're

2296
01:32:20,439 --> 01:32:24,399
processed into a clean standardized

2297
01:32:22,679 --> 01:32:26,399
extract

2298
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:29,279
you know HPS lights and all the other

2299
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:29,279
stuff that go all

2300
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:39,000
indors so I'd like to expand the

2301
01:32:37,079 --> 01:32:42,519
question the question was carbon

2302
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,719
footprint talk about social footprint so

2303
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:47,239
I was on the panel organized by Dan

2304
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:48,880
Larson the not to distant past and and I

2305
01:32:47,238 --> 01:32:51,039
was talking about the importance of not

2306
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,039
advertising cannabis and Mark Emory who

2307
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:54,319
was on the panel had a really

2308
01:32:52,039 --> 01:32:56,198
interesting response and what he said is

2309
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:58,519
but alcohol is advertised and the

2310
01:32:56,198 --> 01:33:01,719
Cannabis is less har harmful than

2311
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:03,520
alcohol and it substitutes as glucose

2312
01:33:01,719 --> 01:33:05,920
have pointed out that's a really good

2313
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,320
thing I thought his point was valid

2314
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,319
thought it was a very valid point so we

2315
01:33:07,319 --> 01:33:11,238
need to look not just at what cannabis

2316
01:33:09,319 --> 01:33:13,759
does in terms of carbon footprint but in

2317
01:33:11,238 --> 01:33:15,799
terms of health and burden of disease

2318
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:17,800
footprint and if it reduces consumption

2319
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:19,159
of alcohol which is quite frankly well I

2320
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:21,760
don't buy the model of hard drug and

2321
01:33:19,158 --> 01:33:24,839
soft drug but if I did alcohol is a hard

2322
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:27,440
drug and if cannabis reduced our social

2323
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:30,119
consumption of alcohol our general

2324
01:33:27,439 --> 01:33:30,118
society would be

2325
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,440
healthier WRA it up for us so we can

2326
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:39,520
take some questions from the audience

2327
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:42,678
sure on the question of how do we reduce

2328
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:44,719
our carbon footprint you know we have to

2329
01:33:42,679 --> 01:33:46,880
turn to technology to a certain extent

2330
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:48,920
too because yeah in the indoor

2331
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,639
cultivation it's all about the lights

2332
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,399
and about all the systems for managing

2333
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:54,880
humidity but you know we're not

2334
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:57,238
harnessing of the solar power potential

2335
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:59,199
that we have with it and all the other

2336
01:33:57,238 --> 01:34:00,599
efficiencies in terms of the equipment

2337
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:02,399
and some of the better technology that's

2338
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:05,239
coming up with equipment these days that

2339
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:08,000
can do these things and so to your point

2340
01:34:05,238 --> 01:34:10,039
the motivation has to be there to come

2341
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,439
up with better systems even though the

2342
01:34:10,039 --> 01:34:14,800
cost might be on know per kilow might be

2343
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:16,118
higher they can still be deployed in a

2344
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,560
much more meaningful way because

2345
01:34:16,118 --> 01:34:19,079
obviously if there's a roof and it has

2346
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:20,960
to be St there's those flat areas that

2347
01:34:19,079 --> 01:34:22,920
the solar panels can be know so it's not

2348
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:25,279
to say that it's going to be 100% turn

2349
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:27,319
turn around but I think that you know as

2350
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:30,039
the as the industry starts to grow we'll

2351
01:34:27,319 --> 01:34:32,599
start to learn to think about being more

2352
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:34,279
green and having to to rely to

2353
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,840
technology to sort of help to reduce

2354
01:34:34,279 --> 01:34:37,920
that carbon

2355
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:40,639
footprint thank

2356
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:43,199
you okay we hit on some topics that you

2357
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:45,279
found interesting and useful and okay

2358
01:34:43,198 --> 01:34:49,000
good so now I have some questions for

2359
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:52,000
you and you do not have to out yourself

2360
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,719
obviously if you don't want to um but

2361
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,118
I'm wondering how many people in the

2362
01:34:53,719 --> 01:34:57,520
room are associated with a medical

2363
01:34:55,118 --> 01:34:57,519
canvas

2364
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:04,920
dispensary okay and how many people in

2365
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:08,920
the room are associated with a licensed

2366
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:11,560
producer okay and how many people are

2367
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:13,880
associated with a clinic that is

2368
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:16,000
authorizing patients access to either

2369
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:20,880
dispensaries or

2370
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:22,439
LPS okay and um how many people and

2371
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:25,239
again you don't have to out yourself if

2372
01:35:22,439 --> 01:35:27,879
you don't want to people in the room use

2373
01:35:25,238 --> 01:35:27,879
cannabis as a

2374
01:35:28,279 --> 01:35:36,719
medicine okay um are there researchers

2375
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:39,000
here any researchers great uh any

2376
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:41,000
media maybe the guy behind the camera

2377
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:45,198
you count as

2378
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:47,279
media yeah great excellent um and are

2379
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:50,479
there folks here who are really here to

2380
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:53,679
learn and are looking to um find a place

2381
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:57,479
to get involved in in this business a

2382
01:35:53,679 --> 01:36:00,118
few of you okay great now how many of

2383
01:35:57,479 --> 01:36:01,359
you have a question or a comment that

2384
01:36:00,118 --> 01:36:04,519
you'd like to

2385
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:07,679
make let's have a look not a ton of

2386
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:10,840
you oh well maybe we'll get warmed up a

2387
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:13,399
little bit so is there somebody in the

2388
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:16,079
room who uses cannabis as medicine who

2389
01:36:13,399 --> 01:36:18,439
would like to ask a question patients

2390
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:20,158
first and you might speaking up afraid

2391
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:22,000
we don't have a a roving mic if it

2392
01:36:20,158 --> 01:36:24,839
doesn't work you can come on up here

2393
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,359
it's all right I'm really loud

2394
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:28,079
uh is it all right if it's not a

2395
01:36:26,359 --> 01:36:30,279
question associated with my medical use

2396
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:31,840
of cannabis no yeah no I just wanted to

2397
01:36:30,279 --> 01:36:33,519
give somebody who uses cannabis as a

2398
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,960
medicine the first right to speak so you

2399
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,719
can ask whatever you want try and keep

2400
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:41,079
it to a minute if you can okay uh I just

2401
01:36:37,719 --> 01:36:43,800
had a question um Mark made me think

2402
01:36:41,079 --> 01:36:45,639
about it a little bit um and it's in

2403
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,719
regards to spreading the wealth a little

2404
01:36:45,639 --> 01:36:49,880
bit and reducing harm by spreading

2405
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:53,239
spreading the wealth of this emerging

2406
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:55,440
industry and I want to be really aware

2407
01:36:53,238 --> 01:36:58,439
um cognizant about all of the people

2408
01:36:55,439 --> 01:37:01,599
that we know people in this room that we

2409
01:36:58,439 --> 01:37:04,559
know who support their families and

2410
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:07,199
their livelihood has been in producing

2411
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:09,560
cannabis um in the cottage underground

2412
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:11,960
industry for the last 40 years in this

2413
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:14,199
province it's a huge part of our economy

2414
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:16,118
and how do we store those people out of

2415
01:37:14,198 --> 01:37:19,039
an illegal industry and into this

2416
01:37:16,118 --> 01:37:20,599
emerging legal industry because for me

2417
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:23,279
it seems like

2418
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:24,840
something that's might be underreported

2419
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:26,719
but it's going to be on the scale of

2420
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:28,880
like the end of the Cod fishery in

2421
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:31,399
Newland personally I feel like it's on

2422
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:34,000
the same level that's a economic tragedy

2423
01:37:31,399 --> 01:37:37,519
that's coming toward VC and I would like

2424
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,520
for us to talk about that a little

2425
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:46,560
bit I think what you're saying is really

2426
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,239
important actually and at the end of

2427
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,440
alcohol prohibition there was a a

2428
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:53,919
thoughtful process that included the

2429
01:37:50,439 --> 01:37:56,039
illegal dealers um in the new laan and

2430
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:58,199
so what we see is bronin is now secret

2431
01:37:56,039 --> 01:38:00,000
so a completely illegal process is now a

2432
01:37:58,198 --> 01:38:02,158
completely legal one so I think it's

2433
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,679
actually really really important um so

2434
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:06,559
acknowledged as a huge issue and that's

2435
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:08,599
partly why I say we need to keep it

2436
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:11,080
small and I think we should keep it

2437
01:38:08,599 --> 01:38:13,279
small and include the legal Growers and

2438
01:38:11,079 --> 01:38:16,679
dealers whatever the whole process and

2439
01:38:13,279 --> 01:38:18,880
it's not just um livelihoods but it's

2440
01:38:16,679 --> 01:38:20,760
also the whole galarian issue so it's

2441
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,480
both it's very very important Point yes

2442
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:25,440
and we're not right now not

2443
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:25,439
acknowledging that point

2444
01:38:25,599 --> 01:38:30,159
just to add I mean I I think it's it's

2445
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:32,159
clear it's a very much sort of rural

2446
01:38:30,158 --> 01:38:33,879
development type issue in BC as well

2447
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:36,839
where we've you know seen I grew up on

2448
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:38,440
Ben R you know logging sort of declin

2449
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:40,719
where Crews were large and then they

2450
01:38:38,439 --> 01:38:42,960
were extremely small and fishing kind of

2451
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:45,198
declined as well but you know marijuana

2452
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:47,719
production certainly supplemented the

2453
01:38:45,198 --> 01:38:51,000
income of lots of resource workers and

2454
01:38:47,719 --> 01:38:53,480
others as well in in places like uh you

2455
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:56,840
know go the golf Island and the cies and

2456
01:38:53,479 --> 01:38:59,238
you know the extension of M under with

2457
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:02,239
the Aller case has sort of kept that

2458
01:38:59,238 --> 01:39:03,959
going I think in some ways but not you

2459
01:39:02,238 --> 01:39:06,039
know one of the things also is price

2460
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:09,079
fluctuations has changed the business a

2461
01:39:06,039 --> 01:39:12,238
lot in Washington state legalizing has

2462
01:39:09,079 --> 01:39:13,800
changed things a lot so um but I I do

2463
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:16,718
think that you know if you talk to car

2464
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:18,960
dealers in the cies about you know where

2465
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:22,279
pickup trucks were funded by I mean it

2466
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:24,239
was a huge part of of uh of those

2467
01:39:22,279 --> 01:39:26,639
economies it could up then you're right

2468
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:31,279
it's like the C fishery or or another

2469
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:31,279
industry that could go the way the

2470
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:37,520
doo one of the conundrums is going to be

2471
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:40,119
in the in the drivers in in the debate

2472
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:42,199
is the standards which safety and the

2473
01:39:40,118 --> 01:39:45,279
quality control L is going to weigh into

2474
01:39:42,198 --> 01:39:47,439
this and both federally and provincially

2475
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:49,920
what they're going to demand there be

2476
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:51,678
because there's a tradeoff it's it's

2477
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:54,560
easier to grow but if there's all these

2478
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:56,639
other requirements quality control and

2479
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:59,360
testing and and things that are required

2480
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:01,719
to do and the things of safety those all

2481
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:03,118
cost money they all stack up and so then

2482
01:40:01,719 --> 01:40:05,399
it becomes a function of you know

2483
01:40:03,118 --> 01:40:07,639
straight economis of scale that's where

2484
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:09,759
the problem comes in because you can't

2485
01:40:07,639 --> 01:40:11,800
at some point you can't produce it cheap

2486
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:13,239
enough if all the criteria the bar keeps

2487
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:15,679
getting higher and higher and you have

2488
01:40:13,238 --> 01:40:17,319
to have enough horsepower enough assets

2489
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:19,399
on the ground in order to make to go of

2490
01:40:17,319 --> 01:40:21,439
it so they have to like it's a scat the

2491
01:40:19,399 --> 01:40:25,319
analogy I use a lot of times is scat no

2492
01:40:21,439 --> 01:40:28,319
was a k going on theage size was about a

2493
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:29,920
section or 640 acres right and the

2494
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:31,319
economy changed and everything else has

2495
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:34,279
moved forward the average Farm size

2496
01:40:31,319 --> 01:40:36,759
today SC is 5,000 Acres it's not

2497
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:38,439
uncommon to see a father and son

2498
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:40,840
managing just two of them managing

2499
01:40:38,439 --> 01:40:43,399
10,000 acres you know it's just because

2500
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:45,840
economies of scale equipment got bigger

2501
01:40:43,399 --> 01:40:47,559
price qu now that was just a Natural

2502
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:49,119
Evolution so I'm just saying from a

2503
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:50,960
standpoint of thinking about this in the

2504
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:52,759
future it all is I think a lot is going

2505
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,239
to be driven by what the government

2506
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:56,760
bodies are going to demand how how the

2507
01:40:55,238 --> 01:40:58,678
product should be shaped how it should

2508
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:00,719
be made safe for patients I think that's

2509
01:40:58,679 --> 01:41:03,239
going to drive a lot of

2510
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:06,039
that I just wanted to add that you know

2511
01:41:03,238 --> 01:41:08,678
in uh in Colorado they created 10,000

2512
01:41:06,039 --> 01:41:12,079
jobs in a year for canvas

2513
01:41:08,679 --> 01:41:13,560
legalization um incredible really I

2514
01:41:12,079 --> 01:41:16,158
don't think that these jobs are going

2515
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:18,880
away by any means 70 about 50% of the

2516
01:41:16,158 --> 01:41:20,559
jobs at till rate are uh are actually

2517
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:23,440
production jobs right now working

2518
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:24,880
directly with the plant um that's I

2519
01:41:23,439 --> 01:41:27,198
completely agree that the shift is going

2520
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:29,079
to be to some extent out of some rural

2521
01:41:27,198 --> 01:41:31,439
areas and maybe into more populated

2522
01:41:29,079 --> 01:41:33,960
areas but out of uh the employment that

2523
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:36,158
t has created we've created about twice

2524
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:37,920
that much just in ancillary Services as

2525
01:41:36,158 --> 01:41:40,519
well and right now we're working with

2526
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:42,118
biu specifically develop curriculum with

2527
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:44,760
their Horticultural program and their

2528
01:41:42,118 --> 01:41:46,559
MBA program so that their students can

2529
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:49,280
come right in at tillay and know the

2530
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:50,840
system that we're working in so I and

2531
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:52,679
I'm not suggesting by any means that

2532
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:54,159
this is only going to be governed by by

2533
01:41:52,679 --> 01:41:55,800
big is there's going to be small and

2534
01:41:54,158 --> 01:41:57,559
mediumsized companies as well I think

2535
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,039
that actually there's there's going to

2536
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:00,880
be that's one of the big shifts we're

2537
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:02,880
going to see in the next few years is

2538
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,920
these Niche producers and Niche areas

2539
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,679
and I think that uh that even Whistler

2540
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:08,639
in some ways is doing that right now as

2541
01:42:06,679 --> 01:42:10,639
well by producing Organics so I don't

2542
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:12,599
think these jobs are going away I think

2543
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:14,760
they will come up from the underground

2544
01:42:12,599 --> 01:42:16,920
and I think that you know even when I

2545
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:19,560
ran a dispensary for 10 years when

2546
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:21,560
people start growing medical marijuana

2547
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:23,360
and they do so on a more legitimate

2548
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:25,280
basis rather than just growing for for

2549
01:42:23,359 --> 01:42:27,039
the recreational Market they can start

2550
01:42:25,279 --> 01:42:29,319
talking to their friends and family

2551
01:42:27,039 --> 01:42:30,719
about it they cannot have this dichotomy

2552
01:42:29,319 --> 01:42:32,799
in their lives where they have to hide

2553
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:34,719
what they're doing from half the people

2554
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:36,440
they know and and you know only express

2555
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:38,520
it with the other half and I think that

2556
01:42:36,439 --> 01:42:42,039
as this as this industry legitimizes

2557
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,040
that's what we're going to see

2558
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:52,158
[Applause]

2559
01:42:53,719 --> 01:42:56,639
hang on just a second can everybody be

2560
01:42:55,079 --> 01:42:57,679
really quiet for a minute so that we can

2561
01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:00,480
hear this

2562
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:03,000
voice I just wanted to point out that

2563
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:05,839
although um there may be a lot of jobs

2564
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,840
that are created I think that that is a

2565
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:10,440
very different kind of job to go from

2566
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:12,279
being Your Own Boss having your own

2567
01:43:10,439 --> 01:43:14,879
business to becoming an employee and

2568
01:43:12,279 --> 01:43:16,960
that's a significant pay cut so instead

2569
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:19,840
of having your own shop you're suddenly

2570
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:21,800
an employee at Walmart that makes a huge

2571
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,880
difference to all of those families so I

2572
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:26,679
don't think it's the same

2573
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:28,480
and I think it's a bit mising to say

2574
01:43:26,679 --> 01:43:31,639
these jobs are being created when it's

2575
01:43:28,479 --> 01:43:34,198
uo all of these other small businesses

2576
01:43:31,639 --> 01:43:38,359
that provide a much larger amount of

2577
01:43:34,198 --> 01:43:38,359
money to those families thank

2578
01:43:42,238 --> 01:43:46,718
you do we have any other questions or

2579
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:50,239
comments from the

2580
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:53,198
floor you were pretty

2581
01:43:50,238 --> 01:43:55,638
quick I've always thought that when call

2582
01:43:53,198 --> 01:43:58,960
would say they created 10,000 jobs it

2583
01:43:55,639 --> 01:44:02,359
was more that they surfaced 10,000 jobs

2584
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:04,480
is what I suspect that's what you were

2585
01:44:02,359 --> 01:44:06,598
my my question was in the carbon

2586
01:44:04,479 --> 01:44:08,638
footprint

2587
01:44:06,599 --> 01:44:12,159
discussion there appeared to be a

2588
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:14,960
perceived dichotomy between doing stuff

2589
01:44:12,158 --> 01:44:17,319
indoors and having excellent quality

2590
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:20,399
control and doing stuff outdoors and

2591
01:44:17,319 --> 01:44:22,759
being able to use the Sun and therefore

2592
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:25,198
not have a big carbon footprint but

2593
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:27,639
remember dve David Hutchinson telling me

2594
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:30,479
a couple years ago about this amazing

2595
01:44:27,639 --> 01:44:34,400
technology where you can grow indoors

2596
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:34,399
and use a sun called a

2597
01:44:35,359 --> 01:44:42,479
greenhouse

2598
01:44:38,279 --> 01:44:46,840
that a viable alternative in terms

2599
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:49,079
of yes sure under the under the mmpr it

2600
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:51,159
certainly is but it's kind of

2601
01:44:49,079 --> 01:44:52,639
restrictive and they make it somewhat

2602
01:44:51,158 --> 01:44:55,879
difficult for the licensed producers to

2603
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:57,880
prod it can be done and it is being done

2604
01:44:55,880 --> 01:45:00,118
um green houses especially in lower

2605
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:02,520
Vancouver work very well they get full

2606
01:45:00,118 --> 01:45:04,399
full year round growing uh I think in

2607
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,960
the carbon footprint thing and talking

2608
01:45:04,399 --> 01:45:08,279
about derivatives I'm just going to plug

2609
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:10,319
the derivatives here is the idea is is

2610
01:45:08,279 --> 01:45:12,679
is that the the growth in this market if

2611
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:15,158
we were given the chance to would be in

2612
01:45:12,679 --> 01:45:17,279
derivatives uh I can't imagine that raw

2613
01:45:15,158 --> 01:45:18,879
cannabis would be more than 20% of the

2614
01:45:17,279 --> 01:45:20,880
total market share in 10 years all

2615
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:22,639
everything's equal uh the nice thing

2616
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:25,480
about derivative products is you don't

2617
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:27,039
have to to grow indoors uh a lot of what

2618
01:45:25,479 --> 01:45:28,479
we've seen adopted in all these legal

2619
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:30,158
markets all over the place are actually

2620
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:33,079
functions of prohibition so they've

2621
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:35,238
taken an IL legal Market or elicit and

2622
01:45:33,079 --> 01:45:36,880
moved it to the elicit Market U coming

2623
01:45:35,238 --> 01:45:39,519
back to the jobs part of that is the

2624
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:42,000
prices that that people pay right now

2625
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:43,800
are based on prohibition and I think

2626
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,840
we're going to see a market correction

2627
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:47,880
and any if you look at the wine industry

2628
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:49,679
uh it gets priced to a point where you

2629
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:51,800
don't really make money making wine in

2630
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:53,158
your basement and so all these people

2631
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:54,639
that are growing illegally right now

2632
01:45:53,158 --> 01:45:57,198
that do make a lot of money and that it

2633
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:58,800
would be a shame to see those jobs lost

2634
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:00,799
uh will need to transition into the

2635
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:02,960
legal Market because eventually this

2636
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:04,920
artificial price which is based on

2637
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:06,480
artificial scarcity through regulation

2638
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:08,359
it's going to disappear and there's no

2639
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:10,238
two about it so you just have to be

2640
01:46:08,359 --> 01:46:11,639
aware of that and transition out and of

2641
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:13,039
course outdoor production would be a

2642
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:14,599
large part there's no reason we

2643
01:46:13,039 --> 01:46:18,760
shouldn't be growing massive fields of

2644
01:46:14,599 --> 01:46:23,720
outdoor cannabis in Colona it's perfect

2645
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:23,720
[Applause]

2646
01:46:26,279 --> 01:46:30,840
one of the difficulties that's going to

2647
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:34,479
come into this is

2648
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:36,520
how how organizations how how government

2649
01:46:34,479 --> 01:46:38,439
not only regulate this industry from

2650
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:39,800
within the country but also what happens

2651
01:46:38,439 --> 01:46:42,919
from imports and

2652
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:44,800
exports we had know we were involved in

2653
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:47,560
the neutral industry way back in the

2654
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,960
early days we had a number of farmers

2655
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:51,639
and a and a budding industry that was

2656
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:53,639
getting started in the neutr industry we

2657
01:46:51,639 --> 01:46:56,719
were supplying them plet

2658
01:46:53,639 --> 01:46:58,359
and it didn't take inside of three years

2659
01:46:56,719 --> 01:47:02,158
before they started sourcing it from

2660
01:46:58,359 --> 01:47:05,238
Southeast Asia it compl completely wiped

2661
01:47:02,158 --> 01:47:07,399
out the neutral production in western

2662
01:47:05,238 --> 01:47:11,399
Canada completely wiped it out because

2663
01:47:07,399 --> 01:47:13,920
of the economics and the world and so if

2664
01:47:11,399 --> 01:47:15,439
we successfully in moving this continum

2665
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:17,319
you've got to be aware that the next

2666
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:20,919
dragon that will show up is that will be

2667
01:47:17,319 --> 01:47:24,920
facing incoming product from India and

2668
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:28,079
from Southeast Asia Jamaica and it'll be

2669
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:30,719
really Dirt Cheap it will drive the

2670
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:32,319
farmers out of business here so they

2671
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:34,158
have to be careful of what we wish for

2672
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:36,039
because we need a regulatory framework

2673
01:47:34,158 --> 01:47:38,079
that protects against some of that

2674
01:47:36,039 --> 01:47:40,079
otherwise all the Farms including arms

2675
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:42,198
will be non-existent but it'll go to the

2676
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:44,359
price the lowest common arm if the

2677
01:47:42,198 --> 01:47:45,598
Contin continues to go if we don't learn

2678
01:47:44,359 --> 01:47:47,000
our lessons from what happened to the

2679
01:47:45,599 --> 01:47:49,319
neutral

2680
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,800
business thank you some great

2681
01:47:49,319 --> 01:47:52,519
conversations I'd love to take another

2682
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,840
question from a woman if there's a woman

2683
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,840
that

2684
01:47:55,198 --> 01:47:59,799
question go

2685
01:47:56,840 --> 01:48:01,679
ahead uh I'm here uh on behalf of the BC

2686
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:04,320
Compassion Club Society most of you

2687
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:07,480
probably know us we are uh the boringest

2688
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:09,759
dispensary in Canada um and we've been

2689
01:48:07,479 --> 01:48:12,359
around for 18 years we provide hundreds

2690
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:14,039
of thousands of dollars every year in

2691
01:48:12,359 --> 01:48:16,118
other treatment options as well as

2692
01:48:14,039 --> 01:48:19,439
cannabis so my question to the panel

2693
01:48:16,118 --> 01:48:21,238
probably to Mark um is as people that

2694
01:48:19,439 --> 01:48:23,158
profit off of medicine what is our

2695
01:48:21,238 --> 01:48:25,759
responsibility what's Our obligation to

2696
01:48:23,158 --> 01:48:25,759
give back to

2697
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:36,400
patients it's a really interesting

2698
01:48:33,719 --> 01:48:39,439
question so

2699
01:48:36,399 --> 01:48:40,960
uh I'm not sure what the answer is I'm

2700
01:48:39,439 --> 01:48:43,839
really interested in how the money flows

2701
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:46,239
so I I'll start with a larger answer um

2702
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:47,800
so if we look at a public health

2703
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:49,799
approach a public health approach says

2704
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:52,279
the money should be funned back so it

2705
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:53,719
shouldn't be used just for General

2706
01:48:52,279 --> 01:48:55,000
Revenue so if you think about

2707
01:48:53,719 --> 01:48:56,239
governments generally when governments

2708
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,439
make money they stick at the General

2709
01:48:56,238 --> 01:49:00,198
Revenue and then they spend it on

2710
01:48:57,439 --> 01:49:03,919
whatever including buying votes so I

2711
01:49:00,198 --> 01:49:05,519
think that that in a in a public health

2712
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:08,000
model the money should basically be

2713
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:09,560
funneled into public health initiatives

2714
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,800
and it could be mental health treatment

2715
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:12,360
it could be addics treatment quite

2716
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,360
frankly it could be high quality

2717
01:49:12,359 --> 01:49:16,479
education our education system is not

2718
01:49:14,359 --> 01:49:19,399
doing well right now and so putting it

2719
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:20,919
into high schools and primary schools um

2720
01:49:19,399 --> 01:49:22,359
so essentially in the model that the

2721
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:24,639
health officers Council of myself for

2722
01:49:22,359 --> 01:49:26,479
advocating for we would the the

2723
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:28,639
commission would funnel the money but it

2724
01:49:26,479 --> 01:49:31,678
would funnel the money into things that

2725
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:33,319
support Public Health that's part of my

2726
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:35,199
question that's part of your that's part

2727
01:49:33,319 --> 01:49:37,079
of my answer but I think my

2728
01:49:35,198 --> 01:49:38,519
understanding of your organization is

2729
01:49:37,079 --> 01:49:40,880
you do have this whole other thing that

2730
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:43,080
you do get back which is your your other

2731
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:45,359
medicines piece which is actually pretty

2732
01:49:43,079 --> 01:49:47,319
cool um when I took a tour of it a few a

2733
01:49:45,359 --> 01:49:48,439
little while ago um I was impressed I

2734
01:49:47,319 --> 01:49:49,880
was impressed with the fact that it

2735
01:49:48,439 --> 01:49:51,919
wasn't just about cannabis it was about

2736
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:54,920
healing and I thought you did a good job

2737
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,920
for that so thank

2738
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:58,470
[Music]

2739
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:58,470
[Applause]

2740
01:49:59,238 --> 01:50:05,158
you in the red CH okay um on healing I

2741
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:07,719
think that's a good point to hear uh

2742
01:50:05,158 --> 01:50:09,839
healing is the endogenous ability of

2743
01:50:07,719 --> 01:50:12,000
life to return from a state of disease

2744
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:13,800
to a state of health and this is what

2745
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,118
medicine is all about is is healing

2746
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:17,880
patients and cannabis and this goes to

2747
01:50:16,118 --> 01:50:19,479
the environmental side is a holistic

2748
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:21,118
medicine and what I mean is the whole is

2749
01:50:19,479 --> 01:50:24,039
greater than the sum of its parts so we

2750
01:50:21,118 --> 01:50:26,479
say you know it's a plant takes Co CO2

2751
01:50:24,039 --> 01:50:27,800
out of the air and produces oxygen and

2752
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:30,079
as was said before it can take

2753
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:32,159
radioactive elements out of soil so it's

2754
01:50:30,079 --> 01:50:34,519
not THC it's not the tpes the whole

2755
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:36,799
planted genome and its life cycle is

2756
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:38,480
healing the planet not just the patients

2757
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:40,920
that need it but through its growth

2758
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:42,959
cycle it it is beneficial for the whole

2759
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:45,039
planet and it's going to heal all of us

2760
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:47,480
together but we need to find sustainable

2761
01:50:45,039 --> 01:50:49,599
methods for producing it in sync with

2762
01:50:47,479 --> 01:50:51,799
our ecosystems and we can have something

2763
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:53,920
that is you know going to change the

2764
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:55,400
world in a very POS positive way but it

2765
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,520
has we have to think about that and

2766
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:58,279
think about the whole chain of

2767
01:50:56,520 --> 01:51:00,040
production because with Pharmaceuticals

2768
01:50:58,279 --> 01:51:02,118
it starts with oil and it's taken out of

2769
01:51:00,039 --> 01:51:03,760
the ground and it's refined and then

2770
01:51:02,118 --> 01:51:05,319
it's transported and then there's a

2771
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:07,199
synthesis and all these steps are

2772
01:51:05,319 --> 01:51:09,198
releasing pollutants and releasing CO2

2773
01:51:07,198 --> 01:51:11,598
so we're moving to a new way where we're

2774
01:51:09,198 --> 01:51:13,479
producing medicine sustainably and we

2775
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:14,840
can produce medicine where it's public

2776
01:51:13,479 --> 01:51:16,919
health thing everybody's getting

2777
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:20,670
healthier because of the way we're doing

2778
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:25,560
things and this is where it needs to go

2779
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:27,440
[Music]

2780
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:29,599
I just actually going to make a point to

2781
01:51:27,439 --> 01:51:32,439
respond to the fellow L

2782
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:34,560
and over here about about business

2783
01:51:32,439 --> 01:51:36,759
opportunities and I think I think this

2784
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:38,320
is one of the most exciting times in

2785
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:40,320
history I think we'll look back in 50

2786
01:51:38,319 --> 01:51:42,439
years from out and say wow we missed a

2787
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:45,198
huge opportunity I think for any mm

2788
01:51:42,439 --> 01:51:47,879
grower start a business do what do what

2789
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:49,439
Chuck raizy over here did two years ago

2790
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:51,800
nobody heard a tweet you know tweet is a

2791
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:54,919
Canadian success story because they had

2792
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:57,480
the foresight and and the you know the

2793
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:59,440
wherewithal to to go and and raise money

2794
01:51:57,479 --> 01:52:01,879
and do what it takes to to build a

2795
01:51:59,439 --> 01:52:03,078
business um and there's no reason that

2796
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:04,359
you can't do the same there's no reason

2797
01:52:03,078 --> 01:52:07,158
that you can't do the same no the

2798
01:52:04,359 --> 01:52:08,319
reality is till is a far far long way

2799
01:52:07,158 --> 01:52:11,118
away from being

2800
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:12,559
Walmart they their startup business and

2801
01:52:11,118 --> 01:52:14,000

2802
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:15,520
20 years in this space it's going to be

2803
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,279
really exciting to see you look at the

2804
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,159
companies on the board Apple Organics

2805

behind that you know what who who knows

2807
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:24,560
where that company could go for no

2808
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,210
reason that you can't do the same thing

2809
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,810
right so thank

2819
01:52:49,158 --> 01:52:55,359
medicinal uh aspect of things but I am

2820
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:57,238
very exced that you are talking about

2821
01:52:55,359 --> 01:53:00,960
sustainability U and I think it's going

2822
01:52:57,238 --> 01:53:03,879
to be critical as both the medicinal and

2823
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:08,880
the recreational or legal Market moves

2824
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:08,880
forward I think sustainability is

2825
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:16,199
critical started the beginning tonight

2826
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:19,679
talking about how little harm can does

2827
01:53:16,198 --> 01:53:22,638
that fraction of people that have haveed

2828
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:25,599
immune systems

2829
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:27,800
doctors need talk prescribe medicines

2830
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:29,360
because they have this real harmful

2831
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:32,679
effect that it Tak so many times more

2832
01:53:29,359 --> 01:53:34,960
than you're supposed to have at all if

2833
01:53:32,679 --> 01:53:37,000
you want to end stigmatization and the

2834
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:39,880
reaper M stop talking about Public

2835
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,880
Safety alcohol is so much more harmful

2836
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:44,800
prescription drugs cigarettes water is

2837
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:46,400
more harmful than Canabis that's where

2838
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:48,880
the real problem I see is happening

2839
01:53:46,399 --> 01:53:51,078
right now our government Vancouver we

2840
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:53,639
need to have dispensaries 300 me three

2841
01:53:51,078 --> 01:53:56,399
football fields schools because kids

2842
01:53:53,639 --> 01:53:57,599
can't see marijuana leads in in Windows

2843
01:53:56,399 --> 01:53:59,839
Mark you said there shouldn't be any

2844
01:53:57,599 --> 01:54:01,159
products for Visible I see liquor stores

2845
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,199
all over the place with their products

2846
01:54:01,158 --> 01:54:05,559
in the windows and big signs saying come

2847
01:54:03,198 --> 01:54:07,198
and drink our booze I mean we're living

2848
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:09,480
in a crazy world and we're having these

2849
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:11,759
kind of discussions and all this money

2850
01:54:09,479 --> 01:54:14,399
on Public Safety about the number one

2851
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:16,720
safest thing in our environment my God

[Applause]

2854
01:54:17,409 --> 01:54:23,599
[Music]

2855
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:25,439
comment yeah um can I just address that

2856
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:27,239
one first uh using liquor as your

2857
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:28,759
measuring stick is probably a bad idea

2858
01:54:27,238 --> 01:54:32,559
just because they do it doesn't mean we

2859
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:34,039
should one two there are actually harms

2860
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:36,360
associated with cannabis use if it

2861
01:54:34,039 --> 01:54:38,000
doesn't come with education hyper mesis

2862
01:54:36,359 --> 01:54:41,198
syndrome is something that we're seeing

2863
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,760
more frequently unchecked the the the

2864
01:54:41,198 --> 01:54:44,759
the work that we've done in the Cannabis

2865
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:47,520
industry to show that it's healing and

2866
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:49,239
helpful put backfire I understand where

2867
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,920
you're coming from but there's a step

2868
01:54:49,238 --> 01:54:54,078
and a path for everything and you know

2869
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:58,118
we're thatth and it may just take a

2870
01:54:54,078 --> 01:54:58,118
little longer than everyone here is

2871
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:04,920
[Music]

2872
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:06,199
hoping it's interesting to look at the

2873
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:09,118
different tracks that alcohol and

2874
01:55:06,198 --> 01:55:12,799
tobacco were on over a 40e period when I

2875
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:15,399
first bought alcohol and in Ontario X

2876
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:17,239
number of years ago um I walked into a

2877
01:55:15,399 --> 01:55:19,359
blank room with black and white text on

2878
01:55:17,238 --> 01:55:21,479
the wall I filled out a pencil fil card

2879
01:55:19,359 --> 01:55:23,880
that I handed to somebody there was no

2880
01:55:21,479 --> 01:55:26,399
product in sight no advertising in sight

2881
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:27,719
he handed me back a brown paper bag I

2882
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:29,519
didn't actually get to see the label of

2883
01:55:27,719 --> 01:55:32,960
any alcohol product so I walked out the

2884
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:34,520
door slowly over the years we've moved

2885
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:37,760
away from a public health model to

2886
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:39,840
regulating alcohol but we've increased

2887
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:42,440
our Public Health involvement with

2888
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:44,400
tobacco so tobacco has gone from being

2889
01:55:42,439 --> 01:55:46,399
wide St and advertised advertised on

2890
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:48,920
television advertising magazines you

2891
01:55:46,399 --> 01:55:51,759
know X number of doctors recommend

2892
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:52,840
smoking tobacco is was the advertising

2893
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:55,560
of the day

2894
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:57,119
30 years ago 40 years ago um and we have

2895
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:58,760
a a public health model for the

2896
01:55:57,118 --> 01:56:00,039
regulation of tobacco more so we haven't

2897
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:02,800
got there yet you know we still have

2898
01:56:00,039 --> 01:56:04,319
branded products and uh the warning sign

2899
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:06,440
isn't the whole package yet and it's

2900
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:08,679
still colorful logoed but we're getting

2901
01:56:06,439 --> 01:56:11,198
there so slowly the public health model

2902
01:56:08,679 --> 01:56:13,078
increasing with tobacco but decreasing

2903
01:56:11,198 --> 01:56:14,559
with alcohol so I think that we need to

2904
01:56:13,078 --> 01:56:16,198
look at both of those and say which one

2905
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:18,000
of those do we want with with cannabis

2906
01:56:16,198 --> 01:56:19,598
and I would recommend that we have a

2907
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:22,539
public health approach to regulation

2908
01:56:19,599 --> 01:56:26,039
cannabis

2909
01:56:22,539 --> 01:56:28,078
[Applause]

2910
01:56:26,039 --> 01:56:30,519
thank you Hillary um I just want to

2911

2913
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:37,599
this room and I see the most incredible

2914
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:41,800
room of Advocates

2915
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:43,319

2917
01:56:43,319 --> 01:56:47,078
and energy within this room and I

2918
01:56:45,319 --> 01:56:48,679
respect all of the people sat on the

2919
01:56:47,078 --> 01:56:51,319

2920
01:56:48,679 --> 01:56:52,920
arranging this this is quite exceptional

2921
01:56:51,319 --> 01:56:54,439
one thing as I see one elephant in the

2922
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:56,560
room is we still have a federal

2923
01:56:54,439 --> 01:56:58,960
government we have a health Minister as

2924
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:00,880
the BC people know because she was here

2925
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:04,158
just a couple of weeks ago publicly

2926
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:06,359
stating that marijuana is not medicine

2927
01:57:04,158 --> 01:57:09,920
how do we how do we get them away from

2928
01:57:06,359 --> 01:57:09,920
that mindset or is are they a lost

2929
01:57:11,619 --> 01:57:17,920
[Music]

2930
01:57:14,679 --> 01:57:20,039
course I was talk to my dad about two

2931
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:23,319
weeks ago about the the bows of Health

2932
01:57:20,039 --> 01:57:25,439
Canada and I know I've had 15 years of

2933
01:57:23,319 --> 01:57:27,960
Health

2934
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:31,118
Canada previous to that I helped my dad

2935
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:33,158
build a a CDO of a community based

2936
01:57:31,118 --> 01:57:35,598
organization dedicated the care of

2937
01:57:33,158 --> 01:57:37,158
intellectual disability adults in

2938
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:39,039
helping them get meaningful work and

2939
01:57:37,158 --> 01:57:41,359
helping them give lifestock and I said

2940
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:44,399
to him you know it's not much of a

2941
01:57:41,359 --> 01:57:47,559
stretch when it had to deal with health

2942
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:50,839
Canada just

2943
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:52,560
saying I don't think the federal

2944
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:53,920
government is going to move from Their

2945
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,920
Fear

2946
01:57:53,920 --> 01:58:00,440
Paradigm they have their their entire

2947
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:02,399
their entire modus OPI is based on fear

2948
01:58:00,439 --> 01:58:03,598
fear of coming out of the box fear of

2949
01:58:02,399 --> 01:58:05,920
doing anything that's going to make them

2950
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:07,360
not get elected and it's it transcends

2951
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:09,960
right down to the bureaucracy fear of

2952
01:58:07,359 --> 01:58:11,279
getting fired if make a wrong decision

2953
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:13,599
after working with them it's all based

2954
01:58:11,279 --> 01:58:15,719
on fear that's their big motivator now

2955
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:18,078
they really try really hard because they

2956
01:58:15,719 --> 01:58:20,760
know that they're accountable to us the

2957
01:58:18,078 --> 01:58:23,679
elector you know the the voting public

2958
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:25,199
but it's a fear culture especially with

2959
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:27,480
you know the Darth Vader prime minister

2960
01:58:25,198 --> 01:58:27,479
we have

2961
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:37,560
today but it's it's a fear

2962
01:58:35,118 --> 01:58:39,759
regime really so I have a little

2963
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:41,360
bitterness towards the whole process so

2964
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:43,480
the answer is I don't you know it's

2965
01:58:41,359 --> 01:58:45,719
going to take a long time to get the

2966
01:58:43,479 --> 01:58:47,078
government to come to any kind of Common

2967
01:58:45,719 --> 01:58:48,880
Sense on this they're going to be

2968
01:58:47,078 --> 01:58:53,519
dragged screaming and kicking and that's

2969
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:55,560
the end of the day that's it

2970
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:57,480
we have time for one more question and

2971
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:59,760
I'm GNA give it to Jonathan no you don't

2972
01:58:57,479 --> 01:59:02,598
want it okay

2973
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:04,239
who yeah you go ahead um we've been

2974
01:59:02,599 --> 01:59:06,920
speaking about cannabis as a medicine

2975
01:59:04,238 --> 01:59:08,519
for quite some time and it has been a

2976
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:10,880
medicine far longer than it's been

2977
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:12,560
prohibited and i' I'm a certified

2978
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:15,118
horiculture technician that's worked as

2979
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:16,639
a designated grower for health Canada uh

2980
01:59:15,118 --> 01:59:18,719
I've also been a Horticultural therapist

2981
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:22,639
in the psychiatric board in the in the

2982
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:25,639
Nao um and also founder of dispensary

2983
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:28,199
two years ago um one that I'm not

2984
01:59:25,639 --> 01:59:30,840
working with anymore but uh there's been

2985
01:59:28,198 --> 01:59:33,719
this Great Divide that I see with plants

2986
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:36,000
and people and the health Rel and the

2987
01:59:33,719 --> 01:59:38,560
whole process in relation to it and so

2988
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:41,198
my question is how can we get it to be

2989
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:43,760
recognized as more of a holistic process

2990
01:59:41,198 --> 01:59:46,359
and U bridge the gap uh between the

2991
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:50,320
relationship between patients and the

2992
01:59:46,359 --> 01:59:52,279
plants because even seeing people um in

2993
01:59:50,319 --> 01:59:54,759
highly psychotic

2994
01:59:52,279 --> 01:59:58,599
touching the soil and breathing in the

2995
01:59:54,760 --> 02:00:03,159
microbes and feeling the ement of the

2996
01:59:58,599 --> 02:00:05,800
positive outcome or the um energy from

2997
02:00:03,158 --> 02:00:09,039
that we're we're putting everything in

2998
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:10,760
the box and and not allowing people to

2999
02:00:09,039 --> 02:00:14,238
have that kind of therapy anymore is

3000
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:16,639
there a solution to find getting those

3001
02:00:14,238 --> 02:00:17,598
people the opportunity of doing so a

3002
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:20,599
good

3003
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:23,119
question uh when you when you look at

3004
02:00:20,599 --> 02:00:24,520
normal Canada for me I didn't really

3005
02:00:23,118 --> 02:00:27,439
understand what the context was and then

3006
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:30,440
I started thinking about it cannabis is

3007
02:00:27,439 --> 02:00:32,399
apparently special uh in all sorts of

3008
02:00:30,439 --> 02:00:34,759
ways it's illegal um you're not supposed

3009
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:36,439
to grow it yourself I I think the end

3010
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:38,280
goal is that cannabis no longer is

3011
02:00:36,439 --> 02:00:40,519
special at least not special in the ways

3012
02:00:38,279 --> 02:00:42,679
that we think it is right now it needs

3013
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:44,440
to become boring um and then we can

3014
02:00:42,679 --> 02:00:46,279
ReDiscover that potential and then it'll

3015
02:00:44,439 --> 02:00:47,319
find its own place in society like

3016
02:00:46,279 --> 02:00:50,519
anything

3017
02:00:47,319 --> 02:00:53,118
else is is as long as we keep making

3018
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:55,360
exceptions for it uh in it whether it be

3019
02:00:53,118 --> 02:00:57,960
regulations societal law it doesn't

3020
02:00:55,359 --> 02:00:59,559
matter um then it'll be limited in its

3021
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:03,118
applications like any this is not

3022
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:05,360
specific the canidates um So eventually

3023
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:07,439
down the road I I think it will be

3024
02:01:05,359 --> 02:01:09,719
common place to some degree and that

3025
02:01:07,439 --> 02:01:11,039
means it'll find it'll reconnect in the

3026
02:01:09,719 --> 02:01:12,880
ways that you're talking about if

3027
02:01:11,039 --> 02:01:15,639
certain people choose to use it that way

3028
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:18,000
but it's just still too special at this

3029
02:01:15,639 --> 02:01:23,078
point it's just it's a bit of a hot

3030
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:23,078
potato so give it a deade

3031
02:01:24,279 --> 02:01:28,000
can make it really Qui and Le promise

3032
02:01:26,319 --> 02:01:30,519
whoever answers this question to make it

3033
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,520
really quick okay uh I just wanted to

3034
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:34,119
quickly say thank you so much for this

3035
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:36,719
platform it's it's so amazing that we

3036
02:01:34,118 --> 02:01:38,679
can brainstorm and talk about things

3037
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:41,158
associated with cannabis is there

3038
02:01:38,679 --> 02:01:44,319
anything that we can do um from a

3039
02:01:41,158 --> 02:01:46,279
Grassroots level to legitimize and

3040
02:01:44,319 --> 02:01:48,920
slowly push this sector forward is there

3041
02:01:46,279 --> 02:01:52,039
something that we can do you know right

3042
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:54,239
now that we can we can help

3043
02:01:52,039 --> 02:01:56,319
the battle will be fought in the media

3044
02:01:54,238 --> 02:01:57,519
so any way of engaging the media around

3045
02:01:56,319 --> 02:01:59,479
this discussion is actually really

3046
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:00,719
really important and even things like

3047
02:01:59,479 --> 02:02:03,479
when there's an article that comes out

3048
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:05,399
either Pro or con drugs generally if you

3049
02:02:03,479 --> 02:02:07,238
find it online there's room for comments

3050
02:02:05,399 --> 02:02:09,679
at the end usually and if you read the

3051
02:02:07,238 --> 02:02:11,759
comments quite frankly they're youthy

3052
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:15,560
obnoxious they're not skillful they're

3053
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:17,840
not skillful thoughtful intelligent

3054
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:19,480
thought out discussions about drug

3055
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:22,440
policy issues in our society there these

3056
02:02:19,479 --> 02:02:24,439
flame Wars that happen which ESS

3057
02:02:22,439 --> 02:02:26,158
think that a politician is reading this

3058
02:02:24,439 --> 02:02:28,319
think that a politician will read your

3059
02:02:26,158 --> 02:02:30,039
comments so I think the best thing that

3060
02:02:28,319 --> 02:02:31,479
we could all do is actually engage the

3061
02:02:30,039 --> 02:02:33,519
media every way we can and you can

3062
02:02:31,479 --> 02:02:35,319
engage them today by finding the next

3063
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:39,239
drug prohibition article and commenting

3064
02:02:35,319 --> 02:02:41,399
in a really skillful way thank you John

3065
02:02:39,238 --> 02:02:44,158
first and then R just quickly I think we

3066
02:02:41,399 --> 02:02:47,158
have to avoid this divide and conquer

3067
02:02:44,158 --> 02:02:47,158
LPS versus

3068
02:02:50,238 --> 02:02:54,718
dispensaries need United front as you

3069
02:02:52,679 --> 02:02:57,359
can see from the lp discussions the

3070
02:02:54,719 --> 02:03:00,920
dispensary discussions people are on the

3071
02:02:57,359 --> 02:03:03,359
same side I mean split Maybe by Health

3072
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:04,719
Canada talking about things differently

3073
02:03:03,359 --> 02:03:07,799
but I think there's a lot of common

3074
02:03:04,719 --> 02:03:07,800
ground and we have to keep that

3075
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:14,039
going I think that as you weigh into

3076
02:03:11,439 --> 02:03:15,799
that the media is a very effective tool

3077
02:03:14,039 --> 02:03:18,078
right weigh in on commenting on the

3078
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:19,639
media but you also know that politicians

3079
02:03:18,078 --> 02:03:22,599
even though they're fear-based they do

3080
02:03:19,639 --> 02:03:25,078
listen they have to listen and when you

3081
02:03:22,599 --> 02:03:27,520
have two letters from on the same

3082
02:03:25,078 --> 02:03:30,078
subject coming to a politician they're

3083
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:31,880
obligated to respond so it really is

3084
02:03:30,078 --> 02:03:34,880
becoming activist in the sense of you

3085
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:37,359
know coming up with a a pragmatic

3086
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:39,760
writing of a letter to the politicians

3087
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:41,598
both federally and provincially that

3088
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:43,880
will be the have the greatest impact and

3089
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:45,639
it's the theme emerges it can't be you

3090
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:47,679
know if they take the ones that are

3091
02:03:45,639 --> 02:03:49,520
really the really off the wall and they

3092
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:51,840
angry and they're and they're just they

3093
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:53,520
they're disenchanting and they and they

3094
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:55,800
they and they're actually violent

3095
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:57,679
they'll throw those away if it's a well

3096
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:59,279
thought through letter and there's more

3097
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:00,880
than one on the same theme they have to

3098
02:03:59,279 --> 02:04:02,960
respond to it it becomes a political

3099
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:04,520
issue and I think that from your

3100
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:08,319
standpoint that's probably the most

3101
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:08,320
effective use of the T is getting into a

3102
02:04:08,479 --> 02:04:13,879
politician so it's time for some thank

3103
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:16,119

3113
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:41,279
of conversations we need to be having
