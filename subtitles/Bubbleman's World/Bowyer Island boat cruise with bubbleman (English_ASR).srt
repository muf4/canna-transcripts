94
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,839

uh right up in here as well I got the

96
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,439
bee on the medy Kush which Johnny B

97
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:09,359
really loved and then a couple of more

98
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:13,439
just nice bud

99
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,439
shots that uh nice big

100
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,519
centerfold and last but certainly not

101
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,880
least that same picture you saw on the

102
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:25,079
cover of the book it's a popular one

103
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:28,360
everyone wants that shot and that shot

104
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:31,639
was Remo the urban grower so check out

105
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,160
Urban Remo on Facebook and on YouTube

106
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,199
because if you want if you enjoy photos

107
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,400
like that you'll definitely enjoy the

108
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,840
content that Remo the urban grower

109
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:44,239
provides so I suspect now it's time for

110
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,519
us to do a little

111
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,240
puffing got my

112
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:51,359
Hitman got my fresh frozen Astro Boy my

113
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,680
Skillet

114
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,199
tool and uh my

115
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,240
torch so I should be able to get the job

116
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,240
done here I always find the skillet tool

117
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,560
is a little little bit big for this

118
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:09,639
particular piece but uh ah we should be

119
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,639
okay we should be able to get her

120
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:24,000
done it's quite something even even

121
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,000
heating up the nail is a little bit of a

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
challenge

123
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,199
I definitely love my denail for this

124
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:40,639
very reason I find the nail is uh a

125
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,639
little

126
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,720
bit little bit you never know especially

127
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,759
outside if it's actually

128
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,520
working there we go I got a better view

129
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,120
on it

130
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,478
now getting it hot hot

131
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,079
hot yeah I wanted to take the Dil out

132
00:06:55,478 --> 00:07:00,159
today I've been uh doing a little bit of

133
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:02,719
work with uh denail with Brian and Nick

134
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,120
Stevie um not sure how much I'm allowed

135
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,759
to say but we're kind of working on a

136
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,120
little project together kind of trying

137
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,560
to well those guys are pioneers there's

138
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,519
no doubt about it and I think that they

139
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,360
recognized um some of my value in the

140
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,318
fact that I I really use these things a

141
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,160
lot that their products I take them all

142
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,879
over the world I use them in different

143
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,080
scenarios and I really sort of put the

144
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,439
product to the test in a way that a

145
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,560
group of guys like that who are

146
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,839
constantly pioneering you just know

147
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,560
they're going to have an appreciation

148
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:34,519
for someone like that and uh indeed they

149
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,560
do all right well let's see if we can

150
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,560
get a little hit on this

151
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,519
thing well there's no doubt about it

152
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,360
that worked I definitely got a rip uh I

153
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,399
got my new method 7 shades on there's

154

7.com I'm telling you these coups are

173
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,039
really great they had they had sent me a

174
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,679
pair of the new Coupe HPS with the

175
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:57,000
mirrored glass lenses and I went and

176
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,919
shot at tilray a couple of days ago and

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm not sure if he was one of the owners

178
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:03,240
or if he was was one of the head Growers

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,799
but I let him put on the coups and he

180
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,079
wouldn't take them off he basically told

181
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,838
me that he needed to buy them he's he's

182
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:11,439
getting more for all of his gardeners at

183
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,360
tillay and uh so I was real happy to set

184
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,279
that up and and and Link those guys up

185
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,120
together because obviously Till's got uh

186
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,679
you know a couple thousand lights

187
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,639
burning and a lot of people in those

188
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:24,359
rooms uh their eyes are being affected

189
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,240
by by that strong powerful light so

190
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,560
always a good thing to have your method

191
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,120
sevens these aren't particularly a pair

192
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:35,078
you'd wear in the girl room they're a

193
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,078
pair for the Sun but uh yeah I sure love

194
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:42,000
them give you a serious Testament of how

195
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,919
much I like these I'm quite a shade snob

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,919
I've been using Maui gyms for the last

197
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,919
10 years and I've gone through many many

198
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,360
many many pairs and they're 350 bucks

199
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,759
they're not cheap anyway I've Got a

200
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,519
Brand New Pair of Maui gyms at home

201
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,600
right now they're in the case and I've

202
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,919
been wearing my method 7 so I got to

203
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,560
tell James that and I think he was

204
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:01,559
definitely like wow that's that's a true

205
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,159
story well I'm going to take another rip

206
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,879
here and then I think we're going to

207
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,879
boot around just do a little circle of

208
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,799
the house sound and see if I can't maybe

209
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,600
locate uh some Dolphins and the whales

210
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,120
uh yesterday I heard were up in the

211
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,720
sound up in Squamish so maybe we could

212
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,879
head over to the back side of anvil or

213
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,440
something and I want to show you guys

214
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,278
the whales I want to show you guys the

215
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,480
Dolphins cuz it's definitely a level of

216
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,679
excitement that we have not yet achieved

217
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,079
here on Bubble man's world when uh when

218
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,159
you get out on the boat and you see the

219
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:36,479
whales or the Dolphins I just I really

220
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,679

I'm very uh big animal lover not sure if

222
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,799
you guys know that about bubble man but

223
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,079
uh it's part of the reason I'm a

224
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:46,399
vegetarian I'm not really big on killing

225
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:49,239
and eating animals I just love them I

226

love animals I think they're great and

227
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,039
uh I can't imagine just you know having

228
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,920
the love that you would have for your

229
00:10:53,039 --> 00:11:00,000
dog but then you know just eating a

230
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:02,240
cow cows are pretty cool too

231

this particular Island that is

251
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:15,799

you guys might appreciate um just

272
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,320
floating by this island so I think this

273
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:51,559
might be a good time to load yourself up

274
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,040
a fat dab twist up a fatty gear up cuz

275
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:55,758
we're going to do a couple of minutes of

276
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,719
uh just enjoying this island look for

277
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,000
seals

278
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,519
Eagles um

279
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,519
Dolphins

280
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,120
maybe back side of this island is often

281
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:22,198
where the mama seals will leave their

282
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,198
seal pups while they go hunt for the

283
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:29,198
day so you see baby seals quite quite

284
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,320
often just laying on these rocks um they

285
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,679
blend in quite well but if I see one

286
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,160
I'll uh I'll stop the boat and zoom the

287
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:40,359
camera in the best that I can pretty

288

315
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,839
they're just kind of littering the Rocks

316
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,480

325
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:40,038
pictures for you guys and add them into

326
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,640

331
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,639
quite a few over in this corner

332
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,319
too going to back up don't like being

333
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,759
too close to the islands and I don't

334
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:01,158
want to encroach on them too much

335
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:05,759
we haven't bugged them out they haven't

336
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,760
moved so have a good day bacon

337
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,360
seals just one of the really beautiful

338
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,558
and cool things about living in British

339
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,798
Columbia is things like that being able

340
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:22,798
to

341
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:25,639
uh float by on your boat and see 20

342
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,918
SEALS or 10 SEALS or five

343
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,759
seals just chilling on the side of the

344
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,759
Rocks like that

345
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,240
very

346
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,159
cool let's go see if we can't catch some

347
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,960
Eagles now looking up in the trees bald

348
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,480
eagles mate on the back side of this

349
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,919
island so there's often always you know

350
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,079
generally one or two of them uh couples

351
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,559
I mean so two to four bald eagles we

352
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,359
should catch at least one of them it is

353
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:54,639
a pretty vast Forest up there it's just

354
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:54,639
a matter of looking for the white head

355
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:07,158
there goes our

356
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,158
neighbor to ding that boat

357
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:30,759
[Music]

358
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:48,200
[Music]

359
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,839
so we're heading into the house sound

360
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,240
now that island in the background that

361
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:59,639
um appears to have no

362
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,038
top is called Anvil Anvil Island

363
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:06,159
there's not much going on over there

364
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,158
other than I believe a Christian Camp

365
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,640
[Music]

366
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:38,210
[Music]

367
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:41,480
I guess while we're floating around this

368
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,799
island we could learn a little something

369
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,319
about our endoc canabo systems not sure

370
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:49,119
how many of you guys are familiar with

371
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:51,798
your endocannabinoid system but uh it is

372
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,798
a system that helps uh regulate most of

373
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:56,279
the biological functions that occur in

374
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:58,079
your body uh how well you remember and

375
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:59,639
how well you forget how well you sleep

376
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,000
and how well you you wake up when you

377
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,000
get hungry and when you're full how well

378
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,400
you go to the bathroom all these certain

379
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,440
uh all these different biological

380
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:12,840
functions are uh tuned and put into

381
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,480
homeostasis via um uh your endoc canabo

382
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:16,240
system and the proper feeding of that

383
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,360
endoc canabo system which of course

384
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,960
doctors tell us to uh consume amino

385
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:23,359
acids Omega-3s and Omega 6s there's

386
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,038
actually eight uh essential amino acids

387
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,599
that humans require to survive and a

388
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:30,640
couple of more three more I believe uh

389
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:33,480
for children so they need 11 and we need

390
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,400
eight anyway those uh amino acids are

391
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,640
building blocks and they help produce uh

392
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,440
endoc canabo uh inside your body that's

393
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,919
what Endo means endogenously uh those

394
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,558
cannabinoids are produced via the

395
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:47,520
building blocks of amino acids but you

396
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:50,759
can also get more help and saturate your

397
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:53,480
endoc canabo system uh by

398
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:56,440
consuming uh phyto cannabinoids which

399
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:01,839
are exclusive to cannabis now phyto

400
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:04,519
canabo um CB D CBN CBC CBG THC all these

401
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:08,558
different uh you know them all I'm sure

402
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:11,319
um these these function in our bodies to

403
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:14,798
help regulate and uh our endoc canabo

404
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:17,038
systems and put us into a state where um

405
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:19,158
we don't get as sick we are less

406
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,919
susceptible to disease we are able to

407
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:24,278
prevent things like heart disease stroke

408
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,480
diabetes um these are all very important

409
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:30,240
factors in life and uh if you look them

410
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,880
up they're very high uh disease rates uh

411
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,558
the highest disease rates in the world

412
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,679
heart disease and stroke diabetes and

413
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,079
the cost of them on the healthcare is

414
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:41,640
astronomical so just simply allowing us

415
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:43,399
to consume phyto canabo and when I say

416
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,600
consume I uh please don't think that I

417
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,640
mean just

418
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:50,918
smoke um the smoking uh please when I

419
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,679
say consume please don't think I mean

420
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:55,278
just smoke because truly what I'm what

421
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,120
I'm talking about is I'm talking about

422
00:22:55,278 --> 00:23:02,200
the creams uh the transdermal patches

423
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:05,239
the lingual drops um Edibles and then of

424
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,038
course uh vaporization as well smoking

425
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,240
has its place don't get me wrong it can

426
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,400
stimulate appetite quickly it can

427
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,359
relieve ocular pressure quickly uh it

428
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,240
can produce wonderful euphoric feelings

429
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:19,240
which I believe are uh medicinal and

430
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,558
preventative in their own way and uh

431
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,880
yeah all around uh saturate that endoc

432
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:25,440
canabo system when you can and I'm going

433
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,559
to leave you with that cuz I feel like

434
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm kind of going on and on now but uh

435
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,678
thanks for coming out on the boat with

436
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,640
me it was real fun sorry I didn't uh

437
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,000
really have much more to talk about in

438
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,320
regards to uh J herbs and I didn't

439
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,079
really show you many hashes or herbs but

440
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:48,079
uh we saw the beautiful house sound on

441
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:50,639
really like a 9 out of 10

442
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,879
day and I think that's uh that's pretty

443
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,440
good I'm heading up to Whistler for the

444
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,278
next couple of days so you may catch a

445
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,240
bubble man's world from up there I'll

446
00:23:56,278 --> 00:23:59,640
see what I can do thanks for watching

447
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,640
guys

448

peace
