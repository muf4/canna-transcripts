00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,800
pretty stoked on this um as some of you

110
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,600
may know um Slinger and I did an art

111
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,160
show two art shows actually together in

112
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,879
my gallery back in uh 0203 I guess it

113
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,439
was the first one was called degenerate

114
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,038
art which uh Slinger had basically

115
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:53,719
snagged from uh Hitler who created the

116
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:56,639
degenerate art movement in the 30s late

117
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,639
30s early 40s when he was trying to uh

118
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,879
basically you know show art in a

119
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,280
negative in a negative way and and

120
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,600
degrade artists and so we Slinger and I

121
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,959
borrowed that term for this show uh the

122
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,960
degenerate art show which happened in 02

123
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,038
and then 03 again we did the regenerate

124
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,198
art show and a couple of years later you

125
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:18,318
know Slinger put together the idea that

126
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,160
he was going to do this incredible uh

127
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,919
documentary and that maybe that would be

128
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,479
a part of it but obviously the glass

129
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:28,120
scene has been going for a while now and

130
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:30,560
uh inspired by people like Snodgrass and

131
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,360
other incredible blowers I'm just really

132
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,680
happy to say that I know these guys and

133
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,360

137
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,079

138
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,759
we should start with this one I think I

139
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:50,959

00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:19,560
watching this movie so what we'll

190
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,400
probably do is uh throw it in here soon

191
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,720
pause pause the camera cuz I'm sure you

192
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:26,198
guys don't want to watch us watching a

193
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,840
movie but every time we take a hit we'll

194
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,639
turn the camera on and we'll make sure

195
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,279
we share it with you guys so if you

196
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,000
haven't watched the generate art yet

197
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,799
head over to Netflix and watch it with

198
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,679
us talk

199
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,439
soon all right so we haven't started the

200
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,000
movie yet we were sitting here both

201
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,880
thinking without mentioning it that

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,559
Slinger himself was not representing

203
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,799
here which is insane cuz I have a ton of

204
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:52,278
Slinger at my office in Vancouver but um

205
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,199
Flav has uh a little Slinger piece here

206
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:56,000
that he had gotten from a guy who got it

207
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,759
from a guy who apparently got it from

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,278
the regenerate art show I don't

209
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,278
personally remember remember this piece

210
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:04,639
which is strange cuz uh I usually

211
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:06,480
remember Slinger pieces but it's

212
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,399
definitely Slinger I see that all over

213
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,200
with the honeycomb U marble and the uh

214
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,399
he got a s yeah his sigs and his little

215
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:19,160
yeah be really beautiful so before we

216
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,078
start the movie props to the man himself

217
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:24,000

221
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,959
joints long time

222
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,000
ago Slinger couldn't wrap his head

223
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:41,359
around it I still can't wrap my head

224
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,799
around stuffing a bud into a bowl but

225
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,800
here's some

226
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,799
hash it's a lovely little bubbler

227
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,959
it really is nice to hit a Slinger

228
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,958

229

232
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,040
so much for the piece thank you so much

233
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,759
for the

234
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:27,559
movie you are a great representative of

235
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:29,759
our culture

236
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:31,679
absolutely it's uh it's going to be nice

237
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,519
to watch it's definitely nice to see all

238
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,519
this glass it's nice that someone out

239
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,600
there is documenting it cuz documenting

240
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,639
is hard and you don't really realize it

241
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,720
but when you pull back and you document

242
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,159
it's it's almost as though you pull

243
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,320
yourself somehow away from the

244
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:49,399
experience yes you know I found that

245
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,800
from taping take yourself out of the

246
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,039
experience yeah when I'm taping or doing

247
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,958
photography or recording although I'm

248
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:58,480
there more so than anyone I'm also

249
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,759
removed from the experience CU I'm

250
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,720
usually looking through a lens and

251
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:05,639
you're trying to capture the experience

252
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,800
absolutely in its Purity which is very

253
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,039
hard to do when you're actually a part

254
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,519
of it cuz you almost want to take it and

255
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,559
make it your own yeah yeah so it's

256
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,200
definitely when someone likees Slinger

257
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,239
can show you the real culture in the

258
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,240
history of the glass art movement it's

259
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,560
really something special absolutely well

260
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:29,039
let's not wait another

261
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:29,039
second push play on that Flav

262
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,519
oh all right we just watched the

263
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:42,399
introduction and maybe a little bit past

264
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:45,519
that and uh really killer

265
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:49,320
editing great start to the movie you

266
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,839
know would you agree oh always yes I

267
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,720
think the personally I think the intro

268
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,880
is uh one of my favorite parts of the

269
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,160
movie I love uh all aspects of the movie

270
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:59,838
but it's just so beautiful it's all

271
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,120
Serene and really

272
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,440
gets you into the mood for a [ __ ]

273
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,278

00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:09,639
just kind of got to the snod grass part

276
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,240
and I thought well we should probably

277
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,560
hit another fat piece definitely

278
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,159

it it's a nice little piece it's really

284
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,399
quite heavy and you can't really imagine

285
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:37,759
how many like Millies there are in this

286
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:39,440

seedsman cuz you can never have too much

293
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,639
sativa

294
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,719
it's nice to see Fish 2000 sitting on

295
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:11,599
the table it's kind of surreal this is a

296
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,278
piece that years ago um I'm pretty sure

297
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,920
I don't want to say it as fact but I'm

298
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,799
pretty sure we brought Marcel to his

299
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:21,278
first fish show and it was up here in

300
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,958
Vancouver I think it was

301
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,799
99.99 the Commodore show no that was

302
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:30,399
since in '93 this was some years later I

303
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,559
only met these guys in '98

304
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,240
and so yeah by

305
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:35,958
99 um Slinger had always gone to you

306
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,079
know the most fish shows really he had

307
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:40,958
he had seen them I'm sure over a 100

308
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,239
times um I'm more around the 30 to 40

309
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,759
range but at the time Marcel hadn't seen

310
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,519
one and he came up and got real inspired

311
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,319
and I had one of his dolphin pieces and

312
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,120
I remember kind of you know him just

313
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,320
being there and saying like y That's the

314
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,360
guy that blew it and everyone like

315
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,639
looked at Marcel and he just kind of

316
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,159
like ran away you know he just did not

317
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,198
want that attention at all it was like a

318
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,480
whole crowd of people that had just you

319
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:07,599
know it was kind of an insane lot piece

320
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:10,639
to pull out which was the fish 99 um

321
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,480
number three the smaller of the of the

322
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,919
three and so years or a year later he

323
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,399
came up with this piece less than a year

324
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,958
later he blew this piece and I remember

325
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,120
his intention was to give it to fish yes

326
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,319
he wanted to have this in and if it

327
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,720
happened he was going to give it to them

328
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,560
as a gift and that's why all the

329
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,680
dolphins represent you know the

330
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:31,838
different members of the band

331
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,919
and uh what do you got you got one two

332
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,720
three

333
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,919
four two three four Dolphins which is

334
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,079
the band and then I believe the fifth

335
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:44,479
one was Paul langad do the sound man

336
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:48,319
representative of right cuz Paul is like

337
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,440
the fifth member of the band totally um

338
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,800
yeah so then after the fish 2000 show

339
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,600
happened and all these different people

340
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:56,799
puffed out of it and you know it was

341
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,480
just he kept it it was it didn't it

342
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,639
didn't get go to fish the way it was

343
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,278
going to

344
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,320
and then he decided to clean it and

345
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,278
bring it up to Vancouver and be like

346
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,120
here man the only Vibe this pipe is

347
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:11,120
missing is your Vibe and so I used to

348
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,198
take this piece everywhere like to

349
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,278
concerts to like my friends head shops

350
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,319
in Vancouver I had a box with all the

351
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:20,278
white kind of peanut things in it and I

352
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,278
just used to cruise around with this

353
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:24,399
pipe cuz I felt like it was my mission I

354
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:26,679
felt like Marcel was like you have to

355
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,000
like when he said you know it needs your

356
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:30,638
Vibe he meant like me and my friends

357
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,159
friends you know what I mean not like me

358
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,159
at home just like oh yeah look at this

359
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,159
piece no you can't hit it so I literally

360
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:40,240
shared it like the way he shared it at

361
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:42,759
fish 2000 with anyone and everyone so

362
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,959
really out of all glass pipes I got to

363
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,839
think this one has had more unique

364
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:51,000
people that have never even hit a

365
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,240
headpiece before hit that pipe in fact I

366
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,958
was at the uh The Joint was it called

367
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,639
The Joint no Grassroots y uh Blair's old

368
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:00,638
shop on uh Commercial Drive and I was at

369
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,600
grass roots and I pulled this pipe out

370
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,079
and this guy he was visiting from like

371
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,480
Illinois or something he comes over to

372
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,638
me and he's like where did you get that

373
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,800
pipe he's like was that pipe at fish

374
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,839
2000 heit he smoked out of it man with

375
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,439
Marcel or without Marcel for all I know

376
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,800
cuz Marcel put this pipe out into the

377
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,839
air and it was yeah tour it around for 6

378
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:26,879
and 1 half hours yeah exactly very cool

379
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:28,560
yeah no the pipe has a very long history

380
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,919
to it it's been to something like 15

381
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,919
different

382
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,360
States so all right well Snodgrass is in

383
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:41,039
his bus and he's about to tell us about

384
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,360
how he founded this

385
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,919
incredible culture that has grown

386
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,159
exponentially since the days of uh

387
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,159
making color changing glass on dead

388
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:59,159
Tour all right taking another break cuz

389
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,239
we need another Bowl butth this document

390
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:03,278

391
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,480
Jason Harris interview that Slinger did

392
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:08,318
talking about one of the first bubblers

393
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,120
ever made on the carile the rap and rake

394

the rap and rake technique yeah really

395
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:14,599
cool I got to say I'm uh I'm really

396

RG you guys you guys got to see this

400
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:28,038
yeah stepping it up little further back

401
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,240
camera doesn't autofocus is the problem

402

oh okay look right there they'll be able

403
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,720

404
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,519
shots

405
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,440
in of like closeups while we're talking

406
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,400
of like if you want to talk about the

407
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,240
pipe I'll show close-ups in regards to

408
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,880
every little piece you're talking about

409
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,880
okay cuz I've taken great photos of this

410
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,840
piece after you my friend thank

411
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,360
you such a ridiculous pipe for those of

412
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:01,798
you that don't know there's like this

413
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:03,678
flower of life like laser perforated

414
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:05,960
disc at the bottom that all the bubbles

415
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,840
come out of you can't even see the holes

416
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,600
but as they come out they get bigger and

417
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,000
bigger and bigger and bigger and there's

418
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:15,319
like five or six layers of

419
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,440
bubbles makes for a smooth hit I'll say

420
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,439
I'll say that makes for a real smooth

421
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:29,079
hit oh a huge Bowl thank

422
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,079
you we're watching

423
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:37,440
mother ship is um really

424
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:40,279
the the best filtration their their

425
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,240
pipes give the best toes the smoothest

426
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:45,240
toes the level of art on them is

427
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,599
parallel to pretty much

428
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,159
none they're beautiful they are

429
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:53,918
beautiful yeah really nice base too like

430
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:56,039
the base that you want to see on most

431
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,400
pipes really strong it's not like you're

432
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:59,798
going to ever put this pipe down and

433
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,038
Chip this base you know what I mean like

434
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:04,558
it's built but yet it's really artistic

435
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:08,158
and beautiful as

436
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,158

coming in the near future I really look

555
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,679
forward to especially with the

556
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,079
exponential growth that they spoke about

557
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,480
in the movie and how it'll be like

558
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:43,519
probably in the next 2 to 3 years as

559
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,839
much will have happened that happened in

560
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,240
the last 10 years and it's true it's

561
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,720
true even if you just follow what's

562
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,759
going on from month to month in the

563
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,200

585
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,880
regenerat like the shows that were put

586
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,399
on by

587
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,960
you it' be hard to say I definitely can

588
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:15,239
see like I didn't even realize it was

589
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,919
the end I was so enamored by the whole

590
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,519
movie that it just kind of ended and I

591
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,919
was like oh man

592
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:25,839
like I realized now seeing it you know

593
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,120
now already some years have gone by yeah

594
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,079
definitely

595
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:34,000
so yeah it's true actually the I think

596
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:38,839
the latest footage is

597
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,839
20110 2009 maybe 201 in

598
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,840
right yeah it's a treat to be able to

599
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:48,719
come over to flaves and hit the um the

600
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,199
glass collection I'm as much as I'd like

601
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,000
to say I smoke the headiest of the

602
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,720
glasses I I smoke nice glass but it

603
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,759

604
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:03,600
pieces I don't have the variety

605
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:03,599
like this so it's really nice to be able

606
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,200
to stop by and hit the

607
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:16,319

is Well much like uh said in the movie

609
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:22,879
I'm a firm believer that

610
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,558
uh this artc should be in museums nice

611

615
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,240
somewhere yeah this piece is just oh

616
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,079
it's hard to describe you have to be

617
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,798
able to see it up close and it's just

618
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:50,359
unbelievable the

619
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:53,278
staircase the different discs with the

620
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:57,398
air trop readi thing whatever yeah the

621
00:29:53,278 --> 00:30:00,440
can it's ridiculous yeah it is

622
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:02,879
absolutely this the last uh collab that

623
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,960
uh Jason and Marcel ever did

624
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,519
together don't know if they're planning

625
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,880
on doing another one not sure well we've

626
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,880
got a

627
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:14,679
hope I loved some of the big collabs too

628
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:17,639
I can really see that growing in the

629
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,480
near future where it's it is uh five or

630
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,759
six different artists putting together

631
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,319
this monster piece I know it exists

632
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:29,960
already

633
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:29,960
but I can see of that it's quite nice

634
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:35,239
yeah this pipe is kind of incredible for

635
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,880
one reason and I can't believe they did

636
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:41,759
it and I love that they did it they got

637
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,519
this like just old school carb on the

638
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,879
side it's just so even though it was

639
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,440
done in 2010 it is a very it's like

640
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,159
everything about it is old school design

641
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,759

Dango yeah T really comes through with

703
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:04,199
nothing it definitely came through the

704
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:07,920
most with with the sublimator which I

705
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:11,399
have to tell you the same quite a

706
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,920
bit for the unit because a all these

707
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,519
beautiful pieces are all glass and that

708
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,000
we love glass and then again I guess we

709
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:20,800
didn't compare it to hitting it with a

710
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,400
hot rod or something like that yeah yeah

711
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,760
