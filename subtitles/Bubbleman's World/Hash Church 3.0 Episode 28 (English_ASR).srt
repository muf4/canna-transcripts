mean I know you know a lot of people

96
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:24,679

00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:27,239
has been hands down seems to say all

98
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,439

that they've ever experienced so kudos

100
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,600
to you man indux labs indux labs trust

101
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:37,159
me we've been trying to like this whole

102
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,759
like this the the day I hooked up with

103
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,160
Kylie I swear to

104
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,600
God they they made it so you couldn't

105
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,840
ship the their units to Canada like it

106
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,080
was like what what do you mean you can't

107
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,758
ship these units to Canada so we're

108
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,359
we're a little hurting up here I did get

109
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,080
an induction unit and I I don't know

110
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,160
what company it was from let me grab it

111
00:04:54,079 --> 00:05:00,359
real quick it is

112
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,759
not um what you've got going on K in any

113
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,240
way shape or form I think I think the

114
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,160
problem with this particular indux unit

115
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,680
is that it's just they haven't figured

116
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,320
out how to how to make it more sensitive

117
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,918
it's just like it's insane it like you

118
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:19,279
can turn the bowl to like redh hot vapor

119
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:20,719
in like in half a second and so I don't

120
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,879
even know the name of the company but

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,520
this is the one that I got years ago and

122
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,639
kind of got to

123
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:29,519
taste got to see basically what it was

124
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,560
potentially about and I I don't the name

125
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,719
of this thing is like looto Labs or

126
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,560
something are you familiar with this

127
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,319
unit think I've seen that before yeah I

128
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,240
mean listen I'm not trying to bash the

129
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,919
company but it's it's just it's not it's

130
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,918
too much there's no way to dial it to

131
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:49,120
make it more sensitive I mean honestly

132
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:52,399
vapexhale is a much better unit for

133
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,949
tpin verus this thing but the thing that

134
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,028
you

135
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:56,028
[Music]

136
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:02,439
have off camera

137
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,800
uh in regards to setting up this sort of

138
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:07,160
think tank in regards to sensory science

139
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,319
and and you know from everything I've

140
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,880
heard from Tom solventless mind and from

141
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,639
Nick zegler and from even skunkman Sam

142
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,519
who has one of your units uh it's just

143
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,400
uh it's it's the one that I'm jonesing

144
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:21,120
for so hardcore because I want to be

145
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:24,638
able to dial in those profiles where you

146
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,439
can kind of go through the tpine profile

147
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,680
accessing different bouquet of flavor by

148
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:33,279
just using you know that that sensitive

149
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,680
I guess capabilities that your unit has

150
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,038
maybe maybe you can tell everyone a

151
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,120
little bit about the unit and maybe uh

152
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,000
talk about what inspired to create it

153
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,399
and what was behind creating it and what

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,240
you're kind of hoping that the unit

155
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:49,279
helps uh you know unveil for the people

156
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,199
of the Cannabis community and Industry

157
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:55,679
if you don't mind there no problem uh I

158
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,280
guess it was this this discovery that

159
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,840
you know the size shape quantity and

160
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,598
composition of the heating element that

161
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,799
you're loading into the vial control the

162
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:07,918
temperature ramp and the vapor texture

163
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,319
once that was determined it was just

164
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,560
plug and play try everything possible to

165
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,360
dial it in to get those different tpine

166
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,720
profiles so you can go extremely low and

167
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,319
slow like from room temperature to 400

168
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,560
degrees over the course of 500

169
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:28,759
seconds or the unit's capable of you

170
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,439
know hot dabs in 6 seconds it really

171
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,360
depends what you're looking looking for

172
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:36,199
you know you can use it as an analytical

173
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:39,038
tool if you want by running the slower

174
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,400
ramps uh or you know some people just

175
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,519
like pulling huge clouds and that's

176
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,719
possible as well why don't why don't we

177
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,680
go through the difference between you

178
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,080
know convection conduction induction why

179
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,158
don't you talk a little bit about the

180
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,839
sort of popular vaporizers that are on

181
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:57,079
the market and why the indux is really

182
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,719
quite something different I think it all

183
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:00,478
comes down to temperature control you

184
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,879
know I'm using a induction to heat a

185
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,478
heating element but it's actually

186
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:08,240
conduction that's heating the the

187
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:10,240
substances so induction is a clean form

188
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,960
of heating and you have extreme amount

189
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,800
of control so you know I just found that

190
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:17,279
that that gives more control than say

191
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,598
heating a an

192
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,399
insulator you know insulators aren't the

193
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:25,399
great at greatest at heating uh yeah

194
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:28,519
they're pure but you lose control so you

195
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:31,359
know I have titanium elements I have

196
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:36,639
steel elements I have

197
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,759
glass uh elements with a steel core uh

198
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,759
the titanium ones have the most control

199
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,519
because you're directly heating the

200
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,879
surface in a slow manner through eddy

201
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,200
current it's like a

202
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,439
resistor uh then when you use the glow

203
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,519
sticks I call them which are the uh

204
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:58,000
steel elements encased in glass that

205
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:00,159
Heats and so heats up a lot faster but

206
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,720
that energy in the core has to transfer

207
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,919
through the glass shell to then he

208
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,399
concentrate it's a smooth presentation

209
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,919
but you just don't have quite the

210
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,039
control you have when you're directly

211
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:16,519
feing El like a

212
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:18,838
tit so hey Kylie question um so I I've

213
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,159
spoken to other researchers that are

214
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,399
looking at just conduction and just how

215
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:25,838
heat and thermodynamics are working in

216
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,919
in your experience are you finding Mo

217
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,279
most of the individuals I'm speaking to

218
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:34,559
seem to believe that 36 is like in terms

219
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:37,240
of a heating element like a material for

220
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,679
heating it is kind of the best in terms

221
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,759
of of thermal like the way that it it

222
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,519
heats up is that what you're finding I

223
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,480
mean I I'm not saying I know but I'm I'm

224
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,879
just really curious to understand your

225
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,800
your opinion I guess because I guess

226
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,200
these are these are really opinions at

227
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:59,399
this stage of of the game at some some

228
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:01,640
respect right i' you know 316l 304 304 l

229
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,039
those are atic stainless Steels medical

230
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,399
grade

231
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,319
yeah you know they're non-magnetic so

232
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,000
they heat similar to the titanium a

233
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,920
little bit slower but to be honest you

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,320
get better flavor off the grade two

235
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,039
titanium interesting yeah so that would

236
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,160
be my my hunch was like interesting 316

237
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,480
or three or4 sounds awesome but hey Mark

238
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,319
um but at the same time it seems like

239
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,800
it's inefficient in terms of like the

240
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,040
way it rants

241
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,958
through you know like a if you're

242
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:31,559
looking at it from like a curve

243
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,759
you know it seems like it's just like

244
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,679
it's like a a triangle wave or something

245
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,240
it just like Peaks and then goes down

246
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,838
where seems like other elements have

247
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,720
more of a curve to it the way that it it

248
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:45,040
kind of ramps up and goes through the

249
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,800
the you know just through the different

250
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,439
ranges of temperatures you know because

251
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,838
let's face it all these these chemicals

252
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,120
have a have a boiling point right and

253
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,560
you know going through those temperature

254
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,480
ranges really I think does help the

255
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:02,000
experience and the the profile and taste

256
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,159
yeah you're you know dial it in to go

257
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,879
through whatever you know temperature

258
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:10,559
range at the rate you want to right it

259
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:12,720
takes a little bit of experimentation to

260
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,679
you know plug in the different heating

261
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,560
see exactly the effect you're going for

262
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:23,278
both flavor and you know cerebral effect

263
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:26,518
is combined the

264
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,919
316 that can be manipula size and shape

265
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:32,720
of It kind of tailor the temperature

266
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,479
ramps uh I've played around with it some

267
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,839
but I'm just working with the grade two

268
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,360
titanium and some other materials I'm

269
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,800
working on a new material that has given

270
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,079
me really good in results I'm not

271
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:48,078
willing to say what it is right

272
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:48,078
now

273
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,320
talid so what do you think out of any

274
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,919
all the elements you have like in terms

275
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,800
of of of just experience in terms of

276
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:01,240
taste uh and delivery are you feeling

277
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,000
that there's a better more efficient one

278
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,759
than than the other or they just like

279
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,879
you're saying very just different from

280
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:09,078
one another oh well they're all

281
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:13,159
different I mean it you know you can

282
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:16,039
load 13 1.6 millimeter titanium grade 2

283
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:18,039
rods into the vial at the same time and

284
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,838
get one experience you add one it heats

285
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:21,480
up a little bit faster you take one away

286
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,560
it heats up a little bit slower so you

287
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,680
tailor the experience that way so really

288
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,958
it's all determined by the heating

289
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,359
element it's pretty

290
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:36,559
are we talking about the or sorry Kylie

291
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:39,278
are we talking about the index yes uh I

292
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,078
yeah I love them sorry uh you you guys

293
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,759
got me

294
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:48,000
uh uh well and truly faded at uh MJ

295
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:52,759
biscon in Vegas a couple years

296
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,600
ago I remember very well how you been

297
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,639
great working with fine folk like

298
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,800
yourself and and Marcus and getting to

299
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,278
talk all the all the fun stuff so

300
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:04,919
I went to biscon again this had a little

301
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:07,360
more luck than when I saw you out there

302
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,919
but he back then it was like no one knew

303
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,759
about the machine no one to try it and

304
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,719
as a beautiful

305
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,958
paper you know now people are starting

306
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,680
to learn about it what it's capable of

307
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:22,439
and uh the response very good I I I pimp

308
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,239
it hard um the way I describe it is like

309
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:29,959
it's like being able to consume via

310
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:33,399
GC because the uh the the I mean the the

311
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:36,319
sequential elusion of the compounds that

312
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,679
we that I experienced was you know like

313
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,800
it was like okay well there's lemine

314
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,838
there's oine there's turp terpinolene

315
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:45,078
and then oh there's the

316
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,959
THC it was it was it was wonderful

317
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:49,198
that's Stacks the nice thing is is you

318
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,000
can control since you have you know

319
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:54,838
control over the ramp you can control

320
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,320
the compounds your going to exper just

321
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,680
work your way through their individual

322
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,680
boiling points and uh you know you cut

323
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,838
it off when you get the effect you're

324
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:04,838
looking

325
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,839
for

326
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:10,078
soque

327
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,559
excited sounds incredible dude I I'm

328
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:12,879
just Jones and I can't tell you it's

329
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,159
been like two and a half years that I've

330
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,320
been trying to get my hands on one of

331
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,159
these units and and you know many years

332
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,160
ago when someone said oh what do you see

333
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,759
as the perfect futuristic sort of

334
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,319
medical device and I said wow I mean in

335
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,720
a perfect world it would be pretty cool

336
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,199
if you had kind of a box very much like

337
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,240
what yours looks like and then I

338
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:32,120
pictured little glass vials that kind of

339
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,120
fit inside the box with like all the

340
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,360
novel canabo that you want to have

341
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,399
access to all of the tarine profiles and

342
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,680
then hopefully you know you know the

343
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,159
deeper aromatic volatiles that are that

344
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,838
are having an effect on it as well and

345
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,919
then just dialing in you know through

346
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,240
some type of an algorithm exactly like

347
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,879
oh what cultivar is the ghost train Haze

348
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,560
oh this is what ghost train Haze is and

349
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,078
then you just plug it into the machine

350
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,679
and the Machine just takes out little

351
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:59,399
bits of whatever it needs to create that

352
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,679
profile and I think that you're good

353
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,480
halfway there with this uh with this

354
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,000
unit and I've only heard great things

355
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,278
from from amazing

356
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,320
people that's awesome I'm really happy

357
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:12,198
to hear all this and I'm so excited to

358
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,120
be a part of this project and finally

359
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:18,799
get this thing you know used in an way

360
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,799
you know I've done but you know I'm kind

361
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,838
of limited in my capacity but have you

362
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,159
guys on board it's

363
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,680
fantastic yeah so what Kylie's talking

364
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,679
about is we'll give a little bit of a

365
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,439
public mentioned just uh Nick and I have

366
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:35,039
been kind of going back and forth on

367
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,120
email we brought in Kylie a while ago

368
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,838
and some other sort of people we're just

369
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,078
trying to create a little bit of a think

370
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,399
tank you know like a little bit of a a

371
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:47,278
sensory science think tank with group of

372
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,440
people you know inclusive of course and

373
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,480
just trying to get it to the point where

374
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,639
we can have like Nick Nick mentioned you

375
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,480
know having a shared lexicon would be

376
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,198
very important but also having you know

377
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,039
a shared unit that people are able to go

378
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,599
through these different you know

379
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,159
experiences have these different effects

380
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,800
from different plants and extracts and

381
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,639
it's just kind of an exciting rabbit

382
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,879
hole that I've been looking to go down

383
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,039
further and further really since I met

384
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:16,399
Nick and and Jeremy and I heard the term

385
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,838
sensory science it seems to be hand

386
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,039
inhand with what you know our

387
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,759
discussions are here on hash church so

388
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:23,639
you know that's going to happen in the

389
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,240
future sort of behind closed doors but I

390
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,799
figured hey why don't we you know get on

391
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,720
a hash church and have a little bit of a

392
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,719
conversation about

393
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:38,278
lost Marcus uh oh for a that's starlink

394
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,880
it's gonna happen like that to him from

395
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:44,120
time to time he's gonna stretch El he'll

396
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:46,240
be he'll be back yeah Elon or at least

397
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,039
you mentioned what's that Marcus we we

398
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,560
lost you for a minute there buddy don't

399
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:51,240
worry about it you guys just keep going

400
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:56,039
I was just blowing smoke up your guys's

401
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,039
ass well this least you're H

402
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,799
can I thought I felt a dingle um can I

403
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,880
uh interject you a little

404
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,879
bit Yeah

405
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,319
so one of the things that I was working

406
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,120
on uh the last time I was on um or I'd

407
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:15,078
sort of wrap that up in my former life

408
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:18,639
um was really trying to establish a

409
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:20,038
unified sensory program for for Hops and

410
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,640
there's you know a tremendous amount of

411
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:24,919
overlap but really the experience that I

412
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,799
had um

413
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,000
was that you know developing a system

414
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:33,720
and a program

415
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,119
for uh characterizing aromatics and um

416
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,480
in you know eventually of course

417
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:40,359
quantifying them but uh or quantitating

418
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,759
them if you're talking in gclc land um

419
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,879
but in this case was really getting

420
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:50,119
everybody on the same page and so using

421
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:52,039
certain standards to Define um what the

422
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:54,798
the principal components were that were

423
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:57,440
leading to the uh the aromatics and then

424
00:17:54,798 --> 00:18:00,240
what um what we would agree to call them

425
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,720
um and so in creating a sensor or a

426
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:07,200
shared sensory lexicon we're able to

427
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,279
then assign numbers to the levels that

428
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,080
we detect them at and we can

429
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:11,678
characterize people as well in terms of

430
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,279
of their sensitivities and

431
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,400
blindnesses um and what that allowed us

432
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:20,319
to do was to start to create a sort of a

433
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,559
rating scale for each characteristic so

434
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,279
sometimes it would be Citrus uncore lime

435
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,960
Citrus uncore grapefruit you know so so

436
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:30,000
so forth like that um or tropical

437
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,720
fruitcore guava or mango and all and and

438
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,119
and use all these things um and that

439
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,880
allowed us to create much better

440
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:41,879
pictures of the um botanical in front of

441
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,600
us um and

442
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,720
so this was because we we discovered

443
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:50,359
that basically a lot of the compounds

444
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:55,480
that are um important for identifying a

445
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:57,599
given choar of hop were um not actually

446
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,079
relevant to to beer at all they they

447
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,480
didn't make it a solution um and for for

448
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:07,000
cannabis it's a little bit different but

449
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:10,640
the ability to um characterize the the

450
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,558
components and then the sensory picture

451
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,759
um of what was there was massive and you

452
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:20,000
know with Dr Russo's work on the

453
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:22,640
Entourage effect and the um impact of

454
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,919
the aromatic fractions on the

455
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,240
therapeutic benefits of of cannabis um I

456
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,400
think that there's the time is right for

457
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,919
really getting getting together and

458
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:35,120
creating a industry industry standard

459
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,038
lexicon you know not not necessarily

460
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:41,079
that we're going to dictate what

461
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:42,839
people smell and taste and and and think

462
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,000
about it but that we at least have

463
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:48,759
reference standards so that even though

464
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,079
to me it might smell like um say durian

465
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:51,960
because I've been to Thailand and you

466
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,599
know grew up in Southeast Asia um

467
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,079
someone else might describe that as

468
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:59,759
garlic pineapple and diesel in their own

469
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:01,960
mind but we agree to call it X Y or Z

470
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,879
you know and um each region is going to

471
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,079
have its different its own lexicon uh

472
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,440
for example the Midwest might have

473
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,399
something called Snicker salad um which

474
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,120
is was I was introduced to recently and

475
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,400
was very confusing and it's not a range

476
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,519
of flavors that I was familiar with at

477
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,320
all and considering there's no vegetable

478
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:19,798
or fruit in it but it you know that's it

479
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:22,079
it does smell kind of very distinctive

480
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,480
and so someone from the Midwest would

481
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,639
would say oh yeah that's that's X Y or Z

482
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,798
and someone from say Seattle would go

483
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,280
what the hell are you talking about I

484
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:32,038
don't even know what that means

485
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:35,038
but to me it smells like chocolate

486
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:36,640
caramel whipped cream and marshmallows

487
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,240
which are the principal ingredients so

488
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,559
the idea is

489
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,839
that our lexicons are informed not only

490
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:47,119
by our um physical limitations so either

491
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:50,639
our sensitivities or blindnesses like

492
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:53,918
anosmia to uh to certain smells um but

493
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,200
also our cultural context so someone who

494
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,080
is in North Asia Chinese Korean or in

495
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,279
Southeast Asia even though they're both

496
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:01,079
you know in Asian they share a lot of

497
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:03,639
things they're going to have very

498
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:06,319
different sensory lexicons based on

499
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,520
their exposure to food Cuisine and and

500
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:11,759
tradition um and if we can get everybody

501
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:15,278
sort of talking on the same page with

502
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:18,038
regards to the compounds we can develop

503
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:19,519
sensory thesauruses so yes in the

504
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:21,558
western us we tend to use these

505
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,639
descriptores but they refer to these

506
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:25,319
compounds whereas in China they use

507
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,240
these descriptors but they're referring

508
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:29,240
to the same compounds we can then create

509
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,440
a

510
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:36,120
not only a lexicon or translation but

511
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:39,120
also the ability to actually

512
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:41,000
quantitate what based on people's noses

513
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,399
so you don't have to use gc's for for

514
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,960
all this but based on people's noses we

515
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:50,320
can get a pretty good idea of what that

516
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:52,640
strain is going to offer um and the the

517
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,079
stretch goal Beyond this is then to look

518
00:21:52,640 --> 00:22:00,120
at um if we can apply the same

519
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:03,158
methodology to the typing of of of you

520
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:06,479
know human phenotypes and the

521
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:09,600
interaction with the various choar so

522
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,720
that we can see that okay with if you

523
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,639
are from this genetic background you

524
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,880
probably there's an 80% or 70% chance

525
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,320
you have all of these receptors and

526
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,200
these genes and your ECS works this way

527
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,519
um if you're X weight if you're male or

528
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,720
female so on so forth if you have any

529
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:29,480
underlying conditions um we might be

530
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,079
able to then start to

531
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,519
be able to

532
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:35,639
predict you know in general not

533
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,240
necessarily specifically what the

534
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:42,120
experience most people would have um

535
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,519
with uh with with a given strain and um

536
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:46,918
that's incredibly powerful because right

537
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,879
now it's kind of a roll of the

538
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,679
dice

539
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,360
um so here here's a question so roll of

540
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,240
the dice and developing a phonetic and

541
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,278
then ultimately a language that we can

542
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,960
agree on to your point right

543
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:05,159
some sort of system or peries of systems

544
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,480
that relates to one another now I guess

545
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,960
this maybe directed towards Dr Mark but

546
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,319
you know how do we really start to

547
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,798
Encompass and circle around the ideology

548
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:19,079
of this is right for a patient a

549
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:20,798
impatient B but not patient C right and

550
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:23,879
and that that seems like nearly

551
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:26,038
impossible to me you know so because we

552
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,720
have such Dy you know the EC is so

553
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:32,240
understudied and and just it's we've

554
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,600
such a long way to go so circling around

555
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,278
the ideology that we're going to say hey

556
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:37,959
definitively A and B are going to be

557
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:40,599
this and See's going to be that I feel

558
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,319
like we're we have so much research to

559
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:44,599
go and I just wonder what are the IDE

560
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,319
what are the thoughts that we all

561
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:49,798
collectively have you know today that

562
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:51,918
could get us closer to understanding how

563
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:53,839
we could get towards talking in those

564
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,360
ways right not saying that we're going

565
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,798
to definitively define something but

566
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:01,199
what are the steps you think that we

567
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:05,000
could take to to get closer to

568
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,558
that poy the beer

569
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,278
industry wasn't it wasn't just the beer

570
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:11,240
industry it was it was specific that we

571
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:14,079
we we kind of upended it the team that I

572
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:18,159
built upended it because we saw this

573
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:20,000
path forward and we only got As far you

574
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,159
know we only got 60% of the way there

575
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,159
and that's that's kind of why I

576
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,919
mentioned that to get to the

577
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,200
quantitation and uh

578
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:35,520
analysis of the effects the therapeutic

579
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:39,558
effects that's um that will take you

580
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:42,038
know rcts and um you know clinical

581
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:44,918
trials or clinical level level clinical

582
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:47,720
level trials in terms of quality not

583
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,720
necessarily massive size um to be able

584
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,720
to determine it um and you know we would

585
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:57,360
want to use diverse

586
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,319
populations um so you know um well

587
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,839
diverse populations and so multiple

588
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:05,639
countries but also

589
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:07,798
um multiple genetic backgrounds um and

590
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,480
it will take a while

591
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:13,720
but if we get everybody used to talking

592
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:17,880
and used to thinking in shared

593
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,880
terms that is an achievable

594
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:25,919
goal I don't personally I think that you

595
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:28,000
know the fact that I mean just looking

596
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,679
at Fitness and looking at health and

597
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,079
looking at at what people consume for

598
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,440
food uh you know everyone wakes up at a

599
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,918
different time goes to bed at a

600
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,399
different time uh has a different

601
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,200
schedule um

602
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:42,079
metabolic you know some of them aren't

603
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,798
getting enough sunlight some aren't you

604
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,558
know their uh scum rhythm is off all

605
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,599
these things are wrong with people and I

606
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,918
think that when you would for us to sit

607
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:54,959
here and try to and I I love the idea

608
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:56,759
but I just think that the approach um we

609
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,640
can't even get people to agree on a

610
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:01,519
vaccine we can't get people to on

611
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:05,000
anything so I don't understand how I

612
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:07,480
think this is such a huge test because I

613
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,720
can take all of you right now you know

614
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,200
us us as the subject and how do you

615
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,600
apply this even to us we're educated we

616
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,120
understand this we have an understanding

617
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,038
of these things we can communicate at

618
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,959
this level um we know what Esters are

619
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:24,679
and flavenoids and we understand all

620
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,038
these things but I think it's it's so

621
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:28,440
slow to the to the process of us

622
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,919
educating the rest of the people and

623
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,679
then expecting them you know like what

624
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:37,240
Colin said it's it's a b and c how I

625
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,320
really don't see it being possible

626
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,159
except in a way where it's a number of

627
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:44,200
questions that allow people to to to let

628
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,880
us know how they feel to let us know

629
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,480
after they've used something how it made

630
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,600
them feel and sort of just let them

631
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,360
develop that for themselves um because

632
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,759
even just like I said in Fitness it's

633
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,398
like i' I've got people coming to me and

634
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,839
being like Oh you you know this much

635
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:02,000
protein and take this and take that and

636
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,839
half of that [ __ ] you know I could drink

637
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,440
a little bit of salt water before I work

638
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,199
out and get a better pre-workout than

639
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,080
most of the other [ __ ] it's these little

640
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,360
tiny things people are selling something

641
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,839
and I would feel like from an educated

642
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,879
standpoint collectively um it would

643
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,879
almost appear like we were trying to fit

644
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,679
people into a box that don't fit into

645
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,760
because I mean even even I mean the

646
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,278
years and years and years and years of

647
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,359
of you know etn you know is a perfect

648
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:30,038
example of having a dispensary and

649
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:32,319
always putting together these really

650
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:34,278
well wellth thought out um you know

651
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,558
interactive experiences with people to

652
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,359
get an understanding of what they think

653
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:42,278
of cannabis I feel like people vary too

654
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:45,319
much cannabis varies too much and you're

655
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:48,519
intoxicating people at the same time so

656
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:49,720
it's almost like the fifth hour of a uh

657
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:52,480
of a beer

658
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:55,200
festival it's a little foggy right like

659
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,159
it's it gets to be that way so you know

660
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,480
there's always going to be different

661
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,960
levels I just feel like it's it's such a

662
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,759
great conversation but

663
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,880
um man like like Marcus always says

664
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,679
hurting cats like you're hurting [ __ ]

665
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,640
countries of cats at this point like

666
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,640
you're you're just you're standing in

667
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,440
Australia in the middle of in the of the

668
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,799
Jung you know the middle of the Outback

669
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,798
and there's a zillion cats like there's

670
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,879
I look at it as a you know for us

671
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,720
collectively I think that it's it's a

672
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,120
series of questions and it's a Ser like

673
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,440
a comfortable real just oh cool and and

674
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:29,918
the people that are intelligent enough

675
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,360
to want to answer those questions

676
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,240
because they want that understanding

677
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:35,798
they're going to go forward but we

678
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,480
really need to admit to ourselves that

679
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:40,240
90 90% of the people consuming cannabis

680
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,079
are just trying to get high they're just

681
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,200
trying to forget about the dude that

682
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,759
just cut them off and all these other

683
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,919
things and I think that um I love the

684
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:50,720
idea it's it's I would love to

685
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,320
accomplish this I just think that it's

686
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,200
uh it's gonna look like Charlie standing

687
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:58,200
at the board you know with all that [ __ ]

688
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,519
behind him and and the crazy hair you

689
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,480
know I I uh I I I swear to God that I

690
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,599
think that uh every one of us wants this

691
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,679
I just think that we will all be dead by

692
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:10,359
the time it's done I I just don't I

693
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:12,440
don't think it I don't think

694
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:14,839
so does that make it not worth doing

695
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,240
then oh no I love doing [ __ ] like this

696
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:18,480
please don't get me wrong and yeah

697
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,919
that's that's kind of my point is that

698
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,120
this is what everybody said about the

699
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,519
Hop industry is that we could never get

700
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,518
anybody to

701
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:29,879
agree guard's uh very simplistic

702
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,079
definition of of like seeven seven

703
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,640
different major attributes um from the

704
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,038
German perspective I always I'm on the

705
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,519
record of making fun of the Germans but

706
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:40,879
that's they started it so let's be fair

707
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:44,640
here um but

708
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:48,080
uh we did it um it took a couple years

709
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,200
um but we also were we were vertically

710
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:53,519
integrated as a company okay so we

711
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,278
controlled not only the farming but also

712
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,558
the processing and the distribution to

713
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:01,599
clients and so this would have to to be

714
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,960
an industry um we're trying to develop

715
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,558
an industry standard and not trying

716
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,600
we're not trying to box people in but

717
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:10,240
trying to give people more information

718
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,759
about what's in their cannabis so um

719
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,759
when we say that you know we'll be able

720
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:18,879
to and again I say that the the effects

721
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,960
are like that's way in the future okay

722
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,200
that that those results are are way far

723
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,640
down line um but at least being able to

724
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,919
show you know that this one tastes like

725
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,080
citrus grapefruit but this one tastes

726
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:34,640
like citrus lime um because these

727
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,720
compounds are in this particular ratio

728
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,679
and so it does it will originally need

729
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,880
to involve a lot of GC work um but it

730
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,840
will refer it'll also need us to come

731
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,919
together

732
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:49,918
as group industry so people dispensary

733
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:53,320
owners um sensory scientists uh

734
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,960
Growers processors um and say okay you

735
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:58,240
know we are not trying to put people

736
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,880
into we're not trying to force a into

737
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,038
something they don't want to do but

738
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,679
we're going to try to create at least a

739
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:09,158
standard that people can use if they so

740
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,720
choose um and if it's really if it if

741
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:14,240
it's done correctly people start to

742
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,200
start to use that that di that that

743
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,679
um that lexicon that that language to

744
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,558
describe things and it sort of grows

745
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:24,278
organically from there um because we are

746
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:27,079
all using we agree that even though we

747
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:29,119
may think this might trigger a different

748
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:31,519
concept like I I like to use the example

749
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,558
of uh you know someone once gave me

750
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,638
notes like oh this was uh this reminds

751
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,960
me of when I walked into my

752
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:39,558
grandmother's house that she had sugar

753
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,360
cones rather than waffle cones like well

754
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:45,240
that's very specific to you and very

755
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:48,240
meaningful and probably means a lot but

756
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:52,839
I have no idea what you're talking

757
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:57,038
about and so so we want to try to limit

758
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:59,558
people's like ah what a chunker um sort

759
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,558
of the Bro sign and the like dude this

760
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:03,798
is

761
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:08,119
like we still can't get past Inda and

762
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:10,798
sativa with people okay simplest of

763
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:12,398
nomenclature so I respect where you're

764
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,599
coming from and as somebody who's been

765
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:18,798
doing this for 20 years I agree exactly

766
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,798
what um you know Addison was stating is

767
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:23,038
that there's a small percentage of

768
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,359
people who have [ __ ] to give about it

769
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,038
the rest of the people you know don't

770
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:30,158
understand but I'm one of those people

771
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:32,038
who has that to give so I want to know I

772
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,120
do want to understand because the

773
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:37,519
biggest problem I get from patients

774
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:40,719
every single day is hi I've got cancer

775
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,839
what's my cancer Bud hi I've got this H

776
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,798
where's my this bud and it's like sorry

777
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:46,759
it's completely subjective you've got to

778
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:50,038
go try everything to get an

779
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:51,960
understanding and I do like the new way

780
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:54,599
that science is going in the sense that

781
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,120
we're going by turpine profiles now as

782
00:32:54,599 --> 00:33:00,158
opposed to going across this Indica

783
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:01,599
sativa misinformation which has so much

784
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,760
of the public

785
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,319
confused they're coming in I want

786
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:10,000
something that doesn't lock me down on

787
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:12,759
the couch that's great what what doesn't

788
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,638
and they look at me like I don't know

789
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:16,759
exactly you don't know I don't know and

790
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:19,719
since it's completely subjective all we

791
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:22,960
can go is by science to help us arrive

792
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,519
there so science I think is key once we

793
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,759
because there's people right now that

794
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:30,399
are actually using gene science of

795
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:33,558
humans to try to match them with tpine

796
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:36,119
profiles to supposedly help a human and

797
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:38,638
I think that's a a new frontier that

798
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:40,879
sounds like a lot of quackery that but

799
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:42,599
it has some basis in real science that

800
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,159
has to be executed it's going to take

801
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:47,759
time and already I mean when did

802
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:50,919
mcpartland and Rob Clark put out their

803
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,919
book educating people on Inda and sativa

804
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:54,600
and how many years later we're still

805
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,799
talking about that you see what I'm

806
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,959
saying so unfortunately because we

807
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:02,398
change laws and then educate about

808
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,759
people about things we've got a steep

809
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:08,279
uphill of education so I appreciate what

810
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:11,320
you're doing and I want to see more of

811
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,919
what you're doing however I it's a long

812
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,399
way till we arrive there but I'm

813
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,719
interested in the path in the journey

814
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,559
and I appreciate where you're coming

815
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:20,959
from I have a quick question for

816
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:23,679
everyone because it just and I hate to

817
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,599
interrupt is it that occurs when each of

818
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,519
us gets sick of a strain or tired of a

819
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:30,960
strain and then has to go to other

820
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:33,800
strains you know I mean I've got the

821
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,480
Legends kit in front of me and there's a

822
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:39,519
I mean the profiles are crazy on this

823
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,398
but even when it goes from from my taste

824
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:45,759
or my preference to go from rosin to

825
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:48,719
melt what is you know because that's why

826
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,679
I'm I'm sort of like we ever pull this

827
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,918
off because even in my own self you know

828
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,240
it's a cloudy day and this and there's

829
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,799
all these things that apply so it's I I

830
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,959
I agree with you I think it would be

831
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,160
great to lay out some or to begin the

832
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,838
process of of of getting this out there

833
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,920
and sort of saying hey lemon lime all

834
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,400
these things but it it seems like such a

835
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,920
giant task to uh to tackle what I'd like

836
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,760
to what I'd like to understand more is

837
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,720
how you guys actually tackled it um on

838
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,520
your side and the the you know the fact

839
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:22,480
that um you know when you're talking

840
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:24,440
about Hops and Tarpin and and beer um

841
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,960
you know of course it's it's you put

842
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,838
that glass up to your face you give it a

843
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,358
smell if smells okay you're going to

844
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:32,519
give it a sip if you if this if it's in

845
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:34,719
your mouth and it tastes right you're

846
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:37,440
going to swallow it right it's it's that

847
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:40,919
process and I wonder um for you guys

848
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,760
like what is it that um how did you guys

849
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:48,358
get to that point you know to to get

850
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:52,160
that understanding right so um it

851
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:55,838
was okay I will describe sort of what I

852
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:57,639
set up from the beginning um and uh you

853
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:59,239
know I'll try to go through the pro

854
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:01,078
program overview in general of how I

855
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:02,919
built it and then we can go go from

856
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:05,160
there none of this information this is

857
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:10,200
like well documented on on on yak's

858
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:12,159
website so um basically

859
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:15,279
um

860
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:18,799
we when you when you when you assess a

861
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,960
Botanical um there are there there's a

862
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,000
couple different things that matter one

863
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,639
is a true to type value which is that

864
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,400
this is consistent across this variety

865
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:31,440
within um you know couple standard

866
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,280
deviations so generally two um off of

867
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,440
the mean for its environment because

868
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,319
there's a strong G by interaction right

869
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,039
so you might see this in a if you're

870
00:36:38,318 --> 00:36:41,239
growing cocoa if you're cannabis if

871
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:42,318
you're going Coco if you're going deep

872
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:44,159
water culture if you're going living

873
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:45,880
soil if you're going semi semi-organic

874
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,039
you know so on so forth uh and you're

875
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,280
using LEDs versus HIDs versus so on so

876
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:53,679
forth those are all um those are all

877
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,760
factors need to be considered in outdoor

878
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:59,440
crops it's it's infinitely more complex

879
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,200
but once you have that true to type

880
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,599
score you have you know it's a plus one

881
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:08,118
meaning it's one standard deviation over

882
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:10,119
in X Y and Z characteristic well we

883
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:12,119
didn't have those characteristics okay

884
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:14,358
so we didn't know what we were looking

885
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:20,039
at we were looking at a PCA to start

886
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:21,799
with which was total oil and um uh the

887
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:23,960
like total Alpha basically so so

888
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,119
basically it' be like looking at total

889
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,838
amount of aromatic compounds possible

890
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,519
and THC count right which which is

891
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:33,199
pretty that's about where the industry

892
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:34,519
was two years ago 3 years ago okay in in

893
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,960
cannabis and it's getting it's getting

894
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:38,440
getting better okay but from that point

895
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,639
on we're like okay well hang on there's

896
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:45,960
a lot more going on here so we used a

897
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:50,318
standard metric for analyzing uh

898
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:53,199
Botanical um so using a GC and then we

899
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:56,800
um did a sensory evaluation and using

900
00:37:53,199 --> 00:38:00,480
the standard method we noticed that um

901
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,519
these two different varieties were grown

902
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,199
by the same grower so that was actually

903
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:07,119
nice control um were showing up as

904
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:09,159
statistically indistinguishable using SE

905
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,960
the seven-point metric for the oils that

906
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:12,639
were were being you know used and it was

907
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,039
happened to be Mosaic and what is now

908
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:16,279
called sabro and anybody in the beer

909
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,679
industry can tell you that those FL hops

910
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,599
do not smell anything alike so we

911
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:22,838
noticed that okay there is some uh

912
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,039
there's something that our standard

913
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:28,119
method is not picking up so we started

914
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:31,000
doing a two-pronged approach which is

915
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:33,720
that we sensory we analyze through

916
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,079
sensory every single lot and we decided

917
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,639
the terms ahead of time so that took

918
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,359
about six months to decide what the what

919
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:41,000
the Lexicon was going to be and so we

920
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:43,960
did you know we B you take the major

921
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,880
categories like herbal Woody earthy

922
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,519
fruity

923
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,680
um

924
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:53,039
dank um

925
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,960
vegetal uh onion garlic diesel flavors

926
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,480
yeah like all those things together um

927
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,599
and then nice

928
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,519
[Music]

929
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:02,519
um and I might have to do that in a

930
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:07,199
second um and then

931
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:08,639
you you take all those uh and and write

932
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:11,519
so you develop your your basically your

933
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:13,920
flavor wheel and you say okay in fruity

934
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,079
you have the option of citrus tropical

935
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,280
you know palm fruit Red Berry you know

936
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,800
those things and then you specify beyond

937
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,760
that so like in your Berry you can say

938
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,200
Blackberry raspberry uh blueberry Maran

939
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,680
Berry so on so forth um in your citrus

940
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:30,838
you've got lemon lime grapefruit you

941
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:33,159
know uh Citron uh Yuzu Tangerine you

942
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:35,358
know all those things um and then you

943
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:37,639
can assign a number which is a one to

944
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,880
five scale basically or 1 to 10 scale um

945
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:42,118
and it can be any integer between it can

946
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,039
be like a 5.5 or something like that um

947
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:46,880
incidentally we found we got better data

948
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:48,880
with a smaller scale because people are

949
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,280
lazy and they gravitate towards to mean

950
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,440
um but um what that allowed us to do was

951
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,040
then say okay this is what we are

952
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,920
talking these are the terms we're using

953
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:05,318
this is is um how we're describing it um

954
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:08,680
and then we put those samples through a

955
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:11,079
GC um and we had we've got two different

956
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:14,078
GC or we had two I had two different GC

957
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:21,519
GCS one with an all Factory port and one

958
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:23,880
with a um uh sulfur um a sulfur ch ch

959
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:26,440
luminesence detector um which allowed us

960
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:30,280
to look at thyes and thids and so what

961
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:33,480
we're able to do is you know smell the

962
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:36,040
sample as it's going through the GC um

963
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,519
and correlate each compound as it elutes

964
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:40,838
off to a descriptor so you just speak

965
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:44,239
into it and say okay this is a 1 through

966
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:48,799
five Citrus grapefruit this is a peach

967
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:52,439
this is a pear this is an apricot and

968
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,440
um what that did was allow us to start

969
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:58,960
creating you

970
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:00,920
know maps of the different strains or

971
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,159
different different Nick can I ask a

972
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,039
question sure please of course hey

973
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:11,480
thanks man um really cool topic here

974
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:13,559
today um so uh GC stands for gas uh

975
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,960
chromatograph and so for those of you

976
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:19,679
who don't know you're taking a sample of

977
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,679
material and injecting it into uh an

978
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:25,480
injector Port that's typically at 200

979
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:27,759
Centigrade or sometimes it's at 250 I

980
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,679
think we keep ours at 2 and

981
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,400
up so certainly if you look at a tpine

982
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:36,000
profile at room temperature and you look

983
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,039
at a tpine profile at 200° Centigrade

984
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,679
you could very much

985
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:44,159
see differences because chemistry

986
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:45,838
happens man you can't just assume that

987
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,920
you're going to inject this stuff in an

988
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:50,880
oxygen atmosphere heat these compounds

989
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,838
up which have multiple sites of

990
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,160
unsaturation and you're not going to

991
00:41:52,838 --> 00:41:57,440
undergo some type of chemical

992
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:59,559
transformation by the time you get to

993
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,000
the either old factory or whatever

994
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:06,000
detector you're using so how do you

995
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,039
reconcile a room temperature T tpine

996
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,760
profile with a tpine profile that's been

997
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:14,960
heated to 200 degrees so this this takes

998
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,640
time um but you first of all you should

999
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,240
get a GC that has a capability to do

1000
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:21,799
different ramps um and so you start at

1001
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,118
slightly below room temperature because

1002
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,039
I tried to keep this low Tech a low Tech

1003
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:27,800
question yeah but so basic basically we

1004
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:28,719
use we use different uh temp ramps just

1005
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,000
kind of like what Kylie was talking

1006
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:34,000
about earlier which is that um you know

1007
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,199
if you you find the vaporization point

1008
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,358
the and the under different conditions

1009
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:39,078
you can run under vacuum you can run

1010
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:40,358
under pressure and and even stretch

1011
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:44,480
those those chromatograms out a little

1012
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:45,719
bit more um and you are able to capture

1013
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,519
what is coming off at each given

1014
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:50,919
temperature and for cannabis it's almost

1015
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:54,119
kind of besides the point because our

1016
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:57,400
room temperature is not how we consume

1017
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:01,079
these we smoke them um well it's some s

1018
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,920
how we we extract them right and we how

1019
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,160
I guess back to the other another

1020
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,480
question I had how are you

1021
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:10,719
differentiating monps and sesats from

1022
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:14,838
other types of of compounds and how is

1023
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:16,799
that together um you know how's that

1024
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:18,440
data together you know reading to you is

1025
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,720
that is that actually giving you some

1026
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,960
kind of wherewithal as to okay this

1027
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:25,318
variety is reacting this way at this

1028
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,199
temperature but it's not reacting that

1029
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:32,440
way at let's say uh you know 180 versus

1030
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:36,759
120 well okay so so um there's a couple

1031
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,760
different layers here so

1032
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:41,719
um we're talking about like just

1033
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,640
basically you I'm talking about getting

1034
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:46,679
it getting it into the detector first

1035
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:49,639
let me go with that okay so um we have

1036
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:52,719
reference libraries for um you know all

1037
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:54,078
identified compounds and you get a uh

1038
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:55,519
nist is a common one but there's some

1039
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,559
other ones you can build your own if you

1040
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,559
identify them and

1041
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:05,519
um you know the attributes of those

1042
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:08,440
compounds under at ambient pressure and

1043
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:10,679
temperature and what their Vapor

1044
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:18,039
vaporization temperatures are what their

1045
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:19,558
um the VP is the uh the you know PPM

1046
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:21,759
things like that right well no no like

1047
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,200
so so PPM is just just a measurement of

1048
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,680
them and so so like what what the

1049
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:28,399
threshold is what the average threshold

1050
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:29,799
is like so chem spider and Cam and the

1051
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,680
Good Sense company have a lot of good

1052
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,200
data on all these things um but they're

1053
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:36,919
you know their their databases are are

1054
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,199
not always complete the nist is a

1055
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,119
fantastic one National Institute of

1056
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:44,719
something or other but databases um and

1057
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:47,680
in Institute standards and Technology

1058
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:50,919
thank you sir um

1059
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:52,318
and you compare these to what what are

1060
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,480
known and you get a conf confidence

1061
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:58,000
interval so basically you say like okay

1062
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,920
this is um geranial um versus Geral

1063
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,639
acetate Jal acetate uh it's you know

1064
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,440
it's a 67% chance it's going to be Geral

1065
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:07,000
acetate but it's a 95% chance that it's

1066
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,480
geranial it's likely geranial okay and

1067
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,159
there is there is some coaltion

1068
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,318
sometimes where you get things that go

1069
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:14,759
together um and you also get compounds

1070
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:16,358
that interfere with each other when um

1071
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,720
they're they're going through the

1072
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:23,519
through the G the um ionization process

1073
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:26,078
um but by running multiple runs under

1074
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:29,039
slightly different parameters you can

1075
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,960
change the those uh that that those

1076
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:35,400
coaltion um characteristics so for

1077
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:38,800
example if you are running triput so you

1078
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:42,119
do your um initial run with your space

1079
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,079
standard in triple CIT and then you

1080
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:46,838
compare those results you say okay well

1081
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,760
this peak is wider than it normally is

1082
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:50,078
against my reference standard so there

1083
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,720
might be something else that's coming

1084
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,920
out with it you increase the pressure

1085
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:58,239
and you change the uh temperature ramps

1086
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,318
and you try to split those Peaks up and

1087
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:04,118
so you can see that okay actually was an

1088
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:06,159
example is finacing um uh trans beta

1089
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:07,119
finacing is the standard that's used um

1090
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:10,159
but there's actually a bunch of

1091
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:13,200
different isomers in there um and so you

1092
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:15,440
can look at one single Peak is about you

1093
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:18,199
know it's say on a normal chromatogram

1094
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:22,318
at uh it comes out at you know 27

1095
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:24,318
minutes um and it looks say this wide

1096
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:27,318
right but when you actually look at all

1097
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:30,199
the ones that include all the other the

1098
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:32,599
isomer of Farine it's like a peak that's

1099
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:34,279
like this wide um and so you know

1100
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:35,480
there's something else going there and

1101
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,910
Farine doesn't have that many things

1102
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,800
that coal with it so it we're pretty

1103
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:40,960
[Music]

1104
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,599
comfortable just use it for the entire

1105
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,599
family of them and they don't interact

1106
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:48,280
differently with with our our sense our

1107
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,400
sensory program or sorry our organ

1108
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:54,960
organoleptic uh

1109
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:57,760
senses once you start doing that you

1110
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,639
start getting a much better picture of

1111
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,680
um when things come out and the real the

1112
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:05,598
real strength of doing it this way is

1113
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:07,239
when you link it with sensory and you

1114
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,559
start smelling them as they're coming

1115
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:11,799
off together because there are sometimes

1116
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:14,040
you'll get big Peaks on on your

1117
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,839
chromatogram and none of your panelists

1118
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:17,679
smell anything when that thing goes

1119
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:20,759
through which means it's an you know

1120
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:23,159
aromatically inactive compound as far as

1121
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,359
humans and as far as your specific uh

1122
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:27,480
sample your your panel panel sample goes

1123
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:28,960
um

1124
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,480
however there's other times when you see

1125
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,358
you don't see a peak um and you detect

1126
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,880
something that is really interesting so

1127
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:42,679
this happens happened for us with a very

1128
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:45,480
specific Aroma of Peach and apricot and

1129
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:49,000
uh we weren't seeing anything on one of

1130
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,679
our gc's so that told us that something

1131
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
was eluding at that moment but it was

1132
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:54,960
outs said the resolution so we changed

1133
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,119
the resolution and lo and behold we were

1134
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:00,039
able to identify two compounds that were

1135
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:03,480
associated with you know for our our

1136
00:48:00,039 --> 00:48:06,800
sensory panel of about 40 people um

1137
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:09,800
Peach and apricot okay so you so it goes

1138
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:13,000
both ways the sensory helps inform the

1139
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:15,160
the quantitative science and then the

1140
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,400
science helps create reference standards

1141
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:21,199
for sensory um so you have to do both

1142
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,318
together so here's a third here's the

1143
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:25,799
other third piece I think that at least

1144
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:28,079
I believe through the years that I've

1145
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,920
come to really ECT more is the

1146
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:33,599
psychology of things and how as a

1147
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,400
younger self you are trained literally

1148
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,240
like all of us we are all trained to

1149
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,760
learn and know things such as Cas smell

1150
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:44,239
things that we love right and they carry

1151
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:46,520
into today as an older self and and when

1152
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:48,078
someone says they like LOLOL forward

1153
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:51,559
things you like oh did you like grape

1154
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:54,760
juice as a kid and most of the time it's

1155
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:57,319
yes you know or I love or I love Calo I

1156
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,920
don't know why well did you love Citrus

1157
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:02,519
as a kid you know and all these things

1158
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,039
kind of make are starting to kind of

1159
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:06,798
make more sense as I get older and and

1160
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:09,039
we interact with more and more patients

1161
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:11,079
and speak in these terms and that's kind

1162
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:13,880
of the dumb down version the the layman

1163
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:16,519
term if you will of it all but I think

1164
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:19,079
that's extremely informative to the

1165
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:22,199
bioessay aspect of this and that

1166
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:24,839
actually will directly inform the other

1167
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:28,719
data that you see because you can now

1168
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:31,558
match real world with with you know with

1169
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,919
robotics and science you know and and

1170
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:35,200
that that to me is the is a very

1171
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,358
difficult thing as we're talking about

1172
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:41,279
today right it's it's almost it's the

1173
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:43,078
it's the Unicorn right so I don't know

1174
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,519
it just feels to me like there's there's

1175
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:47,039
more I I really think it's amazing like

1176
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:49,838
it's all these things together I think

1177
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:52,358
can help inform one another um you know

1178
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:54,400
it's the Art and Science in a way I'm

1179
00:49:52,358 --> 00:49:55,838
just excited to where it will lead us I

1180
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,798
mean think about when we didn't know how

1181
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:00,119
to of flower plants and everyone was

1182
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:01,519
just growing leaf and then someone was

1183
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:03,000
like hey you got to cut the light down

1184
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:04,920
and uh you know you'll get some buds on

1185
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,798
there and you know like I there's

1186
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,358
there's great things that we have yet to

1187
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:11,559
uncover and I think the rabbit hole that

1188
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:14,039
Nick is mentioning it's not supposed to

1189
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:16,880
be the be all end all but it's gonna

1190
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:19,519
create some incredible side missions in

1191
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,079
the game of cannabis yeah the dialogue

1192
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,480
right like and

1193
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,839
while um and and you know I guess I want

1194
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,880
to play a little bit of The Devil's

1195
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:31,960
Advocate while I really

1196
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,519
appreciate all of the standards and

1197
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:37,440
everything that you know sort of puts it

1198
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:41,119
into common

1199
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,280
language also puts it into common

1200
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,280
language and that is the same as when

1201
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,079
you standardize anything so say when the

1202
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,798
filet screwdriver was standardized it

1203
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,720
took away a thousand different

1204
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:53,440
instruments and different tools that

1205
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:56,159
other people were using all around the

1206
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,519
world so what this does is it gives us a

1207
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:01,399
common language but it also takes away

1208
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:03,798
individualistic language so me as a

1209
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:07,039
practitioner when I'm talking to people

1210
00:51:03,798 --> 00:51:08,960
I want them to use their language of

1211
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:11,838
whatever they want because that tells

1212
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:14,079
them more that tells me more about their

1213
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:18,639
constitution now if they're using

1214
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:21,480
language that is already you know in um

1215
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:23,838
some kind of a format then they're using

1216
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:27,318
someone else's language they're using

1217
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:31,279
someone else's tool and what concerns me

1218
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:34,119
is in standardizing cannabis and

1219
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:37,160
standardizing Botanicals is that we're

1220
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:39,798
taking away a lot of cultural values

1221
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:42,558
we're taking away you know the language

1222
00:51:39,798 --> 00:51:45,159
that people have with this very sacred

1223
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,519
plant that they've been long-term

1224
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:50,039
cultivating so what worries me about

1225
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:54,039
science is a bunch of

1226
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:57,480
englishspeaking white people creating a

1227
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:59,039
language for people all over the world

1228
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:03,798
that have a

1229
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:06,000
very intuitive very sacred relationship

1230
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:10,119
with this plant and that sacred

1231
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,960
relationship is also how I personally as

1232
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:15,720
a health practitioner treat people so if

1233
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:19,720
they're telling me you know this reminds

1234
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:23,358
me of Grandma's closet because of a

1235
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:26,199
cedar you know the cedar closet or

1236
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:29,519
something like that yes or moth balls

1237
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:31,519
with yes that may not be on you know

1238
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,639
this particular standard but that tells

1239
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,239
me more about that person it tells me

1240
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:38,199
more about the

1241
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:40,439
relationship that they might be having a

1242
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:42,118
with the medicine and also B with

1243
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,798
whatever healing tones that they're

1244
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:46,519
going through our energy at that

1245
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:49,358
particular time so yeah I really I

1246
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:52,239
really can Relish in the fact that we

1247
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:54,838
have a philic screwdriver and I can

1248
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:58,719
carry it all over the world but yet

1249
00:52:54,838 --> 00:53:03,078
again I'm not seeing all of the

1250
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:06,039
tools that are possible you know um

1251
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:07,760
historically and so it worries me of

1252
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:10,798
this sort of

1253
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,119
homogenization that we are creating

1254
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:14,880
within the Cannabis industry again

1255
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,200
creating Hoops that we can't jump

1256
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,039
through further on because this is a

1257
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:22,598
fractal medicine every single person has

1258
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:25,558
a different relationship with it and it

1259
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:27,079
fractals in different heat in different

1260
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:30,880
areas in different

1261
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:33,240
M well you said it every single person

1262
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,079
has their own and this just happens to

1263
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:36,919
be

1264
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,760
ours and so you have to accept it just

1265
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,358
like you want to accept yours they're

1266
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,880
both just as valid and well here's

1267
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:45,798
another like let me I'm I'm worried that

1268
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,519
people are I'm worried that you've

1269
00:53:45,798 --> 00:53:50,480
misinterpreted kind of the what the the

1270
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:55,559
goal is the goal is not to put people

1271
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:59,519
into boxes the goal is to give us terms

1272
00:53:55,559 --> 00:54:02,920
so that we can run it against um you

1273
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:07,318
know physical science and and chemistry

1274
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:08,760
to try to characterize lots of the plant

1275
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:09,838
okay not not we're not telling people

1276
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,640
what they're going to feel or how

1277
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:15,440
they're going to react to it and the

1278
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:18,239
idea of a shared lexicon is not to limit

1279
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:21,440
but to in fact give greater resolution

1280
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:24,399
and the Lexicon is not static it would

1281
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:28,440
be continuously evolving and increasing

1282
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:30,280
so um and it it does as you as you

1283
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,240
pointed out you know each patient has a

1284
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:36,880
different historical relationship to

1285
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:38,838
these uh the the sensations that arrive

1286
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,798
from these that arise from these

1287
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:45,880
compounds and if leveraged

1288
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:49,159
judiciously you can create a lexicon

1289
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:52,280
that encompasses you know 90 95% of

1290
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:54,960
those things uh you can use it for like

1291
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:58,839
as you said in different cultures um in

1292
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,679
different regions um for different uh

1293
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:02,440
you know genetics that are are related

1294
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:05,480
to different people's uh uh

1295
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:09,679
sensitivities to to smell um and it

1296
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:10,880
doesn't have to be um limiting and it

1297
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:14,358
doesn't have to be static it can

1298
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:17,000
continuously evolve and grow and you

1299
00:55:14,358 --> 00:55:19,880
know I I presented a very simplified

1300
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,280
version but you know my initial draft of

1301
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:24,920
the program that I designed had a drop

1302
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:28,760
down menu of at least like 20

1303
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:31,119
different iteration ations of Aromas for

1304
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:33,960
each subcategory it was ridiculous it

1305
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,480
was it was too too bulky to use but in

1306
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,760
terms of you know simplifying it and

1307
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,639
then we also allowed people to put down

1308
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,280
their own notes in everything okay and

1309
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,480
say this so this like you mentioned

1310
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:48,680
mothballs and Cedar right well mothballs

1311
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,838
are camper Cedar is Cedar um and a

1312
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:52,879
couple of other different compounds and

1313
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:56,920
alphap and bet Pine um

1314
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:59,519
so Mo ball naine

1315
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:04,039
yeah not even a tarpine at all it's a

1316
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:06,038
fused het fused aromatic compound if you

1317
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:08,640
smell pamper and you smell napoline

1318
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:12,960
you'll you'll see the difference between

1319
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:15,480
yeah between the two great thank you um

1320
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,039
uh the that's weird because I've got

1321
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:20,039
camper mothballs as well which is maybe

1322
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:23,079
it's because I was inuk I think they

1323
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:25,559
they tried to make like a more natural

1324
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:27,798
version of the moth balls but the moth

1325
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:29,119
balls in my grandmother's closet with

1326
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:31,599
the

1327
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:35,559
old yeah the super chemy ones but the

1328
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:38,599
point the thing is is also s go ah oh I

1329
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:41,720
just say napoline is a heavy hydrocarbon

1330
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:43,640
that I think they found was toxic so

1331
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:45,879
they tried to phase that out but years

1332
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:48,078
ago that was that's what they used and

1333
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,480
napoline also comes from you can get it

1334
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,519
from petrochemicals but you can also get

1335
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:58,240
it from pine sap from certain Pines you

1336
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:58,239
know yeah absolutely and croso bushes um

1337
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:02,719
so just a quick backup though is that uh

1338
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:06,119
one thing that I also want to talk about

1339
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:10,239
is that we're not discussing tpin

1340
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:13,318
because the turps are only a fraction of

1341
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:18,279
what is aromatically active in cannabis

1342
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:21,358
so amen amen man you you see all these

1343
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,359
people talk about tpes and where I get

1344
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:27,358
kind of you know confused on this is as

1345
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:30,318
a chemist I think of tpin as ligers of

1346
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:32,519
isoprene completely hydrocarbon and as

1347
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:34,400
soon as you have an alcohol or as soon

1348
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:37,239
as you have an oxygen or a sulfur in

1349
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:40,680
there it's no longer a turpine it's a

1350
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:42,558
turpenoid it used to be a turpine but

1351
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:44,960
now these things are doing chemistry and

1352
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:48,839
they're making terpenoids and Turpin

1353
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:51,920
noids is a much wider class of molecules

1354
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:54,440
so lolu that's a turpenoid right because

1355
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:57,639
there's it's a turpine alcohol you know

1356
00:57:54,440 --> 00:58:00,960
so and again this speaks Nick to the

1357
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:03,159
broken lexicon in cannabis right which

1358
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,679
is that you know whether it's sativa

1359
00:58:03,159 --> 00:58:08,879
indicia or you know people are

1360
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:12,159
constantly confusing all kinds of terms

1361
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,920
when it comes to but it also it also

1362
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:15,759
shows the flip side Mark of the shared

1363
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,079
lexicon that people have learned about

1364
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:21,039
Tarpin in the last several years that

1365
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:23,599
they're all Now using and I think that

1366
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,319
that's empowering sometimes so it's like

1367
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,400
you know I love the idea that science is

1368
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:29,038
over here doing and you've got the more

1369
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,039
spiritual aspect over here and the

1370
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:33,839
beautiful thing about cannabis is

1371
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:37,760
exactly what Kelly said it's a fractal

1372
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:39,519
which means everything has its place you

1373
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,160
know regardless of how you're going

1374
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:45,119
about doing it this plant is have is is

1375
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:47,639
somehow getting us to discover new

1376
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:50,119
things about it and to me you know I

1377
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:52,838
love very much the sort of you know

1378
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:54,880
conscious spiritual almost psychedelic

1379
00:58:52,838 --> 00:58:57,199
aspect of understanding the moon and the

1380
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,039
regenerative farming and you know being

1381
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:02,519
synergistic with Mother Earth but that

1382
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:05,119
but I also love the Deep chemistry of it

1383
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:06,719
and how that sort of interacts and you

1384
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,480
know the feelings that I'm having I want

1385
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:11,719
to understand all of these things so I

1386
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,480
really kind of have a foot in both um in

1387
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:16,279
both

1388
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,318
places yeah no I couldn't agree more um

1389
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:21,798
Mark I think Marcus it's

1390
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:23,400
like look this is only healthy because

1391
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:25,159
there's so many times when I wish I

1392
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,639
could have these broader conversations

1393
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:29,798
and Mark said it beautifully terpenoids

1394
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:32,000
is a great term and I just say them

1395
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:34,798
aromatic chemicals I just I don't I just

1396
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,639
even go yeah but the problem there Colin

1397
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:39,440
the problem there to a chemist like

1398
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:42,679
myself yeah when I hear aromatic yeah I

1399
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:45,318
guess in in a general sense that's yeah

1400
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:48,879
Aroma containing compounds or compounds

1401
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:51,679
that have an aroma right but aromatic to

1402
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:55,280
a chemist to an organic chemist means a

1403
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:59,838
Benzene ring or a tryptamine ring

1404
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:02,960
something got 4 n plus2 Pi electrons is

1405
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:05,318
an aromatic species some of those things

1406
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,119
are like noxious they don't smell good

1407
01:00:05,318 --> 01:00:12,119
at all some of them have don't don't

1408
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:14,200
have a smell at all so uh you know again

1409
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:17,599
Aroma containing molecules and that's

1410
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:22,759
why I don't mind using the slang TPS

1411
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:26,000
because TPS to me encompasses tpen cesit

1412
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:29,000
tpin th Turpin but it also encompasses

1413
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,239
is the wider class of molecule which is

1414
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,000
turp noids and it's the turp noids I

1415
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:38,159
think that really create a huge amount

1416
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,880
of molecular diversity in the in the

1417
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:44,598
sense and fragrances that we're able to

1418
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:47,280
sense you know the smell of sense or or

1419
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:49,880
I'm sorry the sense of smell rather is

1420
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,240
is is the most primitive sense that we

1421
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:56,039
we have I think it was the first before

1422
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:58,719
Vision before sight before touch uh

1423
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:01,920
smell was a very very important

1424
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:04,239
evolutionary uh trait to have for

1425
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,599
survival yeah new doubt what one other

1426
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:07,959
thing I wanted to bring up is is

1427
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:10,480
environment for these set in varietals

1428
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:12,440
you know they they're going to express

1429
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:15,519
different traits from the

1430
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:19,880
chemotype itself every single time you

1431
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:23,318
change its feeding cycle it's BPD ppfd

1432
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:25,318
its root Zone temperatures I mean yeah

1433
01:01:23,318 --> 01:01:27,639
there's so many things that that are

1434
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:30,000
contributing I think to even like water

1435
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:32,118
deprivation like if there's so many

1436
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,599
things I think that that allow these

1437
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:35,640
things to go in different directions

1438
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:37,798
during the cultivation aspect of things

1439
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:40,159
that I think we've yet to really truly

1440
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:42,280
understand in terms of controlling so

1441
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:44,358
this this speaks to the point Colin that

1442
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:46,680
I was mentioning earlier to Nick like

1443
01:01:44,358 --> 01:01:49,239
when you walk through the Grove you're

1444
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:51,159
not heating those tpine profiles up to

1445
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:53,919
200 degrees Cade you're walking through

1446
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:56,078
the Grove and basically getting a room

1447
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,480
temperature

1448
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:00,880
you know inhalation of and when you

1449
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:04,278
pinch the bud you're not sending it

1450
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,920
through a injection port at 200 degrees

1451
01:02:04,278 --> 01:02:11,480
so I think just my point to Nick before

1452
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:14,559
was while we conveniently use GC and we

1453
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:16,679
can change the parameters around what

1454
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:18,760
temperatures these things are heated up

1455
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:21,278
they're still being heated and when you

1456
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:23,920
stare crossey at these molecules they

1457
01:02:21,278 --> 01:02:25,480
they do chemistry so certainly when you

1458
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,240
when you inject something into an

1459
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:30,920
injection Port no matter how hot it is

1460
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:33,598
it is going to change the chemistry

1461
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:35,720
somewhat but I think Nick just to go

1462
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:38,760
back to that point for a second is that

1463
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:40,759
um you know um let's look at T

1464
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:43,000
terpinolene for for for example

1465
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:46,119
terpinolene is a great example

1466
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,639
because uh an isomer of terpinolene is

1467
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:50,838
loning right and I think in in

1468
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,639
terpinolene can't there be like four

1469
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:55,119
different isomers because there's two

1470
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:58,078
double bonds that could walk around in

1471
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:59,400
that ring structure itself so so I think

1472
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:02,278
whether you're looking at Gamma

1473
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:04,358
terpinolene or whether you're looking at

1474
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:06,079
alpha terpinolene or whether you're

1475
01:03:04,358 --> 01:03:08,960
looking at lyine these things are going

1476
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:11,920
to have very very different organoleptic

1477
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,519
properties not always you'd be surprised

1478
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:17,760
um so so and and that's that's and it

1479
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:18,960
depends very much on the compound um so

1480
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,559
and that's that's kind of the point is

1481
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,119
that

1482
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:26,079
um as I was mentioning about Farine

1483
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:28,318
earlier as an example I know that one

1484
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,278
and like those all present pretty much

1485
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:35,038
the same

1486
01:03:29,278 --> 01:03:36,278
way um in in terms of the aroma bucket

1487
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:39,319
and it's not to say that each

1488
01:03:36,278 --> 01:03:43,079
individually would not present

1489
01:03:39,318 --> 01:03:45,079
differently but when they all come out

1490
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:49,000
together and they bind the same

1491
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:50,039
receptors the whole um moyy is giving

1492
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,400
you that

1493
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:56,880
experience um and it may be the case

1494
01:03:53,400 --> 01:04:00,119
with um say terpinolene um and its

1495
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:03,039
various isomers that they pretty much

1496
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:04,400
will elute together and let's and I use

1497
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,278
elute together me they're going to flash

1498
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,519
off together and we're going to smell

1499
01:04:06,278 --> 01:04:10,719
them all at the same time rather than

1500
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:13,278
independently um and so I I want to

1501
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:16,558
caution that you know with with sensory

1502
01:04:13,278 --> 01:04:21,079
and organoleptic approaches reductionism

1503
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:23,160
is a mistake um so when you try to just

1504
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:25,079
do a simple PCA or principal component

1505
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:27,519
analysis of something you're Le you're

1506
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:30,079
just like I think

1507
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:34,000
with Kelly the other things that are

1508
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:35,798
there and one of what my program my

1509
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,798
approach to this is is like let's

1510
01:04:35,798 --> 01:04:40,278
actually get a whole bunch more buckets

1511
01:04:37,798 --> 01:04:43,400
because we don't just want to use PCA

1512
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:46,719
because it it it really dulls the colors

1513
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:49,160
and narrows the the the the ability to

1514
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:51,358
talk about things so we want to look at

1515
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:53,838
um

1516
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:56,880
really as much as as much specificity as

1517
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:59,038
we can reasonably get and we can try to

1518
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,559
get it to the the different use

1519
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:04,119
conditions so vaporization um you know

1520
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:05,200
straight up smoking um Edibles I know

1521
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:06,920
that's that's and we're talking about

1522
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:08,838
the gut microbiome that's and the gut

1523
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,400
ECS that's an entirely different thing

1524
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:13,798
um

1525
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:17,000
but you don't want to

1526
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:19,639
just over ruce it down to single

1527
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,960
compounds like one compound one effect

1528
01:05:19,639 --> 01:05:24,038
um that's I mean the the FDA and the

1529
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:27,240
whole drug classification has proven

1530
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:30,160
that that doesn't work right um and you

1531
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:32,879
just kind of need to put in the work to

1532
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:36,519
get as much information as you can and

1533
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:39,278
then run analyses on these databases

1534
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:43,239
against you know sensory against you

1535
01:05:39,278 --> 01:05:45,559
know GC chemistry and LC chemistry and

1536
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:47,798
then you know whatever other metrics you

1537
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:49,278
want to use so it takes time it takes

1538
01:05:47,798 --> 01:05:52,639
work it takes

1539
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:55,400
buyin but the value we get from that

1540
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:57,440
does not just only allow us to discuss

1541
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:01,559
and and perhaps better characterize

1542
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:03,599
individual lots of of of cannabis um but

1543
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:06,079
also allows Growers to have information

1544
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:09,240
as to what their particular treatment of

1545
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:11,480
a given strain is doing to the turpine

1546
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:15,118
and to the the the actual chemovar

1547
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:18,358
expression and it's an incredibly

1548
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:21,400
powerful tool the value of which is

1549
01:06:18,358 --> 01:06:25,598
almost impossible to quantify until you

1550
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:26,960
start playing with it um and I think

1551
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,240
like so like you know there's a lot of I

1552
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,760
mean in growing oh my God there's so

1553
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:32,439
much bro science about like you know um

1554
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,839
you know 48 Hours of light deprivation

1555
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:37,720
to increase the THC and uh you know

1556
01:06:34,838 --> 01:06:41,599
using different light uh levels and then

1557
01:06:37,719 --> 01:06:44,078
there's the whole flushing argument you

1558
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:48,119
know it's all

1559
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:51,200
anecdotal and there is absolute value in

1560
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:55,838
in an anecdotal experience but until you

1561
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:58,078
begin to really rigorously try to

1562
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:00,519
understand why these things are

1563
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:03,318
happening there's a lot of noise and the

1564
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:06,159
signal gets lost and so what I'm trying

1565
01:07:03,318 --> 01:07:09,519
to do is what I'm proposing is basically

1566
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:12,278
let's work on a system where we try to

1567
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:15,199
collect as much information as we

1568
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:18,880
can and assemble it into a database that

1569
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:22,798
will allow us to start statistically

1570
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:26,278
answering some of these questions um and

1571
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:28,480
it's you know it it'll be a while but it

1572
01:07:26,278 --> 01:07:31,480
doesn't matter like this isn't

1573
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,480
necessarily

1574
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:35,318
um it doesn't matter if it takes forever

1575
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,838
because we're going to always constantly

1576
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:39,318
be learning more things and we're also

1577
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:41,838
constantly going to be refining uh the

1578
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:43,318
our our understanding of what compounds

1579
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:46,798
and what compounds in Synergy or

1580
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:47,838
antagonism do to our experience and so

1581
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:49,159
that's that's kind of the long and the

1582
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:50,639
short of it like this is this is a this

1583
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:54,440
is a marathon it's definitely not a

1584
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:55,838
Sprint yeah Mark I got a question um do

1585
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:58,760
you think it would make more sense to

1586
01:07:55,838 --> 01:08:01,038
refer to to the Turpin themselves as

1587
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:04,559
voc's well they're yeah I mean they're

1588
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:06,839
definitely volatile but um yeah so vocc

1589
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:09,079
is an acronym for volatile organic

1590
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:12,000
compound so they certainly fall into

1591
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:14,480
that category if it's you know again

1592
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,399
like I I've I've run into this a few

1593
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:20,679
times where people want to call kathlene

1594
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:23,960
which is a sesquiterpene they want to

1595
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:26,560
call it a canono because it binds to CB2

1596
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:29,798
it's like wait a second you don't you

1597
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:32,359
don't classify compounds by what

1598
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:36,560
receptors they bind to you classify them

1599
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:38,960
by what the structure of the compound is

1600
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:43,679
so yeah I mean I'd always like to think

1601
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:46,439
that canabo are canabo and terpenoids or

1602
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:47,960
terpenoids I I think that it's

1603
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:51,238
interesting Addison because if you

1604
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:54,920
looked at like tpine profiles like when

1605
01:08:51,238 --> 01:08:58,039
you guys first started way back when and

1606
01:08:54,920 --> 01:09:02,560
now um yeah you're getting a a pretty

1607
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:04,880
broad swath of tpine CES Turpin

1608
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:07,319
terpenoids you know the most common ones

1609
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:10,239
in cannabis and maybe this is again more

1610
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:13,080
of a question for Nick it still seems

1611
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:15,559
like there's an unknown fraction of

1612
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:18,600
compounds in the volatile organic

1613
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:21,719
compound collection that we still can't

1614
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:24,239
quite put our finger on because if the

1615
01:09:21,719 --> 01:09:26,000
folks at true Tarpin try to create the

1616
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:28,158
sour diesel

1617
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,838
uh tarpine profile so they could put it

1618
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:34,358
in a jar and sell it it it all it all to

1619
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:36,600
me anyway uh my sense tells me that

1620
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:37,960
those things all basically taste the

1621
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,798
same and they're kind of missing the

1622
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:44,279
point that they're only looking at maybe

1623
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:46,798
a handful of the Turpin and terpenoids

1624
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:50,040
that are in there but what really makes

1625
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:51,920
a big impact are all those compounds

1626
01:09:50,039 --> 01:09:55,158
that are in there at such a low level

1627
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:59,079
that we can't really discern them by DC

1628
01:09:55,158 --> 01:10:03,359
and but our old factory spectroscopy up

1629
01:09:59,079 --> 01:10:04,920
here can you know so this is an

1630
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:06,599
interesting thing that you you mentioned

1631
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:10,520
here so

1632
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:11,719
um the GC settings are kind of what

1633
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,880
determined that so like there's there's

1634
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:15,039
no such thing as bad weather there is

1635
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:17,520
only uh inadequate clothing and and

1636
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:18,679
preparation you know it's it's to quote

1637
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,920
Mr Swanson the same thing is that

1638
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:21,359
there's nothing that's it's it's not

1639
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,560
that we can't detect them it's that we

1640
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:24,439
don't know we should be looking for

1641
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,880
those and that's what you you have to

1642
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:30,759
work on changing ing the resolution of

1643
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:33,000
of your scan basically and as an example

1644
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,560
um so I put in the chat you know we're

1645
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,760
talking about Turpin terpenoids monot

1646
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:40,159
Turpin hotpin Al nobody's mentioned

1647
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:42,280
aliphatic alcohols dials diates Esters

1648
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:44,960
or the acids

1649
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:46,399
okay and it's and this for example there

1650
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,760
was this paper that came out like two

1651
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:50,719
weeks ago I'm surprised it even got

1652
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:53,159
published um because they said oh we

1653
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:54,640
discovered what uh the skunky Aroma was

1654
01:10:53,158 --> 01:10:56,719
in in cannabis for the first time like

1655
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:00,440
no you I mean we've known that that in

1656
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:02,560
beer for decades um we discovered the

1657
01:11:00,439 --> 01:11:04,158
and this we discovered the the garlic

1658
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,440
and onion characteristics like and the

1659
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:09,119
diesel characters like no we we know

1660
01:11:06,439 --> 01:11:11,000
what compounds cause those and what

1661
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:13,198
classes of compounds and so you might

1662
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,439
have you know identified a particular

1663
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:15,879
isomer of one or something like that but

1664
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:18,719
this is this is this is information

1665
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:20,319
that's already known um and so when we

1666
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,880
talk about tpin like I want people to

1667
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:24,960
move away from just using turpins but

1668
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:27,039
Marcus has point that people are uh are

1669
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,439
are getting more excited about using the

1670
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:30,198
terms that they're learning because they

1671
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:32,279
want to dive deeper and they want to be

1672
01:11:30,198 --> 01:11:34,919
able to better understand the the

1673
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:37,719
medicine or the the compounds or the the

1674
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:40,639
the material that they're using

1675
01:11:37,719 --> 01:11:43,399
and this conversation is really just to

1676
01:11:40,639 --> 01:11:44,800
get people started on let's throw that

1677
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:46,399
up like you know let's let's let's blow

1678
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,800
this up quite a bit let's zoom in and

1679
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:50,000
let's really blow this up and like let's

1680
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:52,440
create a really complex system that we

1681
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:57,760
can at least use to derive information

1682
01:11:52,439 --> 01:12:00,238
from so from past life you know that

1683
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:04,199
that um comparison between Mosaic and

1684
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:07,399
sabro that I said earlier well we

1685
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:10,198
narrowed it down to um a compound that

1686
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:12,759
was at uh at

1687
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:17,399
0.001 parts per

1688
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:19,679
trillion okay um so we can get pretty

1689
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:22,759
damn specific in terms of the volume

1690
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:24,279
that's that that's in there and to me

1691
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,079
that's super exciting like it's

1692
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:27,800
ridiculous uh like that that resolution

1693
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:30,000
like we we kind of went on a on a like

1694
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:32,719
totally diversion bug hunt when we like

1695
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,600
a picr is that what that is a picr I

1696
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:39,319
think it might even be smaller so Pico

1697
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:42,880
trillion so crazy yeah it's basically

1698
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:45,359
like what is it one part per quadrillion

1699
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:47,679
yeah no 0.1 parts per per quadrillion so

1700
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:50,198
yeah that's like taking a lint brush to

1701
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:52,239
a New York City sidewalk you're gonna

1702
01:12:50,198 --> 01:12:55,638
find everything

1703
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:58,319
yeah go go ahead no I was thinking

1704
01:12:55,639 --> 01:13:00,319
earlier too just about you know my

1705
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:02,559
favorite part of all of it is Esters and

1706
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:05,198
I love like the banana Esther is my

1707
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:09,480
favorite because it's so complex in a

1708
01:13:05,198 --> 01:13:11,559
sense and you acate acetate yep yep so

1709
01:13:09,479 --> 01:13:14,718
it's but what I love and then look at

1710
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:17,639
CBD when you bind whatever the cherry

1711
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:19,800
flavor to CBD that binds to that canabo

1712
01:13:17,639 --> 01:13:21,920
there there's things in there what I

1713
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,800
always tell people is when you smell

1714
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,279
cannabis you're smelling a lot of other

1715
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,600
things beside right we know there's

1716
01:13:26,279 --> 01:13:29,039
chlorophyll in there we know there's

1717
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,600
plant matter there there's other things

1718
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:31,840
that they're catching the scent of

1719
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:34,719
that's why when I look at the guys that

1720
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:36,239
true tpin I feel like they aren't doing

1721
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:38,399
it correctly because they're not adding

1722
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:39,959
some of those other things but again

1723
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:42,759
it's not going to be a beautiful clear

1724
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:46,279
jar of tpin at that point um so it's

1725
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:47,639
really it it always gets to me where um

1726
01:13:46,279 --> 01:13:49,559
you know when when I look at these

1727
01:13:47,639 --> 01:13:51,600
things and I see the conversation it's

1728
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,960
the education level of the consumer and

1729
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,920
like Marcus said they've gotten much

1730
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:59,399
better you know they like I remember

1731
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:02,279
when you when when you use the term TPS

1732
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:04,279
or tpin people had no idea what the [ __ ]

1733
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:06,559
that was I would drive my car's license

1734
01:14:04,279 --> 01:14:08,000
plate says TP rig and I would drive my

1735
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,679
car around and no one knew what the [ __ ]

1736
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
it was and now I'm in La almost every

1737
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:14,920
time I'm on the highway there's kids

1738
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,840
behind me like [ __ ] videoing my car

1739
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,239
because they because it's it's so

1740
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:20,880
popular now in the understanding um that

1741
01:14:19,238 --> 01:14:22,479
people know that I love that I think

1742
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,880
that that's the the door's open we

1743
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:27,119
cracked the a little bit and now they're

1744
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:29,560
like oh [ __ ] I mean a lot of people

1745
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:32,399
don't know that Maryland's college

1746
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:34,320
football team is the turps the terpens

1747
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:35,920
so they make a ton I have T-shirts that

1748
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:38,279
just say turps on them and all this [ __ ]

1749
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:41,880
from that I I love how it's becoming

1750
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:43,960
more of the conversation but the the and

1751
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:46,119
I and I think the idea that that you're

1752
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,920
presenting Nick is genius because it

1753
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:50,039
will allow people at least something to

1754
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,000
measure from at least something to dig

1755
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:54,479
into and compare because that's what

1756
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,238
we're doing all the time we may agree

1757
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:57,599
here but then turn around and be in

1758
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:59,718
another situation and we're just

1759
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:02,199
comparing our own understanding so I

1760
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:03,880
think it's a great idea um I really I'm

1761
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:05,799
excited to see really where it goes

1762
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:09,000
because the I love your point about the

1763
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:10,719
drop-down menu and when you get into it

1764
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,960
it's it could be a million different

1765
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,920
things that kind of fall into it so um

1766
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,600
no I think that when it comes to

1767
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:18,000
analyzing things and looking at things

1768
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,480
and getting a better understanding of

1769
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,079
them um it's a long process and I feel

1770
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:25,238
like uh in order to get there we all

1771
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:28,600
need to smoke more hash that's just what

1772
01:15:25,238 --> 01:15:30,319
it comes down and grow more weed yeah

1773
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:33,480
you know there there is a lot of studies

1774
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:35,479
done with enzymatic biotransformation um

1775
01:15:33,479 --> 01:15:38,718
for you know specifically

1776
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:40,359
targeting and terpenoids so I I would

1777
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:41,880
highly recommend I'll I'll send you some

1778
01:15:40,359 --> 01:15:44,079
white papers I have that I've been

1779
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:46,880
digging into and I think it'll be

1780
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:48,198
perhaps helpful for your for for the the

1781
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,920
headp space that you're

1782
01:15:48,198 --> 01:15:53,439
occupying I think the promise that was

1783
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:57,039
never really delivered on is the notion

1784
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:59,359
that we can categ ize a variety or a

1785
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:02,560
cultivar by just looking at the turine

1786
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:05,679
profile by GC and then reassembling that

1787
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:07,920
tpine profile adding that to unflavored

1788
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:11,399
distillate and basically coming up with

1789
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:13,399
a good tasting concentrate and I don't

1790
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:15,599
know Addison I I you know we've been

1791
01:16:13,399 --> 01:16:17,759
following this thing for years and I

1792
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:21,560
still don't think that anyone has got

1793
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:24,280
that got that down it always seems to me

1794
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:27,719
like there's two aspects not just the

1795
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:30,719
tpine pro profile but the the relative

1796
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:33,359
concentration of tpin you know like so

1797
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:36,119
sensitive yeah yeah well years ago when

1798
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:38,359
Tony was talking about you know adding

1799
01:16:36,119 --> 01:16:40,880
tpin to his dad he was like putting

1800
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:43,639
squirts of it in the time it's like holy

1801
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:46,840
[ __ ] I can still feel it on my

1802
01:16:43,639 --> 01:16:50,359
throat when you add that much it becomes

1803
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:52,520
yeah cost costic on your throat and it

1804
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:54,279
also it gets to the full circle of why

1805
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,199
Kylie's here today and you know because

1806
01:16:54,279 --> 01:16:59,039
a part of this conversation and creating

1807
01:16:56,198 --> 01:17:02,279
a shared lexicon it's also like well you

1808
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:02,279
can't be smoking

1809
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:11,800
out yep I was about to say when you

1810
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:13,678
consume hash or a vape um and depending

1811
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:17,440
on what temperature you're using and

1812
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:19,319
also if you consume in the flower form

1813
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,479
you're going to have a totally different

1814
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:21,399
experience like in the flower form

1815
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:24,638
you're going to be getting a lot of

1816
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:25,839
other compounds for good or for ill that

1817
01:17:24,639 --> 01:17:28,119
um

1818
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:30,639
are you

1819
01:17:28,119 --> 01:17:32,479
know present like you get the ash the

1820
01:17:30,639 --> 01:17:34,840
Ash and the smoke and so on so forth and

1821
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:37,000
it's um sorry Marcus we lost you just at

1822
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:39,719
the uh as you're getting into

1823
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,719
the

1824
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:44,719
excitement um but yeah I mean that

1825
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:48,639
that's a huge thing and so I call that

1826
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:50,439
form or or the the format matters hugely

1827
01:17:48,639 --> 01:17:55,400
um so I know this is Hash church so

1828
01:17:50,439 --> 01:17:57,198
maybe flower is is is verboten uh but uh

1829
01:17:55,399 --> 01:17:59,559
it's uh you know there's some strains

1830
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:03,479
that I prefer to consume in flower form

1831
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:07,600
um just because I enjoy the experience I

1832
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:10,119
get from it um and others that I you

1833
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,320
know really don't want to do that like

1834
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:16,039
you know Gorilla Glue and N9 Pound

1835
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:18,519
Hammer and all those guys um they are

1836
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:21,600
not lightly named like for me I'm I'm

1837
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:24,520
very sensitive to THC um and it just

1838
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:26,440
knocks me out um whereas like the one I

1839
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:31,520
just showed earlier with the a bunch of

1840
01:18:26,439 --> 01:18:36,439
CBG and CBD and CB Jesus uh it's also

1841
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:37,360
got 3% CBC and 0 4% CBT which is super

1842
01:18:36,439 --> 01:18:39,198
interesting to me I've been I've been

1843
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:41,238
chasing these cannaboids for a while and

1844
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:42,519
uh this is someone I'm I'm talking to

1845
01:18:41,238 --> 01:18:44,678
about some of their their their

1846
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:47,199
development but

1847
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:50,399
um you know we had U I had another one

1848
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:53,638
that was a 1.5 CBC and a bunch of other

1849
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:56,638
stuff and most mostly varen and it it

1850
01:18:53,639 --> 01:19:00,079
made me feel like I was consuming it you

1851
01:18:56,639 --> 01:19:02,119
know back in high school uh I was giggly

1852
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:04,000
I was energetic I was super happy about

1853
01:19:02,119 --> 01:19:05,158
it and I thought it was a CBC so I went

1854
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,760
out and got another one that had the

1855
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:08,359
highest the highest level CBC but it

1856
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:11,719
makes me feel completely different so

1857
01:19:08,359 --> 01:19:13,399
it's it's I I suspect that that one uh

1858
01:19:11,719 --> 01:19:18,039
is um probably to do with a turpine

1859
01:19:13,399 --> 01:19:20,198
profile and I'm just psyched as hell

1860
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:24,880
because well first of all I love that

1861
01:19:20,198 --> 01:19:26,559
feeling he buddy um but uh the um sort

1862
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:30,359
of kind of gone off on a tangent here

1863
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:31,840
wonder why um but the uh the the

1864
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:33,960
experience was just amazing so trying to

1865
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,360
trying to get that characterized um at

1866
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,840
least in terms of what for at least

1867
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:38,079
personally for me and let me be

1868
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,880
completely honest I'm a little bit

1869
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:41,920
selfish in in pursuing this because I

1870
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,800
want to know how this all stuff this

1871
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,319
stuff works for for me I want to know

1872
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:48,639
what I feel like Kai what you doing

1873
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:53,719
sorry he's a he's wanting pets

1874
01:19:48,639 --> 01:19:55,239
um and uh uh you know just I mean just

1875
01:19:53,719 --> 01:19:58,639
for ourselves

1876
01:19:55,238 --> 01:20:01,119
I think this is a say Dan this is a a

1877
01:19:58,639 --> 01:20:03,920
really great opportunity for just for

1878
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:06,479
the for the Geeks to to geek out on what

1879
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:09,079
we're really interested in you know and

1880
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:11,238
in my experience geery

1881
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:13,359
expands one second are you saying your

1882
01:20:11,238 --> 01:20:15,519
dog wanted petting I think that's a

1883
01:20:13,359 --> 01:20:17,880
unique situation in science is anybody

1884
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,480
aware of dog wanting pets I'm I'm no

1885
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:21,440
I've never never never heard of that

1886
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:22,519
before um but yeah got run that through

1887
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:25,238
the

1888
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:28,679
GC his GC is pretty awesome

1889
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:30,919
um we need a Kine

1890
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:32,880
lexicon has a strange affinity for for

1891
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:36,079
cat dung

1892
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:39,260
though M too I had to the kitty litter

1893
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:40,840
robot my cat my dog it's not a good

1894
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:43,679
[Laughter]

1895
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:45,960
scene I have a dog that likes to eat the

1896
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:48,440
other dogs stuff and I've done

1897
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:50,000
everything and there's just you know and

1898
01:20:48,439 --> 01:20:52,799
and you know some days she doesn't get

1899
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,920
any kisses so it's just how it is free

1900
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:58,159
snacks out the oven

1901
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:02,480
yeah it's it's a very taboo thing to

1902
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:02,479
witness I'll tell you right now be

1903
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:07,760
turps what do you mean

1904
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:11,079
raspberry yeah or vanilla yeah the anal

1905
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:13,360
gland of of a water rodent one thing I

1906
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:16,000
wanted to bring up was toxicology and I

1907
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:17,880
think I believe at least there that's a

1908
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:21,079
another subject that is highly

1909
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:25,079
underlooked in terms of how we're

1910
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:27,880
stacking uh you know things through and

1911
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:30,039
uh taking these individual parent parts

1912
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:32,880
and then creating new formulations with

1913
01:21:30,039 --> 01:21:36,679
them as ingredients um we're entering a

1914
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:38,800
a new world that you know admitted I

1915
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:42,719
don't think we we really truly

1916
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:45,719
understand um fully yet and I think it's

1917
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:47,679
I just believe we there's that should be

1918
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:50,719
along for the for the ride if we're

1919
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:54,840
going to develop you know a language it

1920
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:57,439
should be baked into it um so we all

1921
01:21:54,840 --> 01:22:00,400
understand that the risk behind a lot of

1922
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:02,919
this is is actually actually there I

1923
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:06,359
mean we love making these amazing

1924
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:08,600
products but through that act I think I

1925
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:12,759
just believe that we've also made some

1926
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:16,440
pretty toxic things P gun pretty toxic

1927
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:19,239
you know um there's certain things that

1928
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:21,638
we're gonna start to have to have

1929
01:22:19,238 --> 01:22:24,559
answers for I

1930
01:22:21,639 --> 01:22:28,239
think yeah I mean I yeah I mean I think

1931
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:30,520
think there's a it is a it is a drug you

1932
01:22:28,238 --> 01:22:32,479
know there's going to be risks in toxic

1933
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:34,360
you know the toxicity of that drug but I

1934
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:37,000
feel like the one great thing about

1935
01:22:34,359 --> 01:22:39,920
cannabis is that it seems to be not very

1936
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:42,639
toxic at all um you know unless you have

1937
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:44,800
this hyper mesis or these other issues

1938
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:47,279
with consumption um that's what's so

1939
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,600
great about cannabis I I I I mean at the

1940
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:49,960
end we all get these questions all of

1941
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:53,159
time I got a question the other day from

1942
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:55,800
a guy who obviously has no understanding

1943
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:57,039
of you know a very very quick early

1944
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,480
understanding I think he did some

1945
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:01,840
research on leukemia and saw that there

1946
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:03,718
are cell types for leukemia which

1947
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:05,679
specific cannabinoids and tpine profiles

1948
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:07,239
work really well for and and then that

1949
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:09,639
sort of led him into this direction of

1950
01:23:07,238 --> 01:23:11,439
being like well hey my grandmother's not

1951
01:23:09,639 --> 01:23:13,159
eating so I'm trying to get her to eat

1952
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:16,158
and I I explained to him I said just

1953
01:23:13,158 --> 01:23:17,599
give her a very low dose of THC you know

1954
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:19,960
because we all know when we were kids

1955
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,679
and we smoked that shitty Brown weed we

1956
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:24,560
were we got the munchies super hard

1957
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:26,600
because the dose of THC was so low um

1958
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:29,560
and then we also know too if you take a

1959
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:31,480
you know if you put to face a uh a half

1960
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:34,080
gram dab you're probably not going to be

1961
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:36,718
eating anything anytime soon after that

1962
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:39,639
um so I explained to him hey look you

1963
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:41,039
know give her a really low dose of THC

1964
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:43,000
um and he's like what do you mean and

1965
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:45,119
I'm like have her take one puff off of a

1966
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,039
joint you know see what Grandma's made

1967
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:49,880
of you know check her out see what she

1968
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:51,238
can do and and he's like well I mean you

1969
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,840
know we don't want her to feel the

1970
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:55,879
effects of of the THC and I'm like well

1971
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,840
listen you're not going to get the

1972
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:00,119
hungry feeling without the psychoactive

1973
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,920
feeling they come together I said but

1974
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:04,079
ask your grandmother this what

1975
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,279
medications are she taking right now and

1976
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:07,319
what are the side effects of that

1977
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:08,719
medication so you kind of educate them

1978
01:24:07,319 --> 01:24:11,039
to a point where they start to

1979
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:12,600
understand more like look man you're

1980
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:13,920
gonna [ __ ] break you know you're

1981
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,239
gonna break some eggs if you're making

1982
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:18,600
omelets grandma like that's how it works

1983
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:20,718
and he came back to me um this morning

1984
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:23,239
he messaged me and he said man he said

1985
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:25,800
you know she got to the point where she

1986
01:24:23,238 --> 01:24:27,399
you know wasn't and my mother came to me

1987
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:30,039
and and we had to make something happen

1988
01:24:27,399 --> 01:24:31,920
and I told him about our conversation so

1989
01:24:30,039 --> 01:24:33,479
I I was smoking a joint and she came up

1990
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:36,039
and took one puff off the joint and lo

1991
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:38,359
and behold she takes one puff off the

1992
01:24:36,039 --> 01:24:40,920
joint her first response is I don't feel

1993
01:24:38,359 --> 01:24:44,279
anything you know which is good and then

1994
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:46,760
maybe 25 minutes later he said she was

1995
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:49,800
sitting down eating soup which she

1996
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:52,000
hadn't had the urge to do before so it

1997
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:53,800
it really to me it's like how do you

1998
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,399
introduce them how do you walk them in

1999
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:56,360
real slight and give them that

2000
01:24:55,399 --> 01:24:57,839
understanding and that's what this is

2001
01:24:56,359 --> 01:25:00,439
about it's about really creating a

2002
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:02,319
measure uh so that people can say hey

2003
01:25:00,439 --> 01:25:04,519
because look what we've already all done

2004
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:07,079
collectively we've all collectively

2005
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:09,040
helped deliver some of this stuff that

2006
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:10,600
they're already looking at some of these

2007
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:11,880
you know when Steep Hill did its turpine

2008
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,639
testing we were all sitting there and it

2009
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:15,800
was like oh we're g to be able to

2010
01:25:13,639 --> 01:25:18,400
identify all these [ __ ] things and

2011
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:20,719
it's like no you just open Pandora's

2012
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:24,479
Box and you put your foot in your mouth

2013
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:26,920
at the same time because n you know God

2014
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:29,118
is nature in so many ways and and I feel

2015
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,679
like nature is cannabis and my biggest

2016
01:25:29,118 --> 01:25:33,479
beef with steep hill is that you are not

2017
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:36,440
the the the science of you know you are

2018
01:25:33,479 --> 01:25:38,718
not the they try to claim to be this

2019
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:40,399
like what is it like the science of

2020
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:43,000
cannabis or something and it's like no

2021
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:44,599
nature is that nature is giving this to

2022
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,800
you you're just analyzing and looking at

2023
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:48,960
it you're just you know you're you're

2024
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:53,159
you're business people uh looking at

2025
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:55,000
these things so I think oh go ahead I I

2026
01:25:53,158 --> 01:25:56,519
love that you said that out of because I

2027
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,719
think that it's really important for us

2028
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:01,360
to remember too that while we're

2029
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:04,679
studying tpes and all of all of the

2030
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:06,559
different fractals off of what tpes are

2031
01:26:04,679 --> 01:26:08,800
and what they can be even combined with

2032
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:11,600
and be created from you know the

2033
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:15,920
cannabis plant is creating tpin in a

2034
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:19,320
live State it's creating tpin through

2035
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:21,840
this incredible Dynamic microbiology

2036
01:26:19,319 --> 01:26:25,238
body which is the microbiome which is

2037
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:27,760
the endophytic system of the plant so I

2038
01:26:25,238 --> 01:26:30,279
mean talk about nature and talk about

2039
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:32,360
trying to explain something that is so

2040
01:26:30,279 --> 01:26:35,279
dynamically

2041
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:37,439
happening it it it's so different you

2042
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:40,039
know what soil are you giving it what

2043
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:42,399
kind of Lights do you have all of these

2044
01:26:40,039 --> 01:26:45,639
things and and again I'm gonna go back

2045
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:48,559
to normally eat and I'm gonna go back to

2046
01:26:45,639 --> 01:26:52,679
this awesome example in science is that

2047
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:54,920
us as well as plants our DNA we're

2048
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:57,760
99.9% identical

2049
01:26:54,920 --> 01:27:01,239
but our microbiome were

2050
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:03,440
99.9% totally different and that's no

2051
01:27:01,238 --> 01:27:06,759
different with the plant so here we are

2052
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:09,238
trying to explain and express while I do

2053
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:11,800
think that this kind of common language

2054
01:27:09,238 --> 01:27:15,799
could be really helpful you know in

2055
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:20,719
making medicines I believe that a lot of

2056
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:23,360
the energy and effort and um unfolding

2057
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:26,158
if you will of the plant really needs to

2058
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:28,880
come from end aidic system and

2059
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:31,638
microbiology and how we are creating the

2060
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:33,840
tpes from the very beginning not

2061
01:27:31,639 --> 01:27:36,560
necessarily how we're separating them

2062
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:39,360
out and how we're going to you know

2063
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:41,440
isolate them and create nor new sense

2064
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:45,158
but how are we going to work with the

2065
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:48,158
plant uh in its natural state to create

2066
01:27:45,158 --> 01:27:52,158
these vast amounts of tpin and and what

2067
01:27:48,158 --> 01:27:54,559
are we feeding the soil that creates

2068
01:27:52,158 --> 01:27:56,638
these these tpin That's what is so

2069
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:58,840
incredibly interesting to me um in the

2070
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,359
plant so that's that's where all of this

2071
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,319
intersects with metabolomics and

2072
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:03,880
proteomics so we can actually take

2073
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:05,799
samples throughout the life cycle of a

2074
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,279
plant and look at what genes are being

2075
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:11,079
turned off and on and what what

2076
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:13,719
metabolic pathways are engaged um and

2077
01:28:11,079 --> 01:28:15,519
that's super exciting for me and that's

2078
01:28:13,719 --> 01:28:17,158
that's obviously you need to get the the

2079
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,080
sort of the First Data down and then

2080
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:21,879
start looking at it but

2081
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:23,519
um that is it's some amazing science

2082
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,800
that has become accessible in the last

2083
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:28,320
couple of years

2084
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:30,440
to be able to look into the plant cells

2085
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:33,399
and see what the reaction of the plant

2086
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:35,399
is to a given environment um in terms of

2087
01:28:33,399 --> 01:28:36,719
its tertiary metabolites and what

2088
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:40,719
secondary metabolites what it's

2089
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:43,800
producing um and look at you know what

2090
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:47,560
the you know chemical impact in the

2091
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:52,480
living organism of a environmental

2092
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:55,560
change or um stressor is um

2093
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:58,638
it's that will take more work but you

2094
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:00,320
know as I said this is a you know if we

2095
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:02,960
get this going it's a it's certainly job

2096
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:05,679
security it'll be it's a very long

2097
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:09,439
experiment um but it's uh it's super

2098
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:10,520
super um important um and it actually

2099
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:12,158
and this is one of the things that I I

2100
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,080
kind of want to point out is that you

2101
01:29:12,158 --> 01:29:17,039
know this type of work has implications

2102
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:18,359
Beyond just cannabis like this can be as

2103
01:29:17,039 --> 01:29:19,800
you talked about toxicology but look in

2104
01:29:18,359 --> 01:29:22,039
terms of therapeutic benefits you know

2105
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:24,400
this the this the sense of smell is so

2106
01:29:22,039 --> 01:29:26,920
important in memories that I suspect

2107
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:28,679
that there's probably a way to use sense

2108
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:31,880
in in condition in combination with a

2109
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:33,079
bunch of other the therapy to help

2110
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:36,039
people overcome

2111
01:29:33,079 --> 01:29:37,359
PTSD um you know they associate this

2112
01:29:36,039 --> 01:29:39,279
smell with this particular traumatic

2113
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:41,599
event well let's start introducing some

2114
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:44,519
other smells to to try to to change the

2115
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:47,079
signal no noise ratio on on on their

2116
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:49,480
disorder even dementia you know if you

2117
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:50,840
look at dementia that that it's i' I've

2118
01:29:49,479 --> 01:29:52,279
had that idea as well I hate to

2119
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,319
interrupt but it's it makes me think

2120
01:29:52,279 --> 01:29:55,880
that too because you what I've noticed

2121
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:57,479
just in some of the research I've been

2122
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,159
look you know just in videos I'm

2123
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:01,238
watching and things that I'm looking at

2124
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:05,000
of these Alzheimer's patients they're

2125
01:30:01,238 --> 01:30:07,238
using music to to reintroduce them to

2126
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,679
different things and I and instantly I

2127
01:30:07,238 --> 01:30:11,158
was like well [ __ ] that'd be great if

2128
01:30:08,679 --> 01:30:12,719
you also had them you know if you would

2129
01:30:11,158 --> 01:30:15,359
speak to them or talk to the family

2130
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:17,118
members that they had and bring you know

2131
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:19,279
maybe they were a gardener and they love

2132
01:30:17,118 --> 01:30:21,000
to grow lavender and now you introduce

2133
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:23,198
lavender with the music and see what

2134
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,479
that stimulates I I think it's um it's

2135
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:27,519
opening up a lot of different doors I

2136
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:29,238
I've got to jump off um I'll just leave

2137
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:32,280
you guys with one last thing when we

2138
01:30:29,238 --> 01:30:34,158
were when we were preparing for Legends

2139
01:30:32,279 --> 01:30:36,319
um Marcus had explained to us that we

2140
01:30:34,158 --> 01:30:39,559
wanted to make sure that we had to have

2141
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:41,118
fruits and stuff at the event so we were

2142
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:43,360
dealing with a company called Sasson

2143
01:30:41,118 --> 01:30:44,839
fruits which uh sent us a box of fruit

2144
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:47,519
to check out just to kind of figure out

2145
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:50,039
what we wanted to get and they sent us

2146
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:52,320
these pineapple guavas which are these

2147
01:30:50,039 --> 01:30:54,880
little green pineapple guavas they're

2148
01:30:52,319 --> 01:30:56,118
tiny little things and there also other

2149
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,600
guavas and there's a bunch of great

2150
01:30:56,118 --> 01:31:01,198
stuff in there they FAS what's that are

2151
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:04,520
they FAS I'm not sure what they are but

2152
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:06,279
the turp and profile on those things if

2153
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:07,679
there's ever a strain of cannabis like

2154
01:31:06,279 --> 01:31:11,639
that it's G to take over the [ __ ]

2155
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:14,239
world it is so crazy and I want to

2156
01:31:11,639 --> 01:31:16,560
analyze this and just see what they are

2157
01:31:14,238 --> 01:31:18,519
because they're when you taste it you're

2158
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,800
getting you know it's touching on some

2159
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:21,520
of the things that we've experienced

2160
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:23,760
that we understand but then there's a

2161
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:26,440
whole other however they're binding

2162
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:28,880
however they're together it's such a

2163
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:31,319
wide range of turpine flavor that's in

2164
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:33,199
it that you can taste so um I've got to

2165
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:35,279
jump off I I'll leave you guys with that

2166
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:37,238
because it was those pineapple guaves

2167
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:39,198
you got to find them you have to try

2168
01:31:37,238 --> 01:31:41,079
them and then let me know what you think

2169
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:42,678
because it was so amazing but we're

01:32:39,079 --> 01:32:43,158
pineapple guav great describe the

2194
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:44,960
character so I'm gonna hit up Reggie and

2195
01:32:43,158 --> 01:32:47,000
I'm gonna be like Reggie we need to

2196
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:49,399
isolate these and then let's let's see

2197
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,639
if we can put these things then it's

2198
01:32:49,399 --> 01:32:53,039
what you they're described as that sort

2199
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:56,319
of that guava and that uh that pineapple

2200
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:57,359
character those are ton of crazy things

2201
01:32:56,319 --> 01:32:59,439
together and what interesting about

2202
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:02,639
pineapple is that if you just change the

2203
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:04,039
O group on it on its location it tastes

2204
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:05,239
like strawberry and that's how they were

2205
01:33:04,039 --> 01:33:07,560
able to breed something called the

2206
01:33:05,238 --> 01:33:09,319
Pineberry which is a strawberry that

2207
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:12,400
tastes like pineapple and it's white

2208
01:33:09,319 --> 01:33:15,039
it's absolutely amazing but yeah so like

2209
01:33:12,399 --> 01:33:16,519
yeah totally growable um and I love fos

2210

they're one of my favorite fruits uh

2211
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:21,119
they're just hard to find so why does it

2212

01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:10,039

thanks guys peace out Addison see you

2239
01:34:16,039 --> 01:34:23,039
later but also going on what um Addison

2240
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:26,440
was saying I would also then add on um

2241
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:29,560
you know uh psilocybin therapy on there

2242
01:34:26,439 --> 01:34:32,960
because of how psilocybin are able to

2243
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:35,159
rebd uh neurons I think that's something

2244
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:37,960
that uh isn't discussed enough as well

2245
01:34:35,158 --> 01:34:40,238
especially for people who are older or

2246
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:42,118
have suffered traumas uh as you were

2247
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:44,439
talking Nick earlier about that that's

2248
01:34:42,118 --> 01:34:46,319
one of the things we found you know I

2249
01:34:44,439 --> 01:34:48,960
work with veterans at a national and

2250
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:51,719
international level and cannabis is an

2251
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:54,118
amazing pallative but when you know you

2252
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:56,439
want to deal when that healer that that

2253
01:34:54,118 --> 01:35:01,118
deeper healing you know psychedelics

2254
01:34:56,439 --> 01:35:03,238
come into play and I I appreciate the um

2255
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:06,039
the new Forefront that they're uh

2256
01:35:03,238 --> 01:35:08,519
experimenting with in uh psilocybin

2257
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:11,800
because I think uh a combination of

2258
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:14,239
cannabis and siloc cybin are going to be

2259
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:16,000
natural beneficials and we're seeing

2260
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:17,959
that already in the veterans community

2261
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,198
from people already self-healing that

2262
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:23,279
way so we're just trying to uh come up

2263
01:35:21,198 --> 01:35:26,238
with uh standard operational procedures

2264
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:29,158
so people can have a safe uh and

2265
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:30,959
efficacious experience as opposed to you

2266
01:35:29,158 --> 01:35:32,439
know they get the experience they want

2267
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,039
as opposed to the experience they're

2268
01:35:32,439 --> 01:35:36,319
given you know what I'm

2269
01:35:34,039 --> 01:35:38,800
saying because those arey set and

2270
01:35:36,319 --> 01:35:41,279
settings are as you know are are key to

2271
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:43,320
any type of acceptance or unacceptance

2272
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:45,118
you know if I go take mushrooms and go

2273
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:47,439
to a you know amusement park I'm going

2274
01:35:45,118 --> 01:35:50,238
to have a different experience than if

2275
01:35:47,439 --> 01:35:53,759
I'm in my home where I have things that

2276
01:35:50,238 --> 01:35:55,799
I can relate to that ground me Etc uh it

2277
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,920
allows for that self-healing to take

2278
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:01,880
place so it's a a a total holistic

2279
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:03,399
understanding that I think is lost on a

2280
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:05,520
lot especially younger people when

2281
01:36:03,399 --> 01:36:08,198
they're out there experimenting they

2282
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:11,360
take these and then go out into the

2283
01:36:08,198 --> 01:36:14,039
world as opposed to trying to go as best

2284
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:16,118
as we can inward to the situation which

2285
01:36:14,039 --> 01:36:19,039
is a whole other level of Education that

2286
01:36:16,118 --> 01:36:21,559
needs to take place but just that that

2287
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:23,039
Co correlation between you know uh a

2288
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:25,520
people with Alzheimer's and those that

2289
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:27,760
are having memory issues and especially

2290
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,000
as you get into that dementia range I

2291
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:32,560
look forward to seeing uh and especially

2292
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,319
if there's some budding uh researchers

2293
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:37,400
out there we look forward to seeing your

2294
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:39,759
studies once you become doctors on what

2295
01:36:37,399 --> 01:36:41,759
actually takes place in these

2296
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:44,639
relationships because we definitely need

2297
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:46,320
to have a better understanding um

2298
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:48,239
because we know anecdotally it's

2299
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:50,319
happening but we need the science like

2300
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:52,439
with cannabis to come around and

2301
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:55,238
actually you know bring bring that to

2302
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:58,399
the case but I love what you're doing

2303
01:36:55,238 --> 01:37:00,279
Nick and keep at it well trying to build

2304
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:02,559
build support for it all because I think

2305
01:37:00,279 --> 01:37:03,359
it's a it's got a lot of potential uh in

2306
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,560
terms of what you're just mentioning

2307
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:09,319
about cybin and I would I would also

2308
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:11,800
Venture ketamine therapy um the uh uh Dr

2309
01:37:09,319 --> 01:37:13,920
senil agarwall has uh is now suing the

2310
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:16,039
DEA to make psilocybin because legal for

2311
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:18,520
Medical Treatments because it's

2312
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:20,000
demonstrated efficacy and they can't you

2313
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:21,520
know you can't regulate you can't

2314
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,319
prevent people access getting access to

2315
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:25,280
something that's going to help them uh

2316
01:37:23,319 --> 01:37:26,559
and the therapy like I have actually

2317
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:30,039
undergone some of this therapy and it's

2318
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:33,080
tremendously impactful um not just for

2319
01:37:30,039 --> 01:37:34,399
for for trauma and and depression and

2320
01:37:33,079 --> 01:37:37,118
stuff like that but also for something

2321
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:41,118
like M migraines cybin is a fantastic

2322
01:37:37,118 --> 01:37:42,759
anti-migraine medication uh and it's uh

2323
01:37:41,118 --> 01:37:45,679
surprising you

2324
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:47,239
know sorry no it is it's it's it's it's

2325
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:49,679
a whole other Frontier but I mean we're

2326
01:37:47,238 --> 01:37:52,158
still having problems with cannabis I

2327
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:54,760
mean still I mean this week uh group I

2328
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:57,158
work with at the UN level I mean we had

2329
01:37:54,760 --> 01:38:00,719
to uh set out uh a letter and we were

2330
01:37:57,158 --> 01:38:03,598
able to get over a hundred uh groups to

2331
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:06,000
call for greater CR transparency at the

2332
01:38:03,599 --> 01:38:08,199
incb with its cannabis initiative

2333
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,840
because they're being behind closed

2334
01:38:08,198 --> 01:38:13,638
doors so uh we put the pressure and got

2335
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:16,119
a response this week from uh the UN

2336
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:19,359
Secretary General where they want to

2337
01:38:16,118 --> 01:38:21,880
hear from us but they will not mediate

2338
01:38:19,359 --> 01:38:24,079
the discussion so uh we have to take a

2339
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:26,800
whole bunch of information we've got

2340
01:38:24,079 --> 01:38:29,238
things coming up this week uh in Vienna

2341
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:32,679
and then uh in mid-march we'll be there

2342
01:38:29,238 --> 01:38:34,919
as well um trying to push back against

2343
01:38:32,679 --> 01:38:37,279
this because we're just celebrating one

2344
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:39,560
year just one year people as of December

2345
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:41,719
2nd the group that I work with changed

2346
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:44,239
international law and got uh cannabis

2347
01:38:41,719 --> 01:38:47,480
pulled out of schedule 4 so that medical

2348
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:50,479
marijuana is legal for the first year

2349
01:38:47,479 --> 01:38:53,079
since 1961 so we're currently working on

2350
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:55,839
getting cannabis pulled for recreational

2351
01:38:53,079 --> 01:38:57,760
and adult use as well but at the same

2352
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:59,960
time we're still treading these Waters

2353
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:02,440
so we've got a long way to go

2354
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:04,319
International wise but treaty wise but

2355
01:39:02,439 --> 01:39:06,158
if we get this research that you're

2356
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:08,840
doing Nick and get it going hopefully by

2357
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:11,039
the time we all hopefully all meet on a

2358
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:12,880
path some time in the future where we'll

2359
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:15,319
find the Utopia we're searching for

2360
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:18,159
education and freedom wise so steps by

2361
01:39:15,319 --> 01:39:20,519
step we're on that path right now you're

2362
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:22,879
on it we're on that yellow brick

2363
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:25,280
road there's a lot of work being done in

2364
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:28,880
Canada with the Canadian psychedelic

2365
01:39:25,279 --> 01:39:31,158
Association and um a lot of the

2366
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:33,719
Psychedelic you know therapy that's

2367
01:39:31,158 --> 01:39:36,238
happened in Canada has crossed over to

2368
01:39:33,719 --> 01:39:38,760
the US and you know that the the term

2369
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:41,079
psychedelic was coined by a Canadian

2370
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:43,280
doctor I forget his name right off the

2371
01:39:41,079 --> 01:39:45,840
top of my head but I think it was in

2372
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:49,198
1955 back in Saskatchewan they were

2373
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:50,760
doing LSD trials and doing you know some

2374
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:53,960
pretty incredible therapies with

2375
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:57,440
addictions you know back back in the 50s

2376
01:39:53,960 --> 01:40:00,039
and it was the you know it was LSD going

2377
01:39:57,439 --> 01:40:01,678
in into the public that you know that

2378
01:40:00,039 --> 01:40:03,560
you always hear about it changing the

2379
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:06,279
Paradigm and stuff and now we feel like

2380
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:09,679
we're coming back towards therapy

2381
01:40:06,279 --> 01:40:12,238
but the issue that we will need to

2382
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:14,719
address is as we open up the therapies

2383
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:16,759
is to not as it gets legalized is to not

2384
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:19,480
have it be over regulated like it is

2385
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:21,920
with cannabis so you know it's it's

2386
01:40:19,479 --> 01:40:23,598
obvious that plant medicine is therapy

2387
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:26,679
that helps us through things cuz we've

2388
01:40:23,599 --> 01:40:29,119
been guided through plant medicine with

2389
01:40:26,679 --> 01:40:31,199
indigenous cultures throughout the world

2390
01:40:29,118 --> 01:40:33,598
and in some cases people continue to go

2391
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:36,879
back to these indigenous tribes and and

2392
01:40:33,599 --> 01:40:39,719
get therapy but but plant medicine

2393
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:41,279
Therapies in general are on the rise and

2394
01:40:39,719 --> 01:40:43,279
when it comes to psychedelics there's

2395
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:46,920
literally thousands of compounds out

2396
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:49,198
there that help you know unlock the mind

2397
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:51,440
and when it comes to cognitive

2398
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:53,279
degradation you know breaking the

2399
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:55,559
finding ways to get to the through

2400
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:59,359
through the blood brain barrier you know

2401
01:40:55,560 --> 01:41:01,360
to be able to uh nourish the brain are

2402
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:04,399
are the the medicines that we need to

2403
01:41:01,359 --> 01:41:07,198
focus on and that's where you know whole

2404
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:10,399
whole soil whole plant food whole

2405
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:14,519
medicine comes in because it's often Al

2406
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:18,638
Hub thank you um uh it's often those

2407
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:20,800
medicines that truly know how to uh

2408
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:23,359
break through the blood brain barrier

2409
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:26,800
and there and you know things like rock

2410
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:30,598
cow and algae together has been proven

2411
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:33,840
to improve cognitive uh degradation and

2412
01:41:30,599 --> 01:41:35,880
also medicinal mushrooms there's so many

2413
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:39,000
good medicinal

2414
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:42,319
mushroom uh studies out there often in

2415
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:44,760
Korean Russian or Chinese or Japanese so

2416
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:47,519
we don't often get those teachings in in

2417
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:49,639
this in this Western culture but but

2418
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,560
it's these new Awakenings that we're

2419
01:41:49,639 --> 01:41:53,719
going through right now that will help

2420
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:56,760
unlock people and we believe believe in

2421
01:41:53,719 --> 01:41:59,279
this you know medical sovereignty and

2422
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:01,599
this medical this choice of of what

2423
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:03,679
medicines that you you deserve to have

2424
01:42:01,599 --> 01:42:07,000
to treat your

2425
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:10,079
PTSD and now PTSD comes in lots of forms

2426
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,118
because we have lockdowns and mandates

2427
01:42:10,079 --> 01:42:13,960
out there that are creating PTSD which

2428
01:42:12,118 --> 01:42:16,519
people could use plant medicine to get

2429
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:19,000
through so you know big love to the

2430
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:21,440
families like like yourself hm which are

2431
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,479
helping international law we really

2432
01:42:21,439 --> 01:42:26,079
applaud you and and really want to here

2433
01:42:23,479 --> 01:42:28,678
to support you and often and also we

2434
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:31,439
just want to help people you know keep

2435
01:42:28,679 --> 01:42:33,880
it sacred as it moves forward because

2436
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:36,678
it's that sanctity that really speaks to

2437
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:39,960
our cellular Evolution and our cellular

2438
01:42:36,679 --> 01:42:43,319
improvements so you know it's a trying

2439
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:45,599
to stay natural but using these other

2440
01:42:43,319 --> 01:42:47,519
methods to enhance it you know I think

2441
01:42:45,599 --> 01:42:50,599
is going to be what brings us towards

2442
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:53,599
longevity so I appreciate the dynamic

2443
01:42:50,599 --> 01:42:55,960
conversation and each person's uh you

2444
01:42:53,599 --> 01:42:58,679
know expertise in the field you know

2445
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:01,319
makes makes it a whole conversation

2446
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:03,118
thank you well I have somewhere kind I

2447
01:43:01,319 --> 01:43:04,920
kind of want to shift the conversation

2448
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:07,439
towards our good friend Wade who's in

2449
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:09,800
the room he's just been hanging out I

2450
01:43:07,439 --> 01:43:11,198
wanted to First say welcome brother I I

2451
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:13,960
know that you're hurting right now with

2452
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:15,439
the ribs and uh it would be nice for

2453
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:18,000
everyone to give Wade a little bit of

2454
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:20,359
love as he's uh you know in at home

2455
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,399
right now sort of uh in bed with some uh

2456
01:43:20,359 --> 01:43:24,839
with some damage to his body so we're

2457
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:26,559
thinking about you brother what happened

2458
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:30,079
I missed

2459
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:32,080
this hi everybody

2460
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:38,439
um right

2461
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:41,599
here um what happened Mark is uh back in

2462
01:43:38,439 --> 01:43:46,479
September um I fractured a rib on my

2463
01:43:41,599 --> 01:43:51,000
right side oh and um I I did it climbing

2464
01:43:46,479 --> 01:43:54,559
out of bed didn't fall down nothing no

2465
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:57,118
reason that's apparent for that to

2466
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,920
happened uh but went to the hospital and

2467
01:43:57,118 --> 01:44:02,279
got x-rays and sure enough fractured a

2468
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:04,960
rib and uh in conversation with my

2469
01:44:02,279 --> 01:44:09,039
doctor we both agreed that seemed very

2470
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:12,800
odd I um and so yeah series of blood

2471
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:15,920
tests reveal that I am

2472
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:20,560
profoundly uh deficient in vitamin

2473
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:25,079
D3 wow and as a farmer who spends hours

2474
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:27,199
each day outside I eat really good food

2475
01:44:25,079 --> 01:44:30,118
I pay attention to the things that I

2476
01:44:27,198 --> 01:44:33,479
expose myself to I use cannabis on a

2477
01:44:30,118 --> 01:44:37,279
regular basis I feel like I'm a person

2478
01:44:33,479 --> 01:44:40,079
who should be enjoying good health but

2479
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:41,519
in fact it's my take on it as I've

2480
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:44,479
talked with my doctor and done a little

2481
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:47,320
research vitamin D3 deficiency does not

2482
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:50,198
happen suddenly this has been going on

2483
01:44:47,319 --> 01:44:53,759
for years for me it's probably why I

2484
01:44:50,198 --> 01:44:56,799
hurt my back back in 2018

2485
01:44:53,760 --> 01:45:00,599
and at the moment yeah I am I'm getting

2486
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:02,800
on two weeks pretty much in bed because

2487
01:45:00,599 --> 01:45:05,400
not only do I have the one fractured rib

2488
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:07,079
but there's a chiropractor who's been to

2489
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:08,759
see me is of the opinion I've got a

2490
01:45:07,079 --> 01:45:12,519
couple of fractured ribs on the other

2491
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:15,079
side of my rib cuge and in addition a

2492
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:17,639
couple of ribs that are

2493
01:45:15,079 --> 01:45:22,359
dislocated just having a grand old time

2494
01:45:17,639 --> 01:45:24,760
here but now that I know what's going on

2495
01:45:22,359 --> 01:45:27,759
the fact that I'm so deficient actually

2496
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:30,480
I'm deficient enough in vitamin D3 that

2497
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:33,920
if I were a child I would be diagnosed

2498
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:35,439
with rickets which is a really horrible

2499
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:38,760
disease

2500
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:41,519
um so you know much thanks and

2501
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:44,199
appreciation for Monica my partner who

2502
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:46,800
is working her fanny off to keep up with

2503
01:45:44,198 --> 01:45:48,638
my needs as well as the farm and

2504
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,159
everything else that's going on

2505
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:54,400
here

2506
01:45:50,158 --> 01:45:57,839
um emotionally and M

2507
01:45:54,399 --> 01:45:59,479
I feel inspired and deeply grateful

2508
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:01,960
again I feel like there's been a lot of

2509
01:45:59,479 --> 01:46:04,718
things going on in my life over the last

2510
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:06,679
five or six years that I had trouble

2511
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:07,599
understanding why I was experiencing

2512
01:46:06,679 --> 01:46:10,560
those

2513
01:46:07,599 --> 01:46:13,599
things but uh now that I know that I'm

2514
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:15,960
deficient in vitamin D3 I'm taking

2515
01:46:13,599 --> 01:46:18,560
extremely large doses of it large enough

2516
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:21,719
that they are prescription

2517
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:24,520
only and uh I've got a good doctor who's

2518
01:46:21,719 --> 01:46:25,800
helping me with dealing with the issues

2519
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:29,159
that are going

2520
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:30,719
on and uh I look forward to many more

2521
01:46:29,158 --> 01:46:33,679
years of being an

2522
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:37,118
obnoxious and pressing sort of guy

2523
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:40,199
because I feel my health coming back uh

2524
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:44,359
and I know that when my mind and my

2525
01:46:40,198 --> 01:46:46,359
heart are inspired my body will catch up

2526
01:46:44,359 --> 01:46:48,479
so at the moment yeah I've got my camera

2527
01:46:46,359 --> 01:46:50,679
turned off because you don't want to see

2528
01:46:48,479 --> 01:46:53,559
what I look like laying here in bed

2529
01:46:50,679 --> 01:46:55,279
going on two weeks I did get a shower

2530
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:58,599
this morning for the first

2531
01:46:55,279 --> 01:47:01,000
time um so yeah things are getting

2532
01:46:58,599 --> 01:47:03,520
better but quite honestly for the last

2533
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:06,639
couple of weeks I have not been able to

2534
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:12,040
sit stand or walk without a great deal

2535
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:14,880
of pain and so I'm mostly resting in bed

2536
01:47:12,039 --> 01:47:18,760
and eating well

2537
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:21,239
and taking care of myself healing and uh

2538
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:23,400
feeling deeply grateful for such a

2539
01:47:21,238 --> 01:47:25,799
lovely and amazing woman as a

2540
01:47:23,399 --> 01:47:28,759
partner and that's kind of all I got at

2541
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:32,039
the moment I'm I very much am enjoying

2542
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:34,199
the the conversation about tpin and

2543
01:47:32,039 --> 01:47:37,840
learning more deeply the chemistry of

2544
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:41,279
the plant but much like uh

2545
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:45,400
Kelly uh I I got to keep pointing back

2546
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:49,198
to this plant knows what it's

2547
01:47:45,399 --> 01:47:53,799
doing and I

2548
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:55,238
feel cautious about trying to cut up up

2549
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:58,599
all the different compounds that are

2550
01:47:55,238 --> 01:48:01,158
going on in this plant and then think we

2551
01:47:58,599 --> 01:48:04,239
can put them back together

2552
01:48:01,158 --> 01:48:06,519
again in a way that s provides

2553
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:08,319
potentially the same benefit that the

2554
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:11,920
plant does all by

2555
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:14,679
itself I uh think it's important to

2556
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:17,679
learn what we can about this plant

2557
01:48:14,679 --> 01:48:24,279
because there's no question it's uh it's

2558
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:27,399
a huge gift to uh our planet and

2559
01:48:24,279 --> 01:48:29,279
um yeah that's kind of all I got I'm I'm

2560
01:48:27,399 --> 01:48:31,519
hanging in I'm loving the conversation I

2561
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:34,319
appreciate Marcus you putting on the

2562

uh being inspired and hopefully once in

2567
01:48:48,158 --> 01:48:53,079

01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:20,599

01:49:23,319 --> 01:49:27,679
well

2583
01:49:26,039 --> 01:49:30,039
um

2584
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:33,158
yeah

2585
01:49:30,039 --> 01:49:35,519
um four months ago couple of months ago

2586
01:49:33,158 --> 01:49:37,359
I thought hell I don't see any way out

2587
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:39,520
of this I I don't understand what's

2588
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:43,439
happening to me feels like my body's

2589
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:44,719
falling apart and now it's like yeah it

2590
01:49:43,439 --> 01:49:48,198
was falling

2591
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:49,760
apart but now it's coming back and uh

2592
01:49:48,198 --> 01:49:51,638
are there other symptoms or other

2593
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:53,800
indicators that would lead you to

2594
01:49:51,639 --> 01:49:55,480
believe that you have a vitamin D

2595
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:57,880
deficiency before you actually start

2596
01:49:55,479 --> 01:49:57,879
breaking

2597
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:02,119
[Music]

2598
01:50:00,039 --> 01:50:04,960
bones

2599
01:50:02,118 --> 01:50:09,000
um other

2600
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:11,639
than like feeling like my teeth have

2601
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:14,760
gotten soft over the last 10

2602
01:50:11,639 --> 01:50:18,319
years and

2603
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:22,840
um uh and I was always somewhat puzzled

2604
01:50:18,319 --> 01:50:26,639
at how I hurt my back back in 2018 mark

2605
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:29,400
I was doing what seemed to be pretty

2606
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:30,880
straightforward work that I've done with

2607
01:50:29,399 --> 01:50:35,439
no problem for

2608
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:37,880
years and yet that year it turned into a

2609
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:40,879
nightmare that resulted in having to

2610
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:43,960
have surgery and spending some time in

2611
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:45,520
the hospital and and I came out of that

2612
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:48,719
feeling pretty

2613
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:51,960
good um and

2614
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:55,840
yeah no is the short answer to question

2615
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:58,560
mark what really brought it home was a

2616
01:50:55,840 --> 01:51:02,520
uh a blood serum

2617
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:06,520
analysis uh that revealed that uh my

2618
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:09,719
blood level content of Vitamin

2619
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:13,679
D3 was eight

2620
01:51:09,719 --> 01:51:17,078
nanograms per milliliter of serum and

2621
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:19,199
normal is somewhere between 40 and

2622
01:51:17,078 --> 01:51:23,039
100 so

2623
01:51:19,198 --> 01:51:25,559
um and yeah like I said I I don't know

2624
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:29,000
why I've gotten so deficient that's the

2625
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:30,880
next step it the next step is to get my

2626
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:34,719
bones strong again and build up the

2627
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:37,440
vitamin and D level in my bloodstream

2628
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:41,279
but I also the the next step after that

2629
01:51:37,439 --> 01:51:44,238
is to understand why did I become so

2630
01:51:41,279 --> 01:51:46,800
dramatically deficient in a vitamin that

2631
01:51:44,238 --> 01:51:49,198
my body should be making with my

2632
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:52,000
exposure to the sun and the diet that I

2633
01:51:49,198 --> 01:51:54,960
pursue I eat lots of vegetables that we

2634
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:59,520
grow right on the farm I eat fruit from

2635
01:51:54,960 --> 01:52:03,198
the farm I uh I you know not to call it

2636
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:06,239
out but I eat meat uh we buy high

2637
01:52:03,198 --> 01:52:09,519
quality organic meats and uh we don't

2638
01:52:06,238 --> 01:52:11,238
eat it that often but I I just feel like

2639
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:14,079
yeah I was doing everything I knew how

2640
01:52:11,238 --> 01:52:16,879
to do and yet somehow ended up

2641
01:52:14,078 --> 01:52:18,519
profoundly deficient in vitamin D so I

2642
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:21,480
guess one of the things I would say to

2643
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:23,639
everybody that's listening is trust your

2644
01:52:21,479 --> 01:52:25,919
doctors you know learn what they can

2645
01:52:23,639 --> 01:52:28,719
offer to you in the way of information

2646
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:30,399
that is available about your body and

2647
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:33,520
then pay attention to what's happening

2648
01:52:30,399 --> 01:52:37,879
to your body I'm getting to be 70 years

2649
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:41,920
old and uh and yeah I feel like I got

2650
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:46,239
years of troublemaking left and uh look

2651
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:48,399
forward to having my body back and uh

2652
01:52:46,238 --> 01:52:50,839
ready to rock and

2653
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:52,839
roll well we appreciate you Wade for

2654
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:54,440
sure and and it really does speak to

2655
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:56,000
kind of like the whole conversation that

2656
01:52:54,439 --> 01:52:58,559
we've been talking about today and

2657
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:00,319
trying to create this know this shared

2658
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:03,000
lexicon and going down this sensory

2659
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:05,719
rapit whole like it's to do things like

2660
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:07,238
the blood serum test that you got done

2661
01:53:05,719 --> 01:53:10,279
that's what it's for it's to learn

2662
01:53:07,238 --> 01:53:12,000
things that we can't learn and know from

2663
01:53:10,279 --> 01:53:14,118
like things that have been passed down

2664
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,599
necessarily from our grandmothers or

2665
01:53:14,118 --> 01:53:18,519
whatnot like there are certain things

2666
01:53:16,599 --> 01:53:20,560
that we can't just assume and then and

2667
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:23,199
then we go to science and we get that

2668
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:25,199
blood serum test and we get told

2669
01:53:23,198 --> 01:53:27,279
you know you you have this deficiency so

2670
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:28,919
it's it's really kind of a a full circle

2671
01:53:27,279 --> 01:53:31,519
to the story I really hope you're

2672
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:35,399
feeling better uh Wade and I want to

2673
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:38,480
welcome Dr Allison how the heck are

2674
01:53:35,399 --> 01:53:40,920
you hi I actually have a Post-It here

2675
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:44,839
from a client um that I have been

2676
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:46,078
waiting to see Wade for a long time um

2677
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:47,960
and Wade can you give me a

2678
01:53:46,078 --> 01:53:51,799
recommendation for an indicia leaning

2679
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:51,800
CBD please

2680
01:53:55,760 --> 01:54:02,119
uh

2681
01:53:57,439 --> 01:54:05,678
Harlequin was an indicia leaning

2682
01:54:02,118 --> 01:54:09,880
um mix of indica and

2683
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:14,840
sativa um a high CBD version of it you

2684
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:16,880
could go to Harley Sue or ACDC or

2685
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:18,639
there's there's dozens and dozens and

2686
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:22,239
dozens of different cultivars that are

2687
01:54:18,639 --> 01:54:24,520
out there right now actually I bet etan

2688
01:54:22,238 --> 01:54:26,799
uh would be a better person to answer

2689
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:29,599
that question because he's seeing what's

2690
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:30,960
available in the California Marketplace

2691
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:33,920
in through the

2692
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:36,439
dispensaries I know what's you know

2693
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:38,000
Heritage Market if you will what was

2694
01:54:36,439 --> 01:54:40,839
happening a few years

2695
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:44,359
ago uh but yeah I bet atan would have a

2696
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:47,440
good suggestion on that thank you good

2697
01:54:44,359 --> 01:54:49,960
to see you atan wait I would agree with

2698
01:54:47,439 --> 01:54:53,559
you the problem is unfortunately is we

2699
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:55,880
are not seeing CBD cult of ours showing

2700
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:58,880
up at the dispensaries nowadays we're

2701
01:54:55,880 --> 01:55:02,359
seeing all the bastard stepchildren but

2702
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:05,039
we're not seeing any uh CBD dominance

2703
01:55:02,359 --> 01:55:09,158
lately and uh I'm not sure if it's from

2704
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:12,479
The Grow Supply or manufacturing but uh

2705
01:55:09,158 --> 01:55:15,920
we are deficient here uh in California

2706
01:55:12,479 --> 01:55:17,479
so um Growers manufacturers uh please we

2707
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:20,840
need to do

2708
01:55:17,479 --> 01:55:23,000
better is are we allowed to ship stuff

2709
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:25,800
to California

2710
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:29,198
no uh it's still illegal because it's

2711
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:30,560
still Federal uh mail so it has to be in

2712
01:55:29,198 --> 01:55:32,719
California by

2713
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:35,039
California uh to Californians

2714
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:37,000
unfortunately until of course as we know

2715
01:55:35,039 --> 01:55:40,039
the interstate commerce discussion is

2716
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:42,319
gaining more traction now more than ever

2717
01:55:40,039 --> 01:55:44,519
um and there are uh letters that are

2718
01:55:42,319 --> 01:55:47,158
being put forth to you know push more

2719
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:48,760
for that because uh I want to be able to

2720
01:55:47,158 --> 01:55:51,198
benefit from other people as well as I

2721
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:53,119
want to be able to send people you know

2722
01:55:51,198 --> 01:55:55,078
genetics and things like that because

2723
01:55:53,118 --> 01:55:57,639
there will be a time here in the future

2724
01:55:55,078 --> 01:56:00,279
when you can say yes I want to order a

2725
01:55:57,639 --> 01:56:02,960

2726
01:56:00,279 --> 01:56:05,920
genetics bam okay I want to be able to

2727
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:08,880
do so here and unfortunately we're not

2728
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:11,078
there yet and you know right now

2729
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:14,440
currently we've got two competitions

2730
01:56:11,078 --> 01:56:18,158

2733
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:24,800

uh there is CBD flower is part of the uh

2738
01:56:33,599 --> 01:56:39,199
both of those competitions so I'm very

2739
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:41,078
much looking forward here I know uh we

2740
01:56:39,198 --> 01:56:44,799
won't see the competition from Emerald

2741
01:56:41,078 --> 01:56:46,279
cup until uh next year as judges uh

2742
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:48,239
because now it's waiting until the

2743
01:56:46,279 --> 01:56:50,039
Harvest comes in and then going forward

2744
01:56:48,238 --> 01:56:51,839
that's one of the unfortunate yet

2745
01:56:50,039 --> 01:56:54,560
fortunate things that happened due to

2746
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:57,199
covid is they prolonged the competition

2747
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:59,239
last year so we able to get all the

2748
01:56:57,198 --> 01:57:01,078
samples in the spring so that we could

2749
01:56:59,238 --> 01:57:02,919
actually get a true representation of

2750
01:57:01,078 --> 01:57:05,719
the Harvest that happened here in

2751
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:09,000
California however I'm hoping that we'll

2752
01:57:05,719 --> 01:57:12,198
be able to see some uh harlequins and

2753
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:15,560
others place here at the state fair so

2754
01:57:12,198 --> 01:57:19,279
that we can make everybody aware but

2755
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:21,800
also see the need for production and

2756
01:57:19,279 --> 01:57:24,639
getting this genetic out there to uh the

2757
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:27,320
market because currently it's it's only

2758
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:30,199
for uh legal manufacturers in the state

2759
01:57:27,319 --> 01:57:32,078
of California however in the future it's

2760
01:57:30,198 --> 01:57:33,839
going to be open to Backyard Growers

2761
01:57:32,078 --> 01:57:36,519
because here in California any adult

2762
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:38,199
over the age of 21 can grow six plants

2763
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:40,920
but we we have to kind of wait for the

2764
01:57:38,198 --> 01:57:42,759
county situation to come on board so

2765
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:44,880
we're kind of leapfrogging initially

2766
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:46,719
with the state to hopefully get the

2767
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:49,239
counties to come on board so that we can

2768
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:51,560
have a true uh competition like you

2769
01:57:49,238 --> 01:57:53,839
would in any natural state where it

2770
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:55,719
rises from the county level then to the

2771
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:57,719
state level you see what I'm saying and

2772
01:57:55,719 --> 01:58:01,520
then at that point wouldn't you love to

2773
01:57:57,719 --> 01:58:03,760
be able to then export or import any of

2774
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:05,400
these winners losers Etc you know what

2775
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:07,000
I'm saying because then as these

2776
01:58:05,399 --> 01:58:09,319
competitions come on board in your

2777
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:12,639
States and in your regions I want to be

2778
01:58:09,319 --> 01:58:14,439
able to taste and Sample or grow that

2779
01:58:12,639 --> 01:58:16,440
genetic of those particular winners to

2780
01:58:14,439 --> 01:58:19,839
see what I can actually do the best out

2781
01:58:16,439 --> 01:58:22,719
of so I hope that these competitions as

2782
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:27,078
they become larger will also

2783
01:58:22,719 --> 01:58:30,679
make people more understanding as a

2784
01:58:27,078 --> 01:58:33,719
whole on these CBD varietals and how

2785
01:58:30,679 --> 01:58:35,359
beneficial they are because I daily I'm

2786
01:58:33,719 --> 01:58:38,359
getting patients who are asking and

2787
01:58:35,359 --> 01:58:42,039
looking for it and of course I recommend

2788
01:58:38,359 --> 01:58:44,679
a saturation of you know THC and CBD

2789
01:58:42,039 --> 01:58:46,479
together to help them get an

2790
01:58:44,679 --> 01:58:47,920
understanding for their own

2791
01:58:46,479 --> 01:58:50,839
understanding of what their own

2792
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:53,599
symbiosis of you know what their own

2793
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:56,000
natural feeling should be or be like so

2794
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:58,800
sorry long-winded no that's okay so I've

2795
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:01,359
been doing a lot more cannabis assisted

2796
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:04,679
Psychotherapy and so that's why I was

2797
01:59:01,359 --> 01:59:06,839
asking for a CBD leaning indicia because

2798
01:59:04,679 --> 01:59:09,880
a lot of these people have like high

2799
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:12,400
amounts of anxiety but their the anxiety

2800
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:15,078
is also for THC like they're terrified

2801
01:59:12,399 --> 01:59:17,238
to like you know touch THC but they you

2802
01:59:15,078 --> 01:59:20,920
know they hear out can this is amazing

2803
01:59:17,238 --> 01:59:24,479
and so um I've been looking for one so

2804
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:26,279
that um we can start out with a CBD and

2805
01:59:24,479 --> 01:59:27,319
then slightly move them into a little

2806
01:59:26,279 --> 01:59:29,800
bit of

2807
01:59:27,319 --> 01:59:31,719
THC uh but having something that's a

2808
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:33,960
little more on the relaxing side will

2809
01:59:31,719 --> 01:59:36,078
allow for them to like open their heart

2810
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:38,840
and have some vulnerability in the

2811
01:59:36,078 --> 01:59:40,840
session that's why we recommend starting

2812
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:42,520
off with the te's like for older women

2813
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:45,599
like when my mother wanted to start

2814
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:47,000
trying cannabis um she doesn't smoke so

2815
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:49,679
one of the things that we found is we

2816
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:52,760
found certain te's and tea companies

2817
01:59:49,679 --> 01:59:55,840
make varieties like a 20 to1 CBD to one

2818
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:59,320
THC oh well that was a perfect way to

2819
01:59:55,840 --> 02:00:03,039
introduce her into trying it because she

2820
01:59:59,319 --> 02:00:05,078
got very little THC but it felt very

2821
02:00:03,039 --> 02:00:07,800
relaxed and one of the things that we

2822
02:00:05,078 --> 02:00:11,039
have found is especially CBD helps

2823
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:14,360
balance things out I myself take a 2:1

2824
02:00:11,039 --> 02:00:16,719
um 2 THC to1 CBD I know some people

2825
02:00:14,359 --> 02:00:20,439
prefer one: one some people can handle

2826
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:23,599
the 18 to1 Etc so it's finding what your

2827
02:00:20,439 --> 02:00:25,238
body has and like but when we start

2828
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:28,960
getting

2829
02:00:25,238 --> 02:00:31,959
Z right you know so what works for you

2830
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:33,800
and what ratio is key however I have a

2831
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:36,359
friend of mine who uh likes to hang

2832
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:38,960
around Stoners Like Rob Clark etc etc

2833
02:00:36,359 --> 02:00:42,359
and he says when he goes to hang out

2834
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:45,480
with them he'll take 60 milligrams of

2835
02:00:42,359 --> 02:00:48,078
just CBD so that when he's hanging with

2836
02:00:45,479 --> 02:00:51,158
these experts he can smoke all night and

2837
02:00:48,078 --> 02:00:53,519
not get absolutely blitzed because he

2838
02:00:51,158 --> 02:00:57,238
can hang with and not feel so anxious

2839
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:59,280
and paranoid because of the uh amount of

2840
02:00:57,238 --> 02:01:01,399
CBD he puts in his system it's

2841
02:00:59,279 --> 02:01:04,559
counteracting and balancing out that

2842
02:01:01,399 --> 02:01:06,439
effect so he's not actually getting uh

2843
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:10,199
that effect and then finding then later

2844
02:01:06,439 --> 02:01:12,799
just then small spikes of tarpine Rich

2845
02:01:10,198 --> 02:01:15,279
cannabis then brings on the desired

2846
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:17,440
effect so again it's about finding your

2847
02:01:15,279 --> 02:01:19,158
natural biome but I think it is very

2848
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:23,078
crucial with

2849
02:01:19,158 --> 02:01:26,078
CBD uh varietal especially initially

2850
02:01:23,078 --> 02:01:28,279
because of the anxiety and especially in

2851
02:01:26,078 --> 02:01:30,519
a therapeutic environment when people

2852
02:01:28,279 --> 02:01:31,880
are first experimenting with Canabis I

2853
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:34,440
myself have known when I've given

2854
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:37,639
somebody too much it's easily to make

2855
02:01:34,439 --> 02:01:40,439
them go from absolutely happy and Giddy

2856
02:01:37,639 --> 02:01:43,118
and and relax to absolutely paranoid to

2857
02:01:40,439 --> 02:01:45,919
a level of uncomfortableness that makes

2858
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:48,118
other everyone around them uncomfortable

2859
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:50,679
and so those are the things that we try

2860
02:01:48,118 --> 02:01:52,598
to avoid and why with my experimentation

2861
02:01:50,679 --> 02:01:56,520
working with patients over the decades

2862
02:01:52,599 --> 02:01:59,599
have found a blend of THC CBD in both

2863
02:01:56,520 --> 02:02:03,280
low Vari you know low spikes are very

2864
02:01:59,599 --> 02:02:04,920
helpful to introduce them comfortably

2865
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:06,279
into it it doesn't mean that they're not

2866
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:09,719
going to have any type of negative

2867
02:02:06,279 --> 02:02:12,759
reaction but it's as least as we can

2868
02:02:09,719 --> 02:02:14,439
make the climb in as possible make the

2869
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:16,440
bed as warm as we can when we get into

2870
02:02:14,439 --> 02:02:18,359
it on a cold night right I wonder if

2871
02:02:16,439 --> 02:02:20,479
people were really paranoid before the

2872
02:02:18,359 --> 02:02:23,039
DEA started locking people up and giving

2873
02:02:20,479 --> 02:02:26,799
them 20 30 years at time you know like

2874
02:02:23,039 --> 02:02:29,439
infusing paranoia into cannabis the way

2875
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:32,039
the meat industry infuses the tortured

2876
02:02:29,439 --> 02:02:33,879
flesh and adrenaline soaked flesh you

2877
02:02:32,039 --> 02:02:35,359
know out to the people it's like what

2878
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:38,920
are you trying to do you're attacking

2879
02:02:35,359 --> 02:02:41,719
the very thing that is good for PTSD and

2880
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:45,679
relaxation and you're infusing it with

2881
02:02:41,719 --> 02:02:49,719
paranoia you know what [ __ ] you law

2882
02:02:45,679 --> 02:02:52,359
enforcement 18 does um does California

2883
02:02:49,719 --> 02:02:53,078
Assembly bill you know after

2884
02:02:52,359 --> 02:02:57,039
the

2885
02:02:53,078 --> 02:02:59,719
FDA uh denied the Charlotte webs

2886
02:02:57,039 --> 02:03:04,479
petition or I'm sorry Char uh whatever

2887
02:02:59,719 --> 02:03:06,920
the Charlotte company um denied uh the

2888
02:03:04,479 --> 02:03:09,399
uh listing of it as a dietary supplement

2889
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:16,679
and then California Assembly bill which

2890
02:03:09,399 --> 02:03:19,719
was passed in October now makes um CBD

2891
02:03:16,679 --> 02:03:22,158
available as a dietary supplement in

2892
02:03:19,719 --> 02:03:24,760
California so do you think production

2893
02:03:22,158 --> 02:03:26,759
will catch up with that so you know your

2894
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:29,119
original premise which was you know I

2895
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:31,320
need to see this stuff in my dispensary

2896
02:03:29,118 --> 02:03:35,439
you think that that'll change production

2897
02:03:31,319 --> 02:03:39,319
to put CBD leaning cultivars on the

2898
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:42,158
radar for producers in California I I I

2899
02:03:39,319 --> 02:03:43,519
hope I don't know that to be the case

2900
02:03:42,158 --> 02:03:46,158
you know what I'm saying in the sense

2901
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:48,520
that you know um the legislation is

2902
02:03:46,158 --> 02:03:50,799
still not uh finished in the sense that

2903
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:53,880
I cannot still have CBD products in

2904
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:57,039
there however I can now have uh you know

2905
02:03:53,880 --> 02:04:00,239
sativa derived CBD varietals in the

2906
02:03:57,039 --> 02:04:03,118
future in my dispensary so I am already

2907
02:04:00,238 --> 02:04:06,718
starting to get hit by CBD Distributors

2908
02:04:03,118 --> 02:04:08,799
manufacturers from the outside world

2909
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:12,279
that are the non-cannabis starting to

2910
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:14,880
dangle their foot into our reality I am

2911
02:04:12,279 --> 02:04:18,000
very hopeful that we are going to see

2912
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:22,800
more people start to experiment and play

2913
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:25,760
with these uh varieties and uh start to

2914
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:28,719
break out all every type of ratio so

2915
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:30,760
that every type of ratio is available

2916
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:33,198
okay because unfortunately right now the

2917
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:36,559
only way to do so is to isolate it set

2918
02:04:33,198 --> 02:04:39,759
it aside Etc as opposed to have every

2919
02:04:36,559 --> 02:04:41,880
specific THC to CBD ratio available

2920
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:44,840
that's not available I would love to see

2921
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:47,279
that available so that people can then

2922
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:49,400
document and isolate what works for them

2923
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:51,479
individually because I'm still getting

2924
02:04:49,399 --> 02:04:53,439
people all the time especially people I

2925
02:04:51,479 --> 02:04:54,638
went to high school with and grade

2926
02:04:53,439 --> 02:04:58,039
school with they're like hey you're a

2927
02:04:54,639 --> 02:05:02,159
cannabis expert tell me which uh CBD

2928
02:04:58,039 --> 02:05:04,359
company out there is right for me times

2929
02:05:02,158 --> 02:05:06,158
right how many times a day that I'm like

2930
02:05:04,359 --> 02:05:07,799
I got no [ __ ] clue and I'm not gonna

2931
02:05:06,158 --> 02:05:09,839
lie to you I'm not gonna [ __ ] you

2932
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:12,320
and tell you something I don't know if I

2933
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:14,039
can see science that backs it up Etc the

2934
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:15,799
only way I've seen that is the route

2935
02:05:14,039 --> 02:05:18,118
that we have created here in California

2936
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:20,440
so I see it through the Distributors and

2937
02:05:18,118 --> 02:05:22,920
manufacturers at the Cannabis level we

2938
02:05:20,439 --> 02:05:25,919
do not see that at the professional

2939
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:29,399
outside manufacturer level yet I

2940
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:32,399
anticipate it will in time and hopefully

2941
02:05:29,399 --> 02:05:34,839
yes I hope that more of that access will

2942
02:05:32,399 --> 02:05:38,479
cause that however I still think there's

2943
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:41,520
a problem with the CBD uh manufacturers

2944
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:43,879
currently in play just as CBD from the

2945
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:46,480
hemp because they're not investing in

2946
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:49,800
the hemp infrastructure so there's a lot

2947
02:05:46,479 --> 02:05:52,279
of problems I I love the CBD however I

2948
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:54,119
hate that they're being so easy on

2949
02:05:52,279 --> 02:05:56,759
themselves by just cutting the flowers

2950
02:05:54,118 --> 02:05:59,839
by not putting in real infrastructure

2951
02:05:56,760 --> 02:06:02,599
for manufacturing the for the uh

2952
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:04,960
decortication for actually making hemp

2953
02:06:02,599 --> 02:06:08,078
into viable products much less you know

2954
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:09,800
food stuffs Etc we still don't have just

2955
02:06:08,078 --> 02:06:13,198
that basic understanding and we're still

2956
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:16,279
so far behind so I do hope that some of

2957
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:18,000
these CBD people will step into the THC

2958
02:06:16,279 --> 02:06:21,000
realm and some of these THC people will

2959
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:24,039
step into the CBD realm so that we can

2960
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:25,840
get that biodiversity that's needed for

2961
02:06:24,039 --> 02:06:28,599
the patients themselves currently

2962
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:30,239
because it is sorely missing and so once

2963
02:06:28,599 --> 02:06:33,599
that's there I would like to see that

2964
02:06:30,238 --> 02:06:36,238
next step because then Allison has all

2965
02:06:33,599 --> 02:06:38,199
these different ratios to stri to try

2966
02:06:36,238 --> 02:06:41,118
from starting from one end and working

2967
02:06:38,198 --> 02:06:43,158
her way back or working your way up

2968
02:06:41,118 --> 02:06:46,359
however or whichever way in the Spectrum

2969
02:06:43,158 --> 02:06:51,719
you find yourself or where your body is

2970
02:06:46,359 --> 02:06:53,880
is acclimated to or is used to so

2971
02:06:51,719 --> 02:06:55,559
good I see that Wade has his hand up an

2972
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:57,880
interesting aspect I do just want to

2973
02:06:55,559 --> 02:07:00,760
throw out with regard to using cannabis

2974
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:04,000
as a as a therapy tool we kind of want

2975
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:05,639
to push them to that line of anxiety

2976
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:08,319
because when you push them to that line

2977
02:07:05,639 --> 02:07:10,239
of anxiety during a therapy session then

2978
02:07:08,319 --> 02:07:14,078
you can explore what it is that's

2979
02:07:10,238 --> 02:07:16,158
causing that anxiety and so there I I I

2980
02:07:14,078 --> 02:07:18,679
love what you're saying eten about being

2981
02:07:16,158 --> 02:07:21,799
able to go from like 20 to1 to like 10

2982
02:07:18,679 --> 02:07:24,920
to one to 5 to one and slowly move them

2983
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:28,599
in that direction towards that increase

2984
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:31,559
of anxiety that really helps to um it's

2985
02:07:28,599 --> 02:07:35,119
what we work from as a therapist so but

2986
02:07:31,559 --> 02:07:35,119
I saw Wade had his hand up so I'll

2987
02:07:35,238 --> 02:07:40,319
retract uh no I think you make an

2988
02:07:37,279 --> 02:07:43,719
excellent point Allison uh myself I'm

2989
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:47,399
not a big fan of pushing people on their

2990
02:07:43,719 --> 02:07:51,639
dose um and I what drove me to raise my

2991
02:07:47,399 --> 02:07:54,198
hand was etan's observation about I

2992
02:07:51,639 --> 02:07:59,000
think it was a grandmother having a cup

2993
02:07:54,198 --> 02:08:02,799
of tea as a way of getting into cannabis

2994
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:06,238
without the dealing with the fear and I

2995
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:09,199
think we talk a lot about the chemistry

2996
02:08:06,238 --> 02:08:12,598
of the cannabis plant and the various

2997
02:08:09,198 --> 02:08:15,238
ways that chemistry might affect uh

2998
02:08:12,599 --> 02:08:17,319
people but we don't talk very much about

2999
02:08:15,238 --> 02:08:19,598
the different ways of getting that

3000
02:08:17,319 --> 02:08:22,599
chemistry into your

3001
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:25,960
body the different ways of preparing

3002
02:08:22,599 --> 02:08:27,719
that chemistry into a product that can

3003
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:33,198
be taken into the

3004
02:08:27,719 --> 02:08:36,760
body or dose or frequency of use or any

3005
02:08:33,198 --> 02:08:39,678
of those other things all of which play

3006
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:43,520
in my experience at least a huge part in

3007
02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:47,359
what you can benefit from by using

3008
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:49,960
cannabis smoking or inhalation is one

3009
02:08:47,359 --> 02:08:53,439
way to gain benefit from the use of

3010
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:56,359
cannabis but is one way it is not the

3011
02:08:53,439 --> 02:08:59,839
only way it's the way we talk about a

3012
02:08:56,359 --> 02:09:03,078
lot it's the way our culture sees

3013
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:06,520
cannabis being consumed in the media and

3014
02:09:03,078 --> 02:09:08,799
whatnot but I got to be honest other

3015
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:13,199
than my own personal

3016
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:16,079
use and maybe one in 50 patients I've

3017
02:09:13,198 --> 02:09:19,399
worked with over the years most people

3018
02:09:16,078 --> 02:09:21,920
I've worked with don't want to smoke

3019
02:09:19,399 --> 02:09:24,558
either because their kids or their

3020
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:26,920
Elders or they people who are scared of

3021
02:09:24,559 --> 02:09:31,320
cannabis and I have found again and

3022
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:35,158
again by looking at the needs of that

3023
02:09:31,319 --> 02:09:38,880
person and the chemistry of the plants

3024
02:09:35,158 --> 02:09:42,279
in oils that I might have on hand I can

3025
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:45,520
usually find some way of preparing those

3026
02:09:42,279 --> 02:09:49,158
oils that the person will not

3027
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:52,520
only benefit from it but want to use it

3028
02:09:49,158 --> 02:09:55,319
again and then part of the education

3029
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:58,119
that I try and do on dosing is help them

3030
02:09:55,319 --> 02:10:01,039
to understand how to find the dose that

3031
02:09:58,118 --> 02:10:04,359
works for them that they would be

3032
02:10:01,039 --> 02:10:06,800
willing to repeat that dose to start

3033
02:10:04,359 --> 02:10:09,920
building the vitality and health of

3034
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:12,039
their endoc conoid system and a lot of

3035
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:12,960
the things that we talk about everything

3036
02:10:12,039 --> 02:10:16,158
from

3037
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:20,078
PTSD to neuralgia

3038
02:10:16,158 --> 02:10:22,558
to uh seizures to cancer all of these

3039
02:10:20,078 --> 02:10:26,158
various conditions and many

3040
02:10:22,559 --> 02:10:27,880
more respond to

3041
02:10:26,158 --> 02:10:30,839
cannabis

3042
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:33,279
because the indoc canono system is

3043
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:36,360
involved in those

3044
02:10:33,279 --> 02:10:39,000
conditions and it really is about for me

3045
02:10:36,359 --> 02:10:42,319
not unlike tending the soil of your

3046
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:45,639
garden slowly but surely you build the

3047
02:10:42,319 --> 02:10:48,238
Vitality the diversity of your garden

3048
02:10:45,639 --> 02:10:51,319
soil you'll see better and better

3049
02:10:48,238 --> 02:10:53,000
results and here I am laying in my bed

3050
02:10:51,319 --> 02:10:55,960
talking about diversity and building

3051
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:59,279
your health and all that but it does

3052
02:10:55,960 --> 02:11:01,679
work um yeah you know what that's that's

3053
02:10:59,279 --> 02:11:03,359
still you like you said like Nick said

3054
02:11:01,679 --> 02:11:05,800
earlier you know what are you gonna give

3055
02:11:03,359 --> 02:11:07,039
up no you got to keep going so you know

3056
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:08,239
it's it's always going to be about

3057
02:11:07,039 --> 02:11:09,639
health and wellbeing even if you're

3058
02:11:08,238 --> 02:11:11,000
currently you know still you know

3059
02:11:09,639 --> 02:11:13,319
working towards that because I think

3060
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:16,238
we're all working towards health and

3061
02:11:13,319 --> 02:11:18,319
well-being so yeah no I I I definitely

3062
02:11:16,238 --> 02:11:20,519
hear you Wade and and your message and

3063
02:11:18,319 --> 02:11:24,078
it's also wonderful to see you Alison

3064
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:25,559
and everyone who's joined Brian um

3065
02:11:24,078 --> 02:11:28,519
haven't heard from Kylie yet but big

3066
02:11:25,559 --> 02:11:30,039
love to you and um so um Kelly wants to

3067
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:31,480
say something here in a sec but just I

3068
02:11:30,039 --> 02:11:34,880
just wanted to say really quickly I

3069
02:11:31,479 --> 02:11:38,078
think it's important that we connect the

3070
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:40,800
medicine Growers and makers to the

3071
02:11:38,078 --> 02:11:42,639
customer and the consumer or or what I

3072
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:44,840
like a better word than customer and

3073
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:48,000
consumer but to you know to the

3074
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:50,520
Compassionate Care family because often

3075
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:53,198
in these legalized paradigms we have

3076
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:56,400
detached medicine makers from the

3077
02:11:53,198 --> 02:11:59,399
patients so now patients have to go to

3078
02:11:56,399 --> 02:12:01,679
an alternative doctor or which is great

3079
02:11:59,399 --> 02:12:04,078
you know or a secondary source or a bud

3080
02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:06,880
tender to try and find out you know what

3081
02:12:04,078 --> 02:12:08,639
the medicine maker is embodying so what

3082
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:10,719
we've seen like this last weekend is a

3083
02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:12,880
beautiful thing a farmers market in

3084
02:12:10,719 --> 02:12:16,078
Northern California and the Sebastapol

3085
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:18,159
area give thanks you know dem pure

3086
02:12:16,078 --> 02:12:21,880
Farmers a lot of them were there and

3087
02:12:18,158 --> 02:12:24,000
they were able to share their home made

3088
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:26,639
products they're natural farmed

3089
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:29,639
regenerative farmed regenerative

3090
02:12:26,639 --> 02:12:32,440
medicine Ecco packaged from the farmer

3091
02:12:29,639 --> 02:12:35,920
to the consumer medicine now when that

3092
02:12:32,439 --> 02:12:38,919
when that person comes up to the table

3093
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:41,359
and they make a a not only a chemical

3094
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:42,920
interaction through their conversation

3095
02:12:41,359 --> 02:12:45,158
you know they're automatically now

3096
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:47,520
they're letting down and exudating

3097
02:12:45,158 --> 02:12:49,558
chemicals based off their conversation

3098
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:51,679
it allows and and in in that way it

3099
02:12:49,559 --> 02:12:53,960
opens up a pathway to the medicine

3100
02:12:51,679 --> 02:12:56,199
because now that person has an open

3101
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:58,599
Pathway to the medicine that they got

3102
02:12:56,198 --> 02:12:59,960
from the medicine maker and so you know

3103
02:12:58,599 --> 02:13:01,599
they're going to be excited when they

3104
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:04,039
get home to take that medicine because

3105
02:13:01,599 --> 02:13:06,760
they talk to the person who who created

3106
02:13:04,039 --> 02:13:08,719
it rather than the secondary Bud tender

3107
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:11,559
which I have all the love in the world

3108
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:14,359
for and I think anyone helping is great

3109
02:13:11,559 --> 02:13:16,800
but we should empower the re you know

3110
02:13:14,359 --> 02:13:19,319
the the farm gate Sales Systems and

3111
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:21,199
these these Farmers Market systems to

3112
02:13:19,319 --> 02:13:26,359
happen in other places in the world so

3113
02:13:21,198 --> 02:13:28,198
it's not only coming through you know

3114
02:13:26,359 --> 02:13:30,960
therapy sessions and Kelly had one more

3115
02:13:28,198 --> 02:13:33,960
thing to say did you oh oh I just um

3116
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:35,719
Wade I wanted to touch on to you I we

3117
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:37,960
were having actually a bit of a chicken

3118
02:13:35,719 --> 02:13:39,880
attack up there so it's time the Goss

3119
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:43,559
Hawks like to come around so I had to

3120
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:45,199
run upstairs and I was listening to um

3121
02:13:43,559 --> 02:13:47,880
what you were just saying Wade first of

3122
02:13:45,198 --> 02:13:49,759
all so much love to you and I really

3123
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:52,880
wanted to say that there's a real

3124
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:58,440
overlooked thing right now in the world

3125
02:13:52,880 --> 02:14:00,719
as far as Vitamin D B12 and um and iron

3126
02:13:58,439 --> 02:14:04,960
uptake and that's called

3127
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:08,118
MTHFR so please have your doctor check

3128
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:09,599
for MTHFR which is a methylene Tetra

3129
02:14:08,118 --> 02:14:12,759
hydrolate

3130
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:15,719
reductase which means that the it's

3131
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:18,880
limiting your enzymatic uptake within

3132
02:14:15,719 --> 02:14:21,480
your body and this is something that uh

3133
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:24,239
Allan beer had brought up he wrote a

3134
02:14:21,479 --> 02:14:27,678
book um I believe in the 40s calling is

3135
02:14:24,238 --> 02:14:31,039
your body Baby Friendly because so many

3136
02:14:27,679 --> 02:14:34,239
people were losing children um to this

3137
02:14:31,039 --> 02:14:37,439
inability to uptake amino acids through

3138
02:14:34,238 --> 02:14:41,598
this reductase this absolutely is

3139
02:14:37,439 --> 02:14:44,399
totally defined in vitamin D as well so

3140
02:14:41,599 --> 02:14:47,920
please have your doctor check for that

3141
02:14:44,399 --> 02:14:49,679
those MTHFR mutations and I just really

3142
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:51,679
wanted to say that and pass on my love

3143
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:54,880
to you it's something that a lot of

3144
02:14:51,679 --> 02:14:58,199
people continue to see low iron low

3145
02:14:54,880 --> 02:15:00,199
vitamin b d low vitamin B12 and they

3146
02:14:58,198 --> 02:15:03,359
don't know where it's coming from this

3147
02:15:00,198 --> 02:15:06,238
is something that is incredibly common

3148
02:15:03,359 --> 02:15:09,759
with European descent uh people because

3149
02:15:06,238 --> 02:15:12,959
basically the people who uh survived

3150
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:17,199
were the people who came from clotters

3151
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:19,399
so heav on the battlefield or like if if

3152
02:15:17,198 --> 02:15:22,359
a lot of us that are white European

3153
02:15:19,399 --> 02:15:25,238
Descendants the reason we're still alive

3154
02:15:22,359 --> 02:15:27,319
is because we were came and survived

3155
02:15:25,238 --> 02:15:30,118
from people that claw it so people that

3156
02:15:27,319 --> 02:15:32,759
bled out weren't able to go have you

3157
02:15:30,118 --> 02:15:36,238
know more Generations this is incredibly

3158
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:39,199
prevalent this man Alan beer had said he

3159
02:15:36,238 --> 02:15:41,718
was seen as a heretic they took away his

3160
02:15:39,198 --> 02:15:44,118
license he said that it was maybe one in

3161
02:15:41,719 --> 02:15:46,198
every four people and now we're actually

3162
02:15:44,118 --> 02:15:49,198
recognizing it could be three in every

3163
02:15:46,198 --> 02:15:51,479
four people with the possibility of six

3164
02:15:49,198 --> 02:15:54,719
different mutations this

3165
02:15:51,479 --> 02:15:58,479
absolutely is totally intrical to our

3166
02:15:54,719 --> 02:16:00,520
endoc canabo system the uptake of of of

3167
02:15:58,479 --> 02:16:02,678
cannabinoids where people are having a

3168
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:05,119
lot of toxic issues with different types

3169
02:16:02,679 --> 02:16:08,399
of cannaboids as well as toxic issues

3170
02:16:05,118 --> 02:16:10,238
with food this is a real root of it and

3171
02:16:08,399 --> 02:16:14,198
I know I'm going off on this but it's

3172
02:16:10,238 --> 02:16:15,198
really important so love you it's

3173
02:16:14,198 --> 02:16:17,279
hilarious that you mentioned that

3174
02:16:15,198 --> 02:16:21,039
because I have four out of the six

3175
02:16:17,279 --> 02:16:23,960
mutations for the M MTHFR uh and I have

3176
02:16:21,039 --> 02:16:27,760
have uh so I supplement with fenic acid

3177
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:29,599
and methylfolate um and after years of

3178
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:33,318
trying a bunch of different ssis and

3179
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:36,239
other anti-depressants and therapy uh

3180
02:16:33,318 --> 02:16:38,638
simple two two B vitamins U have made

3181
02:16:36,239 --> 02:16:41,239
all the difference um it's it's hugely

3182
02:16:38,638 --> 02:16:43,478
important and uh yeah the vitamin D

3183
02:16:41,239 --> 02:16:45,359
deficiencies are

3184
02:16:43,478 --> 02:16:48,159
um yeah

3185
02:16:45,359 --> 02:16:49,599
they're they're more I I don't think all

3186
02:16:48,159 --> 02:16:51,079
all the mutations identified yet but

3187
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:53,719
they're they are definitely a thing and

3188
02:16:51,079 --> 02:16:55,879
it's a uh there I sent I sent a couple

3189
02:16:53,718 --> 02:16:59,558
articles up or at least references

3190
02:16:55,879 --> 02:17:02,920
earlier um but yeah it's a again it's

3191
02:16:59,558 --> 02:17:04,558
complex and the more data we have the

3192
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:06,879
the better sort of we're able to sort of

3193
02:17:04,558 --> 02:17:09,718
identify and and

3194
02:17:06,879 --> 02:17:12,718
treat yep and I just wanted to say in

3195
02:17:09,718 --> 02:17:15,079
conjunction with that vitamin D and the

3196
02:17:12,718 --> 02:17:17,318
inability to uptake the vitamin D

3197
02:17:15,079 --> 02:17:20,599
through this methylation issue which

3198
02:17:17,318 --> 02:17:23,519
also leaves toxicities within our body

3199
02:17:20,599 --> 02:17:26,159
for longer so people who have more

3200
02:17:23,519 --> 02:17:28,359
mutations will hold on to toxins in

3201
02:17:26,159 --> 02:17:31,879
their body much longer so people who

3202
02:17:28,359 --> 02:17:34,840
don't have any MTHFR mutations maybe can

3203
02:17:31,879 --> 02:17:36,478
get over a hangover within 24 hours

3204
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:38,760
people with many different mutations

3205
02:17:36,478 --> 02:17:41,638
maybe it could take them two weeks to

3206
02:17:38,760 --> 02:17:45,639
two months to six months to actually get

3207
02:17:41,638 --> 02:17:48,000
over that you know that alcohol abuse

3208
02:17:45,638 --> 02:17:51,478
that they had had but I wanted to say a

3209
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:54,920
side door to the vitamin D is silica

3210
02:17:51,478 --> 02:17:57,599
so it's also one that is is very not

3211
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:59,599
utilized um it whenever we test our

3212
02:17:57,599 --> 02:18:02,478
blood when we test soil when we test

3213
02:17:59,599 --> 02:18:06,880
plants when we test our food silica is

3214
02:18:02,478 --> 02:18:11,039
low so silica can help um propagate the

3215
02:18:06,879 --> 02:18:13,000
uptake of vitamin D as well and also so

3216
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:15,840
like when I drink this I put in

3217
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:18,599
C90 into this which is you know

3218
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:21,398
dehydrated ocean water it's 84 trace

3219
02:18:18,599 --> 02:18:22,960
minerals plus six Rare Earth

3220
02:18:21,398 --> 02:18:25,718
uh elements that are coming up from

3221
02:18:22,959 --> 02:18:29,039
Ocean Vents and then there's 50,000

3222
02:18:25,718 --> 02:18:31,438
organisms that come alive now I take it

3223
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:34,040
down from boiling and then I put a

3224
02:18:31,439 --> 02:18:37,239
little bit of chlorella or a little bit

3225
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:40,240
of of of Spirulina in there along with

3226
02:18:37,239 --> 02:18:42,679
the rock cacal and the Lion's man and a

3227
02:18:40,239 --> 02:18:45,039
little bit of MAA

3228
02:18:42,679 --> 02:18:46,920
and can you hear me oh okay here you're

3229
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:50,080
hearing that anyway the the point is

3230
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:51,239
that um you know it really is it can

3231
02:18:50,079 --> 02:18:53,799
become an amazing

3232
02:18:51,239 --> 02:18:55,879
you know food as medicine and break the

3233
02:18:53,799 --> 02:18:58,199
blood brain barrier and add trace

3234
02:18:55,879 --> 02:19:01,759
minerals to your diet along with the

3235
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:04,359
algae and the the new neut Tropic

3236
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:06,599
Medicine of lion's man you know is

3237
02:19:04,359 --> 02:19:09,880
something to look towards is new Tropic

3238
02:19:06,599 --> 02:19:11,840
medicine cellular regenerative medicine

3239
02:19:09,879 --> 02:19:14,079
and the moral of the story is here is

3240
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:17,200
that we are producing foods that are

3241
02:19:14,079 --> 02:19:19,120
devoid of full spectrum minerals so

3242
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:22,679
therefore we are starting to produce

3243
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:24,479
humans that are unable to fully uptake

3244
02:19:22,679 --> 02:19:26,840
all the minerals because minerals are

3245
02:19:24,478 --> 02:19:29,000
not there and available so that's why

3246
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:32,398
it's really important for us to continue

3247
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:36,679
with mineral uptake and and breed food

3248
02:19:32,398 --> 02:19:39,398
for higher amino acids breed food and

3249
02:19:36,679 --> 02:19:41,840
medicine for higher flavonoids and more

3250
02:19:39,398 --> 02:19:45,199
color content because those are the the

3251
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:47,880
secondary spectrums that that that

3252
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:52,600
enhance you know what what the what the

3253
02:19:47,879 --> 02:19:52,599
main constituents have to offer

3254
02:19:54,879 --> 02:19:59,039
thank you for sharing I wanted to shift

3255
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:01,239
the conversation a little bit back to

3256
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:04,080
bring Kylie into the conversation and to

3257
02:20:01,239 --> 02:20:06,478
welcome uh Brian from denail who just

3258
02:20:04,079 --> 02:20:08,520
rolled in I thought the one thing we

3259
02:20:06,478 --> 02:20:11,279
didn't hit too too much on today is kind

3260
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:12,800
of like you know where we're you know we

3261
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:15,359
talked about trying to create this kind

3262
02:20:12,799 --> 02:20:16,879
of think tank group and shared lexicon

3263
02:20:15,359 --> 02:20:20,200
and just kind of go down this rabbit

3264
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:21,438
hole and you know having you know kind

3265
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:24,560
of the

3266
02:20:21,439 --> 02:20:28,000
having the technology or device that

3267
02:20:24,559 --> 02:20:30,279
allows for the most you know unique

3268
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:32,760
preservation of the profile before it

3269
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:34,840
actually gets to your your mouth and

3270
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:36,280
into your lungs because that's really

3271
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:38,079
you know you can test anything that you

3272
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:40,479
want you can test the flour you can test

3273
02:20:38,079 --> 02:20:44,079
the hash you can test the oil but until

3274
02:20:40,478 --> 02:20:47,438
you heat it up and and volatize it into

3275
02:20:44,079 --> 02:20:49,000
your throat that's really the compounds

3276
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:51,680
that you're getting not the ones that

3277
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:53,840
you may have tested prior at room

3278
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:55,800
temperature uh like Nick had mentioned

3279
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:57,920
earlier so I just thought it would be

3280
02:20:55,799 --> 02:20:59,719
cool to introduce you Brian and get

3281
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:01,318
Kylie back in the conversation and kind

3282
02:20:59,719 --> 02:21:03,159
of talk a little bit about because

3283
02:21:01,318 --> 02:21:05,799
you've been doing crazy things dude also

3284
02:21:03,159 --> 02:21:07,680
like just the the artistic nature of

3285
02:21:05,799 --> 02:21:10,559
what you've been doing you can tell by

3286
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:12,720
how beautiful and symmetrical it is that

3287
02:21:10,559 --> 02:21:15,559
it's somehow better and maybe you can

3288
02:21:12,719 --> 02:21:17,639
speak a little bit of that Brian yeah uh

3289
02:21:15,559 --> 02:21:20,760
real quick is my microphone

3290
02:21:17,639 --> 02:21:22,920
working I hear you Brian how you doing

3291
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:25,920
do all right uh I can't hear myself and

3292
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:29,680
I've had equipment issues in the past uh

3293
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:32,079
uh on that subject uh we had a a really

3294
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:33,559
interesting Revelation recently where

3295
02:21:32,079 --> 02:21:36,000
previously we've been considering our

3296
02:21:33,559 --> 02:21:38,639
work in terms of flavor uh and having

3297
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:40,000
been originally based in New York we

3298
02:21:38,639 --> 02:21:42,079
couldn't talk about any of the other

3299
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,559
pharmacology without risking a huge

3300
02:21:42,079 --> 02:21:46,000
legal consideration uh but some of the

3301
02:21:44,559 --> 02:21:48,239
newer nails that run a little bit more

3302
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:49,920
efficiently people keep asking why am I

3303
02:21:48,239 --> 02:21:51,639
getting a different High how am I

3304
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:54,318
getting higher how am I still up and

3305
02:21:51,639 --> 02:21:55,920
alert and we had this Epiphany that uh

3306
02:21:54,318 --> 02:21:57,920
as we've been pursuing flavor

3307
02:21:55,920 --> 02:22:01,280
preservation we've been changing the

3308
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:02,680
pharmacology too uh its flavor is

3309
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:05,200
chemical preservation through face

3310
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:07,520
change you want to be able to take your

3311
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:08,960
substance convert it to a gas get it

3312
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:10,520
through your system as quickly as

3313
02:22:08,959 --> 02:22:13,159
possible without

3314
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:15,200
degradation and we're we're using a

3315
02:22:13,159 --> 02:22:17,439
non-homogeneous substance with things

3316
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:20,240
that vaporize across a huge spectrum of

3317
02:22:17,439 --> 02:22:24,040
temperatures which often gives a you

3318
02:22:20,239 --> 02:22:26,280
have to can you have to degrade to THC

3319
02:22:24,040 --> 02:22:28,840
to Delta 9 from thca in order to get the

3320
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:31,319
pharmacology and be a lot of the other

3321
02:22:28,840 --> 02:22:33,239
elements are getting time to destroy

3322
02:22:31,318 --> 02:22:35,239
themselves in the process so as we hit

3323
02:22:33,239 --> 02:22:36,920
New Heights and efficiency uh we we

3324
02:22:35,239 --> 02:22:39,840
haven't done Chemical Testing on it just

3325
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:41,559
anecdotal we're pretty sure that what

3326
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:43,880
we're seeing is a lower Mitigation Of

3327
02:22:41,559 --> 02:22:45,239
CBN from the higher efficiency nails and

3328
02:22:43,879 --> 02:22:47,398
higher efficiency

3329
02:22:45,239 --> 02:22:49,079
systems uh lending itself to a

3330
02:22:47,398 --> 02:22:51,799
completely different high so like Marcus

3331
02:22:49,079 --> 02:22:54,120
said we're final Del every device how

3332
02:22:51,799 --> 02:22:57,519
efficient that is you throw a dab in an

3333
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:59,200
800 degree Banger and you do not have

3334
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:00,640
and you might want that effect you might

3335
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:02,960
want something that's burned some of the

3336
02:23:00,639 --> 02:23:04,959
turbin and has a high CBN content is

3337
02:23:02,959 --> 02:23:07,358
going to help put you to sleep but for

3338
02:23:04,959 --> 02:23:09,639
the the subtlety the the fine points the

3339
02:23:07,359 --> 02:23:11,439
the harder to reach stuff really doing

3340
02:23:09,639 --> 02:23:13,599
Justice to everything The Growers the

3341
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:15,760
Breeders the processors have worked so

3342
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:18,318
hard to get into the jar you need an

3343
02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:21,559
ultra efficient system uh and having

3344
02:23:18,318 --> 02:23:23,079
spent time originally in nail design and

3345
02:23:21,559 --> 02:23:25,278
then in cannabis distillation and

3346
02:23:23,079 --> 02:23:26,879
distillation Theory coming back to nail

3347
02:23:25,279 --> 02:23:30,600
design with Advanced distillation Theory

3348
02:23:26,879 --> 02:23:34,599
under my belt I man the the the effects

3349
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:36,200
are actually stunning we're we're we're

3350
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:38,640
not a research facility we're we're

3351
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:39,960
development facility uh so in order to

3352
02:23:38,639 --> 02:23:41,719
actually sit down and do that we'd need

3353
02:23:39,959 --> 02:23:43,358
to do a bunch of controlled situations

3354
02:23:41,719 --> 02:23:46,199
put the same oil in run it through a

3355
02:23:43,359 --> 02:23:47,760
bunch of situation a bunch of systems at

3356
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:49,960
different temperatures different systems

3357
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:52,439
different materials present but I

3358
02:23:49,959 --> 02:23:54,358
guarantee you'll find different results

3359
02:23:52,439 --> 02:23:57,318
in the vapor coming off of them and that

3360
02:23:54,359 --> 02:23:59,720
can lead to an intelligent guide for how

3361
02:23:57,318 --> 02:24:02,159
to use your tools to get what you're

3362
02:23:59,719 --> 02:24:04,358
looking for from your oil and and it's

3363
02:24:02,159 --> 02:24:06,119
really the last it's the last stage in

3364
02:24:04,359 --> 02:24:08,479
it it's it's what happens right before

3365
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:10,399
it goes to your face I couldn't talk

3366
02:24:08,478 --> 02:24:12,478
about the farming I couldn't talk about

3367
02:24:10,398 --> 02:24:15,559
the biology of it but the the physics of

3368
02:24:12,478 --> 02:24:17,959
it that actually preserve it motion or

3369
02:24:15,559 --> 02:24:19,079
in some cases intentionally control uh

3370
02:24:17,959 --> 02:24:20,879
control the

3371
02:24:19,079 --> 02:24:22,920
degradation uh

3372
02:24:20,879 --> 02:24:24,398
it's it's not it's not really studied

3373
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:26,000
and it's something I've spent my life's

3374
02:24:24,398 --> 02:24:28,239
work on and I only kind of realized in

3375
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:30,639
the last year that we're changing how

3376
02:24:28,239 --> 02:24:34,478
high you get or what kind of high you

3377
02:24:30,639 --> 02:24:35,920
get um there's there's a lot to do there

3378
02:24:34,478 --> 02:24:38,519
could go into the specifics of how it

3379
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:40,680
all works but that's that's the the the

3380
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:43,120
the broad overview of of where I am in

3381
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:45,079
my work we're looking at controlled

3382
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:47,840
conditions that that actually do in your

3383
02:24:45,079 --> 02:24:50,559
Hardware give you some options on on how

3384
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:52,079
you're outputting your chemicals

3385
02:24:50,559 --> 02:24:53,439
what's your favorite temperature to

3386
02:24:52,079 --> 02:24:55,799
smoke

3387
02:24:53,439 --> 02:24:59,720
at there okay first there's no one

3388
02:24:55,799 --> 02:24:59,719
answer to that second it's

3389
02:25:00,520 --> 02:25:05,520
uh depending on your system um say we're

3390
02:25:03,639 --> 02:25:09,599
using a a a temperature controlled

3391
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:11,319
heater on uh on a sapphire electric nail

3392
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:13,920
uh if we're going just for flavor we're

3393
02:25:11,318 --> 02:25:15,478
going in just at about 420 degrees on

3394
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:18,359
the heater setting which is giving us

3395
02:25:15,478 --> 02:25:20,879
about 400 Dees on the nail just enough

3396
02:25:18,359 --> 02:25:23,559
to vaporize everything and have really

3397
02:25:20,879 --> 02:25:25,278
really good flavor uh that's G to it's

3398
02:25:23,559 --> 02:25:27,159
not going to give you any sort of large

3399
02:25:25,279 --> 02:25:29,239
volume of dab and sometimes you can be

3400
02:25:27,159 --> 02:25:30,879
distilling off some of the volatiles we

3401
02:25:29,239 --> 02:25:32,478
like Sapphire because for reasons

3402
02:25:30,879 --> 02:25:34,000
unknown to me it doesn't like to just

3403
02:25:32,478 --> 02:25:37,278
distill off the volatiles it likes to

3404
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:40,120
peel it off in layers and vaporize it uh

3405
02:25:37,279 --> 02:25:42,840
on on a slurper we'll go in at 575 on

3406
02:25:40,120 --> 02:25:45,720
the stem uh which is way too hot to go

3407
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:48,279
in on a banger but physics of face

3408
02:25:45,719 --> 02:25:50,000
change uh if you're quickly and

3409
02:25:48,279 --> 02:25:51,880
efficiently evaporating off of something

3410
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:53,200
that's higher than your boiling point

3411
02:25:51,879 --> 02:25:55,559
you'll be able to change phase and

3412
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:57,319
Escape at your boiling point uh since

3413
02:25:55,559 --> 02:25:59,559
it's a torch system we we don't have a

3414
02:25:57,318 --> 02:26:01,159
good electric slurper worked out uh

3415
02:25:59,559 --> 02:26:02,719
you're you're effectively able to bypass

3416
02:26:01,159 --> 02:26:04,799
what your working temperatures would be

3417
02:26:02,719 --> 02:26:07,719
would be and get a longer dab window out

3418
02:26:04,799 --> 02:26:10,159
of it uh the kind of oil the turpine

3419
02:26:07,719 --> 02:26:12,318
content present uh what you're actually

3420
02:26:10,159 --> 02:26:14,639
trying to achieve there there's always a

3421
02:26:12,318 --> 02:26:17,879
trade-off between flavor and

3422
02:26:14,639 --> 02:26:21,199
vapor and kind of the high end right now

3423
02:26:17,879 --> 02:26:23,759
is 575 on on the centrifugal vertical

3424
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:26,960
lifts uh torch systems the low end being

3425
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:27,960
about 420 on a sapphire uh temperature

3426
02:26:26,959 --> 02:26:31,759
controlled

3427
02:26:27,959 --> 02:26:33,478
heater past that we find that uh our new

3428
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:35,840
carb cap is so efficient we have to pull

3429
02:26:33,478 --> 02:26:37,920
our temperatures down and use about half

3430
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:41,120
the breath pressure to get the same

3431
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:43,318
exact effect on one of the systems so

3432
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:44,920
your your your your Hardware your tools

3433
02:26:43,318 --> 02:26:47,159
your

3434
02:26:44,920 --> 02:26:48,639
oil pure diamonds you want to run in

3435
02:26:47,159 --> 02:26:49,959
hotter because you don't have turpins to

3436
02:26:48,639 --> 02:26:51,358
worry about you need to break you need

3437
02:26:49,959 --> 02:26:53,199
to be able to break them down quickly

3438
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:55,159
something that's super duper Saucy you

3439
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:57,960
need to come down

3440
02:26:55,159 --> 02:26:59,559
it's a billion different kinds of oil

3441
02:26:57,959 --> 02:27:01,119
and a 100 different 100 thousand

3442
02:26:59,559 --> 02:27:03,600
different kinds of desired effects

3443
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:05,560
people uh there there's that that's a

3444
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:09,200
range there's no there's no one

3445
02:27:05,559 --> 02:27:11,079
answer from my experience sufficiency is

3446
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:13,000
related to vaporizing each of the

3447
02:27:11,079 --> 02:27:14,799
individual components and your

3448
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:17,318
concentrate at the lowest possible

3449
02:27:14,799 --> 02:27:19,879
temperatures we're talking cold

3450
02:27:17,318 --> 02:27:23,478
starts when you subject certain like

3451
02:27:19,879 --> 02:27:25,039
light volatiles to high temperatures

3452
02:27:23,478 --> 02:27:27,159
there's a huge temperature difference

3453
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:29,720
there and a more likelihood of it

3454
02:27:27,159 --> 02:27:31,439
converting into something that could be

3455
02:27:29,719 --> 02:27:34,398
pot

3456
02:27:31,439 --> 02:27:36,559
toxic what you're doing is keep that

3457
02:27:34,398 --> 02:27:38,519
degradation from happening it's gonna

3458
02:27:36,559 --> 02:27:41,119
degrade there's no question about it

3459
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:45,159
it's degrade but can you control the

3460
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:47,479
degradation yes a low ramp or do you

3461
02:27:45,159 --> 02:27:50,639
want to just drop it on something that's

3462
02:27:47,478 --> 02:27:53,079
you know 400 degrees and take the chance

3463
02:27:50,639 --> 02:27:56,000
that you're GNA possibly be breaking it

3464
02:27:53,079 --> 02:28:00,478
apart more you guys are probably

3465
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:03,680
intimately familiar with that Dr Robert

3466
02:28:00,478 --> 02:28:06,000
stran at Oregon

3467
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:08,200
State so I mean this is the guy that

3468
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:11,120
basically said oh be careful when you

3469
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:14,640
dab because you're gonna degrade things

3470
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:17,240
into AC croline and Benzene and all that

3471
02:28:14,639 --> 02:28:21,119
was that the 710 miren

3472
02:28:17,239 --> 02:28:22,879
study yeah that was great science sorry

3473
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:24,720
well it was interesting Brian because

3474
02:28:22,879 --> 02:28:27,719
when I when I first saw that I'm like

3475
02:28:24,719 --> 02:28:30,920
wow I I I need to re I need to reproduce

3476
02:28:27,719 --> 02:28:33,478
this because this is really important to

3477
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:36,279
either say this is [ __ ] or that this

3478
02:28:33,478 --> 02:28:38,760
is really happening and then when you

3479
02:28:36,279 --> 02:28:42,159
pull his procedure he had one of those

3480
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:45,439
stupid smoking machines it's

3481
02:28:42,159 --> 02:28:47,639
like where the [ __ ] do you get that

3482
02:28:45,439 --> 02:28:50,920
right yeah he wasn't using the right

3483
02:28:47,639 --> 02:28:53,358
test equipment can uh can I he getting a

3484
02:28:50,920 --> 02:28:56,840
lot of press and I think he's getting a

3485
02:28:53,359 --> 02:29:00,720
lot of people concerned and worried

3486
02:28:56,840 --> 02:29:04,000
about about consuming concentrates this

3487
02:29:00,719 --> 02:29:05,559
way um yeah I mean I I don't exactly

3488
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:08,079
know where to go with that but I think

3489
02:29:05,559 --> 02:29:10,719
that there can be some some work I know

3490
02:29:08,079 --> 02:29:13,318
that uh Marcus Rogan I don't know if you

3491
02:29:10,719 --> 02:29:16,199
guys know that guy up in Canada I think

3492
02:29:13,318 --> 02:29:19,039
he kind of came up with some other type

3493
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:20,880
of device that can measure some of the

3494
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:23,319
compounds and looking at different

3495
02:29:20,879 --> 02:29:25,639
conditions to try to understand what

3496
02:29:23,318 --> 02:29:27,359
those degradation profiles are and what

3497
02:29:25,639 --> 02:29:29,039
they're not but I don't think that

3498
02:29:27,359 --> 02:29:34,520
there's a good study out there that

3499
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:34,520
basically can quantify this I agree with

3500
02:29:35,799 --> 02:29:39,759
you oh sorry I don't know whose turn it

3501
02:29:38,318 --> 02:29:41,478
was um can I say one thing about

3502
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:45,398
degradation then I'm off the floor for a

3503
02:29:41,478 --> 02:29:46,799
sec please okay um one of the things it

3504
02:29:45,398 --> 02:29:48,478
took it took a minute to realize because

3505
02:29:46,799 --> 02:29:50,358
it's not obvious unless you're actually

3506
02:29:48,478 --> 02:29:52,639
in it that um getting the thing things

3507
02:29:50,359 --> 02:29:55,920
through phase change and out it's about

3508
02:29:52,639 --> 02:29:57,680
Escape conditions and boiling point and

3509
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:59,840
your R and your running temperatures are

3510
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:04,279
the most important parts but if you've

3511
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:06,439
got a 385 degree Banger and it's got a 2

3512
02:30:04,279 --> 02:30:08,960
milliliter deep pool of stuff turpins

3513
02:30:06,439 --> 02:30:11,120
that are trying to boil at you know 50

3514
02:30:08,959 --> 02:30:12,679
80 Celsius they're going to be stuck in

3515
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:15,760
the tar they're going to get time and

3516
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:17,239
contact to to to destroy themselves

3517
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:19,478
everything's spinning around into a thin

3518
02:30:17,239 --> 02:30:22,039
film and a centrifuge The Vapor can

3519
02:30:19,478 --> 02:30:24,318
escape there's no time uh everything's

3520
02:30:22,040 --> 02:30:27,359
always changing phase at its boiling

3521
02:30:24,318 --> 02:30:30,920
point you throw water at 250 degrees or

3522
02:30:27,359 --> 02:30:33,359
a million degrees it's 212 in normal

3523
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:34,799
pressure the instant it's created every

3524
02:30:33,359 --> 02:30:37,318
moment it gets in contact with that

3525
02:30:34,799 --> 02:30:38,318
higher heat Source it can overheat so

3526
02:30:37,318 --> 02:30:40,840
one of the things that we're really

3527
02:30:38,318 --> 02:30:44,199
doing it's it's fluid dynamics it's

3528
02:30:40,840 --> 02:30:46,040
hacks of getting the vapor to escape as

3529
02:30:44,200 --> 02:30:47,399
it's created so when I'm talking about

3530
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:49,160
running hotter on these more efficient

3531
02:30:47,398 --> 02:30:50,599
Nails we're going from room temperature

3532
02:30:49,159 --> 02:30:53,520
outside the nail

3533
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:55,559
being processed in through up and around

3534
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:57,319
in less than a second in a lot of

3535
02:30:55,559 --> 02:30:59,478
instances and there's there's just no

3536
02:30:57,318 --> 02:31:01,799
time for it to overheat even though it's

3537
02:30:59,478 --> 02:31:03,278
briefly touching a higher heat Source

3538
02:31:01,799 --> 02:31:05,119
Brian do you do you mind putting a

3539
02:31:03,279 --> 02:31:07,239
couple videos up like sharing your

3540
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:08,720
screen and showing some of the videos

3541
02:31:07,239 --> 02:31:10,719
that because earlier you said like when

3542
02:31:08,719 --> 02:31:12,278
you came out of the distillation world

3543
02:31:10,719 --> 02:31:14,239
you were like oh I'm going to apply some

3544
02:31:12,279 --> 02:31:16,640
of that uh short path molecular

3545
02:31:14,239 --> 02:31:19,920
distillation or falling film or Rising

3546
02:31:16,639 --> 02:31:21,959
film evaporator aspect and and kind of

3547
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:23,439
create bangers it would be great if we

3548
02:31:21,959 --> 02:31:25,000
and if you tell me your Instagram

3549
02:31:23,439 --> 02:31:27,279
account I just couldn't find it I could

3550
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:30,000
find your personal one I've known you

3551
02:31:27,279 --> 02:31:31,600
for like a decade I know you got too

3552
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:34,719
many dude no we we had to we had to

3553
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:37,559
reboot all our media it's dmail USA uh

3554
02:31:34,719 --> 02:31:39,679
just DNA I

3555
02:31:37,559 --> 02:31:41,239
USA it's weird that that just didn't

3556
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:44,239
come up in my search I think we're

3557
02:31:41,239 --> 02:31:45,959
Shadow band definitely are Shadow band

3558
02:31:44,239 --> 02:31:48,079
okay I can do it I've got some up here

3559
02:31:45,959 --> 02:31:50,278
you can keep talking or whoever's

3560
02:31:48,079 --> 02:31:51,639
talking I'll show a few of these one of

3561
02:31:50,279 --> 02:31:53,239
the conditions that I've as Brian and

3562
02:31:51,639 --> 02:31:55,680
Kylie one of the conditions that I've

3563
02:31:53,239 --> 02:31:58,119
been looking at is obviously there's you

3564
02:31:55,680 --> 02:32:01,200
know vacuum distillation or uh ambient

3565
02:31:58,120 --> 02:32:03,399
pressure and and other other situations

3566
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:05,399
um

3567
02:32:03,398 --> 02:32:06,599
and I I think about it in terms of

3568
02:32:05,398 --> 02:32:08,920
theoretical plates if we're talking

3569
02:32:06,600 --> 02:32:12,079
about distillation um and the more you

3570
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:14,920
can get the better resolution you you

3571
02:32:12,079 --> 02:32:17,799
you should you should have um and so you

3572
02:32:14,920 --> 02:32:20,520
know like vacuums tend to reduce those

3573
02:32:17,799 --> 02:32:22,398
and uh you know changing changing the

3574
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:23,840
the pressure conditions and and the

3575
02:32:22,398 --> 02:32:24,719
vapor pressure and and the temperature

3576
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:27,079
oh that's a

3577
02:32:24,719 --> 02:32:28,679
beautiful beautiful tool um but yeah

3578
02:32:27,079 --> 02:32:30,398
looking at the thin film it's it's it's

3579
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:34,159
a fantastic way to get things to flash

3580
02:32:30,398 --> 02:32:36,039
off real quick um and so long as you

3581
02:32:34,159 --> 02:32:38,478
don't flood the plates or don't overload

3582
02:32:36,040 --> 02:32:40,040
it um it's a way to to get them to go

3583
02:32:38,478 --> 02:32:42,840
pretty

3584
02:32:40,040 --> 02:32:44,920
quick yep uh but we uh we can't dab

3585
02:32:42,840 --> 02:32:47,880
under vacuum if we could my job would be

3586
02:32:44,920 --> 02:32:50,600
easy uh what what what we're doing is

3587
02:32:47,879 --> 02:32:53,239
taking you're right the the thin film

3588
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:54,680
uh you're getting you're getting um

3589
02:32:53,239 --> 02:32:56,799
they're they're there for better Escape

3590
02:32:54,680 --> 02:32:58,318
conditions I've been focusing on trying

3591
02:32:56,799 --> 02:33:00,199
to have every this is going to be a good

3592
02:32:58,318 --> 02:33:02,439
one uh no accessories in it you see how

3593
02:33:00,200 --> 02:33:05,800
in that video everything's spreading out

3594
02:33:02,439 --> 02:33:09,120
into thin Stripes so this is this is an

3595
02:33:05,799 --> 02:33:10,599
attempt to miniaturize the the aspects

3596
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:13,160
of a thin film evaporator or a

3597
02:33:10,600 --> 02:33:15,600
centrifugal evaporator the Dabber coming

3598
02:33:13,159 --> 02:33:17,760
in from the outside is running like your

3599
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:20,399
feed chamber we run the dish at a lower

3600
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:22,040
temperature like a prime so

3601
02:33:20,398 --> 02:33:24,799
uh depending on how we do it how we

3602
02:33:22,040 --> 02:33:27,560
control it everything's going from room

3603
02:33:24,799 --> 02:33:28,799
temperature to Vapor so fast that it's

3604
02:33:27,559 --> 02:33:30,719
really mitigating the amount of

3605
02:33:28,799 --> 02:33:32,358
degradation from the time component

3606
02:33:30,719 --> 02:33:35,398
which does allow us to even run hotter

3607
02:33:32,359 --> 02:33:36,880
this is actually my favorite nail is

3608
02:33:35,398 --> 02:33:39,760
going

3609
02:33:36,879 --> 02:33:43,000
to this is my my most recent thought on

3610
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:43,000
how a nail could would should

3611
02:33:44,478 --> 02:33:50,199
work and this Venus Brian yeah that's

3612
02:33:47,959 --> 02:33:51,559
Venus there's no time for anything to

3613
02:33:50,200 --> 02:33:54,000
sit in a hot puddle and cook

3614
02:33:51,559 --> 02:33:56,959
everything's only in the working Zone

3615
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:58,840
when it's being engaged and because

3616
02:33:56,959 --> 02:34:00,278
everything's in motion the actual oil

3617
02:33:58,840 --> 02:34:01,880
that's not contacting and getting

3618
02:34:00,279 --> 02:34:03,920
vaporized doesn't get a chance to

3619
02:34:01,879 --> 02:34:05,599
overheat and then it falls back down to

3620
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:07,840
a cooler chamber so it doesn't cook

3621
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:09,559
while it's in motion uh that one's just

3622
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:11,760
the most elegant iteration of that

3623
02:34:09,559 --> 02:34:14,318
particular design but the notion that

3624
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:17,120
this pursuit of efficiency uh was

3625
02:34:14,318 --> 02:34:18,799
leading to a preservation of cannaboids

3626
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:20,600
just had not occurred to me until

3627
02:34:18,799 --> 02:34:23,799
earlier this year

3628
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:26,040
uh the flavors there this work is

3629
02:34:23,799 --> 02:34:27,398
overall concept Material Science fluid

3630
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:31,319
dynamics

3631
02:34:27,398 --> 02:34:33,719
thermodynamics and I have zero phds uh

3632
02:34:31,318 --> 02:34:35,239
my company has zero phds we just kind of

3633
02:34:33,719 --> 02:34:37,159
think about how it all comes together

3634
02:34:35,239 --> 02:34:40,239
and keep doing it dude you don't need

3635
02:34:37,159 --> 02:34:42,119
phds you have dabs

3636
02:34:40,239 --> 02:34:44,719
bro of

3637
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:47,319
phcs I I like to think that that I've

3638
02:34:44,719 --> 02:34:50,239
spent more time thinking about dab

3639
02:34:47,318 --> 02:34:51,920
physics than most people

3640
02:34:50,239 --> 02:34:53,318
uh there's plenty of qualified people

3641
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:54,719
that could be brought up to speed run

3642
02:34:53,318 --> 02:34:57,760
circles around me but they're usually

3643
02:34:54,719 --> 02:34:59,639
doing more traditional conventional work

3644
02:34:57,760 --> 02:35:00,880
Mark uh by the way you're one of uh

3645
02:34:59,639 --> 02:35:02,519
you're one of the most important people

3646
02:35:00,879 --> 02:35:04,959
in this industry scientifically I'm I'm

3647
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:09,520
honored to be here with you oh well

3648
02:35:04,959 --> 02:35:13,199
thank you wait which Mark oh uh you no

3649
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:15,760
uh wait Mark versus Marcus I'm marus Mar

3650
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:17,680
Marcus Mar Marcus's industry glue dude

3651
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:21,159
you're the scientific Community I'm I'm

3652
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:23,840
not I'm just the humble host please

3653
02:35:21,159 --> 02:35:25,039
people like you hold us together but uh

3654
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:26,799
yeah we haven't Mark and I haven't

3655
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:28,120
really talked much but uh you pop up in

3656
02:35:26,799 --> 02:35:29,719
a lot of circles and I've got a lot of

3657
02:35:28,120 --> 02:35:31,840
respect for you so it's really it's

3658
02:35:29,719 --> 02:35:36,278
really an honor thank you the feeling is

3659
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:38,799
definitely mutual um I I think that it's

3660
02:35:36,279 --> 02:35:41,880
interesting that you say uh dab physics

3661
02:35:38,799 --> 02:35:45,199
because yeah I never never thought of it

3662
02:35:41,879 --> 02:35:46,879
quite in those terms but it certainly is

3663
02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:49,439
Brian I I don't know if you ever see

3664
02:35:46,879 --> 02:35:51,839
this misconception but whenever you see

3665
02:35:49,439 --> 02:35:54,200
the boiling points of the canono and

3666
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:58,478
they list THC at

3667
02:35:54,200 --> 02:36:01,479
157 or what 315 Fahrenheit right they

3668
02:35:58,478 --> 02:36:04,599
didn't realize that when Mula measured

3669
02:36:01,478 --> 02:36:08,840
that that boiling point back in

3670
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:12,840
1964 it was at a vacuum pressure of 0.05

3671
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:15,239
Tor so the the boiling point at at at

3672
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:17,840
atmospheric pressure is much much

3673
02:36:15,239 --> 02:36:19,840
greater than that what we found is that

3674
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:23,318
yeah if you use the nomograph you can

3675
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:29,200
basically find the boiling point of

3676
02:36:23,318 --> 02:36:32,519
THC is somewhere around 429 degrees uh

3677
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:34,439
Centigrade we're able to get some Escape

3678
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:35,960
conditions at lower temperatures than

3679
02:36:34,439 --> 02:36:38,960
that but we are lowering the pressure

3680
02:36:35,959 --> 02:36:41,519
with carb caps and we're also um when

3681
02:36:38,959 --> 02:36:43,278
it's in solution it's going to have some

3682
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:45,560
aspect of of being able to escape a

3683
02:36:43,279 --> 02:36:47,920
little bit earlier uh we are getting

3684
02:36:45,559 --> 02:36:50,398
Vapor with conf with Dish surfaces uh in

3685
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:52,359
the 400 range but you're right a pure

3686
02:36:50,398 --> 02:36:54,358
diamond isn't going to do much more than

3687
02:36:52,359 --> 02:36:56,279
melt at that point and what about

3688
02:36:54,359 --> 02:36:58,318
diamondium can you tell us a little bit

3689
02:36:56,279 --> 02:37:01,279
about that and why that's you know

3690
02:36:58,318 --> 02:37:03,840
different from Ruby or I can tell you a

3691
02:37:01,279 --> 02:37:05,560
little bit about it and I'm still okay

3692
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:07,559
so the relationship between Material

3693
02:37:05,559 --> 02:37:09,278
Science and dabs is something that I

3694
02:37:07,559 --> 02:37:13,680
partially understand having done this

3695
02:37:09,279 --> 02:37:16,960
for a long time uh this when when we did

3696
02:37:13,680 --> 02:37:18,159
a global survey about nine years ago uh

3697
02:37:16,959 --> 02:37:19,799
the state-of-the-art and Material

3698
02:37:18,159 --> 02:37:21,279
Science was the titanium guys saying

3699
02:37:19,799 --> 02:37:23,318
quartz would kill you the quartz guys

3700
02:37:21,279 --> 02:37:25,960
saying titanium would kill you so we're

3701
02:37:23,318 --> 02:37:28,840
like there's got to be more to it uh we

3702
02:37:25,959 --> 02:37:31,599
sorted materials by uh their ability to

3703
02:37:28,840 --> 02:37:33,760
withstand the conditions uh both

3704
02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:36,399
thermally and chemically and then just

3705
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:38,880
started looking for additional answers

3706
02:37:36,398 --> 02:37:41,879
uh we settled on silic carbide and

3707
02:37:38,879 --> 02:37:43,199
Sapphire as two of the the materials we

3708
02:37:41,879 --> 02:37:46,000
wanted to introduce and we've done a lot

3709
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:48,120
of work with other things uh this one in

3710
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:50,799
particular in once we had an

3711
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:52,200
understanding of the kind of the the

3712
02:37:50,799 --> 02:37:53,840
kind of things you'd see on a material

3713
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:57,000
spec sheet that would actually lend

3714
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:58,880
themselves to flavor this kind of topped

3715
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:00,559
the charts theoretically but at the time

3716
02:37:58,879 --> 02:38:03,398
it was hundreds of thousands of dollars

3717
02:38:00,559 --> 02:38:05,478
a kilogram so we laughed and kept going

3718
02:38:03,398 --> 02:38:08,478
uh some patents expired some prices came

3719
02:38:05,478 --> 02:38:10,079
down and the market changed that pillar

3720
02:38:08,478 --> 02:38:13,840
that you just showed has a retail of

3721
02:38:10,079 --> 02:38:17,359
like $550 and it's 18 millimeters by six

3722
02:38:13,840 --> 02:38:19,639
it is expensive expensive stuff uh we

3723
02:38:17,359 --> 02:38:20,640
wanted to do the inserts uh because we

3724
02:38:19,639 --> 02:38:22,159
thought we'd actually be able to get

3725
02:38:20,639 --> 02:38:24,719
them cost

3726
02:38:22,159 --> 02:38:26,318
effective and end up doing small parts

3727
02:38:24,719 --> 02:38:27,398
and what we saw in small parts was

3728
02:38:26,318 --> 02:38:30,039
Flavor

3729
02:38:27,398 --> 02:38:32,199
reviews in effect in in excess of what

3730
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:33,800
we thought was possible from small parts

3731
02:38:32,200 --> 02:38:36,840
Someone putting a five millimeter sphere

3732
02:38:33,799 --> 02:38:38,799
in a banger flavor RWS off the charts

3733
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:40,559
now the the basic thermal properties

3734
02:38:38,799 --> 02:38:44,639
that stuff moves heat over a thousand

3735
02:38:40,559 --> 02:38:47,439
times faster than quartz uh it's almost

3736
02:38:44,639 --> 02:38:49,719
completely functionally inert and it's

3737
02:38:47,439 --> 02:38:51,920
extremely non-stick so you get get that

3738
02:38:49,719 --> 02:38:54,278
in Motion in your system you effectively

3739
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:57,840
have a a spinning disc of of a heat

3740
02:38:54,279 --> 02:38:59,640
Super Highway and what that does for

3741
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:01,840
quickly and efficiently getting

3742
02:38:59,639 --> 02:39:05,478
everything to to phase change and get

3743
02:39:01,840 --> 02:39:07,079
out is astonishing yeah astonishing to

3744
02:39:05,478 --> 02:39:09,039
the point where people are people with

3745
02:39:07,079 --> 02:39:10,840
with a low sense of smell or taste are

3746
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:13,720
trying it and hitting me back and saying

3747
02:39:10,840 --> 02:39:16,880
thank you i' never tasted my oil

3748
02:39:13,719 --> 02:39:19,398
before I Mark's nodding but in order to

3749
02:39:16,879 --> 02:39:20,959
get in that's some of the basics of it

3750
02:39:19,398 --> 02:39:23,358
there's more to it that I literally

3751
02:39:20,959 --> 02:39:26,438
don't know

3752
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:28,640
it's I literally don't know dead Brian

3753
02:39:26,439 --> 02:39:30,920
like I don't see much ceramic Nails

3754
02:39:28,639 --> 02:39:33,599
anymore are those things

3755
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:36,639
gone

3756
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:38,399
the the ceramic nails that were the full

3757
02:39:36,639 --> 02:39:41,680
ceramic nails that were popularized were

3758
02:39:38,398 --> 02:39:43,358
low grade alumina prone to explosion and

3759
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:45,840
I think enough time has passed it I can

3760
02:39:43,359 --> 02:39:50,520
say that uh the company was more of a

3761
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:52,840
stock market scam than a company um

3762
02:39:50,520 --> 02:39:55,159
so there are options for full Ceramics

3763
02:39:52,840 --> 02:39:58,120
uh everything that we like would be

3764
02:39:55,159 --> 02:39:59,680
dramatically more expensive than quartz

3765
02:39:58,120 --> 02:40:02,520
uh we're still making ceramic Parts

3766
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:03,520
ceramic inserts doesn't puffco use a

3767
02:40:02,520 --> 02:40:07,760
ceramic

3768
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:09,680
Bowl uh yeah they're using uh I believe

3769
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:11,478
they're using a higher quality alumina

3770
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:13,239
than uh than Hive used to Hive was the

3771
02:40:11,478 --> 02:40:16,799
company that really popularized ceramic

3772
02:40:13,239 --> 02:40:19,559
nails and they shot that in the foot um

3773
02:40:16,799 --> 02:40:21,398
puffco uh I I would say is Pro haven't

3774
02:40:19,559 --> 02:40:22,478
tested it I think it's alumina uh it's

3775
02:40:21,398 --> 02:40:25,639
the only thing that would fit their

3776
02:40:22,478 --> 02:40:28,079
price points uh people make aftermarket

3777
02:40:25,639 --> 02:40:30,439
parts for them quartz silicon carbide

3778
02:40:28,079 --> 02:40:33,120
Sapphire for the most part but other

3779
02:40:30,439 --> 02:40:34,600
than silicon carbide inserts uh there's

3780
02:40:33,120 --> 02:40:36,840
one that people have been using aluminum

3781
02:40:34,600 --> 02:40:38,439
nitride uh Mark if you can find a paper

3782
02:40:36,840 --> 02:40:41,840
that says anything other than aluminum

3783
02:40:38,439 --> 02:40:43,760
nitride degrades in contact with water

3784
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:45,719
uh and and shouldn't be used for dabs

3785
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:48,159
I'd love to see it because I've gotten a

3786
02:40:45,719 --> 02:40:50,000
lot of [ __ ] for saying that well you

3787
02:40:48,159 --> 02:40:51,959
know a lot of things with those Ceramics

3788
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:54,000
is is they're they're manufactured in

3789
02:40:51,959 --> 02:40:56,759
bulk and unfortunately a lot of them are

3790
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:59,159
made over in China so you always got to

3791
02:40:56,760 --> 02:41:01,559
wonder like what kind of Trace

3792
02:40:59,159 --> 02:41:03,200
components might be in there you know

3793
02:41:01,559 --> 02:41:05,478
just like the whole thing with shiny

3794
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:07,760
metal you know objects that you're

3795
02:41:05,478 --> 02:41:11,519
getting from a Chinese Factory could

3796
02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:15,439
have any number of you know cadmium lead

3797
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:18,880
Mercury so um are the impurities that

3798
02:41:15,439 --> 02:41:22,359
are often present in Ceramics just

3799
02:41:18,879 --> 02:41:25,358
basically take those completely off the

3800
02:41:22,359 --> 02:41:27,680
table no not completely so ceramic is as

3801
02:41:25,359 --> 02:41:29,640
broad of a term as metal if you say you

3802
02:41:27,680 --> 02:41:31,680
can't get good ceramic you say you can't

3803
02:41:29,639 --> 02:41:33,439
get good metal you can't get good glass

3804
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:35,600
it's just anything can be done with a

3805
02:41:33,439 --> 02:41:37,639
standard and ceramic is one of the

3806
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:39,640
broadest categories of materials in the

3807
02:41:37,639 --> 02:41:41,398
world uh one of the reasons we're doing

3808
02:41:39,639 --> 02:41:44,000
trade names now is because everything

3809
02:41:41,398 --> 02:41:46,680
we've done in new materials has opened

3810
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:49,478
us up to having a lower grade impure

3811
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:51,479
copy of it done or some version of it in

3812
02:41:49,478 --> 02:41:54,519
many cases so cheap that people cut us

3813
02:41:51,478 --> 02:41:56,920
out of our own Marketplace so we I found

3814
02:41:54,520 --> 02:41:59,520
that I've given people the uh the

3815
02:41:56,920 --> 02:42:02,120
inspiration to make bad

3816
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:04,399
products

3817
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:05,359
uh that's an interesting way of looking

3818
02:42:04,398 --> 02:42:08,719
at it

3819
02:42:05,359 --> 02:42:10,479
right it it is um it's you know it's

3820
02:42:08,719 --> 02:42:13,799
hard to patent stuff in this industry

3821
02:42:10,478 --> 02:42:17,318
and and uh even if you get it through no

3822
02:42:13,799 --> 02:42:18,759
no one particularly cares so it's uh you

3823
02:42:17,318 --> 02:42:20,359
when we when we did silicon carbide and

3824
02:42:18,760 --> 02:42:22,880
Sapphire we just talked about them as

3825
02:42:20,359 --> 02:42:25,000
what they were people are using jewelry

3826
02:42:22,879 --> 02:42:26,519
grade Sapphire and Ruby on everything

3827
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:29,680
we're still using optical grade

3828
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:32,079
sapphires on everything big difference

3829
02:42:29,680 --> 02:42:34,559
we we could we could get the we used to

3830
02:42:32,079 --> 02:42:36,559
pay $250 for Sapphire parts and sell

3831
02:42:34,559 --> 02:42:38,039
them for 300 because 250 was what they

3832
02:42:36,559 --> 02:42:41,600
cost and no one wanted to pay more than

3833
02:42:38,040 --> 02:42:44,920
300 wow new technology the um had the

3834
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:48,359
issues with Supply chains affected your

3835
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:50,318
uh your raw material cost much uh raw

3836
02:42:48,359 --> 02:42:51,880
materials not so much uh actually the

3837
02:42:50,318 --> 02:42:53,239
electrical components for the Dil

3838
02:42:51,879 --> 02:42:56,278
controllers have been the problem where

3839
02:42:53,239 --> 02:42:58,520
we suffered uh we we for for raw

3840
02:42:56,279 --> 02:43:02,359
materials uh quartz is going to go up a

3841
02:42:58,520 --> 02:43:03,760
little bit um every place that we that

3842
02:43:02,359 --> 02:43:05,079
we were finding our raw materials were

3843
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:06,800
going to go up we were able to address

3844
02:43:05,079 --> 02:43:08,719
it with uh with bulk increases and

3845
02:43:06,799 --> 02:43:11,159
purchases to keep everything the

3846
02:43:08,719 --> 02:43:12,559
same uh but yeah no that we're going to

3847
02:43:11,159 --> 02:43:13,959
see crazy inflation and everything's

3848
02:43:12,559 --> 02:43:16,600
going to be weird

3849
02:43:13,959 --> 02:43:19,159
soon but you are also seeing other

3850
02:43:16,600 --> 02:43:22,239
companies coming around and start to

3851
02:43:19,159 --> 02:43:24,000
knock off even your the you know here

3852
02:43:22,239 --> 02:43:27,359
you know you're sit car you know what

3853
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:29,719
I'm saying so it's it shows you that you

3854
02:43:27,359 --> 02:43:31,520
were ahead of the curve and the industry

3855
02:43:29,719 --> 02:43:33,478
is coming around to your thought once

3856
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:35,079
they realize and understand what they

3857
02:43:33,478 --> 02:43:36,959
are have and what they're dealing with

3858
02:43:35,079 --> 02:43:39,279
so I want to thank you personally I've

3859
02:43:36,959 --> 02:43:41,519
been using your stuff uh for nearly a

3860
02:43:39,279 --> 02:43:43,079
decade or you know since your Inception

3861
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:46,560
and your

3862
02:43:43,079 --> 02:43:50,079
consistent uh availability to always

3863
02:43:46,559 --> 02:43:53,318
improving yourself and never settl

3864
02:43:50,079 --> 02:43:55,719
for what is out there and always pushing

3865
02:43:53,318 --> 02:43:57,719
the boundaries is something that needs

3866
02:43:55,719 --> 02:43:59,920
to be applauded and commended because

3867
02:43:57,719 --> 02:44:02,398
it's very expensive and hard to do this

3868
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:03,840
type of research and development and I

3869
02:44:02,398 --> 02:44:05,920
thank you for the love you've given me

3870
02:44:03,840 --> 02:44:07,880
and the discounts over the years because

3871
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:09,920
I gift all these things to other people

3872
02:44:07,879 --> 02:44:12,119
and Stoners who are just coming on

3873
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:15,079
because you know again it was very

3874
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:17,240
expensive early on now the price of your

3875
02:44:15,079 --> 02:44:19,600
components are much more in reach of

3876
02:44:17,239 --> 02:44:21,760
your average consumer as opposed to to

3877
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:24,079
just being within the reach of you know

3878
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:27,800
those that could afford a lot so not

3879
02:44:24,079 --> 02:44:29,799
only congratulations on your creation

3880
02:44:27,799 --> 02:44:31,840
but creating new things but also

3881
02:44:29,799 --> 02:44:34,398
bringing price points down so it's more

3882
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:37,000
affordable over time I know you absorb

3883
02:44:34,398 --> 02:44:39,278
those costs through all of your R&amp;D

3884
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:42,398
because it's so expensive though I know

3885
02:44:39,279 --> 02:44:45,359
most people don't have the coones to do

3886
02:44:42,398 --> 02:44:48,000
that so thank you for being a leader and

3887
02:44:45,359 --> 02:44:50,359
a Pioneer in that resolve because that's

3888
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:53,520
why I continue to f follow you and what

3889
02:44:50,359 --> 02:44:55,159
you do is because you don't settle for

3890
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:57,239
what's out there you don't even settle

3891
02:44:55,159 --> 02:45:00,639
for your own you're always trying to

3892
02:44:57,239 --> 02:45:03,239
find New Paths and new Pathways which

3893
02:45:00,639 --> 02:45:06,959
too few companies in the dab industry

3894
02:45:03,239 --> 02:45:09,680

02:46:26,879 --> 02:46:31,199
really thought or understood as well but

3929

3936
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:52,478
was it was weird to not pursue an

3937

academic career and decide to just work

3938

02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:35,399
technical problems he said he's been

4019
02:50:31,760 --> 02:50:37,639
having some internet issues um but yeah

4020
02:50:35,398 --> 02:50:40,079
I second everything you say his work is

4021
02:50:37,639 --> 02:50:43,199
top-notch Maine is an incredible place

4022
02:50:40,079 --> 02:50:45,600
and some amazing talent I mean I've got

4023
02:50:43,200 --> 02:50:48,359
some Brave boat Gardens right here for

4024
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:50,318
Maine incredible indoor stuff and the

4025
02:50:48,359 --> 02:50:53,000
whole main Community big love to you

4026
02:50:50,318 --> 02:50:58,039
guys hopefully I'll join you one

4027
02:50:53,000 --> 02:51:01,799
day uh also uh Brian Mr schroer um uh

4028
02:50:58,040 --> 02:51:03,479
these type two uh caps you should get a

4029
02:51:01,799 --> 02:51:05,519
Nobel Prize for I mean these are

4030
02:51:03,478 --> 02:51:08,278
absolutely brilliant absolutely

4031
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:11,640
intelligent so easy to use makes the

4032
02:51:08,279 --> 02:51:14,279
flow an upake ex except if you if you

4033
02:51:11,639 --> 02:51:16,719
unscrew this and lose the piece and then

4034
02:51:14,279 --> 02:51:19,159
you have to use these with the with the

4035
02:51:16,719 --> 02:51:21,278
tweezers like this it's not I'm gonna

4036
02:51:19,159 --> 02:51:23,600
get you a new Dabber I

4037
02:51:21,279 --> 02:51:26,359
gotta it still

4038
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:28,439
works take take a take a good look at at

4039
02:51:26,359 --> 02:51:30,479
the one at the end's using versus yours

4040
02:51:28,439 --> 02:51:33,079
there there is like there's clearly six

4041
02:51:30,478 --> 02:51:35,599
years of Technology between them oh you

4042
02:51:33,079 --> 02:51:37,680
got one of the old school ones yeah the

4043
02:51:35,600 --> 02:51:39,760
the first carb cap was a straight hole

4044
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:41,960
and it splashed everything so we just

4045
02:51:39,760 --> 02:51:43,719
made a quick change to it to mix

4046
02:51:41,959 --> 02:51:46,039
everything the one that the one that at

4047
02:51:43,719 --> 02:51:47,959
the end's using uh completely different

4048
02:51:46,040 --> 02:51:49,880
physics you got you have to use like

4049
02:51:47,959 --> 02:51:52,799
half as much pressure to hit that

4050
02:51:49,879 --> 02:51:55,278
right yes compared to this one which was

4051
02:51:52,799 --> 02:51:57,879
a previous iteration which was I love

4052
02:51:55,279 --> 02:51:59,640
these These are great these are great I

4053
02:51:57,879 --> 02:52:02,358
wish you still made these I know I kind

4054
02:51:59,639 --> 02:52:04,799
of was part of that early uh Etc and you

4055
02:52:02,359 --> 02:52:07,279
made the taller ones but these are

4056
02:52:04,799 --> 02:52:09,398
perfect size they only have one I know

4057
02:52:07,279 --> 02:52:11,600
you'd probably now it would have two

4058
02:52:09,398 --> 02:52:14,760
holes in it if you actually did them

4059
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:17,920
currently but they just perfect size and

4060
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:21,079
weight but I liked how you also these

4061
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:24,079
Cascade es matter because of heat

4062
02:52:21,079 --> 02:52:26,600
absorption and as well as this stays a

4063
02:52:24,079 --> 02:52:28,959
lot cooler up here than if it were down

4064
02:52:26,600 --> 02:52:32,079
here or if it were straighter so these

4065
02:52:28,959 --> 02:52:35,759
types of Curves uh as well as swells in

4066
02:52:32,079 --> 02:52:38,719
the glass itself make a difference in uh

4067
02:52:35,760 --> 02:52:41,000
how long you can keep the Dabber on top

4068
02:52:38,719 --> 02:52:43,000
to absorb because of again the older

4069
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:48,040
technology of the dabs we were using at

4070
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:50,000
the time but the thickness of it as well

4071
02:52:48,040 --> 02:52:53,160
I could hold it and sustain it for a

4072
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:56,000
longer time for a longer slow temp dab

4073
02:52:53,159 --> 02:52:57,359
than if I did something in these these

4074
02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:00,920
first

4075
02:52:57,359 --> 02:53:03,760
gen uh denail caps that of course the

4076
02:53:00,920 --> 02:53:06,079
heat just sank so quickly all the way up

4077
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:07,719
here if you went as long you would

4078
02:53:06,079 --> 02:53:10,238
literally burn your fingers trying to

4079
02:53:07,719 --> 02:53:12,478
remove this metal as opposed to this

4080
02:53:10,238 --> 02:53:15,478
glass actually if you have our Dabber

4081
02:53:12,478 --> 02:53:18,039
instead of another one uh the rabber has

4082
02:53:15,478 --> 02:53:20,238
a a heat sink uh built into it and it's

4083
02:53:18,040 --> 02:53:23,200
got a thi area where you could handle it

4084
02:53:20,238 --> 02:53:25,079
it does Marcus was holding up a a cast

4085
02:53:23,200 --> 02:53:27,120
sterling silver topper that our friends

4086
02:53:25,079 --> 02:53:31,318
family made I think there's like 10 of

4087
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:33,479
those in the world um that was just some

4088
02:53:31,318 --> 02:53:35,879
gifts that we had for Christmas I I my

4089
02:53:33,478 --> 02:53:39,438
my wife's got one uh I don't know where

4090
02:53:35,879 --> 02:53:41,799
the rest went but man there's so much to

4091
02:53:39,439 --> 02:53:43,439
it yeah you got one um I think that was

4092
02:53:41,799 --> 02:53:45,599
your Christmas present a couple years

4093
02:53:43,439 --> 02:53:48,960
ago there there's a lot of work we have

4094
02:53:45,600 --> 02:53:51,559
to do here here's the reflex Ma you were

4095
02:53:48,959 --> 02:53:51,559
talking about

4096
02:53:51,760 --> 02:53:59,079
Marcus right on Kylie's in the room Sam

4097
02:53:55,520 --> 02:54:03,880
the uh gentleman who designed that

4098
02:53:59,079 --> 02:54:08,920
unit which one is he I'm right here oh

4099
02:54:03,879 --> 02:54:14,278
howdy howy nice do you have the insane

4100
02:54:08,920 --> 02:54:14,279
1100 I don't know what the insane 1100

4101
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:19,279
is there's there's there's the larger

4102
02:54:17,439 --> 02:54:21,520
unit that's like it's like portable

4103
02:54:19,279 --> 02:54:23,640
battery power cells in it and it weighs

4104
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:24,640
a ton and it's just it's hilariously

4105
02:54:23,639 --> 02:54:26,398
over

4106
02:54:24,639 --> 02:54:28,599
engineered

4107
02:54:26,398 --> 02:54:29,799
briefcase I don't think mine has

4108
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:32,680
batteries in

4109
02:54:29,799 --> 02:54:34,639
it someone help someone help Kylie find

4110
02:54:32,680 --> 02:54:36,559
a workaround for shipping he's getting

4111
02:54:34,639 --> 02:54:39,398
regulations and there's got to be a

4112
02:54:36,559 --> 02:54:42,799
workout one thing I can tell you about

4113
02:54:39,398 --> 02:54:45,559
Tye is it takes it makes almost

4114
02:54:42,799 --> 02:54:46,959
everything tastes better especially the

4115
02:54:45,559 --> 02:54:52,398
first half of the

4116
02:54:46,959 --> 02:54:55,679
hit but but uh kie share your screen

4117
02:54:52,398 --> 02:54:58,599
dude how do I do oh I'm not there I just

4118
02:54:55,680 --> 02:54:59,800
talk no you so there's a bottom there

4119
02:54:58,600 --> 02:55:02,040
there a little if you look in the bottom

4120
02:54:59,799 --> 02:55:05,719
menu of the screen there's a green share

4121
02:55:02,040 --> 02:55:07,800
screen icon I've got him pinned right

4122
02:55:05,719 --> 02:55:10,199
now so he's the his screen is the main

4123
02:55:07,799 --> 02:55:12,759
screen everyone's looking at that

4124
02:55:10,200 --> 02:55:15,439
working there you go yeah look at this

4125
02:55:12,760 --> 02:55:17,398
thing I work by myself but here's a new

4126
02:55:15,439 --> 02:55:21,000
briefcase I'm taking out to them yeah

4127
02:55:17,398 --> 02:55:23,879
that's don't have that big

4128
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:25,359
model I I don't know why I don't have it

4129
02:55:23,879 --> 02:55:27,278
but I

4130
02:55:25,359 --> 02:55:31,600
don't

4131
02:55:27,279 --> 02:55:34,800
why but uh I really like it but it it's

4132
02:55:31,600 --> 02:55:38,559
fairly complicated to use compared to a

4133
02:55:34,799 --> 02:55:40,438
regular Dabber that's my only complaint

4134
02:55:38,559 --> 02:55:42,478
yeah you have to understand how the size

4135
02:55:40,439 --> 02:55:45,520
shape and quantity and composition

4136
02:55:42,478 --> 02:55:49,639
controls the vaporization process and

4137
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:51,479
then uh set your timing per periods like

4138
02:55:49,639 --> 02:55:54,478
on your unit right there you have it set

4139
02:55:51,478 --> 02:55:56,959
at like 40 seconds so at the smallest

4140
02:55:54,478 --> 02:55:59,318
elements you can run it continuous like

4141
02:55:56,959 --> 02:56:01,879
up to five Cycles or 500

4142
02:55:59,318 --> 02:56:04,359
seconds but when you use the larger the

4143
02:56:01,879 --> 02:56:07,199
quicker heating materials you want to

4144
02:56:04,359 --> 02:56:08,840
set the timer at a lower period for

4145
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:11,840
instance with the glow sticks I like

4146
02:56:08,840 --> 02:56:13,880
setting at 25 seconds running it that'll

4147
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:16,639
get me right to preheat at the very

4148
02:56:13,879 --> 02:56:19,559
onset of vaporization you'll taste those

4149
02:56:16,639 --> 02:56:21,358
light volatiles and that sweet nectar

4150
02:56:19,559 --> 02:56:23,959
flavor and then I'll turn the dial down

4151
02:56:21,359 --> 02:56:26,120
to 10 and run subsequent Cycles from

4152
02:56:23,959 --> 02:56:29,438
there to extend the session without

4153
02:56:26,120 --> 02:56:32,160
overheating but like I said everybody

4154
02:56:29,439 --> 02:56:34,398
it's complicated yeah it's like playing

4155
02:56:32,159 --> 02:56:36,200
a musical instrument you really have to

4156
02:56:34,398 --> 02:56:38,278
master it to get the dude it's one that

4157
02:56:36,200 --> 02:56:40,680
I want to master I want to learn this

4158
02:56:38,279 --> 02:56:42,920
instrument I want to play that thing

4159
02:56:40,680 --> 02:56:46,479
well you you're welcome to come on over

4160
02:56:42,920 --> 02:56:49,120
here and uh you can play with it for

4161
02:56:46,478 --> 02:56:52,159
three days in a row if that's what you

4162
02:56:49,120 --> 02:56:53,920
like nice dude open invitation to skunk

4163
02:56:52,159 --> 02:56:55,398
man's house to play with this reflux

4164
02:56:53,920 --> 02:56:58,760
machine come

4165
02:56:55,398 --> 02:56:58,760
on to use

4166
02:57:02,159 --> 02:57:10,559
it the one I've been using a lot lately

4167
02:57:07,359 --> 02:57:10,559
is this

4168
02:57:12,120 --> 02:57:18,479
one oh the scope in stack yes corre

4169
02:57:16,680 --> 02:57:21,520
that's what it's called yeah I've heard

4170
02:57:18,478 --> 02:57:21,519
great things about that one

4171
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:30,960
too someone in the comments said this is

4172
02:57:27,639 --> 02:57:30,959
where we start selling

4173
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:35,600
stuff hey a lot of the stuff of M you

4174
02:57:34,040 --> 02:57:38,120
guys plugged I don't even have in stock

4175
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:38,120
don't worry about

4176
02:57:38,478 --> 02:57:46,799
it now that's for you guys to decide

4177
02:57:43,040 --> 02:57:49,439

4183
02:57:58,079 --> 02:58:01,639
promotional stuff with bubble man in the

4184
02:57:59,680 --> 02:58:03,639
past but it was never a paid promotion

4185
02:58:01,639 --> 02:58:07,439
it was here's a thing do an honest

4186
02:58:03,639 --> 02:58:12,000
review um if if you like it speak speak

4187
02:58:07,439 --> 02:58:13,720
well of it but otherwise don't um the

4188
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:15,680
the what I'm seeing here it's it's not

4189
02:58:13,719 --> 02:58:17,679
paid promo it's it's people that know

4190
02:58:15,680 --> 02:58:19,398
this industry inside it out telling you

4191
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:22,960
guys what they actually believe

4192
02:58:19,398 --> 02:58:25,639
in I and I for whatever my word is worth

4193
02:58:22,959 --> 02:58:28,358
that's that's the truth not an ad that's

4194
02:58:25,639 --> 02:58:30,358
why I it as well I've never paid for any

4195
02:58:28,359 --> 02:58:32,120
promotion whatsoever I just let Word of

4196
02:58:30,359 --> 02:58:34,880
Mouth be my only

4197
02:58:32,120 --> 02:58:36,760
marketing yeah and that's why I've used

4198
02:58:34,879 --> 02:58:38,799
my word of mouth to spread the words of

4199
02:58:36,760 --> 02:58:40,800
those companies that hav in work you

4200
02:58:38,799 --> 02:58:44,398
know I go back to having the first the

4201
02:58:40,799 --> 02:58:47,000
temp temple which was the first uh I

4202
02:58:44,398 --> 02:58:49,318
guess electronic rig after the Highly

4203
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:51,279
Educated I guess was the first one but

4204
02:58:49,318 --> 02:58:53,318
it was in such limited quantities I

4205
02:58:51,279 --> 02:58:57,200
couldn't find one so I had to order one

4206
02:58:53,318 --> 02:59:01,840
of those temp temples from um Canada

4207
02:58:57,200 --> 02:59:06,120
which is this crazy Xbox with that uh a

4208
02:59:01,840 --> 02:59:09,600
crazy Chrome the big Chrome one

4209
02:59:06,120 --> 02:59:13,359
yeah it was obnoxious but it worked and

4210
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:18,159
it show I also had to create and and uh

4211
02:59:13,359 --> 02:59:20,800
shift the actual um coil around the nail

4212
02:59:18,159 --> 02:59:23,039
originally because it didn't come aach

4213
02:59:20,799 --> 02:59:25,879
or of an understanding so I've seen the

4214
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:28,279
progression from starting off in myself

4215
02:59:25,879 --> 02:59:30,159
2011 with the torch and then looking for

4216
02:59:28,279 --> 02:59:31,960
something that didn't scare women or

4217
02:59:30,159 --> 02:59:33,439
people that are around because you know

4218
02:59:31,959 --> 02:59:35,719
when you're just hanging out you whip

4219
02:59:33,439 --> 02:59:37,639
out a [ __ ] huge old [ __ ] Blazer

4220
02:59:35,719 --> 02:59:39,478
people [ __ ] get nervous because their

4221
02:59:37,639 --> 02:59:41,760
Association from television everything

4222
02:59:39,478 --> 02:59:43,519
is that you're using crack you know so

4223
02:59:41,760 --> 02:59:45,600
they start to think that oh Jesus Christ

4224
02:59:43,520 --> 02:59:48,800
he's using a [ __ ] cremet torch and

4225
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:51,479
[ __ ] yeah so to find us the straight

4226
02:59:48,799 --> 02:59:53,799
propane torch like ghetto heating up

4227
02:59:51,478 --> 02:59:56,879
spoons and [ __ ] like we must have looked

4228
02:59:53,799 --> 02:59:58,959
completely psychotic absolutely and so

4229
02:59:56,879 --> 03:00:00,478
then when these more refined products

4230
02:59:58,959 --> 03:00:03,199
came available and then temp temple

4231
03:00:00,478 --> 03:00:06,799
didn't last long and so then it was to

4232
03:00:03,200 --> 03:00:09,960
find anybody who was producing any type

4233
03:00:06,799 --> 03:00:12,840
of electronic nail and uh you've been a

4234
03:00:09,959 --> 03:00:15,639
Trailblazer from your initial creation

4235
03:00:12,840 --> 03:00:17,120
which was the first one that I found

4236
03:00:15,639 --> 03:00:19,879
that was kind of a plug-and play

4237
03:00:17,120 --> 03:00:22,680
everything all fit together it was easy

4238
03:00:19,879 --> 03:00:24,119
to assemble it wasn't intimidating out

4239
03:00:22,680 --> 03:00:26,000
the boxes there's no way I could take

4240
03:00:24,120 --> 03:00:27,680
somebody who's a patient and then get a

4241
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:29,639
temp temple and show okay now you're

4242
03:00:27,680 --> 03:00:33,200
going to need crimpers and some major

4243
03:00:29,639 --> 03:00:35,238
actual wrenches here to wrap this thing

4244
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:38,120
around this

4245
03:00:35,238 --> 03:00:40,959
titanium you know what I'm saying so

4246
03:00:38,120 --> 03:00:42,479
whereas those ones also caught fire uh

4247
03:00:40,959 --> 03:00:44,079
they had just a thin little piece of

4248
03:00:42,478 --> 03:00:46,159
electrical tape you know that that raw

4249
03:00:44,079 --> 03:00:48,559
aluminum shell uh there were live

4250
03:00:46,159 --> 03:00:50,719
terminals like 3 millimet away from them

4251
03:00:48,559 --> 03:00:54,600
with when the electrical tape that they

4252
03:00:50,719 --> 03:00:57,318
just kind of put over it came off fire

4253
03:00:54,600 --> 03:00:58,920
um well they were pretty they they had a

4254
03:00:57,318 --> 03:01:01,159
good idea they did it but I mean like

4255
03:00:58,920 --> 03:01:02,318
they shouldn't have I I've I've fixed a

4256
03:01:01,159 --> 03:01:04,159
number of those and I've talked to a

4257
03:01:02,318 --> 03:01:08,199
number of people who like tables or

4258
03:01:04,159 --> 03:01:10,359
rooms or houses bur uh I was I was doing

4259
03:01:08,200 --> 03:01:12,399
uh high energy experiments in my in my

4260
03:01:10,359 --> 03:01:15,359
apartment late at night um when when

4261
03:01:12,398 --> 03:01:17,278
they were putting them out but no you're

4262
03:01:15,359 --> 03:01:19,159
you're right and that's that's one of

4263
03:01:17,279 --> 03:01:20,720
sorry bger picture stuff this industry

4264
03:01:19,159 --> 03:01:23,680
you can just slap something together and

4265
03:01:20,719 --> 03:01:27,760
sell it there's nothing stopping people

4266
03:01:23,680 --> 03:01:29,159
from making bad products here at all uh

4267
03:01:27,760 --> 03:01:31,680
I don't know when that's going to change

4268
03:01:29,159 --> 03:01:34,879
but seems to be encouraged we got our

4269
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:38,200
first vaporizer from Ontario back in

4270
03:01:34,879 --> 03:01:41,119
probably the early 2000s and it was a

4271
03:01:38,200 --> 03:01:44,560
Botanical they sold it as a Botanical

4272
03:01:41,120 --> 03:01:48,279
vaporizer and they gave you a whole uh

4273
03:01:44,559 --> 03:01:50,840
catalog of lavender and basil and Mull

4274
03:01:48,279 --> 03:01:53,800
and mint and T all the different things

4275
03:01:50,840 --> 03:01:57,920
that you could smoke in it but it was

4276
03:01:53,799 --> 03:02:01,199
a kind of cylindrical shaped little unit

4277
03:01:57,920 --> 03:02:02,799
and it had a ceramic Bowl in it and I

4278
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:04,600
forget the name of the company at the

4279
03:02:02,799 --> 03:02:07,679
time but it was it was the first one

4280
03:02:04,600 --> 03:02:10,079
that we ever saw in the electronic form

4281
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:12,880
before the volcanoes and and some of

4282
03:02:10,079 --> 03:02:15,559
those earlier you know different you

4283
03:02:12,879 --> 03:02:18,559
know vaporizers that became popular the

4284
03:02:15,559 --> 03:02:21,760
volcano was before 2000

4285
03:02:18,559 --> 03:02:23,840
yeah oh yeah I met those guys in

4286
03:02:21,760 --> 03:02:26,559
Germany for some reason we didn't have

4287
03:02:23,840 --> 03:02:29,880
the volcano here and the cies early

4288
03:02:26,559 --> 03:02:31,879
2000s yeah I brought it to BC bro I

4289
03:02:29,879 --> 03:02:34,959
brought the volcano and the volcano

4290
03:02:31,879 --> 03:02:39,119
could be used for dabs you just put that

4291
03:02:34,959 --> 03:02:42,639
fat little uh Brill pad yeah the Brillo

4292
03:02:39,120 --> 03:02:44,920
pad exactly and my dry sift bubbled and

4293
03:02:42,639 --> 03:02:48,039
melted and Vaped

4294
03:02:44,920 --> 03:02:50,159
perfect yeah used to use like a a like

4295
03:02:48,040 --> 03:02:52,160
you're describing a a a bowl when we

4296
03:02:50,159 --> 03:02:54,600
drill on the top and put a tube in and

4297
03:02:52,159 --> 03:02:57,200
then take a soldering gun and then put a

4298
03:02:54,600 --> 03:02:59,079
metal piece on top of that and then put

4299
03:02:57,200 --> 03:03:02,359
the material on top of that and let it

4300
03:02:59,079 --> 03:03:05,920
Vapor I got turned on to vaporization in

4301
03:03:02,359 --> 03:03:08,680
95 first in Jamaica by a Rastafarian

4302
03:03:05,920 --> 03:03:10,439
Elder named red who showed me this very

4303
03:03:08,680 --> 03:03:12,880
simple method that they were using to

4304
03:03:10,439 --> 03:03:16,200
vaporize cannabis with which blew me

4305
03:03:12,879 --> 03:03:18,438
away and then the same year I I had a

4306
03:03:16,200 --> 03:03:20,960
booth at the Cannabis Cup next to Eagle

4307
03:03:18,439 --> 03:03:23,600
Bill and he had like the heat gun with

4308
03:03:20,959 --> 03:03:25,879
the with the quartz bowl and I was like

4309
03:03:23,600 --> 03:03:29,840
all right let's give this gun the stal

4310
03:03:25,879 --> 03:03:29,839
gun with the big like Stein

4311
03:03:30,478 --> 03:03:42,278
yeah saw was in 98 at Holy Smoke on a CO

4312
03:03:38,040 --> 03:03:45,840
first VAP I saw was

4313
03:03:42,279 --> 03:03:48,439
1985 in Santa Cruz California wow A

4314
03:03:45,840 --> 03:03:52,600
friend of mine named Chris card invented

4315
03:03:48,439 --> 03:03:56,840
it and it used a uh also a heat strip

4316
03:03:52,600 --> 03:04:00,680
gun to to function with a a big water

4317
03:03:56,840 --> 03:04:03,318
pipe and uh I had suggested to him that

4318
03:04:00,680 --> 03:04:06,318
we could get some sort of a small

4319
03:04:03,318 --> 03:04:10,559
microwave device to either microwave

4320
03:04:06,318 --> 03:04:12,959
buds or a hash or whatever and instead

4321
03:04:10,559 --> 03:04:15,680
of microwaves which he said wasn't

4322
03:04:12,959 --> 03:04:18,959
practical and small enough and wasn't

4323
03:04:15,680 --> 03:04:22,120
safe to use uh we we he came up with

4324
03:04:18,959 --> 03:04:24,839
this and uh yeah he spread it to all the

4325
03:04:22,120 --> 03:04:27,160
Buyers Clubs in California and then

4326
03:04:24,840 --> 03:04:29,238
eventually it it got around the world

4327
03:04:27,159 --> 03:04:30,279
and companies like volcano and others

4328
03:04:29,238 --> 03:04:33,799
got

4329
03:04:30,279 --> 03:04:37,359
involved Mark McCoy

4330
03:04:33,799 --> 03:04:39,679
too rtech made a actual glass connector

4331
03:04:37,359 --> 03:04:42,920
was a two-piece that you could actually

4332
03:04:39,680 --> 03:04:44,439
slip your uh hot air gun into and they

4333
03:04:42,920 --> 03:04:46,520
promoted the steinels and why the

4334
03:04:44,439 --> 03:04:49,600
steinels is because the steinels had a

4335
03:04:46,520 --> 03:04:52,479
ceramic core as opposed to a metal core

4336
03:04:49,600 --> 03:04:54,520
and no asbestos correct no asbestos so

4337
03:04:52,478 --> 03:04:56,358
you were inhaling and I used to roll

4338
03:04:54,520 --> 03:04:59,479
into parties with the rip Tech and a

4339
03:04:56,359 --> 03:05:01,279
bong and just destroy parties and then

4340
03:04:59,478 --> 03:05:03,358
quietly just disappear and people were

4341
03:05:01,279 --> 03:05:05,079
like what the [ __ ] just happened it was

4342
03:05:03,359 --> 03:05:06,800
same same I still have mine right over

4343
03:05:05,079 --> 03:05:09,238
here they were doing it with weed they

4344
03:05:06,799 --> 03:05:11,079
weren't doing it with hash right correct

4345
03:05:09,238 --> 03:05:13,799
we were only doing with weed we were not

4346
03:05:11,079 --> 03:05:15,639
doing with hash you are correct no no

4347
03:05:13,799 --> 03:05:17,719
way shape or form we even thinking about

4348
03:05:15,639 --> 03:05:19,879
hash because we had access to more

4349
03:05:17,719 --> 03:05:22,679
flower than anything again this is the

4350
03:05:19,879 --> 03:05:26,199
late 90s in LA and stuff like that so I

4351
03:05:22,680 --> 03:05:29,040
got one of the first uh machines the

4352
03:05:26,200 --> 03:05:31,420
original isolator machine uh when I

4353
03:05:29,040 --> 03:05:32,680
worked at the Galaxy gallery back in

4354
03:05:31,420 --> 03:05:38,159
[Music]

4355
03:05:32,680 --> 03:05:39,720
90 96 97 998 so and that's but that's

4356
03:05:38,159 --> 03:05:42,680
when we started playing with hash but

4357
03:05:39,719 --> 03:05:45,238
before then it was strictly just you

4358
03:05:42,680 --> 03:05:47,000
know what we could do with flour and

4359
03:05:45,238 --> 03:05:49,680
prior to that the only extent of a

4360
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:51,920
vaporized that I had heard of was that

4361
03:05:49,680 --> 03:05:53,680
cheap piece of [ __ ] that they sold in

4362
03:05:51,920 --> 03:05:55,719
head shops some friends of mine grabbed

4363
03:05:53,680 --> 03:05:57,279
when I was up in Pennsylvania they

4364
03:05:55,719 --> 03:06:00,238
grabbed at a head shop and it was a

4365
03:05:57,279 --> 03:06:02,600
plastic piece with a soldering iron with

4366
03:06:00,238 --> 03:06:06,478
a flat soldering you know kind of a

4367
03:06:02,600 --> 03:06:10,760
piece and a glass it the BC vaporizer

4368
03:06:06,478 --> 03:06:13,599
yeah it was just sold 12,000 of them or

4369
03:06:10,760 --> 03:06:15,398
something crazy it was the worst thing

4370
03:06:13,600 --> 03:06:17,200
ever we were so excited to try it once

4371
03:06:15,398 --> 03:06:18,680
we tried it it was like this thing is

4372
03:06:17,200 --> 03:06:20,920
awful

4373
03:06:18,680 --> 03:06:24,359
did you ever get to try the volatier

4374
03:06:20,920 --> 03:06:26,120
from David wheeler the small little wand

4375
03:06:24,359 --> 03:06:27,800
that fit into a quartz Bowl because

4376
03:06:26,120 --> 03:06:30,880
prior to that I was vaping with the

4377
03:06:27,799 --> 03:06:33,840
vriptech and I was condensing the oil in

4378
03:06:30,879 --> 03:06:35,799
the glass stem of the VTech bowl and it

4379
03:06:33,840 --> 03:06:37,880
would be a red oil and I would dab it

4380
03:06:35,799 --> 03:06:40,438
smoke it on SC a you know a little bit

4381
03:06:37,879 --> 03:06:42,839
of bubble or whatever and then this

4382
03:06:40,439 --> 03:06:44,639
volatier came out and The Whole Bowl was

4383
03:06:42,840 --> 03:06:46,398
quartz and it was the first quartz

4384
03:06:44,639 --> 03:06:49,199
vaporizer that I'd seen and what I

4385
03:06:46,398 --> 03:06:50,519
noticed was that the oil when it was

4386
03:06:49,200 --> 03:06:52,479
turned into a vapor and then

4387
03:06:50,520 --> 03:06:56,000
precipitated back into a liquid in the

4388
03:06:52,478 --> 03:06:59,199
stem of the quartz that it no longer uh

4389
03:06:56,000 --> 03:07:01,680
did that uh in into an orange or a red

4390
03:06:59,200 --> 03:07:04,840
liquid but it precipitated back into an

4391
03:07:01,680 --> 03:07:07,398
absolutely gold liquid and that was like

4392
03:07:04,840 --> 03:07:09,600
a huge sort of Revelation back in like

4393
03:07:07,398 --> 03:07:12,920
the you know the the late 90s or

4394
03:07:09,600 --> 03:07:17,800
whatever wow that's cool another thing

4395
03:07:12,920 --> 03:07:19,920
nice about the reflx is that they give

4396
03:07:17,799 --> 03:07:24,079
you this little

4397
03:07:19,920 --> 03:07:25,960
uh for the bowls well this is the Bowls

4398
03:07:24,079 --> 03:07:30,439
because even though they're glass jars

4399
03:07:25,959 --> 03:07:34,438
that what fits into the uh resc I mean

4400
03:07:30,439 --> 03:07:37,359
the reflux and it works uh really good

4401
03:07:34,439 --> 03:07:38,760
because you've always got a clean one

4402
03:07:37,359 --> 03:07:41,640
and

4403
03:07:38,760 --> 03:07:44,600
uh you you you could

4404
03:07:41,639 --> 03:07:48,879
see those ones are the used

4405
03:07:44,600 --> 03:07:52,640
ones these are unused

4406
03:07:48,879 --> 03:07:52,639
yeah that's sweet to have that many as

4407
03:07:53,478 --> 03:07:59,039
well yeah it's nice being able to

4408
03:07:55,639 --> 03:08:00,559
preload your full day if you want to I'm

4409
03:07:59,040 --> 03:08:03,239
figuring I'll probably go through 50

4410
03:08:00,559 --> 03:08:06,000
loads at the emerald Cup in a day

4411
03:08:03,238 --> 03:08:09,199
something like that just rapid fire oh

4412
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:12,200
my God you need a rotary feed like I

4413
03:08:09,200 --> 03:08:15,760
have on my gas chromatography it holds

4414
03:08:12,200 --> 03:08:18,880
96 little bottles oh like a revolver

4415
03:08:15,760 --> 03:08:20,639
that would be sweet

4416
03:08:18,879 --> 03:08:24,119
I gave out like a pound of oil at one of

4417
03:08:20,639 --> 03:08:25,639
the cannibis cups 50 loads might be low

4418
03:08:24,120 --> 03:08:29,720
yeah you gave it to me don't you

4419
03:08:25,639 --> 03:08:32,920
remember I gave it to like a thousand

4420
03:08:29,719 --> 03:08:36,599
people I just constantly changed my

4421
03:08:32,920 --> 03:08:39,719
clothing and got them all I used to give

4422
03:08:36,600 --> 03:08:41,880
around a 100 grams in Dabs out at the

4423
03:08:39,719 --> 03:08:44,438
Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam and I did it

4424
03:08:41,879 --> 03:08:46,559
for I don't know like a decade and a

4425
03:08:44,439 --> 03:08:48,600
half or something it end it ended up

4426
03:08:46,559 --> 03:08:51,398
being a fair chunk of of of hash for

4427
03:08:48,600 --> 03:08:54,399
sure to give away in death literally a

4428
03:08:51,398 --> 03:08:57,639
pound in a day at Legends we definitely

4429
03:08:54,398 --> 03:08:59,799
smoked more than a 100 grams oh gosh

4430
03:08:57,639 --> 03:09:01,599
yeah absolutely but it wasn't all mine I

4431
03:08:59,799 --> 03:09:03,478
wasn't gifting it to everyone although

4432
03:09:01,600 --> 03:09:05,840
the Legends in Vancouver was the first

4433
03:09:03,478 --> 03:09:09,760
couple Legends most of it was mine but

4434
03:09:05,840 --> 03:09:12,680
after that everybody had really great

4435
03:09:09,760 --> 03:09:14,478
stuff I'll tell you people uh you know

4436
03:09:12,680 --> 03:09:16,040
that's what Legends helped it helped

4437
03:09:14,478 --> 03:09:17,799
people step up and be like I want to

4438
03:09:16,040 --> 03:09:19,920
make cash like that like it just it

4439
03:09:17,799 --> 03:09:21,599
seemed like there needed to be a thing

4440
03:09:19,920 --> 03:09:23,760
it was just too it just there just

4441
03:09:21,600 --> 03:09:25,079
needed to be like a little light at the

4442
03:09:23,760 --> 03:09:26,600
end of the tunnel that people could

4443
03:09:25,079 --> 03:09:28,879
catch a glimpse of and be like you know

4444
03:09:26,600 --> 03:09:30,760
what I saw it I'm going for that I'm

4445
03:09:28,879 --> 03:09:33,119
gonna get there and then they start you

4446
03:09:30,760 --> 03:09:36,159
know growing exceptional cannabis and

4447
03:09:33,120 --> 03:09:39,200
processing exceptional hashes and I just

4448
03:09:36,159 --> 03:09:41,079
can't imagine go ahead no no please you

4449
03:09:39,200 --> 03:09:42,399
were talk you can't imagine what I was

4450
03:09:41,079 --> 03:09:44,439
just gonna I was just going to say how

4451
03:09:42,398 --> 03:09:46,000
many amazing people over the years I met

4452
03:09:44,439 --> 03:09:47,600
that just wanted to come to Legends and

4453
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:51,959
the original way to get a ticket to

4454
03:09:47,600 --> 03:09:51,960
Legends for me was to show me

4455
03:09:52,879 --> 03:10:00,799
that every timeo every time I no problem

4456
03:09:57,639 --> 03:10:04,799
I'll finish it for him the way to show

4457
03:10:00,799 --> 03:10:08,238
was to show really good hash to Marcus

4458
03:10:04,799 --> 03:10:10,639
and then he would let you in with that

4459
03:10:08,238 --> 03:10:12,600
entry yeah and I never took any of the

4460
03:10:10,639 --> 03:10:14,000
hash I never like smoked it I just would

4461
03:10:12,600 --> 03:10:16,880
look at it and be like yeah that hash

4462
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:19,600
should be in the room at Legends and

4463
03:10:16,879 --> 03:10:21,000
that's how that's cool room each year

4464
03:10:19,600 --> 03:10:22,800
and now look what it's going to and

4465
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:25,120
it'll just get bigger and so you know I

4466
03:10:22,799 --> 03:10:27,519
was just going to say it's nice to

4467
03:10:25,120 --> 03:10:29,760
recognize which we talked about before

4468
03:10:27,520 --> 03:10:31,720
was that the origins of you know hash

4469
03:10:29,760 --> 03:10:33,880
making and some some of the hash in like

4470
03:10:31,719 --> 03:10:37,278
Milana and India are just having just

4471
03:10:33,879 --> 03:10:40,039
such hard times right now so any way

4472
03:10:37,279 --> 03:10:42,600
that people can like learn about what's

4473
03:10:40,040 --> 03:10:46,239
happening in Milana and Himel predesh

4474
03:10:42,600 --> 03:10:48,200
and utara cond all the the mountainous

4475
03:10:46,238 --> 03:10:50,840
regions and parts of India you know

4476
03:10:48,200 --> 03:10:52,479
India's corporatizing their cannabis

4477
03:10:50,840 --> 03:10:55,960
right now like lots of other countries

4478

have in the world and origin cities and

4479
03:10:55,959 --> 03:11:01,839
origin hash making places in India right

4480
03:10:59,478 --> 03:11:05,719
now a lot of those families are going to

4481
03:11:01,840 --> 03:11:07,398

people all over the world in Strife so

4521
03:12:48,120 --> 03:12:54,479
yes we have been there and we years and

4522
03:12:51,040 --> 03:12:57,720
years ago the only country that was

4523
03:12:54,478 --> 03:13:03,920
making uh both hand

4524
03:12:57,719 --> 03:13:07,760
rubbed uh dry sift Gera and uh

4525
03:13:03,920 --> 03:13:10,120
uh was cashmir there was no other

4526
03:13:07,760 --> 03:13:13,000
country in the whole world Kashmir was

4527
03:13:10,120 --> 03:13:15,359
the first country to be making both

4528
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:17,879
types

4529
03:13:15,359 --> 03:13:21,800
commercially and now pakist stand just

4530
03:13:17,879 --> 03:13:24,438
legalized I hear and I heard Imran Khan

4531
03:13:21,799 --> 03:13:28,119
uh just like cut ribbons at a brand new

4532
03:13:24,439 --> 03:13:30,960
like you know open cannabis farm in

4533
03:13:28,120 --> 03:13:36,319
Pakistan and also did I hear right that

4534
03:13:30,959 --> 03:13:38,159
Dubai is now open to cannabis is there's

4535
03:13:36,318 --> 03:13:40,559
new laws passing in the world that are

4536
03:13:38,159 --> 03:13:41,398
pretty mindblowing that's nothing so so

4537
03:13:40,559 --> 03:13:44,159
has

4538
03:13:41,398 --> 03:13:47,639
Malaysia well that's the the connection

4539
03:13:44,159 --> 03:13:51,398
is like Dubai and and Malaysia making

4540
03:13:47,639 --> 03:13:53,639
and and I think the the queen of Dubai

4541
03:13:51,398 --> 03:13:56,159
potentially is working on like a CBD

4542
03:13:53,639 --> 03:13:57,760
product but then that could open up

4543
03:13:56,159 --> 03:14:00,238
Indonesia don't forget about don't

4544
03:13:57,760 --> 03:14:02,639
forget about Germany that's

4545
03:14:00,238 --> 03:14:04,760
huge well and then the seed companies

4546
03:14:02,639 --> 03:14:08,358
that got busted in Spain so there's like

4547
03:14:04,760 --> 03:14:10,639
a crazy you know uh you know bust that

4548
03:14:08,359 --> 03:14:13,720
happened in Spain and there's a huge

4549
03:14:10,639 --> 03:14:16,519
Seed Company transition happening in

4550
03:14:13,719 --> 03:14:18,000
Europe so Europe's really kind of it

4551
03:14:16,520 --> 03:14:20,800
feels like there's a lot of flux

4552
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:22,279
happening there at the moment I'm not

4553
03:14:20,799 --> 03:14:24,438
there obviously but we have a lot of

4554
03:14:22,279 --> 03:14:26,238
family over there and and and it's it

4555
03:14:24,439 --> 03:14:29,238
seems so yeah

4556
03:14:26,238 --> 03:14:29,238
Germany

4557
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:35,959
um when the seed bus happened I I I

4558
03:14:32,719 --> 03:14:40,199
could actually hear your voice uh Sam

4559
03:14:35,959 --> 03:14:40,199
saying well they broke International

4560
03:14:40,359 --> 03:14:47,079
laws yes well they did but the real

4561
03:14:43,680 --> 03:14:50,079
problem I think down there was I'm not

4562
03:14:47,079 --> 03:14:54,039
exactly sure of the circumstances but uh

4563
03:14:50,079 --> 03:14:57,520
it's not legal to cultivate in Spain for

4564
03:14:54,040 --> 03:15:00,040
seeds or for weed to sell unless you're

4565
03:14:57,520 --> 03:15:01,680
licensed by the government and none of

4566
03:15:00,040 --> 03:15:03,920
those companies were licensed by the

4567
03:15:01,680 --> 03:15:06,040
government got it so I'm guessing lag

4568
03:15:03,920 --> 03:15:08,040
Guardia like ran through their [ __ ] is

4569
03:15:06,040 --> 03:15:10,520
that what

4570
03:15:08,040 --> 03:15:12,800
happened I'm not sure exactly what

4571
03:15:10,520 --> 03:15:13,640
happened in Spain except for that there

4572
03:15:12,799 --> 03:15:17,278
was

4573
03:15:13,639 --> 03:15:19,439
a a big mixup

4574
03:15:17,279 --> 03:15:21,238
so I was told it was Federal their

4575
03:15:19,439 --> 03:15:23,880
version of federal agents I don't know

4576
03:15:21,238 --> 03:15:26,760
what that really you know what that

4577
03:15:23,879 --> 03:15:29,398
looks like but um I know that the court

4578
03:15:26,760 --> 03:15:33,359
case that they're in right now over over

4579
03:15:29,398 --> 03:15:36,519
it um it is definitely a potential you

4580
03:15:33,359 --> 03:15:38,520
know transformation of European laws we

4581
03:15:36,520 --> 03:15:40,720
know it because it is such a you know a

4582
03:15:38,520 --> 03:15:43,479
big court case and there's there's

4583
03:15:40,719 --> 03:15:45,318
pretty large seed companies involved so

4584
03:15:43,478 --> 03:15:48,238
you know I hope it all works out you

4585
03:15:45,318 --> 03:15:50,519
know in favor for the companies involved

4586
03:15:48,238 --> 03:15:54,198
in there because some of them are close

4587
03:15:50,520 --> 03:15:56,279
pretty close friends with ours so

4588
03:15:54,199 --> 03:15:59,439
yeah that's a

4589
03:15:56,279 --> 03:16:02,960
shame I I don't think any of the seed

4590
03:15:59,439 --> 03:16:05,000
companies selling seeds from Spain the

4591
03:16:02,959 --> 03:16:07,238
research companies are licensed but I

4592
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:09,520
don't think any of the seed companies

4593
03:16:07,238 --> 03:16:11,359
selling commercially are actually

4594
03:16:09,520 --> 03:16:13,520
licensed by the government to produce

4595
03:16:11,359 --> 03:16:15,479
their seeds I could be wrong but I don't

4596
03:16:13,520 --> 03:16:18,238
think

4597
03:16:15,478 --> 03:16:20,719
so seems like a big open space that

4598
03:16:18,238 --> 03:16:22,478
nobody's filling I guess they just well

4599
03:16:20,719 --> 03:16:25,079
no that's why they went down to Spain to

4600
03:16:22,478 --> 03:16:27,879
get out of Holland

4601
03:16:25,079 --> 03:16:30,760
and and then they didn't follow all the

4602
03:16:27,879 --> 03:16:34,759
Spanish rules because see you could sell

4603
03:16:30,760 --> 03:16:37,559
seeds from Spain but you cannot you have

4604
03:16:34,760 --> 03:16:39,960
to have a place you produce them and if

4605
03:16:37,559 --> 03:16:41,639
you produce them in Spain you have to be

4606
03:16:39,959 --> 03:16:44,000
licensed by the

4607
03:16:41,639 --> 03:16:45,840
government but what about

4608
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:48,359
Portugal I don't know what the

4609
03:16:45,840 --> 03:16:52,600
regulations in Port go are to be

4610
03:16:48,359 --> 03:16:52,600
honest I got a feeling they're a lot

4611
03:16:53,279 --> 03:16:59,680
looser yeah under the impression a lot

4612
03:16:55,879 --> 03:17:02,079
of people are doing it through Portugal

4613
03:16:59,680 --> 03:17:04,199
but I don't really

4614
03:17:02,079 --> 03:17:06,318
know well it's drugs have been

4615
03:17:04,199 --> 03:17:08,920
decriminalized there right all drugs

4616
03:17:06,318 --> 03:17:12,159
yeah I'm heading there in July so I'll

4617
03:17:08,920 --> 03:17:16,359
ask around you have a

4618
03:17:12,159 --> 03:17:19,719
mission yeah it's simpu points for what

4619
03:17:16,359 --> 03:17:22,880
kind legal to grow

4620
03:17:19,719 --> 03:17:25,599
cannabis is it legal to grow cannabis in

4621
03:17:22,879 --> 03:17:28,959
Portugal for seed production that's the

4622
03:17:25,600 --> 03:17:28,960
question and I have no

4623
03:17:33,159 --> 03:17:39,799
idea no one does I was gonna say that I

4624
03:17:36,920 --> 03:17:43,159
don't think anybody know when I moved to

4625
03:17:39,799 --> 03:17:46,039
Holland it was you could grow in green

4626
03:17:43,159 --> 03:17:49,279
houses and as long as you did not divert

4627
03:17:46,040 --> 03:17:52,880
the cannabis to Illegal markets the seed

4628
03:17:49,279 --> 03:17:56,600
production was legal that was till about

4629
03:17:52,879 --> 03:18:00,398
1998 or 99 I think they changed the

4630
03:17:56,600 --> 03:18:03,040
law I think Switzer Switzerland has um

4631
03:18:00,398 --> 03:18:05,238
areas where you know it has favorable

4632
03:18:03,040 --> 03:18:07,560
laws and and we want to shout up our

4633
03:18:05,238 --> 03:18:09,639
Switzerland family out there the elel

4634
03:18:07,559 --> 03:18:13,198
green Swiss farm and everyone out there

4635
03:18:09,639 --> 03:18:15,159
doing amazing work you know um yeah

4636
03:18:13,199 --> 03:18:17,319
there there are jurisdictions that are

4637
03:18:15,159 --> 03:18:19,959
that are you know doing well

4638
03:18:17,318 --> 03:18:23,039
um and also I know that always people

4639
03:18:19,959 --> 03:18:25,039
are looking for a better spot so well I

4640
03:18:23,040 --> 03:18:27,600
know a couple I know a couple Swiss

4641
03:18:25,040 --> 03:18:31,000
breeders who have now moved into the US

4642
03:18:27,600 --> 03:18:32,279
there's one big breeder down in uh

4643
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:36,398
Oregon

4644
03:18:32,279 --> 03:18:38,600
somewhere uh with high CVG and a lot of

4645
03:18:36,398 --> 03:18:41,719
different varieties but they originated

4646
03:18:38,600 --> 03:18:43,840
in Switzerland I think uh maybe part of

4647
03:18:41,719 --> 03:18:45,799
the regulation that we're uh dancing

4648
03:18:43,840 --> 03:18:48,478
around here is the fact that they

4649
03:18:45,799 --> 03:18:51,438
couldn't have a decent seed export

4650
03:18:48,478 --> 03:18:53,599
business so they set up here in the US

4651
03:18:51,439 --> 03:18:55,960
and are now producing seeds here in the

4652
03:18:53,600 --> 03:18:57,559
US yeah and what they have a because

4653
03:18:55,959 --> 03:19:00,039
they want to sell into

4654
03:18:57,559 --> 03:19:02,398
US yeah they want to sell into the US

4655
03:19:00,040 --> 03:19:05,479
and Canada and elsewhere and they can

4656
03:19:02,398 --> 03:19:08,318
produce seeds in the US and I know that

4657
03:19:05,478 --> 03:19:10,760
they're crushing the genetic backgrounds

4658
03:19:08,318 --> 03:19:13,559
for that Swiss material Came From Italy

4659
03:19:10,760 --> 03:19:15,159
if it's what I'm thinking of interesting

4660
03:19:13,559 --> 03:19:18,439
I think you're correct I think that's

4661
03:19:15,159 --> 03:19:18,439
right Sam

4662
03:19:18,879 --> 03:19:23,079
I have info on Portugal according to the

4663
03:19:20,520 --> 03:19:25,720
internet yeah I just found some

4664
03:19:23,079 --> 03:19:28,799
too uh still illegal to grow but they

4665
03:19:25,719 --> 03:19:30,358
have Industrial Hemp law and most likely

4666
03:19:28,799 --> 03:19:33,039
any relevant seeds would have to come

4667
03:19:30,359 --> 03:19:34,960
from a plant that you can't legally grow

4668
03:19:33,040 --> 03:19:36,720
unless you found some way to get a THC

4669
03:19:34,959 --> 03:19:39,559
bearing strain through the industrial

4670
03:19:36,719 --> 03:19:40,760
hemp regulations so it looks like

4671
03:19:39,559 --> 03:19:44,278
there's a lot of stuff in flux in

4672
03:19:40,760 --> 03:19:46,880
Portugal we we we were talking uh to a

4673
03:19:44,279 --> 03:19:50,399
guy on Adam dun show the other day about

4674
03:19:46,879 --> 03:19:51,679
about um tissue culture and does tissue

4675
03:19:50,398 --> 03:19:55,159
culture get

4676
03:19:51,680 --> 03:19:57,880
around this the regulation on

4677
03:19:55,159 --> 03:19:59,920
seeds um probably not because a lot of

4678
03:19:57,879 --> 03:20:01,119
the regulation is not just seeds but

4679
03:19:59,920 --> 03:20:03,639
like in Portugal for example it's

4680
03:20:01,120 --> 03:20:07,160
illegal to grow

4681
03:20:03,639 --> 03:20:09,599
period so like a plant germ plasma yeah

4682
03:20:07,159 --> 03:20:13,398
like germ plasma would probably still be

4683
03:20:09,600 --> 03:20:15,120
considered considered yeah illegal okay

4684
03:20:13,398 --> 03:20:18,358
you get into some really interesting

4685
03:20:15,120 --> 03:20:20,359
illegal but the plant itself if it's a

4686
03:20:18,359 --> 03:20:23,159
little mini clone or grown through

4687
03:20:20,359 --> 03:20:25,920
cellular culture is illegal in most

4688
03:20:23,159 --> 03:20:27,600
countries in the world yeah but I mean

4689
03:20:25,920 --> 03:20:30,680
like some some of these things are just

4690
03:20:27,600 --> 03:20:32,359
sort of like it's like a little sachche

4691
03:20:30,680 --> 03:20:34,880
I think these things are usually filled

4692
03:20:32,359 --> 03:20:37,040
with Al genic acid and it's just a

4693
03:20:34,879 --> 03:20:40,079
basically a piece of meisam I mean you'd

4694
03:20:37,040 --> 03:20:43,199
have to do some microscopic analysis to

4695
03:20:40,079 --> 03:20:46,879
determine that it was Cannabis or

4696
03:20:43,199 --> 03:20:48,399
H yes but if that was done then it would

4697
03:20:46,879 --> 03:20:50,839
be

4698
03:20:48,398 --> 03:20:52,879
illegal so someone just asked in the

4699
03:20:50,840 --> 03:20:54,920
chat you know Oregon CBD company they're

4700
03:20:52,879 --> 03:20:57,119
working with university university out

4701
03:20:54,920 --> 03:20:59,079
of Mississippi or something they're

4702
03:20:57,120 --> 03:21:01,439
saying or just a university I don't

4703
03:20:59,079 --> 03:21:03,600
think it's Mississippi but um I would

4704
03:21:01,439 --> 03:21:05,520
believe that's under the the federal

4705
03:21:03,600 --> 03:21:08,399
guidelines of the hemp bill right yeah

4706
03:21:05,520 --> 03:21:11,680
that would be under Dr L solle at Oxford

4707
03:21:08,398 --> 03:21:13,920
University correct got it Oxford

4708
