When you in my zone,

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,480
hold live in the garden. When you in my

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,560
zone, smoke sessions. Yo, pass me the

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,160
mic,

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,000
homie. Pass me the mic like it's a

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,560
blunt. I'mma light up these lyrics and

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,640
spit the fun. 5K Lou Bass was shaking in

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,719
my trunk. He broke the beat down, made

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,039
the crowd jump. I'm dope. Came here to

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,280
get you all lifted. Coming off of the

15
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,439
top, it's unscripted. Hit this, hold it

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,520
in, then exhale. Grow with the great

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,679
white shake. Kill a whale. It's blow

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,000
bomb. Get this on where the party stay

19
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,000
popping from dust to dawn. Squares get

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,238
gone. Make room. We here. Came stepping

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,079
through the door in my custom gear. All

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,479
in the air. Now we about to roll. Keep

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,640
it live in the garden where Ganji grows.

24
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,640
Light up the dank when I'm mando dope

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,558
and leave the microphone. Smoke when you

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,198
in my zone. Going to get you high. I'm

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,679
going to get you lifted. Lifted when you

28
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,359
in my zone. I get a lost in a smoke

29
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:09,200
cloud. Hit this. When you in my zone, my

30
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,920
mic's like a blunt. When I ripped it,

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,240
ripped it. When you in my zone, I get

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,240
them lost in a smoke cloud. Hit

33
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,239
this.

34
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:25,840
I'm down.

37
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,319
When you in my zone, going to get you

38
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:41,478
high. Going to get you lifted. When you

39
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:44,798
in my zone, I get them lost in a smoke

40
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:47,679
cloud. When you in my zone, my mic's

41
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,000
like a blunt when I rip it. When you in

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,159
my zone, I get them lost in a smoke

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,078
cloud. Hit

44
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,159
this. Now, I still got more to blow. I

45
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,478
ain't done. Lyrics that flow and roll

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,560
off the tongue. Smoke in my lungs. My

47
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,640
crew's blazing. If you love weed, let me

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,200
see your hands raising. Light it up.

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,920
Rotate the tank my way. Jarfield and I'm

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,679
ready for the Friday night. Feeling the

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,360
groove. That's when she asked, "Are you

52
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,439
still in the mood?" I'm like, "Yep."

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,520
Step out back and get tacked. Burn the

54
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,079
whole sack. Spit some old raps. Catch

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,239
the contact when I bust a rhyme. West

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,879
MC's up one at a time at a time. My

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,640
zone's homegrown. I'm so laced with the

58
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,318
game. And I was taught in the old days.

59
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,639
I'm putting weed in the air for the

60
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,799
folks. Burn the mic to a roast. When you

61
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,679
in my zone, going to get you high. Going

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,080

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,680

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,440
Hit this. When you in my zone, my mic's

65
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,239
like a blunt when I ripped it. Ripped

66
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,919
it. When you in my zone, I get them lost

67
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:52,030
in a smoke cloud. Hit this.
