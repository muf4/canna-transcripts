00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,079
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:27,839
uh today I wanted to take you guys

4
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:31,678
through a little bit of a uh I guess a

5
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:34,679
pre-review of the new sasquash Rosen

6
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:37,640
press that I got from the sasquash Rosen

7
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:41,238
Press Company uh owned by of course soil

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,878
grown s um Philip Phil uh if you check

9
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:47,959
out Instagram soil grown

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,558
_ solventless soil grown solventless I

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,239
believe is his name um has these

12
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,358
incredible presses that he's come to

13
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:58,198
design of course we all know soil grown

14
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,198
for his popularizing of the um rosin

15
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,159
method and really for taking taking it

16
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:05,798
to the next level and bringing and

17
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,399
creating uh flower rosin before uh the

18
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,680
first time I'd heard of rosin was only

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,320
from hash it wasn't as exciting um there

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,439
wasn't an easy way to do it it was a bit

21
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,359
of a pain in the ass and so Phil really

22
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:18,758
brought it to the next level and created

23
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:20,879
his soil grown brand and he created his

24
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,799
sasquash Rosen press which he's uh

25
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,118
operating that company with some of his

26
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,720
cousins I believe and they're just a

27
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,959
great crew of guys that are just looking

28
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,039
to better the movement they're

29
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,599
definitely don't have some horrible

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,118
agenda of trying to take advantage of

31
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,359
people they're ready to learn and

32
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,920
they're they're looking to share their

33
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:40,438
education in a good quality product I

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,079
was lucky enough to get one customized

35
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,158
plates beautiful plates I'll tell you a

36
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:48,118
little bit about the unit um it

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,840
comes uh with a nice 20 ton jack um I've

38
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:55,399
hooked it up to the DeWalt 15

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,640
ton uh 2ou uh 200 PSI air compressor

40
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,519
very inexpensive it was about

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,840
$300 for this big ass um air compressor

42
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,560
and the unit is great it's uh the bottom

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,600
plate is the heated unit and the reason

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,640
they went with a one heated plate was

45
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,239
that um the plates are so big and they

46
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,000
hold the temperature so well that once

47
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,120
you get both plates up to temperature

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,318
and I'll tell you how to do that in

49
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,879
about a second they hold the temperature

50
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:22,679
really well and for a good chunk of time

51
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:24,719
so the bottom plate is impeccably wired

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,640
it's it heats up beautifully it's got a

53
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,359
real nice uh uh digital readout you can

54
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:31,799
control any temperature that you want to

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,400
put into to the decimal point and what

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,280
we do is um which which is what soil

57
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,159
grown told me personally to do which was

58
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,039
to bring the bottom plate up to

59
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,479
temperature with the top plate hovering

60
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,479
half an inch or so above and once you

61
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:48,238
get that bottom plate up to temperature

62
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,000
lower the plates so they touch and in

63
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,239
the touching you basically will heat

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,800
your second plate uh you can leave this

65
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,280
thing on all throughout the day so this

66
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,760
would really be only something that you

67
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,878
would do in the morning as you were

68
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,719
starting your day if it was a work tool

69
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,840
that you were using Comm commercially

70
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,280
I'm using it just personally but I still

71
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,080
come in the morning and I turn it on and

72
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,680
I leave it on all day um we did talk a

73
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,640
little bit about how long it takes for

74
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,560
the plates to heat up I found that for

75
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,639
me it took about 15 minutes uh soil

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,680
grown said that it can take up to 30 or

77
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,279
40 minutes if it's a real cold morning

78
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,360
and you go out to your shop and you turn

79
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,000
them on and they're really cold so I

80
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,040
didn't experience that it was very nice

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,959
out around 70° and I found in a 70°

82
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,479
temperature they were able to heat up

83
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,360
within 15 minutes and get to

84
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,479
temperature um he's told me that he's

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,439
used a little laser uh temperature um

86
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,000
gate uh to to read out the temperature

87
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:43,239
thermometer and he said his press plates

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,400
have been in within one degree of the

89
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,000
actual temperature so nice accuracy

90
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,280
there uh overall it's a nice little unit

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,400
it's extremely heavy I wouldn't suggest

92
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,318
trying to use uh lift the unit by itself

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,560
but he did put on two nice big handles

94
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,318
at the top that makes it

95
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,759
possible and uh yeah I mean what else

96
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,039
can I say about this thing other than

97
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,120
let me show you some of the footage of

98
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:09,120
what we did the other day we used some

99
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,719
sweet skunk uh bubble hash which I'll

100
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,480
show you right now uh as you can see the

101
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,839
quality uh isn't the top top quality but

102
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,079
it's definitely not too bad all right so

103
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,039
this is the sweet skunk 73 Micron that

104
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,360
we're pressing it's a it's like a three

105
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:29,120
3.5 star has a great bouquet to it the

106
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,199
nose but uh it is pushing out the most

107
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,399
golden delicious

108
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,759
rosin all right so what I didn't show on

109
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,478
camera yesterday which was the

110
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,759
preparation I'm sure the majority of you

111
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:44,360
guys understand and know and so I wanted

112
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,360
to show you uh really simply you know

113
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,038
for those of you that are going to

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,038
wonder and haven't seen my other videos

115
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,120
uh I take uh one of these little screens

116
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:53,879
these are some from from soil grown that

117
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,560
he sent me he sent me a nice big swack

118
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:57,719
of these screens shout out to those guys

119
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,240
for that and what I usually do is I use

120
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,960
a sticker or usually I use a business

121
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,800
card and I get it into there just like

122
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,519
that and you can easily scoop bubble

123
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,079
hash out and what we did was we put

124
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:16,560
about

125
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:18,439
six to 8 G in each one my buddy had them

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,280
substantially thicker so I thinned them

127
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:24,199
out I rather would I would rather do a

128
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:27,638
long a big flat surface area uh than one

129
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,520
that's too fat and thick so a way to up

130
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,720
your numbers is to Simply uh um you can

131
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,560
really see this this one had a little

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,759
bit of a blowout and you can see that

133
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,918
the stuff that's remaining is really

134
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:44,520
just uh not even like hash anymore it's

135
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:46,918
just a powdery sort of talcum powdery

136
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,519
stuff good for who knows what maybe a

137
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,399
coconut oil extract it would definitely

138
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:52,839
be interesting to see these get tested

139
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,239
for canabo and turpine profile to see

140
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:57,119
what gets left behind if anything I'm

141
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,160
sure there's a percentage of canabo I'm

142
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,879
sure there's even a percentage of tpin

143
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,439
um and that's it I guess we'll finish it

144
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:07,478
off with some money shots of the OG and

145
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,120
the sweet skunk that we pressed you can

146
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:11,918
see in the videos that I'm a Noob I

147
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,800
wanted to see the waterfall effect and

148
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,240
wasn't quite sure how far back I had to

149
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,960
leave the little packet so the packet

150
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,680
slid forward each time with the hash

151
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,198
bulbing out of the two presses uh this

152
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,639
is a dangerous game because you can

153
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,520
breach uh your screen get a blowout uh a

154
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,960
cut and then that is is obviously going

155
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:32,639
to contaminate your Hash a few times we

156
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,159
actually thought it had happened when it

157
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,000
hadn't just from the bubbles in the

158
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,960
rosin creating a darker strip down the

159
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,800
middle we assumed it was some black uh

160
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,918
from hash that was coming out from the

161
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,560
inside but on a few occasions it was not

162
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:48,799
the case so just a short little video

163
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,639
I'm going to get a lot better I want to

164
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,079

165
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,598
at the press and showing the whole

166
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,719
process but this just uh this just lets

167

with some OG cush three star bubble hash

181
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,840
8 G in the pouch go down a little bit

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,560
like real slow and

183
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:51,119
gentle kind of pre- Squish

184
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,918
it wait like two or 3 seconds and then

185
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,720
squish

186
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:56,719
o glad that didn't blow

187
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:01,319

empty now bro oh is that nice looking

194
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,039
resin dude are you kidding

195
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
me

196
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:34,320
here we

197
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,639
go wow you can see it come out as you

198
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,640
click

199
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,799
more put that darkness in it again I

200
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,560
hope we didn't blow

201
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,559
it looks like it though

202
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,879
way not too bad I kind of just

203
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
dissipated

204
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,759
looks

205
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:22,278
[Music]

206
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:24,799
okay you can see the absolute stunning

207
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:27,000
quality of this resin uh it's just

208
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,719
dripped beautifully I didn't show you

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,559
but it's literally as hard as a rock now

210
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,800
I could peel these little pieces off

211
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,838
pretty good lots of tiny little air

212
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,519
bubbles which makes for really nice

213
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,839
macro photographs I'm not going to lie

214
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,399
we were extremely happy with how this

215
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,279
press turned out this was the OG Kush

216
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,519
three star keep in mind and we were

217
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:50,799
getting over 50% yields that's pretty

218
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,240
impressive for three

219
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:57,879
star so next up we have the sweet skunk

220
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,120
this was like a 3.5 close to a four star

221
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:04,879
um we wrapped it up did a about 7 G I do

222
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,480
believe um got the Patty pushed in far

223
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,480
enough this time so we didn't have the

224
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,399
near

225
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,360
blowout uh listening to soil gr's tip

226
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,320
which was to reduce the plates to the

227
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,278
point where they're just about squishing

228
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,879
where you can see now the oil just just

229
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,838
starting to come out of the lip of the

230
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,958
screen give it a couple of more and you

231
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,320
see the oil actually start dripping and

232
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,799
uh we used a little bit lower of a PSI

233
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,040
on this one the color was just

234
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:35,879
phenomenal both of us actually laughed

235
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,559
at this point in the video uh as we were

236
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:42,039
filming it because the color was just so

237
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:45,239
beautiful even with uh the 250°

238
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:47,399
temperature and pressing for quite a

239
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,200
long time I mean you can I don't know if

240
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,679
it was a 15sec or even potentially a 20

241
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,560
second press but it was longer than I

242
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,479
normally pressed because of the lack of

243
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,518
pressure it wasn't pushing it all out it

244
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,440
was kind of sitting there I also didn't

245
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:04,839
realize a lot of the resin was um going

246
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,360
out the backside of the area when we

247
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,519
opened it up there was a nice squish all

248
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,519
the way around the screen as you can see

249
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,120
here as we open up these plates and and

250
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,240
uh get that parchment open up you can

251
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,959
see it squished all the way around and

252
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,039
uh the patty just fell right out with

253
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,679
the screen the resin was just beautiful

254
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:27,519
to collect uh you can see it here coming

255
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:30,759
up in a second um I managed to just grab

256
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,078
one section of it with my Dabber and it

257
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:36,519
just peeled off beautifully you can see

258
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:39,319
it here there's a nice dab I would say

259
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:42,879
very nice color very nice taste it's got

260
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,800
that extreme strong spicy exotic Haze

261
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:48,480
taste that I love so

262
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,799
much I'll give it a squish okay so this

263
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,600
is the last press that we're going to

264
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,240
share with you here this was a near

265
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,839
blowout I once again left the packet too

266
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,159
close to the edge of the press and you

267
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,600
can see that dark piece that's pushing

268
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,958
out in the center

269
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,920
is actually the screen it's not really

270
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,599
ideal or how you want to do it but I was

271
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,639
already committed and the rosin was

272
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,680
coming out uh quite lovely to the amount

273
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,720
you know this is a s g of hash second

274
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,919
run we were getting quite nice

275
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,240
returns upwards the

276
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:22,278
70 which is very high for a three star

277
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,360
and even a 3.5 and it's kind of why I

278
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:27,078
was hinting that it could be potentially

279
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,800
close even though the Melt Factor wasn't

280
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:33,000
there uh the resin uh is was

281
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,799
definitely inside those gland heads

282
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,600
there's a nice big clear Dome popping up

283
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:40,278
and that's all she wrote we're going to

284
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,879
pull this off and collect it share you

285
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:45,159
one last little clip of some rosin

286
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:48,480
dripping down the screen in a nice

287
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,958
closeup here's that drip drip drip and I

288
