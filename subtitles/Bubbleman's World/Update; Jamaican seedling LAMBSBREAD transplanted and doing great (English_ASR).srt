00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,639
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:07,640
doing a Little Seedling Jamaican Lamb's

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:09,919
bread update for you so she's doing just

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,080
great um she was planted at the exact

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:16,519
same time as the hash plants and you can

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,278
see the difference in growth on both of

7
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:22,239
them for that matter they're just not

8
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:24,000
nearly as strong or as fast growing

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,118
could mean that I have a male knock

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,640
going to complain hoppy with a male I'll

11
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:29,239
pollinate some strains that I have and

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,719
we'll still get to try these genetics

13
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:34,799
but of course like every grower on the

14
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,119
planet I'm kind of wishing for a female

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,238
I'm not a breeder every breeder would

16
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:41,280
wish for a male but I'm wishing for a

17
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,640
female so anyway the update today she's

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,120
ready to get out of this little pot yes

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,320
I'm calling her a

20
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,878
she

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,799
absolutely

22
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:54,878
so just going to give her a little bit

23
00:00:50,799 --> 00:01:00,000
of a moist moistening she was pretty

24
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:01,718
dry let that soak in a little bit and

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
we're going to go right into this one G

26
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:07,000
pot that I have I don't have um a ton of

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
room right now for this but I am making

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,640
room with it in uh under my light until

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,680
I get back and I can get my new tent

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,599
going and whatnot I'll have much more

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,640
room but for now one gallon for the

32
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,839
first week of this little seedlings

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,759
transplant life I think that it'll be

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,640
okay I've got the one gallons the 3 Gall

35
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,840
and the 5 Gall pots so I've got all the

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,840
bases

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
covered

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,159
all right oh nice nice little rooting

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,759
system for a for a two we old clone or

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:47,079
seedling I should

41
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:50,960
say okay so we'll get that down nice and

42
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:54,000
set just get our Earth back in there our

43
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,000
soiless I should

44
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:01,159
say just uh yeah this plant was probably

45
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,839
ready ready the transplant a little

46
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,118
while ago and I didn't really realize it

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,439
so I was a little bit surprised at the

48
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:11,639
health of the roots on the bottom there

49
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,878
I'm uh impressed with these genetics so

50
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,919
far it was another thing that I did with

51
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:17,359
this one John was over and he said uh

52
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,280
you know that Jamaican seedling needs

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,800
some sun man so he

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,000
uh he got me to put it outside and I did

55
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,920
I listened it wasn't too too old but I

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,759
thought you know what you're right it's

57
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:31,119
a Jamaican genetics it's probably so

58
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,159
used to the hot hot sun and I'll tell

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,280
you the minute I put this thing outside

60
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,598
it just it exploded and yes to answer

61
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,120
your question I did put the other ones

62
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,839
outside as well um they just did not

63
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,879
explode on the same

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,120
level so there we go our Jamaican Lambs

65
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,518
bread hybrid I believe I don't believe

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,439
it was a pure pure sativa I think that

67
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,039
it had some cross in it with that Oregon

68
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,318
strain that I've

69
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,598
mentioned anyway there she blows guys

70
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:03,000
and

71
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:05,560
girls Jamaican Lamb's bread

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,919
transplanted so keep an eye out for this

73
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,039
little girl or guy she's going to be

74
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,199
very documented throughout her whole

75
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:15,759
life thanks for

76
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:15,759
watching peace
