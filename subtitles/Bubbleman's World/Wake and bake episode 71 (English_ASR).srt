doing really well today I'm telling you

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,939
I'm feeling pretty good just went and

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,179
picked up my mom's at the airport she's

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,800
in for a week visiting me and my family

11
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:28,140
so it won't be a long one today as

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,269
literally I had to run in shows my

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,340
commitment to you guys I have not even

14
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:33,509
spent time really with my mother aside

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,489
from the drive back from the airport

16
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:37,409
she's in the other room hanging out with

17
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:40,799
my family and I'm in here hanging out

18
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:42,659
with you guys ready to give out a hat

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,759
this is a nice little hat everyone

20
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:47,099
should guess because you know what it's

21
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,539
an easy one it'll fit any head I mean

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,939
unless you've got some giant huge

23
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,820
monstrous head or some real super tiny

24
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,769
small head maybe it wouldn't fit but in

25
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,799
the mean time this was sent to me by the

26
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,739
good folks at SMB suppliers not buyers

27
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,920
kind of reminds me of HQ and barcelona's

28
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:07,739
leaders not dealers we are leaders not

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,420
dealers I like that sort of thing but so

30
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,069
yeah nice little hat I really like the

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,290
style I definitely could have kept this

32
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:16,228
hat I like the gray and the black it's

33
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,118
it's a decent hat for sure so we're

34
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:20,579
gonna give this one away and we are

35
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,438
going to ask the question right away so

36
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,709
the video for today it's got a video

37
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:29,938
with Chris Bennett and it is called

38
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:32,368
boosted boarding in Vancouver with Chris

39
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,529
Bennett no it's not fitted octel Tom I

40
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:38,188
literally just showed the whole hat and

41
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,560
if you notice on the back I said that

42
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:42,539
you can actually change the size so it's

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,560
not fitted it's actually the opposite of

44
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:49,290
a fitted hat Oh anyway let's get on with

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,659
the video the video is boosted boarding

46
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,310
in Vancouver with Chris Bennett the

47
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,368
video is oh don't worry about it octo

48
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,409
Tom I'm happy to answer and show it

49
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:00,450
again it's a snapback exactly Ike Jones

50
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,490
so the video with Chris Bennett it

51
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,189
starts in the truck it's about five plus

52
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,349
minutes in the truck and then we go out

53
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:09,598
onto the boosted boards I just want you

54
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,189
to tell me I doubt anyone's gonna know

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,439
the song name so if you could just tell

56
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:15,919
me the artist that is singing the

57
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,810
in that video right at the start when we

58
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,689
leave the truck and go boosted boardings

59
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,750

81
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:18,569
diamonds of course herkimer's are called

82
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,259
herkimer's because they're from Herkimer

83

New York

84
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:23,729
these are Herkimer diamonds that were

85
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:25,050
not found in Herkimer New York so

86
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:27,810
they're a little double terminated

87
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,550
quartz crystals they're very small just

88
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,110

because Terps can only go in Canada I'm

104
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:19,230
not allowed to ship them out of the

105
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:21,839

106
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:25,590

107

110
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,699
everyone know you're gonna have a good

111
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:37,580
question we're gonna do a really good

112
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,579
good contest in the next two days

113
00:04:53,410 --> 00:05:00,920
all righty all righty

114
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:06,099
a little bit of Chas over there I love

115
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:14,530
the method of dumping the the cleaner in

116
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:18,560
like this and you see it foaming up pop

117
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:27,919
and then the bowl just cleans so nice

118
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:33,889
afterwards cleaning out the Chazz that

119
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:37,009
was a good rip little bit hot but she

120
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:40,699
cleaned real nice always happy when she

121
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:42,289
cleans real nice get rid of the chair so

122
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,939
there's a tiny little bit there let's

123
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,569
see if we can't get a little liquid on

124
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:49,250
there so I hope everyone is doing well

125
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:50,569
oh it was on the outside interesting

126
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,339
every once in a while when you do that

127
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:55,189
method that I do it pushes everything

128
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:57,769
out on to the outside so when you can't

129
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,839
quite get it clean you can go to the

130
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:05,029
outside because a little bit might have

131
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:07,459
gotten onto the outside all right ain't

132
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:09,439

167
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:32,379
with that a lot of stuff going on right

168
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,110
now between our Jamaican projects

169
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:38,319
between California between Canada and

170
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,720
the Ron and greenhouse project I got so

171
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,889
much going on that I don't even know

172
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,390
really where to begin

173
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:48,669
so what should we talk about today live

174
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:51,279
stream making bubble yeah you know Brett

175
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:54,340
it's an idea for sure I could do it I

176
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,989
also like the idea of really filming and

177
00:07:54,339 --> 00:08:00,399
nice nice I think we're gonna film a

178
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:02,259
really really clean proper lab hash wash

179
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,019
down in California here in the near

180
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:07,209
future it'll have my voice over but

181
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:08,919
it'll be Tony's or one of our workers

182
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:11,289
hands that you'll be seeing doing all

183
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,660
the things it's taken a month a month in

184
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,280
a bit to really get the SOPs rolling and

185
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,020
teach everyone exactly how I do it

186
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,569
because there are so many different

187
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:21,129
things that you can do in making bubbles

188
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:25,089
so many little things that you can

189
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:29,170
change that it took a while to explain

190
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:31,209
exactly how I wanted to do it so Tony

191
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:34,120
and I have been doing a lot of face time

192
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:35,769
hash making over the course of the last

193
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,440
couple of months it's been pretty fun

194
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:41,799
the boats great the boats down on the on

195
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,590
the on the trailer in my front yard

196
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,659
right now and I'll probably maybe put it

197
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,280
in the water today I got a check to see

198
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,199
that the battery is working I kept it

199
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,850
trickle charged all winter but I want to

200
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,250
make sure that it's that it's good so

201
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,320
I'm gonna put the battery in today get

202
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:59,139
that checked out now the one thing I had

203
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,810
was a little bit tight on my cable for

204
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:04,179
my gas and I wasn't quite sure what's up

205
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:05,559
with that my mechanic said it could be

206
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:07,359
fine it could be a little bit from

207
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,429
moisture over the winter it might

208
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,690
release and it might get tighter so we

209
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:13,569
basically said take it out for the

210
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,730
weekend if it does get tighter then I

211
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,528
got to remove that wire that cable and

212
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,870
replace it got the end of the world by

213
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:22,000
any means but definitely a time waster

214
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,220
and a money waster you know how it goes

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,929
break out another ten grand

216
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,240
that's what boat stands for not break

217
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:30,338
out another thousand break out another

218
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,350
ten grand

219
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,269
that's what boat stands for we have to

220
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,320
change with inflation maybe they said

221
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:38,589
that about boats

222
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,778
25 years ago but let's be honest today

223
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:45,130
if you only have to break out a grand

224
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:47,740
for your boat wow you're lucky boats and

225
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:49,750
Ho's boats and Ho's yeah that was some

226
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,060
classic from stepbrothers the video that

227
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:55,750
those two guys filmed on the video on

228
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:57,278
the on the sailboat classic classic yeah

229
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,370
I blew my motor right out of my boat a

230
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,708
couple I think it was last year so you

231
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,509
end of the year before last year and so

232
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:07,750
that was quite expensive but insurance

233
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:08,740
covered it it was a faulty piece and the

234
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,620
motor that broke

235
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,889
yeah I agree Amelia I used to really

236
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:19,089
love filming videos up close with my

237
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:20,769
macro of bubbling resin and it was

238
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:22,360
something that you know back in the day

239
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,610
when I first started doing it there was

240
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,430
nowhere else I could see it there was no

241
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,379
web site or any Instagram or anything I

242
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:32,379
could just go look at bubbling melting

243
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:34,778
resin and so I felt kind of in my own

244
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:36,820
little world you know for a while when I

245
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:38,559
started my macro photographs not too

246
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,839
many people were doing it especially in

247
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:44,948
the cannabis space a lot of people were

248
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:46,899
doing it in the bug and flower space you

249
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:49,990
know the macro world is full of people

250
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:51,519
who shoot bugs insects and flowers and

251
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,709
that's where I learned a lot of my

252
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,769
information some really helpful awesome

253
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:59,649
people don't have any egos don't have

254
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:01,778
any competition are super eager and

255
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:03,639
happy to share everything they learn

256
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:05,889
about photography and really that was

257
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,778
the attitude that I brought into it the

258
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:09,750
cannabis industry the cannabis industry

259
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:12,220
is a funny industry because you know

260
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,809
people want to share but people also

261
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:19,649
want to horde and sometimes the hoarding

262
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:21,989
is more attuned to promoting their

263
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:23,339
personal agenda ie making profit you

264
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,839
know like if I don't show anyone how to

265
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,370
do this and I'm the only one that can do

266
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,769
it well then everyone has to come to me

267
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,448
to do this you know for instance some

268
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:33,720
people called me the other day from

269
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:35,998
California they saw my photography they

270
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,069
really wanted to hire me you know I get

271
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:41,220
1,500 to 2,000 dollars a day when I

272
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:43,409
shoot so it would be a value to be flown

273
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,660
down to California and shoot for two or

274
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:48,778
three days in a big facility and a bunch

275
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:52,318
of cultivars but I cannot go down to

276
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:54,838
California so of course I will turn this

277
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:57,240
gentleman on to a couple of my friends I

278
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,680
will turn them on to say dynasty who I

279
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,438
think is one of the best macro

280
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:04,588
photographers going right now hands down

281
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:06,659
hands down and he's in Oregon and I also

282
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:08,730
told him another great photographer

283
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:11,519
friend of mine who's right in California

284
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:13,829
is Todd McCormick who also has the same

285
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,970
lens and shoots really great shots does

286
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:17,519
the stacks as well

287
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,050
yeah shale I believe is in Lexie I don't

288
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,850
think he's in California there's all

289
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:22,528
sorts of great photographers but the key

290
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,110
is where are you if you're gonna be

291
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:31,379

criminal I don't think I would do bad

303
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,299
things in America I try to be a good

304

influence I try to be good and I don't

305
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:03,870
know and now for some reason they become

306
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:06,389
illegal I never heard that they're

307
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,639
illegal at all David at all I think that

308
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:11,129
a lot of the companies that were selling

309
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,269
terpenes also started selling CBD

310
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:15,959
isolate and that for sure is not legal

311
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:19,740
particularly if you're shipping it

312
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:22,109

327
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:06,110
me many of which we have already named

328
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:08,119
here some of the backcountry big

329
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,190
mountain photographers that inspired me

330
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:14,480
were Erika Berger

331
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:17,720
Blake Jorgensen Paul Morrison all from

332
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,778
Whistler all incredible photographers

333
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,028
Jordan Manley who is now a videographer

334
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:25,549
for Arc'teryx but has taken some

335
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:27,169
absolutely stunning images he's this is

336
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:29,479
the guy that took the image he went up

337
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:31,729
to Whistler and he set up his camera on

338
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,079
a tripod and it was a macro shot and he

339
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,389
brought a little bit of water with a

340
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:37,849
dropper funny that I would have one

341
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:39,470
right here a little dropper and he went

342
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,480
over to a leaf and he set up the shot

343
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,129
where he put his bike and he got his

344
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,680
camera and he looked into the wall and

345
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:49,129
he put a droplet of water he looked into

346
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,750
the water droplet and he I don't know

347
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:52,730
where he marked her if he parked his

348
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,980
bike there but he kept moving his bike

349
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,240
into the point where it was like and

350
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,889
moving his camera to the point where

351
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,079
okay everything's clear so then he

352
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:02,259
marked that spot and he had a little

353
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:05,028
photographer you know like a little auto

354
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:08,870
clip for taking the picture on his bike

355
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:10,730
a wireless one and so he set the whole

356
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,009
camera up the little water droplet this

357
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,230
was like a very difficult like

358
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:16,789
impossible shot from a macro standpoint

359
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,289
when you take when you hear the shot and

360
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:20,000
all insist that you go look at it in

361
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:26,198
fact maybe I'll even try to bring it up

362
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,850
because holy [ __ ] what he did was

363
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:33,139
everything got set up and then he I

364
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,509
wonder if I'm gonna be able to find it

365
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:36,559
too because I was pretty sure okay here

366
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:39,019
it is here it is yeah

367
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,469
this is it so he takes this this water

368
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:45,250
droplet he creates a refraction shot and

369
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:49,250
he wants to be it on his mountain bike

370
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,570
okay under in the water drop usually you

371
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,240
show up upside down because it's a

372
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,890
refraction well a fly came along at the

373
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,480
very same time that he was driving his

374
00:15:54,889 --> 00:16:01,720
bike and this fly started drinking one

375
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,440
of the water droplets well here he is

376
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:09,230
upside down on his mountain bike can you

377
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,320
imagine the quality of that macro shot

378
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,620
like the guy is so inspiring when I

379
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,740
asked him I took a course with him

380
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,929
actually up in Whistler for bit for pro

381
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,460
skiing and mountain biking and I said

382
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:24,079
you know what's one of the kind of a

383
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,980
cool tip that you could give me and he

384
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:32,240
said well if you want to get shots that

385
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:35,389
nobody else gets put your camera where

386
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,759
nobody puts their camera and at first I

387
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:39,500
was kind of like what and he's like well

388
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,360
you know how a lot of people kind of

389
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,159
take their they we used to take pictures

390
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,779
with like this this is how all pictures

391
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:46,279
were taken well then the phone's came

392
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:48,649
out and we started taking pictures from

393
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:51,949
the back screens live view of cameras

394
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:53,990
and now there are ways that we can set

395
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:56,330
up shots we can put our cameras anywhere

396
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,339
and when you put your camera somewhere

397
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,440
that no one else has put their camera

398
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,570
you will end up getting a shot that no

399
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,390
one else in the world has gone and I

400
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:10,068
took him to his word on that and when he

401
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:12,500
told me that I applied that to my own

402
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:15,199
cannabis photography and that's part of

403
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:19,009
you know my macro photography is is that

404
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,079
I don't claim to be the best cannabis

405
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:23,059
macro photographer out there I think

406
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:26,990
that there are some exceptional

407
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:30,440
photographers that are above my my level

408
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:34,400
of talent or skill but what I would say

409
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,160
is that I definitely helped popularize

410
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,560
and take some of these first shots you

411
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,290
know from certain angles certain things

412
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:45,579
that just had never existed the shots

413
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:48,039
never existed in my lifetime okay

414
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:50,819
I had never seen macro photographs of

415
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:53,230
beautiful amber perfectly cured bubble

416
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:55,960
or dry sift you know when I took those

417
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:59,319
shots of Sam the skunk man's dry sift

418
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,840
heads that was something that I had

419
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:04,029
never I had never seen before no one had

420
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,399
ever seen it because when I posted it it

421
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:08,559
immediately became almost viral hundreds

422
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,019
of thousands of people saw those

423
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,720
particular early shots I think it is

424
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:16,139
time for a rip Martin Olsen I think

425
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:21,640
that's a great idea why don't we do that

426
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:23,170
why don't we do that bond rip yeah it's

427
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,120
been fun being a part of it you know

428
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,860
what I'm always happy to shout out the

429
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,699
people that inspired me and came before

430
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:32,049
me because there were a lot of them

431
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,559
there were a lot of them yeah you know

432
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:36,129
joy I was a step in the in the in the

433
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:39,220
ladder

434
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:41,380
you know because let's be honest I was

435
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,029
inspired by people who were the steps

436
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,700
before me I got to stand on the

437
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:47,109
shoulders of giants so I think if you're

438
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,200
lucky enough to stand on the shoulders

439
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:57,789
of diet Giants you should be humble you

440
00:18:50,200 --> 00:19:00,610
should always approach your your your

441
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:02,170
journey in life with humility you know

442
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:04,179
humility is good the more I learn about

443
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:07,600
everything in life the more I want to be

444
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:09,549
a humble person it pays off and I don't

445
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,959
pretend to be humble 100% of the time

446
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,639
I'm definitely a little bit aggressive

447
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,559
when I'm driving in my vehicle I'm

448
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,800
getting mad and yelling at the people in

449
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:21,069
front of me but what can you do right I

450
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:23,049
am human hey thanks guys

451
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:24,909
I'm not sure why you're tipping me but I

452
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:27,190
appreciate it it's pretty cool you know

453
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:29,590
what I'll do with it I'll give it away I

454
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,120
wouldn't keep it for myself just doesn't

455
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:32,589
seem right especially when people are

456
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,049
going through all sorts of different

457
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:36,609
problems in our community I love being

458
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:39,250
able to turn this instead of something

459
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:41,769
for me like how much traction can I get

460
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:45,190
how much monetary gain can I make how

461
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:47,650
much followers can I get I like turning

462
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,240
this channel into something that's

463
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,250
bigger and that's what hashed Church was

464
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,630
all about and that's why the giveaways

465
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,759
on the wake-and-bake sand that's why

466
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,720
we're donating any money that comes in

467
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,538
and I'm very

468
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:02,620
transparent about it I take screenshots

469
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:04,779
of the accounts and I send those to the

470
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:07,089
people you know like forest

471
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:09,759
I showed him exactly who donated and how

472
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:11,319
much and then sent him all of that money

473
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,890
because I would never want to be thought

474
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:16,000
that I was you know to another wise my

475
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,070
little guys trying to get my attention

476
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,779
but I'm not gonna listen he's playing

477
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:21,939
with his grandma on the other room yeah

478
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:23,710
he's like screaming at the top of his

479
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,048
lungs but you know what the vibes are

480
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:31,390
good we're 20 minutes in Bubble Boy is

481
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:34,240
hype he's like he's having fun with his

482
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:36,520
grandma of course for us just kicked

483
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,819
about at the CAG meeting oh my god

484
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:44,048
Forrest is a force to be reckoned with I

485
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:46,089
wouldn't mess with Forrest he has he has

486
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:48,450
the biggest truth on his side you know

487
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:52,379
helping catastrophic Lee ill children

488
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,380

I think giant ribs taken deep into the

493
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:34,039
lungs through wicked pipes will

494
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,200
definitely produce a expectorant type

495
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:39,990

499
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:53,789

attention he's probably not gonna stop I
