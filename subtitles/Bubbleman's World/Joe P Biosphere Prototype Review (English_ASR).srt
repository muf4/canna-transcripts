00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,039
integrity glass Arts Instagram he's got

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,198
a photo of it and it gives the links to

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,960
both the blowers and uh mentions that

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,800
it's a prototype uh biosphere perk I can

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,039
show you now what the perk looks like in

14
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,159
slow motion you can see it's very

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,000
violent eruption from the base as it

16
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:43,359
curls around the back and comes through

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,119
this giant biosphere perk and almost

18
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,198
like shoots out of the piece rather than

19
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:50,479
in a solid stream like a recycler

20
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:53,238
usually does it's got this real sort of

21
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:56,198
cool Splash and it creates a a different

22
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:56,198
feel when you pull through

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,119
it woo tastes real nice high integrity

24
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:05,599
glass art just ripped it for the first

25
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:09,560
time and had a real nice rip and uh I'm

26
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:13,719

31
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:33,639
little less than 20 seconds so we're

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,200
of a little beehive in the middle here

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,680
with this really cool disc perk that

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,879
comes out the bottom really a violent

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,200
eruption of the bees in there classic

38

real nice preservation on those turs for

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,599
sure hitting out of the

50
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:41,079
Banger and uh that perk is unique I can

51
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:44,439
definitely say it is unique it sort of

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:48,599
starts out like a recycler but it's more

53
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:52,840
open and it has uh more chug to it not

54
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:56,199
as tight of a pull but really unique

55
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,239
nonetheless and I like how it uh how it

56
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:00,639
preserved those turps that nice low temp

57
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,120
dab of course

58
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,958
