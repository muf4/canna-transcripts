00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,280
excited to talk to you about a few

9
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,320
different things and we've got a couple

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,320
of ships on the table so we can get uh

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,600
sublimating and denailing while we yeah

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,920
while we discuss uh some things so it

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,439
was pretty cool having you on hash

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,520
Church the other day it was uh I mean

15
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,399
I've always known you've had a a deep

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,000
knowledge of sort of different

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,280
historical contexts where cannabis has

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,480
found itself and one of the things I

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,599
appreciate about that historical context

20
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,200
is that you look from it you look for it

21
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,959
from other sources other than like

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,079
cannabis authors yeah yeah well I don't

23
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:11,959
want to be quoting you know cannabis

24
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,759
Advocates so I'm looking more at like

25
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:16,879
archaeologist work Anthropologist work

26
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,959
history of religions religious texts and

27
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,478
things like that and digging around in

28
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,039
those and then trying to accumulate them

29
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,319
and put them in one place where people

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,320
can access that information very cool I

31
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,438
think I heard your bird coughing while

32
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,559
you were yeah yeah my bird he mimics the

33
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,158
cough and uh uh inhale so he'll be

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,759
making a bit of noise in the background

35
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,520
his bird takes hits and then coughs

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,040
after uh the exhale and it's pretty

37
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,239
funny and I just heard it right before

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,759
he explained that so uh Chris has a

39
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:44,519
bunch of cool little things to sort of

40
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,718
show us and I figured we'd probably get

41
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,920
the party started by having a dab I'm

42
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:51,640
always down for a dab what about

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,399
yourself ah sounds good yeah yeah I'm

44
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,319
not too big a Dabber mostly I vaporize

45
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,399
you know raw cannabis and stuff like

46
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,239
that or I like I like rolling up an oil

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,239
snake with a dab and putting that and a

48
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,478
joint and it makes a nice really yes

49
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,799
smooth smooth burning joint I always

50
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:10,478
picture you with a joint myself

51
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,318
yeah what do you say there Kitty you got

52
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,519
a beautiful cat yeah it's a bangal it's

53
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,878
uh yeah part wild jungle

54
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,640
cat yeah you can kind of tell definitely

55
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:21,359
doesn't look like your average uh he'll

56
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,958
be over here at some point I'm sure

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,800
he'll come check us out when he's damn

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,959
when he feels damn good and ready so is

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,080
this some hash you made or uh this is

60
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,120
hash from a friend a local friend up

61
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,560
north of whist and it's some pretty

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,439
melty stuff you can see it's of a cush

63
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,560
variety with a tiny little bit of nebula

64
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:43,400
mixed in and it uh it presses up real

65
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,360
nice into a goopy sort of sticky melty

66
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,200
product and uh I'll give us an give us

67
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,239
each a nice little dab we could probably

68
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:54,959
just do a dunk don't even need a

69
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,000
Dabber see you know one of the things

70
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,039
when I interviewed Lawrence chernak uh

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,840
told me that when he was like

72
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,400
documenting has hashish making in the'

73
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,680
70s and stuff like that generally the

74
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,560
hash wasn't off of buds like the type of

75
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,159
buds we see it was more like almost

76
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,199
plants in vegetative state or very very

77
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,280
spindly Buds and the hash they're very

78
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,399
Rous though for some reason but they

79
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,039
weren't producing the big dense flowers

80
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,959
that uh that we traditionally associate

81
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,798
our hashes plants with here you know

82
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,239
right well I just took a hit out of the

83
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,799
mother ship and it was a dry hit it was

84
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,799
okay though I have to say like really

85
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,438
smooth didn't cough at all and I tasted

86
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,400
beautiful flavor on um on the

87
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:39,479
exhale but I'm going to go put a little

88
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,400
bit of water

89
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:45,479
go all right

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,360
so I got a nice lovely dry hit out of

91
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,318
that but I have since put some water in

92
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,879
it for

93
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:54,839
Chris I was surprised at how nice the um

94
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:56,878
pipe hit without water I have hit uh

95
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,759
that one without water and I've hit my

96
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,598
Taurus without water both mother shits

97
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:02,679
not sure if you're big on the mothership

98
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,238
scenario here but these are particular

99
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,519
pipes that are made by this company

100
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,239
Mothership and uh well they just really

101
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,239
hit if you smoke a lot of bongs you

102
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,039
really recognize it quickly as um an

103
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,199
incredible flavor sorry about that I put

104
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,399
your phone right on the hat no I'll put

105
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,520
my phone off so it doesn't rain too I

106
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:25,120

Blazer that you've got on there that

112

113
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,759
legit I uh

114
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:49,279
1920s yeah for real I love the idea of

115
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,560
having a Legends of hash party

116
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,679
nice very

117
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,199
tasty I love the idea of having a

118
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,918
Legends of hash party and at the door

119
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,600
you get one of these like smoking

120
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,680
jackets you know with a little like

121
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,800
maybe some wipes in the pocket and some

122
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,840
whatever you require in the other

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
pocket hopefully some selection of

124
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,159
hashish in your pocket or something like

125
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,759
there we go even if it was just one

126
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,960
little you know your first dab you just

127
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,879
pull it out of your

128
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,879
pocket wow we're utopian dreamers there

129
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:24,319
we go it's been uh you've been involved

130
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:27,719
in cannabis for 25 plus years yeah yeah

131
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,840
yeah for sure in 19899 found out about

132
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,960
industrial hemp and Jack hair and all

133
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,599
that stuff and uh started kind of

134
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,318
promoting it from then on yeah that

135
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,800
would have been very similar to me I was

136
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:42,720
definitely into uh the smoking of it in

137
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,199
1989 by 991 I started to grow it and

138
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,280
become more of an activist and then got

139
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,759
into the whole hemp thing out out east

140
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,879
before I came out here and it was

141
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,120
definitely um it's been a good

142
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,000
foundation to have that sort of Jack

143
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,800
really brought more of us together than

144
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,439
we'll ever know yeah Jack yeah he's the

145
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,560
father of the move modern movement you

146
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,719
know what I mean it had well you know

147
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,360
I've been smoking herbs since I was 12

148
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,160
years old and grew up here in Vancouver

149
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,360
and I actually went to smokins at the

150
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,680
art gallery in the 70s um yeah I don't

151
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,960
know I can't remember too much about it

152
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,598
I just kind of can vaguely remember

153
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:17,519
being there and smoking weed that's

154
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:20,959
pretty a big crowd of people you know

155
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:23,000
and uh uh um so that but it kind of died

156
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,839
off and through the 80s and stuff like

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,639
that through the efforts of a of a

158
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,799
mother of some child all the head shops

159
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,639
got shut down and so all pipes bongs and

160
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,199
High Times grow magazines any literature

161
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,639
promoting legalization was completely

162
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,199
banned you know what I mean and so uh um

163
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:43,000
there was not really much of a scene

164
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,478
here in in in BC at all you know in 1990

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,680

190
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,680
group leag for ethical action and drugs

191
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:43,878
and I had this thing called patriotic

192
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,879
Canadians for hemp and I had like one

193
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,520
little piece of hemp paper you know

194
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:51,000
cardboard and a little swath of hemp

195
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:52,839
cloth and a bag of hemp seeds and i' go

196
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,519
to these universities and colleges and

197
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:57,560
I'd say okay this is hemp paper and we

198
00:07:54,519 --> 00:08:00,240
can make all our paper out of hemp and

199
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,839
hemp seeds around and you know and uh

200
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,879
that was kind of how it you know really

201
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,119
got going you know so what year would

202
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,000
have been the hemp times that that

203
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,759
brother Leroy guy was always hand that

204
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,279
was like 92 3 4 okay 92 9394 cuz that's

205
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,319
when I started coming here was right

206
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:19,559
around 92 I guess and we hooked up with

207
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,680
them and we had you know it was like we

208
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,038
were we were able to get hemp paper in

209
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,000
large amounts and some hemp cloth that

210
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:28,478
we later found out was did not really

211
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,399
hemp cloth the tie sure the tie well I

212
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,439
had a business moment hemp seed treats

213
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,519
through the a lot of the that's how I

214
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,479
first and uh that was the first

215
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,240
commercial Venture of wholesaling hemp

216
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,120
seed Foods as far as I know and I sold

217
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,959
those all over North America through the

218
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,320
US even in other we bought them and sold

219
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,278
them at our hemp store and that was like

220
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,320
one of the things we were the most

221
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,759
stoked of we often had the mama Inda

222
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,560
hemp seed treats opened up broken into

223
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:53,480
pieces on on a table so people could try

224
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:55,838
them yeah then they didn't have the hemp

225
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,920
nut which really revolutionized uh the

226
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,959
hemp industry the hemp seed itself is is

227
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,879
kind of husky to eat and it's raw form

228
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,719
in the M indc treat it was kind of a

229
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:06,039
sesame seed snap type thing so it kind

230
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,639
of worked for it but it was it was

231
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,559
holding it back and then once they

232
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,919
figured a method of properly dehaul the

233
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,319
seed well that was whole industry blew

234
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,559
that was even more everything than you

235
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,760
can imagine because the seed that was

236
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:20,000
being used prior was actually sterilized

237
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,278
seed you you were unable to sell live

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,879
seed which one of their tricks and it

239
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:25,720
was hell you know like I was importing

240
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,879
all the seed I got from China and

241
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,959
sometimes the seed would show up and be

242
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,480
rancid and I'd be out my money or it

243
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,518
would get hel at Customs forever you

244
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,440
know you know I'm renting a bakery to

245
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,320
make my product that and I can't get it

246
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,760
or there was a lot of uh uh um road to

247
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,560
to to break through to kind of uh get

248
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,278
things going but now the hemp industry

249
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,518
you know it's it's a real money industry

250
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:49,159
and I'm sure it's already a

251
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,879
multi-million dollar industry here in

252
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:52,799
British col in Canada I mean you know

253
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,439
already absolutely and uh you know and

254
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,199
the hemp nuts great I throw like four

255
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,760
tablespoons in my morning smoothie every

256
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,360
day and it's a definitely a big part of

257
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,200
my diet and uh the healthier things that

258
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,120
I eat you know yeah as it should be you

259
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,640
know essential amino acids have that

260
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,399
word essential in front of it and I'm

261
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,199
sure one day we'll see that word get put

262
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,278
in front of phyto canabo they'll be

263
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,800
they'll be essential phyto for sure man

264
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,720
you know probably one day there'll be

265
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,319
juice and whole buds with seeds in it

266
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,839
you know and getting all the Cannabis

267
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,480
goodness out of all that now that's a

268
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,560
juing there you go yeah yeah juice your

269
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,480
oil from your seed and your phyto canabo

270
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:32,119
from the leaf and the bud simultaneously

271
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,399
damn yeah yeah well you know in 1990 I I

272
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,440
guess like where I differentiate from a

273
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,399
lot of other actives I pursued this uh

274
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,680
uh study of cannabis and its different

275
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,078
religious roles in all throughout

276
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,479
cultures and religions you know and uh

277
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:47,919
that happened I had this really powerful

278
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,240
religious experience in 1990 that left

279
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,599
me uh believing that cannabis was the

280
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,480
Tree of Life this you know holy tree of

281
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,639
life that had leaves for the healing of

282
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,320
the Nations and all manners of fruit and

283
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,799
stuff and I really felt that after this

284
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,440
experience that uh all these industrial

285
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,958
applications of cannabis were related to

286
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,480
this you know how we could get rid of

287
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:11,039
our prochemical uh uh um needs and all

288
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,480
fossil fuels and all that with hemp

289
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,399
fuels and hemp Plastics how we can feed

290
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,440
the world with a hemp seed I was on it

291
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,480
replacing soil depleting cotton with

292
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,160
hemp you know what I mean and so it's

293
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,759
always uh uh um uh um been kind of a

294
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,919
what I guess is my specialty in the

295
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,519
Cannabis scene over the last 25 years so

296
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,799
I spent 25 years research on the role of

297
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,519
cannabis in in history and religion

298
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,439
particularly its role in Magic and

299
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,720
religion and I have to say you know 25

300
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,399
years later uh that original religious

301
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,278
experience at a time when I had never

302
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,360
written anything um High School Dropout

303
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,120
I hadn't been particularly uh a pursuer

304
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,000
of intellectual type of things and when

305
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,480
I you know at that time I was a surfer

306
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,799
living out on the west coast to

307
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,680
Vancouver Island and incl and as much as

308
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,399
I'm a pot activist now I was a surfer

309
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,879
then my whole trip was like a gr grew a

310
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,519
bit of weed and uh had a job as a night

311
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:05,759
Watchman a few nights a week and it was

312
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,679
like chasing waves man and it was a a

313
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,559
really good time in Canada for Surf and

314
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,838
there was like maybe like a dozen

315
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,159
Surfers between ulet and toino and now

316
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,560
there's probably a dozen surf shots

317
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:17,559
between ulet and toino you know and so

318
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:19,399
it was like a pioneering time for cold

319
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:22,159
water surfing and a really great scene

320
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,839
you know uh um but yeah you know I'd say

321
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,639
that as fun as that was you know the the

322
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,160
the work I've had the opportunity to do

323
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,720
in regards to cannabis history's been

324
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,159
just as fulfilling for sure oh

325
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,920
absolutely well that's what a great

326
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:35,600
thing to get you all inspired for the

327
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:38,599
Cannabis historian

328
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,680
role chasing waves chasing waves man

329

it's a very Zen experience you know

330
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,559
surfing is like one of the most Zen

331
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,879
things out there you know and it's up

332
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,399
there when you're out on a a good day of

333
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,720
like say a place like Jordan River a

334
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,720
really good point break over on

335
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,759
Vancouver Island and you get like a

336
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,000
quarter mile ride on like a you know 6

337
00:12:53,759 --> 00:13:00,078
to 8T wave uh um and uh uh that's right

338
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,559
up there with the hottest Sex You Ever

339
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,198
Had You know what I mean uh um it's like

340
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,838
a pretty you know and if you like you

341
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:07,039
know get slotted in a barrel or

342
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,199
something like that that's just like

343
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,719
this Timeless Timeless moment of

344
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:13,120
everything's kind of stand still and

345
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,720
you're in this perfect cylinder of water

346
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,360
you know it's just like uh uh um

347
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,000
something that sticks with you you know

348
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,480
beautiful sounds so good yeah man it

349
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,440
would be so good if we could experience

350
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,600
something like that today after a nice

351
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,519
session like this it would be like just

352
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,680
be surfing yeah absolutely man

353
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,278
well maybe make it happen yeah who knows

354
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,000
man maybe we'll make it happen so this

355
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:38,799
is the sublimator now um this is his

356
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,879
newer unit uh the V oh I always get the

357
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,120
name wrong it's pretty cool it dabs up

358
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,600
on top here and then herb inside it's a

359
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,679
vaporizer so if you want to hit it you

360
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,159
can haul ass on it right now yeah and

361
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:49,679
you can you can haul ass on it it's

362
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,919
different from most vaporizers in the

363
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,278
sense where you will uh I know you said

364
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,879
sometimes it's a little bit too much so

365
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,198
I'll just pull back you don't have to

366
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:00,720
pull like what you got there is what i'

367
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:04,000
call kind of King hit a real nice flavor

368
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,399
all the yeah plus it's a sweet skunk so

369
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,519
it's not really a head what's the

370
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,039
difference between the sublimator and

371
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,639
other VAP why is it hit so much harder

372
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:14,439
okay I can only use the word the

373
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,839
metaphorical words to to pass this on to

374
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,360
you but I will say that what he's doing

375
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:21,839
with this unit the way and this is the

376
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,720
key right here these two touching

377
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,000
because it's not about the wand it's

378
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,440
about the atomizer this piece here what

379
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,639
this does is it it creates an entire

380
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,759
space that is a particular temperature

381
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,799
and you put your Herb in and then you

382
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,839
pull it through this tiny little hole a

383
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:42,000
ventury right what it does is it

384
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,639
basically accesses magic I have no idea

385
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,278
how to say it any other way than that

386
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:48,039
but if you are a smoker and you just

387
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,519
test this thing against any other unit

388
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,519
no other

389
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,560
vaporizer it's hitting like this thing

390
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,120
then it's all about if you want the full

391
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,919
rip the half rip you know it depends

392
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:15,159
on how hard you pull and how long you

393
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:15,159
leave the um wand inside the atomizer

394
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,919
for definitely um love the idea of a

395
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,759
sublimator bar where you have dab

396
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,799
attendant taking care of the the the

397
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,800
unit for you and just serving you hits

398
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,799
cuz that's that's definitely where I'm

399
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,278
at with

400
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:35,039
it but The Taste and the smell of that

401
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:37,879
is absolutely Sublime nice little narrow

402
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,958
Leaf cultivar nice yeah what do you

403
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,720
think of the uh the new Theory the wide

404
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:45,559
leaf and the narrow Leaf drug cultivars

405
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,000
um I yeah I don't know man it it's like

406
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:50,318
I think it's still like sativa sativas

407
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,278
are thin leaf and indos are wide Leaf

408
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:56,958
you know and I'd say that uh you know

409
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:59,879
the indicas you know they they kind of

410
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,000
came out the where the du Kush kind of

411
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:05,519
meet up with the aan Chan mountains

412
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,958
there in China and you know I think that

413
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,039
uh the Marana that they found in central

414
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,679
China the really well preserved stuff I

415
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,159
think that's like it's still got the

416
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:17,039
sativa like leaves but then it's got

417
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,360
some indicia like qualities as well and

418
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,318
it's probably right when they're

419
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,039
starting to like hybridize it enough for

420
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:23,479
the indicas to produce or something like

421
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:26,000
that I wonder if we'll ever be able to

422
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,199
tell for sure regardless of anyone's

423
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,600
Theory through gening and through the

424
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:33,039
mapping of the actual genetic I don't

425
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,159
know you know like I like I I think that

426
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:38,759
things like acal gold and Colombian and

427
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:41,240
Mexican red hair I believe that those

428
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:44,959
are just you know European hemp

429
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,519
varieties that got brought over and got

430
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,559
adapted to the warmer climate and

431
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,318
started producing more resin and became

432
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,159
those types of plants you know what I

433
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:54,078
mean uh you know the whole idea that

434
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,240
hemp doesn't you know have to contain

435
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:59,159
any THC or these that's like a modern

436
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,440
hybridization these industrial Str with

437
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:03,198
a little bit of like resin and th it

438
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,720
works as a bug repellent and stuff like

439
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,279
that and grows healthier you seems to be

440
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,838
a pretty important component at least

441
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:10,838
for the plant that's followed us around

442
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:13,958
for the majority of our history yeah

443
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:15,678
yeah for sure it seems that uh THC seems

444
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,959
to be a pretty important you know I'm

445
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,880
I'm sure the earliest users they were

446
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,318
like probably just growing one big

447
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,600
cultivated crop and like a buffalo

448
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,918
utilizing everything off of the plant

449
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,199
the seeds and the stock and

450
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:31,960
the um you know that was like the

451
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,360
earliest uh but you know as a cultivated

452
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,400
crop Carl seon uh um believed that that

453
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,839
was likely Humanity's first cultivated

454
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,880
crop and and the word cannabis you know

455
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,000
the root word for cannabis Kaa that's

456
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,520
like Proto indoeuropean language and so

457
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,759
that's like the oldest type of words

458
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,798
that we can trace back so it's like

459
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,879
right at the very beginnings of language

460
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,480
and stuff like that as far as we can

461
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,240
trace it back there's references to to

462
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,079
cannabis you know what I mean um so it's

463
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,798
very very old and current archaeological

464
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:06,319
evidence for like say uh uh um

465
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:08,519
production of hemp fibers tools that are

466
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,519
used for uh breaking the fibers off the

467
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:13,440
stock of cannabis that were tools like

468
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,798
these were still in use just a few

469
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,440
hundred years ago uh um but they found

470
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:22,759
ones dating back to about 28,000 BC you

471
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,720
know what I mean and U I think uh it's

472
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:27,119
uh you know even older you know like

473
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,079
there's some some evidence of of stuff

474
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,158
even older you know so the

475
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,279
archaeological evidence is just as far

476
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:33,799
back as we can date it through that but

477
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,798
it could have been tens of thousands of

478
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:38,599
years before that you know and people

479
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:40,319
like Dr Jeffrey guy and John mcpartland

480
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,558
Dr Jeff guy's the head of GW

481
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,798
Pharmaceuticals they're speculating that

482
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,918
you know cannabis itself you know the

483
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:49,038
resids and the the drug effects of

484
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,200
cannabis may have facil played a

485
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,558
facilitory role in the very important

486
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,880
period known as the greatly forward when

487
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:58,038
we really start moving away from being

488
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,120
animals living in the jungle to more

489
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:03,079
civilized being and Tool making and uh

490
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,599
uh um all that type of stuff right so

491
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:07,079
that's somehow uh the Canabis High and

492
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,599
the novel way of thinking that it

493
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,279
produced facilitated that step forward

494
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,079
you know what I mean and then you know

495
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,558
you got to think about those just with

496
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:18,720
those dates you know the history of us

497
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,440
growing this plant beside where we live

498
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,519
you know and in our Villages and growing

499
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,400
in our human waste because night soil

500
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,359
you know before we weren't like pumping

501
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,120
all of our uh uh human waste out into uh

502
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,639
the oceans and uh uh polluting our Earth

503
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:36,719
you know there was a time where it was

504
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,720
like part of the cycle of life and that

505
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,960
we were like bear [ __ ] in the woods

506
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,679
going back into nature and we utilized

507
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,159
it into our own fields and our crops but

508
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,280
that energy of that going through us

509
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:50,520
that puts some of us back in that dirt

510
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,200
man and that's that's our relationship

511
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,798
with this planet you know is it's like

512
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,200
we have a a

513
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:58,000
co-evolutionary relationship with

514
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,840
cannabis and that's why we have this

515
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,759
really incredible endoc cannaboid system

516
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,119
that matches up with the cannaboids in

517
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,279
cannabis and other aspects of cannabis

518
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:10,158
as well like Gamlin leic acid which is

519
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,399
in the human mother's milk and uh along

520
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,400
with endocannabinoids uh uh but is you

521
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,120
know in just a couple of other rare seed

522
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,038
oils and stuff like that right you know

523
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:20,959
what I mean it's like we have this

524
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:23,319
inherent relationship connection with

525
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,840
this plant and that's why it's curing a

526
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:26,240
you know a lot of these diseases that

527
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:28,359
people are treating with cannabis

528
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,679
they're now being referred to as endoc

529
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:33,519
canab anoid deficiencies you know what I

530
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,600
mean and so that's like uh that's like

531
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,960
how how close we are with it maybe those

532
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,359
these are all starting to result from

533
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,798
our separation from this herb that's

534
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:44,959
been part of our our life on earth going

535
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:47,000
back thousands and thousands of years

536
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,679
you know and what a fascinating history

537
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,400
it is too man it's completely

538
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,120
fascinating and it's pretty heavy when

539
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,240
you get down to thinking about each one

540
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:57,000
of those components and how they line up

541
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,798
the co-evolutionary aspect of us with

542
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,038
cannabis you know the Dr Jeffrey guy's

543
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:03,319
theories of the Great Leap Forward being

544
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:09,839
sparked by

545
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:13,599
cannabis um it's no big secret that the

546
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:17,158
more we learn about cannabis and its its

547
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:20,000
role in our lives in our lives that you

548
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:22,720
can just see that a lot of this agenda

549
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,599
that seems to be behind making cannabis

550
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,519
illegal is

551
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:30,119
simultaneously creating different

552
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,519
industries that could only exist with

553
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:35,479
cannabis being illegal you know like

554
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:36,960
there's no need to replace um uh the

555
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,640
endocannabinoid

556
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,519
systems food if you will the phyto

557
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,038
canabo and the essential amino acids

558
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,679
there's no real need to replace those if

559
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:47,640
you let people have them in the first

560
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,240
place you know once you remove phyto

561
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,919
canabo from the person's diet then they

562
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,159
become deficient then they have all

563
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,038
these different problems and then they

564
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,919
give you pills which are signalers for

565
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,440
your cells to tell your cell oh you're

566
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,278
having a problem but it's there version

567
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,360
and it's never as good as it's never

568
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,480
natural it's never natural well because

569
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,678
natural is unpatentable you know they

570
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,360
want to be able to patent a specific use

571
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:13,000
and they I can't

572
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,599
believe have any of a deeper

573
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,200
understanding or at least a deep enough

574
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,918
understanding what's truly at work here

575
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,038
because I don't believe we even have an

576
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,320
understand well you know it's like by

577
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:25,519
prohibiting it they've made it also into

578
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:28,319
this super powerful force of cultural

579
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,400
change right you know and it's almost

580
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,119
like the classic you know Garden of Eden

581
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,000
myth and God says don't eat of that tree

582
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:36,199
of life or on that day you'll surely die

583
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,960
you know and then they eat of it their

584
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,720
eyes become open and they start to see

585
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:45,159
all the uh uh um uh crazy [ __ ] uh um

586
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,759
going on out there you know yeah no it's

587
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:51,000
pretty heavy indeed it's uh well we're

588
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:53,519
