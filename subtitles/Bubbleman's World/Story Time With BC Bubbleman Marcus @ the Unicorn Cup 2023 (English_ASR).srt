37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,560
to speak this year I think we were

38
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:19,799
actually at antidote making some hash

39
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,640
together from his Sarah secret it was uh

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,879
that's another story but uh he asked me

41
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,759
hey you know if you want to what would

42
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,759
what would you want to speak about I I

43
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,598
don't ever plan my talks ever I've never

44
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:34,359
planned to talk just kind of come and

45
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,399

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,519
know what what do you want to speak

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,959

00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,000

49
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:44,239
stories uh about my history and about uh

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,519
you know stories stories from the game

51
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,959
basically just kind of what we called it

52
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,959
before it got all corporate and legal it

53
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,840
was the

54
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:56,239
game anyway

55
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,400
um I got turned on to cannabis at 14

56
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,959
years old very similar to the scene uh

57
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,319
out of Half Baked with Dave Chappelle

58
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,759
when they're all young and they smoke

59
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:06,839
their joint and they're all giggling

60
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:09,120
that's when he's in the the the Super

61
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,680
Market store and he's like abaaba you my

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,200
only friend he's hugging the big Ababa

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,480
bar very similar experience with me and

64
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:19,079
my friends after we smoked our first

65
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,399
joint things escalated pretty quickly

66
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,840
for me after that first joint it seemed

67
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,158
like I don't know how much time went by

68
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,799
but before you knew it I was flipping

69
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:31,679
quarters and then ounces and you know

70
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,680
quarter pounds

71
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,360
and then I met this amazing man by the

72
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,719
name of Ron hickey and Ron hickey was

73
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,680
really you know outside of my father he

74
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,080
was one of my first mentors and he was

75
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,959
definitely my first Mentor in the game

76
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,040
Ron lives in the cies here in uh in the

77
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,519
cies in Proctor actually but he was

78
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,919
originally a Winnipeg guy and uh you

79
00:03:52,519 --> 00:04:00,480
know for anyone that knew or knows Ron

80
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:02,359
an absolute Maniac Savage awesome person

81
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,199
and So within a very short period of

82
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,840
meeting Ron he started you know cuffing

83
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:13,039
me 10 packs like 10 pounds of weed at a

84
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,200
time this guy was a real character um he

85
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,798
did 11 years in Stony Mountain

86
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,000
penitentary for being a habitual florist

87
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:21,638
if you can imagine growing cannabis they

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,319
put him in prison with some of the most

89
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,600
dangerous people in

90
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,399
Canada he's got his own incredible

91
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,879
stories he should be here telling his

92
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:31,519
own stories because even what he did

93
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,800
while he was in prison and how many

94
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,918
stabbings he kept from happening using

95
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,478
cannabis to bring people together

96
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:42,439
instead of prison's a very divided place

97
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:44,000
by race more than gangs and so he really

98
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,360
brought people together in that way but

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,478
I met him very young I was probably 16

100
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,319
or 17 years old I had some some maybe 18

101
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,918
even I had some plants that were sick

102
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,319
and we went to his he had a hydroponic

103
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,519
store in the city this is a guy that did

104
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,000
six years in prison now he's got a

105
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,240
hydroponic store in the Bible belt in

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,319
Manitoba and I go there and ask him you

107
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,199
know oh I'm growing these tomato plants

108
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,000
and uh you know they're they're not

109
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,560
doing too good and he's and I'm like

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
literally probably look like I'm 12

111
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,478
years old and he's just like look kid I

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,680
know you're not growing tomato plants

113
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:16,399
why don't we just talk about what you're

114
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,918
growing this is like in

115
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:22,279
1992 or 93 this is very long time ago

116
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:25,120
very illegal you can get in a lot of

117
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:27,719
trouble he's just immediately has trust

118
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,560
starts telling me uh takes me down to

119
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,080
his basement actually and we start

120
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,519
dabbing oil he's got this crazy oil and

121
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,359
he's got hot knives and now we're

122
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,519
dabbing oil and he's telling me all this

123
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,560
crazy [ __ ] and he really brought me

124
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:43,839
under his wing took me under his wing

125
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:46,000
and allowed me to um to just be exposed

126
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,879
to the world of cannabis in a way that I

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,439
would have never been exposed Ron having

128
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,399
the only hydroponic store in the city he

129
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:54,199
basically set up everyone with their

130
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,918
grows and then what he would do is he

131
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,038
would go to each of those grows

132
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,918
throughout the day and help make sure

133
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:03,000
that they were all kind of being lined

134
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,000
up I'm going to hit this real

135
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,240
quick a moment of silence for the honey

136
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,879
bananas oh my God I wish I could share

137
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,079
this with all of

138
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:21,038
you maybe I will when we're done there's

139
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:21,038
not many of you we could pull this

140
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:31,719
off okay so I'll tell a few stories

141
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:35,319
about Ron one of the funniest stories

142
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,840
that I had with Ron was Ron was a real

143
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,598
wild man and there was just always the

144
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:41,799
craziest [ __ ] happening and so one day

145
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:44,918
he tells me I Got 5 gallons of

146
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,520
chloroform I'm like chloroform like like

147
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:49,399
the stuff you knock people out with he's

148
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,079
like yeah yeah the solvent chloroform

149
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,679
I'm like oo isn't that like super

150
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,359
illegal like are you even allowed to

151
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,959
have that he's like oh yeah it's super

152
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,080
they watch it super carefully and all

153
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,719
the bins have numbers and but I managed

154
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,719
to get some and I poured it out and then

155
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,160
I gave them back the empty so he's got

156
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,840
this chloroform and he says let's make

157
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,800
some oil out of chloroform I hear you

158
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,079
can make really good oil from chloroform

159
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,918
so we're we're in his house we're

160
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,639
soaking the weed in the chloroform and

161
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,598
we're we're doing the soak and we cooled

162
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,000
the chloroform we we froze like made it

163
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:24,719
very cold uh and then we put the

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,319
chloroform latent oil on like little

165
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,479
plates with a with a little hot plate

166
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,000
and a fan and was blowing this

167
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,079
chloroform oil out the back window of

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,038
his house about 20 minutes into this I

169
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,399
go

170
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:43,279
outside and and I see this big squirrel

171
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,198
and it's it's like dead like right by

172
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,478
the window I guess it got chloroformed

173
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,478
to death and so I you know Ron's a very

174
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:51,439
caring individual I tell him about this

175
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:54,000
he comes over he's basically crying he's

176
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,639
like oh my God oh my God I killed the

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,800
squirrel so we pick this thing up with a

178
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:04,240
shovel and we bring it into his house

179
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,598
and uh within 5 or 10 minutes this I I I

180
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,720
was like I think I saw it move I think

181
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:10,680
it moved wrong I think it moved and it's

182
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,840
sort of laying there with its its hands

183
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,759
up and it's little pinky is doing this

184
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,560
and then it's doing this and we're

185
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,120
watching it fairly

186
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:24,639
stoned and suddenly it comes to life

187
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:27,079
like 100% and starts tearing around his

188
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,519
house so now we're high on chloroform

189
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,478
Oil we're making chloroform oil we have

190
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,079
5 gallons of chloroform which I'm sure

191
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:35,838
at the time probably would have gotten

192
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,000
us like 5 years in prison just to have

193
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,120
that 5 gallons of Chlor form and we

194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,918
ended up you know for about 40 minutes

195
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,600
chasing this scroll down it did some

196
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:47,079
pretty good damage to his house tore up

197
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,000
his couch which you know was just a

198
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,360
standard day I'll never forget his wife

199
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,480
Gail coming home and being like Ron what

200
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,399
happened oh we were making chlorop form

201
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,680
oil and we thought we killed the

202
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,919
squirrel and then the squirrel like tore

203
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,719
around the house and ripped up the couch

204
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:02,000
and the wallpaper and she was just like

205
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,639
okay like it was just the most normal

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,679
thing to her whereas most people might

207
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:09,159
think that that was a pretty insane uh

208
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:13,159
moment in time so that's what it was

209
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:15,399
like being with Ron every single day

210
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:16,958
that you were with him so a true Mentor

211
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,759
that really taught me that anything is

212
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,359
possible he was an incredible grower

213
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,759
still is a great grower really paid

214
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,360
attention to you know the flush and the

215
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,679
the giving plants love the intention you

216
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,360
know before I was exposed to it from you

217
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,120
know West Coast people dragonfly Earth

218
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,360
medicine is a perfect example of that

219
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,480
vibration of that like loving intention

220
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,720
Winnipeg wasn't like that we didn't have

221
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,360
a lot of that but Ron whether he knew it

222
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,720
or not he had that even though he

223
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,959
projected himself to the world to to be

224
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,278
very different than that that's what he

225
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,039
was really about uh and so he taught

226
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:54,399
that to me about cannabis and I you know

227
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,159
I'm very type A OCD much like Ron was as

228
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,159
well so we really clicked in that sense

229
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,719
I mean he's still uh one of my best

230
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:03,919
friends to this day uh love him dearly

231
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,600
wonderful man and really when people ask

232
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:09,039
me about my journey like how did you

233
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,079
become bubble man it started really with

234
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:14,559
Ron like Ron was the if I didn't meet

235
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,120
Ron I don't know if I would have ended

236
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,599
up on the same pathway that that I did

237
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,679
end up on with um here in in in the

238
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,079
canvas world so I'll just go through a

239
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,799
quick little history of these moments

240
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,559
with Ron you know just kept escalating

241
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,838
and he was facilitating all of this

242
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:34,039
exposure and all of this experience for

243
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,480
me to tap into from being at all these

244
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,639
different people's grows from seeing all

245
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,839
these different personalities and seeing

246
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,360
all the different things in those people

247
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:45,480
that weren't at the top of their game

248
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,800
projected and reflecting back to them in

249
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,440
their P plants through mites through

250
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:54,159
aphids through powdery mildew through

251
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,920
all of these different sicknesses that

252
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,879
the plants would have and you start

253
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,919
correlating them to these very specific

254
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,838
people cuz you know it was a very unique

255
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,958
experience to be able to go into 30 or

256
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,880
40 or 50 grows in a city in the '90s

257
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,119
where it was so highly illegal that

258
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:12,240
those people weren't even telling you

259
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,120
know their brother or their best friend

260
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,519
where their grow was and I was just

261
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,600
getting brought to all of them from Ron

262
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,839
you know Ron gave me Immediate street

263
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,440
cred with people that were like they

264
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,279
didn't know who I was I looked like I

265
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,440
was 12 and it probably made them very

266
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,720
very nervous growing cannabis in a city

267
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,200
where if you get caught you go to Stony

268
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,399
Mountain Penitentiary which is kind of

269
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,079
like the most extreme I we got to be

270
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,600
blessed for where we're at right now and

271
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,679
I know a lot of people complain about

272
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,159
the corporations and the the the

273
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:46,519
corporatization of cannabis and the over

274
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:48,799
regulations and all of this but it beats

275
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,839
being put in a cage for 10 years at a

276
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,000
time and it definitely beats being

277
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,480
pulled over at gunpoint on the side of

278
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,480
the road and taken and put in a cage

279
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,000
those things should have never happened

280
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,639
with cannabis so we do have to celebrate

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,278
the fact that we've gotten to a point

282
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,159
now where we can all enjoy cannabis

283
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:10,399
together at a beautiful Festival like

284
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:11,919
this and just uh give thanks be

285
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,198
grateful

286
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,958
um Ron sort of you know kept me going

287
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:18,838
down that pathway of like watching all

288
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,239
these people I I guess I didn't feel the

289
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,199
urge to grow as much of my own weed now

290
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,799
that I was spending you know 1215 hours

291
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:28,078
at a time Rah would come get me at like

292
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,278
7 or 8:00 at night and he'd drop me off

293
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,958
at like 10 or 11 the next morning we'd

294
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:33,919
just be going to grows all throughout

295
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:36,638
the night and he'd be helping them

296
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,639
figure out what was wrong with those

297
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,079
grows through that I ended up obviously

298
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,278
you know one of the best things Ron did

299
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:45,519
was he gave me cannabis of such a high

300
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:48,120
quality that suddenly people were like

301
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,440
that guy has good cannabis that guy over

302
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,240
there that guy Mark he he's got good

303
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,600
cannabis and so that's one of the

304
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,480
bonuses you know back back then Ron was

305
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,040
such an anomaly very few people grew

306
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,639
cannabis on the level that he grew it

307
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:06,919
and so having that also really bolstered

308
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:09,198
my ability to get into every group you

309
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,879
know from from high school what click

310
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:12,639
were you in oh I I don't know I wasn't

311
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,120
in a click I just sold weed to all of

312
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,919
them you know every click whichever they

313
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,560
were there's always weed smokers in each

314
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:21,919
of them and those are the ones that I

315
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:24,799
found I ended up eventually uh meeting a

316
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:28,278
pretty cool group of guys U Martin morav

317
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:31,399
Alex schi John guo Neil Chippendale

318
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:34,360
would be in there as well um in the

319
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,519
early days in Manitoba and we got it in

320
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,199
our heads as we were smoking cannabis

321
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:42,198
that we were going to try and get hemp

322
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:44,519
growing in our Province we sort of we

323
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:46,479
sort of started this was like 93 and we

324
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,720
start started doing research and finding

325
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,600
out that you know there are these

326
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,800
amendments in the drug and peace law

327
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:57,320
that was done back in like '

328
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:59,639
67 that if the THC is below. 3% 3 or

329
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,199
below that the classification of

330
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,680
marijuana would change to hemp and that

331
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:06,799
hemp would fall under a different set of

332
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,319
regulations that were not as stringent

333
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,078
so uh most of our supporters laughed at

334
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,920
us and told us we would get hemp growing

335
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:15,359
in the ground when hell freeze is over

336
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,519
but for those of you that have ever been

337
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,720
to Winnipeg know that a it is hell and B

338
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,360
that it absolutely does freeze over

339
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,199
every winter swear to God oh thank you

340
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,560
she hears my dry mouth my beautiful wife

341
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:31,559
of 35

342
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:41,679
years yes absolutely the

343
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,959
queen um so yeah we got into this whole

344
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:48,078
hemp activism thing we kind of realized

345
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:51,799
listen Winnipeg is not the place in 93

346
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:54,719
to be pushing the THC agenda or the

347
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:56,639
medical or the recreational all of ones

348
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,360
that we loved and believed in but we

349
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,159
thought we better come at this one from

350
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,079
a a far

351
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,519
angle and so we applied for hemp we

352
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:06,278
figured out a bunch of different things

353
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,320
long story short we basically got a

354
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:13,278
license an experimental license to grow

355
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:15,480
hemp in um 95 1995 we applied in '94 we

356
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,278
didn't get it that year there was only

357
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,600
two Canadians that got it that Year Joe

358
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,720
Strobel and Jeff Kim they were a tobacco

359
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,240
farmer and a lawyer from

360
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,360
Ontario but we ended up getting this

361
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,198
license and I'll never forget it because

362
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,680
we actually brought Ron to the field

363
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:32,719
when it was about 5 ft tall and we were

364
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,359
in my Volkswagen van and I drove him

365
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,800
right through the middle of the field

366
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,120
he'd only been out of prison for a while

367
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,000
but it brought tears to his eyes he

368
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,799
couldn't believe that we he was like

369
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,600
this looks like weed I'm like yeah it is

370
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:52,479
we sort of told a fib we sort of told

371
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,399
them that hemp was a distant cousin of

372
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,159
cannabis and uh because of that THC

373
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,318
percentage they um they accepted that

374
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,639
for whatever ever reason a lot of things

375
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:05,919
when it comes to regulation is not about

376
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:09,440
trying to make them see the light but it

377
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:11,838
is to speak the specific language that

378
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,040
unlocks the door that allows it to

379
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,600
happen uh and if you don't do that you

380
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,318
just you just bang your head against the

381
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,480
wall so we got this hemp license we grew

382
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:25,039
this hemp um I ended up moving away uh

383
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:28,079
to British Columbia soon after 96 uh my

384
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:30,439
wife and I we moved the west but my

385
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,599
partner kept at it and uh they built a

386
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,040
substantial thing with the hemp industry

387
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,319
in Manitoba they had a company called uh

388
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,439
Manitoba Harvest uh fresh hemp foods

389
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:42,159
which is you know the oil and the and

390
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,600
the seed that is available in all the

391
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,719
supermarkets that many of you have

392
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,278
probably purchased like that was a bunch

393
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,680
of just sort of stoned young teenager

394
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:54,000
guys sitting around dreaming a dream

395
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,000
that seemed impossible even to the

396
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,198
people who would share that dream with

397
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,639
us uh and we made it happen so it was uh

398
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:03,838
it was pretty incredible I moved out

399
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,160
west uh and linked up with the one

400
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,720
friend that I had out west I only really

401
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,839
knew one person uh and her name was

402
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:18,078
Hillary black and so she worked at hemp

403
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:20,519
BC uh for Mark Emory back in the day

404
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,078
and she was just really cool whenever we

405
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:23,959
showed up you know some of the other

406
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,000
people that work there kind of we we

407
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,959
just felt cuz we were you know Winnipeg

408
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,200
guys just these Prairie guys rolling in

409
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,720
we probably had strong Prairie accents

410
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,558
and just stuck out in a way that we

411
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,839
didn't realize we were sticking

412
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:41,160
out so we got a lot of the I'm too

413
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:44,079
school for uh I'm too cool for school

414
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,200
energy uh given back at us when we would

415
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,439
go to hemp BC cuz you know we you're

416
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,960
like we drive 25 hours to go to like

417
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,720
this this this

418
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,960
shop and um if no one cared it kind of

419
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,000
felt personal but Hillary cared and she

420
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,480
was always like y it's the wiip he hemp

421
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,279
guys what's up and we'd always have the

422
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,880
haze she's a big fan of the haze Ron of

423
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,158
course hooked me up with the haze that's

424
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,120
another

425
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:11,760
story um and so Hillary ended up uh you

426
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,839
know when I moved out to BC she was kind

427
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,200
of like in love with this guy Todd

428
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:19,000
McCormick and he was in Los Angeles

429
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,519
growing this huge in this huge mansion

430
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,679
um a big crop which was insane because

431
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,558
he was neighbors with Ronald

432
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,000
Reagan and uh no no it's it's worse they

433
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:32,399
got busted and so thank God Todd Hillary

434
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,159
wasn't there um but Todd did 5 years in

435
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,559
terminal Island um in

436
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:39,720
California um and he he's had cancer

437
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,558
multiple times and his spine is fused

438
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,519
together so he's like not that anyone

439
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:45,000
deserves to be in prison but it's harder

440
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,599
to be in prison when you have like

441
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,679
disabilities and you're and you're you

442
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:53,319
know somewhat [ __ ] up pardon my French

443
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,360
Renee B was also seen watering a plant

444
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:57,639
at that grow uh and they wanted to

445
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,558
extradite her she was up here in Canada

446
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,759
they wanted to put her in prison for a

447
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:04,519
mandatory minimum of 10 years because

448
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,879
they had one photo of her watering one

449
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,480
single cannabis plant out on uh the deck

450
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,840
at Todd's house so Hillary was trying to

451
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:16,839
figure out should I go live with Todd in

452
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:18,519
California or should I stay here in BC

453
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:21,678
and maybe you know she's like I have

454
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:23,400
this idea inspired by Valerie caral and

455
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,600
Dennis Pon and all the people that were

456
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,798
doing medical cannabis in California in

457
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,759
the early to mid 90s and Hillary was

458
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:31,240
like in fired by all of that she got

459
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:35,079
exposed to it through Grateful Dead

460
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,960
toour her and basically um was like I

461
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:39,519
want to start like a like a like a

462
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,558
dispensary you know but not a dispensary

463
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,279
and she'd be over at our house and I

464
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:45,519
remember her writing on a piece of paper

465
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,240
like these are the words I don't like

466
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,480
medical marijuana you know she went

467
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,960
through this whole list and then she's

468
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,798
like these are the words I do like

469
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,279
Cannabis Compassion and it became the BC

470
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:00,000
Compassion Club you know like boom I I

471
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:02,960
was one of the first Growers for the BC

472
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,079
Compassion Club uh and then through you

473
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,798
know my experience of selling cannabis

474
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:10,399
at the

475
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:12,158
time cuz I was pretty decent at it uh I

476
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,440
was able to help the club through that

477
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,919
experience I thought you know what what

478
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,200
I can do is when I'm out buying all this

479
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,840
cannabis I can kind of pull like small

480
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,159
lots of the nicest and just get it to

481
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:26,359
the club you know even at a loss because

482
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:30,120
it was like the Cannabis Compassion Club

483
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:33,279
started as

484
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:36,959
the most vulnerable people from our

485
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:39,079
society so there are the mentally ill

486
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,000
there are the homeless there are the

487
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:44,480
drug addicted and there are the

488
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,200
terminally ill and most of the time the

489
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,599
original members of the BC Compassion

490
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,400
Club checked all four boxes so these are

491
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,240
extremely vulnerable people no one in

492
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,720
their right mind was going to The

493
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,759
Compassion Club and being like like holy

494
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,440
[ __ ] I'm going to monetize this dude I'm

495
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,400
going to like I'm going to make so much

496
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,798
money selling weed to these people it's

497
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,880
not and so you know Hillary also for

498
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:13,319
many many many many years sort of

499
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,760
suffered the life of a popper because it

500
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,798
was always about helping these sort of

501
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,319
you know people that needed needed the

502
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:22,759
most help but that was an incredible

503
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,319
thing to be a part of um I was one of

504
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:28,359
the first medical cannabis court cases

505
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:30,960
for the BC Compassion Club I was coming

506
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:34,319
home with a little bit of flour really a

507
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:38,038
little bit compared to the day but 16 lb

508
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:40,079
or something and um I went through a

509
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:41,480
roadblock I think we might have also

510
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,199
been on mushrooms and it could have been

511
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,960
2 a.m. but that's neither here nor there

512
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,919
we went through this roadblock and to me

513
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,600
it seemed very set up and he had this

514
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,240
sort of you know clipboard and he was

515
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,678
letting cars through with without even

516
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,960
talking to them and then when I came up

517
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,278
he was like he just knew like I knew

518
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,640
someone had had had had

519
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:05,159
told um and so Hillary was like I'll be

520
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,120
testifying for you you know John Conroy

521
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,400
was my lawyer which was a completely

522
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,839
incredible experience um towards the end

523
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,400
or towards the middle John uh was being

524
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:18,038
asked by the lawyer and the you know his

525
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,440
the prosecutor and the judge what's a

526
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:23,119
good day for the next court case and the

527
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:27,278
and the his learned friend says uh oh

528
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:30,038
November 22nd uh such and such a year uh

529
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:31,880
98 I guess it was and John's like h no

530
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:34,599
your honor that won't be good for me

531
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,159
leans back into my ear and says because

532
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:40,240
I'll be going to the Cannabis Cup in

533
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:42,960
Amsterdam with my client we were going

534
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,759
to Amsterdam together in November of

535
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,400
that year which we did and it was an

536
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:50,558
awesome trip stayed at the hotel Toren

537
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,240
next to the Anne Frank house but um yeah

538
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,079
so I ended up kind of going through that

539
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,798
whole court case the club was amazing

540
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,759
all the people at the club lots of

541
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,558
patients that I had known from day one

542
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:03,038
we're like coming I would send like a

543
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,678
school bus or a bus to go pick up any

544
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,679
people that wanted to come and show

545
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,080
support and then I would also like

546
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,320
donate flour just be like you know

547
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,759
here's an eighth or a quarter like just

548
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,158
every time they rolled up i' I'd give

549
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,319
them some flour because I knew how

550
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,080
important it was which we did also

551
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:23,639
through all the holidays and

552
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:26,278
whatnot but um ended up getting no fine

553
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,038
no time the judge ordered my money be

554
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:31,759
given back and the most intense part of

555
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:35,079
it was the prosecuting attorney who was

556
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:37,240
a total prosecutor cowboy boots like I

557
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,798
just he was just like the the the

558
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,558
Texan um prosecutor and John and him had

559
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:46,599
known each other for 25 years at this

560
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:50,000
point in time and at one point you know

561
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:53,719
this prosecutor comes up to the John and

562
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,400
tells him look so and so our good buddy

563
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,360
is in the hospital and is dying of

564
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,600
cancer and after listening listening to

565
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:02,158
this whole case which was all about the

566
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:05,079
medical use of cannabis and why it

567
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,320
should be accessible which is why when

568
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:09,278
medical cannabis was allowed and they

569
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,879
didn't bust them all that the judge said

570
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:14,278
in my case if we're going to allow

571
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,919
medical cannabis then we can't expect it

572
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:19,880
to fall from the sky like Mana it has to

573
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,960
come from somewhere and this is what

574
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,120
opened up

575
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,079
transportation of medical cannabis in

576
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:29,038
Canada this court case so yeah no fine

577
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:31,480
no time judge ordered my money be given

578
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:34,240
back I did catch a felony for it which I

579
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,200
got scrubbed years later um but I never

580
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,558
looked at it as a negative I thought you

581
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,558
know what this was incredible work that

582
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,278
Hillary did I felt blessed to just be

583
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:46,879
allowed to be a part of that work that

584
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:48,839
she was doing and once I got busted I

585
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,278
couldn't really sell weed anymore even

586
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,599
though I probably could have but to me

587
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,319
the way I knew the game it was like nah

588
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,759
I can't really do this anymore it's like

589
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,720
the maybe I'm a heat scorer maybe maybe

590
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,960
maybe they're watching me I don't know

591
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,440
right in the end they weren't and I

592
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,159
could have probably kept doing it but

593
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,798
instead I had to come to a Crossroads I

594
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:10,840
was really good at something and able to

595
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,879
make money doing it but now I couldn't

596
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:15,519
do it at all cold turkey and I had to

597
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,559
figure out another way to maintain

598
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:20,278
paying for the lifestyle that I had

599
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,918
acquired which was very different from

600
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:23,919
the one I grew up in Winnipeg so this

601
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,600
was like okay I got to get out there and

602
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,360
I got to figure this out and so I had

603
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:32,319
heard about this B system a two bag a

604
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:35,558
two bag water hash system from Amsterdam

605
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,519
I'd seen it actually um and I thought

606
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:40,798
wow you know what I could sell that I

607
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:43,278
could sell that system and so I went to

608
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,440
Amsterdam uh and I met with the woman

609
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,319
who I thought at the time who had

610
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,080
created this bag system in fact she was

611
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:51,158
just selling the bag system I would

612
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:55,839
learn the true history later through an

613
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:57,840
insane 5year long um patent lawsuit but

614
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,079
basically I went to Amsterdam tried to

615
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,000
get into selling these bags for her but

616
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,639
kind of rubbed her the wrong way that

617
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,679
day I don't know if you know a lot of

618
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Dutch people especially ones that own

619
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,919
coffee shops but they deal with a lot of

620
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,919
Americans and sometimes at the end of

621
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,840
the week they've dealt with too many and

622
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,960
it's like they're intense and so she

623
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,240
kind of like lashed out on me I was

624
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,399
there to buy like 500 to a th000 of

625
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,599
these two bag kits and I I came home

626
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:24,879
super bummed cuz I was I really thought

627
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,158
this is what we can invest the little

628
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,799
bit of money that we have left and start

629
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:32,840
a whole company with and uh I came home

630
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:35,480
devastated and my wife was like why

631
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:38,278
don't we just make our own and I was

632
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,038
like what do you mean make our own she's

633
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:42,200
like yeah we could just sew them and you

634
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:46,200
could just sell them and so that was the

635
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:48,200
birth of fresh headies and bubble bags

636
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,880
and that's really where I chose the

637
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,840
silly moniker bubble man to promote this

638
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,159
concept and I don't know maybe there's

639
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,359
people here that don't know what bubble

640
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:59,278
bags are that scares me if you if you

641
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,398
don't but I'll tell you it's just a

642
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:03,640
simple bag system with screen bottoms

643
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:06,639
that allow you to use water and ice to

644
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,559
isolate the resin glands from the plant

645
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,960
to create a very very concentrated pure

646
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,960
pure pure version of

647
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,519
hashish and we had great great luck with

648
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,119
uh with that company and with the whole

649
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:26,558
process uh going online and selling it

650
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:29,639
creating an online business in like 99

651
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:32,000
2000 like right when that sort of scene

652
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:35,159
started it was like digital cameras were

653
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,240
just coming out online uh services to

654
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,399
take credit cards everything was sort of

655
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,480
colliding simultaneously for a lot of

656
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:44,879
different people to Pivot and switch

657
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:48,159
into you know web-based business and we

658
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,880
created this company and uh Wow Bubble

659
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:54,519
Bags really took off it was uh it was

660
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,519
mindblowing how much it took off and

661
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:59,679
what how how it just

662
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,120
changed everything like suddenly and and

663
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,159
I'll tell you the whole reason I wanted

664
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:07,798
to do that was because I saw John Conroy

665
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,799
take a paper bag full of money that if I

666
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:11,079
had gotten pulled over with it like 5

667
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:13,918
minutes earlier they would have been

668
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:16,359
like this is proceeds of crime he takes

669
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,960
that paper bag he goes to the bank and

670
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:21,278
just gives it to them because he's a

671
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,519
respective lawyer and they just cash

672
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:26,880
that money into his bank and I'm like

673
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,000
holy [ __ ] so instead of selling weed to

674
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,919
get money

675
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,398
I could sell something that people use

676
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,720
with weed to get money but I'm not

677
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:37,398
involved in the weed part of it and that

678
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,759
was another part of bubble bags I

679
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:41,839
thought if I can get money cuz here's

680
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,319
the thing even during a recession people

681
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,759
who sell weed are still making money

682
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,759
people who have weed money are like yeah

683
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:50,079
I'll buy some bubble bags for 300 bucks

684
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:51,839
like [ __ ] I want to make some hash yeah

685
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,720
I'll buy a Tumblr I'll buy a you know

686
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:57,079
like people who are deep into cannabis

687
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,120
have all the toys have all the tools if

688
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:02,398
you will and so I figured well this is

689
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:04,000
if I can create a tool and it's not that

690
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:05,959
we created it but we definitely

691
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,679
pioneered and bettered it two bags

692
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,880
weren't enough we have an eight bag

693
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,640
system now and the way it came about was

694
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,840
just uh it was just all of that timing

695
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,320
colliding simultaneously me getting

696
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:21,599
busted and it really led me to believe

697
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:24,038
too that um when you're manifesting your

698
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:27,959
future they always say oh it'll come in

699
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:30,640
ways you least expect it it's like so

700
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,399
many people spend enormous amounts of

701
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,799
time and energy manifesting a future

702
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:40,918
that they allow to pass them by because

703
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:43,038
they're so stuck on recognizing what

704
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:45,960
that manifestation should look like they

705
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:48,919
think it's an opportunity but it almost

706
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,720
always represents itself as an obstacle

707
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,240
at first and so for me to be able to go

708
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,720
through a roadblock years later and see

709
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,759
Constable John low the guy that busted

710
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,440
me with the Compassion Club weed and to

711
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:05,079
thank him and be like dude I I am not

712
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,120
upset with you in any way literally like

713
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:10,240
you helped change and pivot my life I

714
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:11,398
think I might have given him one jab I I

715
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,960
think I might have said there are

716
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:18,479
literally tons of hashes being made all

717
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:22,480
around the world thanks to

718
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,480
you yeah tons so I don't know uh how

719
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,120
much more time I have left that kind of

720
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,679
leads me uh it's 11:55 is anyone

721
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:32,199
organizing this at all or should I just

722
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,559
talk for a little bit longer yeah yeah

723
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,240
all right we'll keep talking I'll keep

724
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:41,079
going for a bit um so yeah and Bubble

725
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,640
Bags just by 2002 from 99 to 2002 it was

726
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:46,839
a Hustle but by

727
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:49,759
2003 it was substantial it was like

728
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:51,480
money coming in bags going out and more

729
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:53,359
importantly and I'll tell you another

730
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,278
time that I that it was pivotal for me

731
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:59,719
that I really knew that this was going

732
00:30:56,278 --> 00:31:03,200
to be serious was one of my first

733
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:06,519
customers was a woman from Indiana and I

734
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,240
mean this is 99 do you know how illegal

735
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:12,759
cannabis is in Indiana in 1999 like it

736
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,720
is go to prison time let me tell you so

737
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:18,240
she's like this like Middle America

738
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,200
Church woman like just very straight and

739
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,599
very just like she's like I saw your

740
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,759
ad I don't I'm not sure that what I if I

741
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:29,000
understand it correctly but basically

742
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:31,720
what you're tool can do is make a

743
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,880
purified medicine with with with

744
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,639
marijuana she said and so I said yes

745
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,519
basically and so she bought a small set

746
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:42,079
of

747
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:45,679
bags her father was very sick he was 86

748
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:49,759
years old and he had wasting syndrome so

749
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,440
he weighed a very very very very like 87

750
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,079
LBS or something kind of what you weigh

751
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,360
right before you pass

752
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:59,000
away and so she had heard that cannabis

753
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:00,959
and I think she even saw it on a movie

754
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,558
or something like the munchies and kind

755
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,278
of like why would they make that joke

756
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,119
well cuz when you eat when you smoke

757
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:07,919
cannabis it gives you the munchies right

758
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:11,119
this is the generalization doesn't give

759
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:15,080
me the munchies but everyone's different

760
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:17,038
um so don't let me lose where my train

761
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:22,359
of thought was

762
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:26,398
going Indiana yes thank you um

763
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:28,959
Harvard Indiana woman um so she buys the

764
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:30,759
bags she sends me this crazy letter like

765
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,600
this is how long ago this was right she

766
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:35,319
sent me a letter and she a handwritten

767
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,558
letter and basically said told me this

768
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:39,918
whole story she said look I went I was

769
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:43,480
like out on the streets buying like an

770
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,600
ounce of marijuana I was so terrified so

771
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,679
she gets this weed she goes home she

772
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,480
bought her bubble bags in

773
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,000
99 she's like more advanced than most

774
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,558
hardcore cannabis users in the country

775
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,480
and she has no relationship with it

776
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:59,000
whatsoever she has the love of her

777
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,720
father and the worry of losing him and

778
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,240
so she she makes him the bubble I don't

779
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,159
know if she dried it properly or what

780
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,159
not but she put it in his corn cob pipe

781
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:11,000
this is how old this [ __ ] was he

782
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:15,440
had a corn cob

783
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,679
pipe and he puffed this bubble and then

784
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:23,240
she's like and he ate a whole McCain's

785
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:26,038
chocolate cake that night which is

786
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:29,079
hilarious but it's also what you did

787
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:31,759
it's also like oh oh right it's both of

788
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:33,439
those things and I think I reacted both

789
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,319
of those ways when I read the letter I

790
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,278
was like holy [ __ ] that's crazy this is

791
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:41,359
like I just thought it would be cool to

792
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:43,919
let people smoke great hash but there's

793
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,678
implications that go deeper into this

794
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,880
right which is that

795
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,639
whole Compassion Club relationship of

796
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,360
because cannabis has sort of two sides

797
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:54,158
there're this recreational which I

798
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:57,599
really call

799
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:00,000
recreational preventative it's the the

800
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,759
preventative medicine and then there's

801
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,919
the medicinal which is more serious

802
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,599
usually when Once people are like really

803
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,720
focused on cannabis as a medicine

804
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,878
they're fairly sick you know and that's

805
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,398
what I hope to see change in the future

806
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:14,398
where we don't have to wait till we have

807
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:16,239
stage three colon cancer to decide to

808
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,519
take cannabinoids there's sort of this

809
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,039
way that you can use it as a

810
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:23,759
preventative and I mean in my opinion

811
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:25,159
you know I was watching TV the other

812
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,960
night cuz my wife and I are staying at a

813
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,159
hotel and we saw these Pharmaceutical

814
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,599
commercials with like the most insane

815
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,919
side effects and I thought holy [ __ ]

816
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,000
imagine the only side effect cannabis

817
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:39,799
has is the feeling of

818
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
euphoria getting high like that is the

819
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,800
greatest medicine ever so yeah it's um

820
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,559
it's been it's been great to me

821
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,639
throughout these last 30 years of my

822
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:52,679
life it's been really cool to be allowed

823
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:55,280
to be in a position where we were this

824
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,559
Catalyst for hash making around the

825
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,160
world and um it's it's it's something

826
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:03,480
that I've been passionate about for a

827
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:05,799
very long time um I do a party called

828
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,838
Legends of hash I used to do it in

829
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,599
Amsterdam for many many years and I've

830
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:12,599
done it in Barcelona and I've done it in

831
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,119
Vancouver and even did one in Jamaica

832
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:19,480
but now we do them in Los Angeles and uh

833
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:24,400
they're really um a bridge to the

834
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:27,599
old um history of hashish and you know

835
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,280
paying homage to how that came about and

836
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,519
understanding these different places

837
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,920
that people went to use and smok cashish

838
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:36,320
and how different cultures grow and

839
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,838
collect and smoke cashish and sort of

840
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,880
paying homage to that but at the same

841
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:44,239
time bringing in the new and showing

842
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,519
this new methodology of like what we can

843
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:50,639
do when we increase that science of

844
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:53,400
extraction and isolation to get you know

845
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:56,118
these things that really didn't exist 50

846
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,760
to to 60 years ago that that now do

847
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:01,200
today so so um yeah that's kind of one

848
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:05,520
of my ways to pay back annually have a

849
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:08,759
really great party 300 350 people

850
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,759
hashish is the focus for the entire

851
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,680
party and there's a little competition

852
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,400
in there as well that people do and sort

853
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:16,719
of always enjoy that it's it's it's a

854
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,760
good time hopefully one day we'll be

855
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:19,759
able to bring it back to British

856
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,519
Columbia I guess in the

857
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:25,519
meantime I don't know if I have anything

858
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:27,920
else to

859
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:30,039
say I I think that's

860
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,358

861
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:33,358
everybody thank you
