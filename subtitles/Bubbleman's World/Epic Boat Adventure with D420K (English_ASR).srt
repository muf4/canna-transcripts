00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,280
got a touch and last night on the denail

122
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,638
look at that one oh what did you do lean

123
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,638
over it yeah I was like I was trying

124
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,879
trying to read something and I and I

125
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,280
heard it just it get sizzled longer than

126
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,478
it normally should than it normally does

127
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:11,478
and it it got me good but I put some of

128
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:13,279
that um Horatio's oil yeah I put some of

129
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:14,758
that on top of it oh yeah that's a good

130
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,079
and it instantly stopped the burning and

131
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,400
everything like that it actually helped

132
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,318
out a lot so it's fully activated so it

133
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,159
makes sense that it would you know and

134
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,879
you know I I do feel two bong reps are

135

right now so it's not a lake it's quite

166
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,800
different um it's a [ __ ] total

167
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,439
[ __ ] system man a life system

168
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,439
underneath the one that could swallow up

169
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,759
like that Island oh instantly you know

170
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,478
what I mean so that's the crazy thing

171
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,360
about the ocean right now we're at about

172
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,800
600 ft for depth we're sitting about 600

173
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,639
ft of water you ever dive down and see

174
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,199
if you can hit the ball bom I've never

175
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:08,400
dove Down Deeper Than 145 ft 145 that's

176
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,639
it yeah 145 ft most people knar out at

177
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:15,158
about 100 ft they get uh uh the nitrogen

178
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:17,400
Narcosis I went 285 yeah no I was going

179
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:19,478
to say it's not impossible some people

180
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,198
have done it it can be done and it

181
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:24,519
involves different sorts of things like

182
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,598
decompressing and I just just a slow

183
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:31,240
process to me a deep dive was like 140

184
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:33,360
145 ft that was like it's dark it's cold

185
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,360
and it's scary it's it's scarier you

186
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,479
don't have as good of a visibility and

187
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,560
most people use their oxygen at such an

188
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,200
accelerated rate that if you go down to

189
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,119
those depths you'll really only have a

190
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,240
few minutes to stay down there unless

191
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,639
you're some super you know if you're

192
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,120
from Finland or Norway they they have

193
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:54,159
cold Waters there and those guys they

194
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,679
can they always preserve their breath

195
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,319
and any diving that I've ever done

196
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,439
around the world like in Thailand in

197
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,560
warm Waters yeah those guys will come

198
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,519
come up with 80% of their tanks when

199
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:07,599
everyone else has like 20% left yeah

200
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:10,159
when I did diving in Mexico we did a 40

201
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,399
foot just on Coral Reef and stuff and I

202
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:15,439
kept my it it was it was such nice calm

203
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,839
proper breathing that I I lost it down

204
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,560
there longer than the instructor

205
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,079
actually and he went up and I was the

206
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,199
last one on the bottom yeah well you're

207
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:25,639
from Canada yeah see if you're from a

208
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,399
cold area you will likely be able to

209
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:30,439
preserve your breath more in warm Waters

210
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,360
than people that are from those Waters

211
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,160
or yeah I guess cuz it's cold for them

212
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,200
eh well it's just like yeah they might

213
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,719
get down there it it's just different

214
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,519
all I know is that makes sense when you

215
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,240
can hold your breath and can control it

216
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,959
in colder water you will be able to use

217
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,879
even less breath in warmer water well

218
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,078
the guys when I was I didn't want to put

219
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,159
the wet suit on I just dove in my shorts

220
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:52,359
and they're like you're not going in a

221
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,958
wet suit it's it's it's cold in there

222
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,959
like it's cold like [ __ ] as if are you

223
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,119
kidding me well yeah I'll do this rip

224
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,439
here and uh yeah dude rip it up

225
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,120
then we're going to drive to hacket Bay

226
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,920
on Gambier Island right behind us which

227
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,919
is kind of cool that the boat is has

228
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:10,958
Twisted around now and uh it's showing

229
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:14,519
us pocket oh it's showing us Gambier

230
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:17,719
Island as well as parts of the Sunshine

231
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,720
Coast of

232
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,199
course of the

233
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,120
ship man if it's 9:00 and it's this hot

234
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,000
it's probably going to be 30° today

235
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,000
Celsius it's what is that like 100° F

236
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:49,480
mhm B

237
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:52,039
Zoom all right yes all right that

238
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,680
worked there it is yeah I'm feeling

239
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:58,639
super iy right now ready to

240
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:01,638
uh to get back in the uh in the driver's

241
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:05,959

243
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,638
just

244
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,240
ripping you can just fly in this boat

245
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,879
it's real nice you know on a day like

246
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,360
today it's safe to go fast also another

247
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,799
thing you got to know about the ocean is

248
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,600
it's not a lake so you have a lot more

249
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,759
things to watch out for out here dead

250
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,680
heads being a huge ordeal big logs

251
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,399
sometimes they sink and they float just

252
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,039
up below the surface so those ones you

253
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,720
can't even see there's nothing you can

254
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,000
do but you can keep your eye out for

255
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,759
anything else and it's uh it's not the

256
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,399
kind of boating where you're you're

257
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,679
yammering away to your friends and

258
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:43,159
looking away like ocean riding is like

259
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,199
you are white knuckling and staring at

260
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:48,000
where you're

261
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,120
going you do not want to hit hit a a

262
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,519
tree out

263
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,120
here and there's so many of them I mean

264
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,759
look at the forest that's surrounding us

265
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,039
on all these islands those trees break

266
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,439
they fall they come into the water they

267
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:03,919
float around some sometimes trees break

268
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:07,760
uh free from uh the log jams that they

269
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,519
tow up to the paper mile up the the

270
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,799
sound there

271
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,519
so all right well D and I are going to

272
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:18,359
chill out for a bit and just relax and

273
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:23,360
enjoy the buzz we'll get going in a bit

274
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,360
enjoy the Morning Buzz I really set

275
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:46,039
all right so we've just uh crossed the

276
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,120
house sound we were over

277
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:51,719
there and now we're over here this was

278
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,720
literally only minutes ago we were over

279
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,160
there minutes wellow we did sit for

280
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,680
quite a while and just enjoy the

281
00:12:55,159 --> 00:13:03,399
medication oh man like both of us lean

282
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:05,359
back eyes closed smiling relaxed relaxed

283
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,320
enjoying the sun on the face and the

284
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,399
beautiful mother nature the in front of

285
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,278
us like this is love nature at her best

286
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,000
isn't it beautiful yep so this is the

287
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,799
backside of gambir islands and you know

288
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,078
all sorts of things to see here once

289
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:23,759
again Eagles seals sea lions uh the

290
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,239
Dolphins are often seen around this

291
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,240
island so that would be really cool if

292
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,519
we caught some Dolphins there's one of

293
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:35,240
those dead heads looks like an old

294
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:37,360
chal the old chal an old Irish

295
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,959
chal so yeah I'm sure there's some good

296
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,720
cliff jumping up here you can see up

297
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,599
there there's a rope with a little kind

298
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,120
of climb down there there's uh there's a

299
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,600
whole bunch of I think over here just

300
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,278
bouncing oh yeah ripping ripping like

301
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,600
five or six of them he yeah having fun

302
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,039
that's Bowen Island right there and

303
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,639
there's the ferry to the Sunshine

304
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,159
Coast what a beautiful day it's you know

305
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,440
that fair is halfway to the Sunshine

306
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,759
Coast right now we could be on the

307
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,720
Sunshine Coast in probably less than

308
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,800
half an hour we we eat the fair there

309
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,240
yeah we could although you'd be

310
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:14,240
surprised he's going damn near 40 40 m

311
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,839
hour I like the

312
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:29,519
dogwoods yeah those are um our beus

313
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,759
trees the the the the orange ones yeah

314
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,198
yep so those trees what I know about our

315
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,240
beus trees and they have a different

316
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:39,278
name down in the US I have know I know

317
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,879
of them as dog right well our buus

318
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:48,039
trees they lose their bark their their

319
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:50,320
bark H in the winter not their leaves oh

320
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,078
so that's why they're so smooth

321
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,360
throughout the winter they shed their

322
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:58,120
bark there's a seal up

323
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,800
ahead yeah there's his head come here

324
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,839
buddy

325
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:05,399
probably go down oh no that's a seal

326
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,839
yeah yeah probably go down when we go by

327
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,440
there's another one up front there are

328
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:13,440
UTS as well

329
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,440
going

330
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,039
guy dogs Sea Dogs yeah for

331
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,160
real so yeah you know as you get closer

332
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,440
to these islands you realize how

333
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:33,838
Majestic they are and how really big

334
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:37,040
they are from here it looks beautiful

335
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,040
but it doesn't look like

336
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:45,639
this and those our beus trees as you can

337
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,600
see grow right out of

338
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,919
rock serious

339
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,560
trees this little Bonsai sticking out

340
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:59,318
the front here is pretty sick too

341
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,318
sure Juniper or something

342
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,159
so you know also because it's the ocean

343
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,120
and they don't Mark everything I'm also

344
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,879
leery to go too close to the coast

345
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,799
because it's you know there could be a

346
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:13,078
rock and it's not really anyone's job to

347
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:15,639
say that there's a rock there now the

348
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,559
most for the captain to be aware of that

349
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,600
stuff that's it and you know apparently

350
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,518
I'm the captain so is that a bay in

351
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,800
there this is hawkett Bay this is the

352
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,720
first Bay there's three more Bays over

353
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:29,919
here which are oh something like Center

354
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,759
Bay West Bay

355
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,599
and I can't Long Bay so there's Long Bay

356
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,399
Center Bay and West Bay as well as

357
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,199
hacket Bay these are the three Bays of

358
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,480
gambir on this side nice lot of

359
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:44,479
population on this island there's a fair

360
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,480
amount of people living I mean nothing

361
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,360
compared to Bowen you know you

362
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,959
definitely can see houses and and

363
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,240
population in in most of the of the Bays

364
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,159
this is probably the quietest one yeah

365
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,399
it's uh what a peaceful place to live

366
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,639
though I that oh yeah dude everybody

367
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,240
knows everybody everybody helps out

368
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,160
everybody very community community

369
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,160
orientated probably and that sort of

370
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,160
thing a I would I would think so for

371
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,000
sure have to be it couldn't be

372
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,000
successful if it wasn't I couldn't see

373
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,599
it it's sure a beautiful place man I'll

374
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,599
tell you that much

375
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,240
abely lots of logs and TR me lots of

376
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,960
dead heads

377
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,640
yeah they often make their ways into the

378
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,400
Bays you got to be a little bit more

379
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,400
careful on the

380
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:46,759
entrances that must be for

381
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:49,599
uh not going in or going in those boys

382
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:51,480
there big ship yeah I'm not sure that

383
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,319
could be that could be where people have

384
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,000
boys for their own boats or it could be

385
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,519
it could have been where they did have a

386
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,440
a huge boat I don't know if it was in

387
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,918
this one or Long Bay they sunk recently

388
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,880
it was a big oh for AIP Marine

389
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:10,038
underwater sort of yeah some sort of

390
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:13,039
like build the exactly

391
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:15,319
exactly that would be neat to check out

392
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,519
hey let's open

393
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:20,079
this

394
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,599
sorry the bimin is so

395
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,359
low so yeah a hacket is a place where

396
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,719
people come usually with their boats to

397
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,319
camp out and sleep in the bay I think

398
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,759
there might only be a home or two in

399
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,759
here

400
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,919
I've CED out a few times on fishing

401
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,879

00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,480
I've brought you guys here one time

415
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,119
before with Flav we had a big Marcel

416
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,079
octopus piece and we had a session in

417
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,239
the bay here so I think uh we're going

418
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,399
to turn off the

419
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,519

420
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,200
session all right so we just noticed a

421
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,599
vessel pull up here and uh it's some

422
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,919
scuba divers so I thought that was

423
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,599
pretty cool as we were just talking

424
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,159

425
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,639
we've been sitting here for quite a

426
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:51,400
while now we've blown into the bay and

427
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,880
