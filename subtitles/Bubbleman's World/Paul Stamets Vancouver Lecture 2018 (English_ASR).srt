post Alice's company from granary is

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,829
wonderful medicinal mushrooms to

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,109
Canadians and we're also bringing most

7
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:22,178

you for joining us for his talk on the

23
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,210
of science I believe that year that he

24
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,280
won that it was him and me

25
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:16,509
venture of the digital camera so it was

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,099
a good company for them and for those of

27
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,760
you who follow these things he's also

28
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:23,759
not been immortalized in Star Trek

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,760

30
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:32,840
lieutenant Paul Stamets Astro mycologist

31
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,760
so without further ado give Paul Stamets

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:44,840
a warm

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:55,800

35
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:43,009
so we though as severe as that sounds

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:45,770
and the numbers are quite disturbing for

37
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:53,169
losing more than 30,000 species per year

38
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:53,170

winter oops our ancestors also found

46
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:57,129
that when you especially or so good with

47
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:58,990
my water lament that because of the

48
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:01,089
restriction of habitats these mushrooms

49
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:07,710
are becoming part of the fine the large

50
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:07,709
ones can make one smaller ones so

51
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,639
because

52
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:38,729
and so this is the Chinese of course in

53
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:41,069
except extremely important and it's a

54
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,680
massive trade that Mamadou mushrooms to

55
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:45,480
support with the police departments

56
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,400
specifically for that purpose but this

57
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:54,140
much also has other characteristics that

58
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:59,759
are very interesting it is identified

59
00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:03,539
against all sorts of planets very very

60
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,810
devastating agriculture in general but

61
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:10,530
moreover this also was used my client

62
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:13,949
fishermen to dry out flies so but they

63
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:15,809
would be fly fishing things like mr.

64
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:22,979
Snaith about different life so could

65
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:29,149
tackles like well this is also as other

66
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:31,950
very very unique properties and so the

67
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:35,569
biodiversity of my adversity of Kansai

68
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:35,569

this

that's what I mentioned are absolutely

73
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:44,819
critical for Cuba's survival as we

74
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:49,699
weren't forward with in the future

75
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:49,699
so here we go

76
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:56,259
okay so they

77
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,908
so

but a good sure is if my kids looks like

85
00:10:54,659 --> 00:11:02,789
a peach attracts burger birds people

86
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:04,889
animals and so is nutritious and then

87
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:08,519
might eat the piece of each pebble

88
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:21,198
stretch and ruminating with a neutral

89
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:21,198
form so they tend to be parachute so

90
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:29,508
spores germinate from the gills lots of

91
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:29,509
other parts of her and then my slim

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,619
[Music]

94
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:21,730
so these are my salons their stress

95
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:36,939
response and the mysoline wonderfully

96
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:43,590
articulated if there is a response every

97
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:43,590
grouse vanishes so there's always ways

98
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:50,289
and nutrients should they be surrounded

99
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:52,879
by soil not be interrupted or broken a

100
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:55,059
good friend of mine Patrick Hickey I

101
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:59,480
came up with in this is eluding here

102
00:12:55,059 --> 00:13:04,819
because these not three or four hours

103
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,200
and these are the ice now when we had

104
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,959
still photography look in the microscope

105
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:12,170
they couldn't see this but was amazing

106
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:15,049
is that the mycelium channels is nuclei

107
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:19,399
that Kampala Nubian actives I mentioned

108
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:27,399
before is to make yourself tip stupid

109
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:27,399
and so in the threat of my hands across

110
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:31,778

178
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:37,648
this we don't have enough time the

viewers be able to see that this is true

180
00:26:37,648 --> 00:26:46,729
but interesting we there is increased

181
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:46,730
evidence that speaks to their Genesis so

182
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:58,470
I'll show you the actual pictogram 7,000

183
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,890

Charlie decision see mr. demon as no

186
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:13,529
well in Mesoamerica so this day magic

187
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:15,570
mushrooms with the mid-nineteen well I

188
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:18,180
said suggest that this has led to the

189
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:22,970
formation of - I'd like that means and

190
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:28,610
there is the Bavarian beer to be sure di

191
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:31,769
1516 that made specifically by the

192
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:32,699
interview as well as had made with a

193
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:35,609
bunch of other plants

194
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:39,049
I think is a struggle to monotheism and

195
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:42,990
polytheism to Christianity and pagan

196
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:46,259
people celebrating nature and wiping the

197
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:49,890
forest but they calculated the church is

198
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:53,549
a twosome it's just lies attacks the

199
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:58,470
ability of citizens to offer

200
00:27:53,549 --> 00:28:02,159
consciousness so I think this is very

201
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:05,160
probable that a cycle activates of

202
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:07,940
Europe were specifically communities

reverse Buffalo and sequestration places

237

but there's more new species that use

00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:37,210
philosophy also that not good

239
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:39,909
and there's massive people collecting

240
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:42,550
them this it's worth paid enough

241
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:44,230
popularity to a large degree view and

242
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,269
then it was her we discovered by medical

243
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:56,469
researchers in particular Johns Hopkins

244
00:35:46,269 --> 00:36:01,949
Medical School has a better therapeutic

245
00:35:56,469 --> 00:36:01,949
way to deal with the pieces

248
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:07,150
so save the 27% decrease odds of past

249
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:07,150
year or stinking 20% because of

250
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:18,409
association but it can't be this study

251
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:22,719
just came out this past two months is

252
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:22,719
the increase for the nature relatedness

253
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:32,929
[Music]

254
00:37:51,670 --> 00:38:31,510
so this chemist and the FDA said no PTSD

255
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,510
affects so many the cops

256
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:36,549
so many people have PTSD

257
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:46,539
[Music]

258
00:38:49,230 --> 00:39:38,019
so this is well this means that induces

259
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:40,509
encourage and tracks people responsible

260
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:47,739
addition one fact these are leadership

261
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:50,430
skills so the clinical studies at John

262
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:50,429
Hopkins University

263
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:34,208

268
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:11,470
using a drum but about the ability of

269
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,690
Genesis and creativity greater

270
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:17,500
intellectual acumen being able to vote

271
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:21,309
to prevent dementia the idea to give

272
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:23,739
subthreshold those like a vitamin to be

273
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:27,159
able to increase their cognitive

274
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:29,109
abilities is extremely appealing so I

275
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:31,599
hope this have a genetic neurogenesis

276
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,950
and so this is a bit about what Wall

277
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:38,980
Street Journal many of you know about

278
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:44,699
this participate in this so cell cycle

279
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:48,679
mushrooms maybe the first part is also

280
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:51,759
extraordinarily great interest right now

plaques in the fear with virtual

288
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,860
Commission well there's been two

289
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,220
clinical sites in Japan specifically

290
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:38,730
showing my emotions improves

291
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:41,649
significantly hard work of endearment

292
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:44,849
concealer control studies and they

293
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:46,840
should increase instability cognition

294
00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:49,650
interesting winner is among three

295
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,940
compliance paid per day but

296
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,860
statistically significantly stop using

297
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:56,820
lights making these not only patients

298
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:59,980
then they mention like symptoms return

299
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:04,840
so landscape mushrooms contain these

300
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:07,900
compounds but the extraordinary industry

301
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,970
to be is when we did analysis for the

personally take it today this is

00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:11,300

the nerves

329
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:04,789
the idea is to excite and then drive the

neurogenic compounds of saliva and

331
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:11,420
erinaceus to the Durbin I think so

332
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:14,798
epigenetic neurogenesis so this is

333
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,798
extraordinarily interesting

334
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:25,899
we design to test this against that

00:48:22,389 --> 00:48:37,179
sub-threshold OSes there's no change in

336
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:39,818

337
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:45,129
was December that little island in my

339
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:55,450
now this needs to be very very personal

340
00:48:48,539 --> 00:49:00,960
because of my experience I feel

ours like plating from 1894 this nation

this of the ravings of the sea of return

01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:09,160
makers and business people here do this

423
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:12,519
for a better night so please forgive me

424
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:15,639
but Raymond is specifically in the quest

01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:18,280
to finding her genitalium as a woman and

no one could help rabies here on the sea

her homeless man

01:00:24,480 --> 01:01:01,199
I was carrying the apology to the Greek

01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:33,809
there's research this is a pictograph

that was on that rock where we found the

America Tuesdays so we're able to get

these cultures

443
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:42,599
the culture and then we began a very

444
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:45,119
immediate stinking process of what's

445
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:56,309
called by al-qaeda fractionation taking

446
01:01:45,119 --> 01:02:00,319
two solvents taking a water at different

447
01:01:56,309 --> 01:02:00,320
solvents will separate out different

448
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:10,889
situations but we did is that we would

449
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:13,110
try the excitation we dig out the two

450
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:14,779
fractions and then we test these of them

451
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:17,910
against tuberculosis

452
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:19,620
whichever one tested longer that we do

453
01:02:17,909 --> 01:02:22,259
gunpoint on the decision tree

454
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:23,489
let's follow both solvent sequence to

455
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:27,150
see if you find a match suffice

456
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:30,719
constitutive we did this we work for

457

literally hundreds of thousand dollars

460
01:02:33,289 --> 01:02:42,079
we found anti-tuberculosis compounds

461
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:44,629
resident in the area now this is really

462
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:51,940

the buyers know my defensive programming

466
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:03,619
would work with them we also did my

without imagination and the course of my

468
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:16,789

469

520
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:53,380
can make precursors for 24/7 by

521
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:58,310
stimulating blue light my silly come on

522
01:09:53,380 --> 01:10:00,350
so this house is all independent that an

523
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:03,410
experience during our research I

524
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:06,490
attended a botanist and I'll come back

525
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:08,989
to this is a second probably the most of

526
01:10:06,489 --> 01:10:11,359
the world is Turkey to mr. batas

527
01:10:08,989 --> 01:10:14,269
carcinoma is called where's the car

528
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:17,599
because of the variability over turkey

529
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:23,620
tails are well known throughout Asia for

530
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:23,620
supporting medians and we

so here's a video system and this is

01:11:40,649 --> 01:11:48,328
turkey tail this is known to be very

537
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:52,050
personally in June 2009 with my 84 year

538
01:11:48,328 --> 01:11:54,238
old something very serious to talk to

539
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:56,489
you about but you're always so busy

540
01:11:54,238 --> 01:12:00,019
it's a terrible

541
01:11:56,488 --> 01:12:03,569
mom mom was wrong he's a very kind

542
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:05,280
gentle person she doesn't work and my

543
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:08,219
mother's in the future they're just not

544
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:10,019
seen a doctor since 1968 she said my

545
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:11,039
right breast is five times the size of

546
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:14,070
my Mountain

547
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:16,590
I have six swollen lymph glands the size

548
01:12:14,069 --> 01:12:18,420
of walnuts that her boy started shaking

549
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:21,719
and I monitored that I started crying

550
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:23,520
why did you tell me sooner we spent a

551
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:25,829
large part tuned that the suasion

552
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,920
freshman to clinic in Seattle the

553
01:12:25,829 --> 01:12:32,340
ecologist examined her and among second

554
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:35,279
examination she had 5.5 x and their

555
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:37,079
diameter tumor it metastasized and

556
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:40,619
what's her sternum I went to her liver

557
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:43,289
see it Stage four breast cancer the

558
01:12:40,619 --> 01:12:45,210
doctor gave her less than three months

559
01:12:43,289 --> 01:12:47,159
to live as did it here's the second

560
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:50,369
worst case of breast cancer she's seen

561
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:52,289
as about 30 min 20 years of practice we

562
01:12:50,369 --> 01:12:54,300
had a circle of family meeting beneath

563
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:56,729
the bone through this my mom announced

564
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:58,920
that she got a pine casket that she was

565
01:12:56,729 --> 01:13:02,759
one when she did fine because she is one

566
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:05,500
man but then notice of no you do

567
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:08,300
whatever it is you can't

568
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:10,430
but this interesting study not to detail

569
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:13,159
mushrooms ever steer chemical slowing my

570
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:16,820
mind to try and fit he does and that's

571
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:20,019
my son's find us succeed he was prone

day for the morning before the that was

575
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:35,530
in June 2009 and today my mother has no

576
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:35,529
detectable tumors

580
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:15,270
that was 2009 hey you saw my mother

581
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:16,329
yesterday she's almost 93 years of image

582
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:24,639
[Music]

583
01:14:16,329 --> 01:14:29,960
[Applause]

584
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:33,618
tumors cured with positions you know you

585
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:35,420
know consider it to be a very good sign

586
01:14:33,618 --> 01:14:37,609
and so when she got the news super

587
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:57,469
position that she no longer had to be on

588
01:14:37,609 --> 01:14:59,420
treatment so the results of our study

589
01:14:57,469 --> 01:15:01,849
ever summarized here there's a base one

590
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:04,699
study statistically significantly

591
01:15:01,849 --> 01:15:08,599
increases see dat empty cells the

592
01:15:04,698 --> 01:15:11,210
p-value you know about statistics and as

593
01:15:08,599 --> 01:15:14,510
point zero five or less this excellent

594
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:18,019
point zero one was really good this is a

595
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:19,630
point zero zero three and higher doses

596
01:15:18,019 --> 01:15:21,940
of turkey tail

597
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:24,579
with a more rapid recovery and besides

598
01:15:21,939 --> 01:15:27,069
it in case I like to think of damage

599
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:29,109
make the kid with therapy or radiation

600
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:34,359
therapy which was that combination

601
01:15:29,109 --> 01:15:35,979
therapy or a smooth determination so

602
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:39,099
this is published and Phase one clinical

603
01:15:35,979 --> 01:15:41,319
trial periodontal edge of the journal

604
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:45,070
and then a number of other particles

605
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:47,739
came out that extra detail combined with

606
01:15:45,069 --> 01:15:51,299
Herceptin makes herself that work better

607
01:15:47,739 --> 01:15:53,559
and then the to interview some of the

608
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:56,949
oncologist of the treated my mother and

609
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:59,080
also with me and they all God was told

610
01:15:56,949 --> 01:16:01,420
via was interviewed and answers because

611
01:15:59,079 --> 01:16:03,340
the questions I've gotten ass

612
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:06,600
she never suffered from captain grant

cyclic wood

01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:55,060
well it decreased response percent yes

622
01:17:52,630 --> 01:18:00,489
the immune system cause allergic

623
01:17:55,060 --> 01:18:02,170
response response is great so that's

624
01:18:00,489 --> 01:18:04,539
really really interesting to me because

625
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:18,300
in particular with polyphenols in these

626
01:18:04,539 --> 01:18:20,769
lipids so it's kind of a complex

627
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:23,130
there are research results this past

628
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:23,130
year

629
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:33,369
the baby blue pants will be separated we

630
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:37,119
found five polyphenols highly active

631
01:18:33,369 --> 01:18:40,140
against the human papillomavirus HPV 45%

632
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:42,550
been having sex five billion viruses

633
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:47,110
often times that lead to cervical cancer

634
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:49,930
esophageal cancer and this is the actual

635
01:18:47,109 --> 01:18:52,179
if you follow my cursor here this is the

636
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:55,720
director of NIH specification health

637
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:58,630
highly have these five polyphenols that

638
01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:02,159
were invented miss Kathleen Dominicans

639
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:09,520
were extraordinarily active against HPV

640
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:14,019
viruses so this is something that I'm

641
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:20,770
really excited that this past month the

642
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:23,980
u.s. rules against HPV and so this is

643
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:26,560
also lesson these extracts now at stake

644
01:19:23,979 --> 01:19:29,169
no message here is that my son offers

645
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:31,090
you a deep welcome you know active

646
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:33,220
substances antiviral substances

647
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:35,409
antibacterial substances you can

648
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:38,140
fraction

649
01:19:35,409 --> 01:19:39,880
you can also faction away the complexity

650
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:42,579
of the ecological benefits that gives

651
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:45,489
you as a whole so if your complex

652
01:19:42,579 --> 01:19:45,939
organism benefit of a complexity of

653
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:50,380
nature

654
01:19:45,939 --> 01:19:56,769
so now full circle that could be

655
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:59,949
stronger this is before and the use of

656
01:19:56,770 --> 01:20:03,910
we need to preserve the questions we

657
01:19:59,949 --> 01:20:06,880
discussed but many people may not fully

658
01:20:03,909 --> 01:20:07,960
appreciate the benefit that needs global

659
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:11,890
food supply

660
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:17,260
I was security the world now in the

661
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:20,170
danger but 1 million beehives the world

662
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:25,690
China be number one serving you this one

663
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:30,159
Argentina and the wasp of bees is a

664
01:20:25,689 --> 01:20:34,299
direct threat the food biosecurity that

665
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:38,769
is increasingly a problem

666
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:42,340
so when friend of mine that we should've

667
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:44,860
known baker came to be and do my other

668
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:47,110
research with insects and against fire

669
01:20:44,859 --> 01:20:50,049
horses he said well what can he do to

670
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:53,019
help the bees and so I started focusing

671
01:20:50,050 --> 01:21:06,099
my attention on bees now this is the B

672
01:20:53,020 --> 01:21:10,599
spline and flowers and the absence of

673
01:21:06,099 --> 01:21:13,000
is due to a confluence of factors we see

674
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:15,460
these on flowers the last days of their

675
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,929
lives be flanked couple days for

676
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:20,170
pollination used to be other couples of

677
01:21:16,929 --> 01:21:22,810
nine days and that was five so this week

678
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:27,789
we go about a half carat is here so this

679
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:33,159
is why anybody can bees and bees this is

680
01:21:27,789 --> 01:21:37,260
what you Theresa Clark looks like well

681
01:21:33,158 --> 01:21:39,698
there's a memorandum came out the wallet

682
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:42,429
specifies the stressors are classic

683
01:21:39,698 --> 01:21:44,469
needs to die poor nutrition slack

684
01:21:42,429 --> 01:21:47,050
enforcement mites viruses the identity

685
01:21:44,469 --> 01:21:50,590
noise but this chart really makes a call

686
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:56,560
here in the United States is the loss of

01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:01,560
so what I'm studying this problem with

696
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:05,359
the bees and look together and thinking

697
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,360
about an article came out

698
01:23:12,078 --> 01:23:17,399
about beekeeping when these bees

699
01:23:14,939 --> 01:23:25,138
disappears collectors it's a dead leaves

700
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:28,019
from behind one thing even if she's dead

701
01:23:25,139 --> 01:23:30,868
bees but 32-bit developes as well and

702
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:33,360
they don't come out but turns out my NY

703
01:23:30,868 --> 01:23:37,109
City the does appended beehives about

704
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:39,269
peach America now the Americana comes to

705
01:23:37,109 --> 01:23:42,210
the delignification of wood it's also

706
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:46,710
lots of grains but the absence of that a

707
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:50,760
bees not detoxified so that is one of

708
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:54,000
these symptoms of what wood is pretty

709
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:57,030
stressful to be my relation but by far

710
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,939
the biggest stress is that the warming

711
01:23:57,029 --> 01:24:02,840
of hours the people won't win virus now

712
01:23:59,939 --> 01:24:06,210
is academic that spread across the world

713
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:08,429
came from an Asian it is now virtually

714
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:10,198
all bees the world were infected with

715
01:24:08,429 --> 01:24:14,250
this flu viruses including the beef

716
01:24:10,198 --> 01:24:16,678
corned beef or wing virus in 2016 is a

covert infection before moving farmers

719
01:24:19,469 --> 01:24:24,448
cause the Beast please have the strength

720
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:27,300
and so they're not able to flourish as

721
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:30,509
long then the not be given a comeback to

722

the best and the intervention of Isaac

723
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:39,719
continue the fight the bees who look at

724
01:24:36,809 --> 01:24:42,779
dirty syringe is now simply the leading

725
01:24:39,719 --> 01:24:46,498
contender of calling collapse were that

United States specifically the full text

731
01:24:58,618 --> 01:25:06,299
isn't it using off bacon by beekeepers

732
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:09,719
total control over all my five years ago

733
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:12,150
two trenches of M atrocity - whose

734
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:13,710
typical and that will be equal are

735
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:16,848
drenching their hives seven or eight

736
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:20,788
bars it's a micro developing resistance

737
01:25:16,849 --> 01:25:30,090
and so hundred percent of the honeybees

738
01:25:20,788 --> 01:25:31,920
not worldwide virus be collapse you know

739
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:34,460
because of the rampant spread of this

740
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:40,510

01:27:03,609 --> 01:27:14,059

breakfast nook

755
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:18,680
I think the bees were covering my

756
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:21,650
supplement that was at the dark never to

757
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:23,990
get access with sugars but also that

758
01:27:21,649 --> 01:27:27,139
they are necessary activating their need

in detoxification complex somewhat

760
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:36,740
speculative okay so that's one of them

761
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:40,400
I have 1983-1984 I wanna go both forests

762
01:27:36,739 --> 01:27:44,000
I see Paris fresh trees bare selections

the Bears rest trees resident himself

764
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,939
these are ugly tourism or getting

765
01:27:46,699 --> 01:27:50,739
vocalists they each use the maps for

766
01:27:49,939 --> 01:27:54,789
miles

767
01:27:50,739 --> 01:27:54,789
someone will both forest

he said don't know anyone they want to

777
01:29:13,479 --> 01:29:19,449
work with so we started growing up in

778
01:29:16,210 --> 01:29:22,319
Iceland and we make Michael honey my son

779
01:29:19,449 --> 01:29:44,859
and this amount of rice and we make this

780
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:49,449
sugar and it's delicious you see right

781
01:29:44,859 --> 01:29:51,630
here and beekeepers do is they eat sugar

782
01:29:49,449 --> 01:29:54,639
water from the bees sorry

783
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:56,909
these extracts the struggle water defeat

784
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:59,410
the bees you see it would have an effect

785
01:29:56,909 --> 01:30:01,599
so it did this research or State

786
01:29:59,409 --> 01:30:03,819
University we surveyed about 20

787

different species specifically looking

788
01:30:03,819 --> 01:30:14,250
at longevity she is my parish rest of

significant try the daring dumpling of

794
01:30:48,849 --> 01:31:01,779
the beach and off course be shepherds of

795
01:30:51,988 --> 01:31:07,388
these excursions and then we conducted

796
01:31:01,779 --> 01:31:12,429
experiments with 532 feed lives the

797
01:31:07,389 --> 01:31:19,349

chemical treatments the beekeeping

814

they used pretty extensively damaged

here this issue

[Music]

818
01:34:43,829 --> 01:34:47,909
I mean these are critical to agriculture

01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:50,010
they call any more than 110 G wheat

thousand acres and every single one of

823
01:34:53,369 --> 01:34:58,729
those blossoms need to be fertilized in

a timely manner all of us

825
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:04,260
this research experiment of her going

826
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:07,100
against the largest beehive experiment

827
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:25,980
ever conducted in the world 532 beehives

828
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:28,860
testing the effects of these so one of

829
01:35:25,979 --> 01:35:31,889
the beauties of the next factor in

830
01:35:28,859 --> 01:35:33,630
controlling the viruses is the

831
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:36,660
ease-of-use that commercial beekeepers

832
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:38,730
there used to have this as far as fixing

833
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:40,619
something into their sugar syrup and

834
01:35:38,729 --> 01:35:47,669
medians and ease it's very simple to

835
01:35:40,619 --> 01:35:56,099
adopt my hope is that this research will

836
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:59,489
give this anniversary party hostess miss

837
01:35:56,100 --> 01:36:02,489
Vale what do people do for food and this

838
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:04,529
is fundamental to save organisms so I'm

839
01:36:02,488 --> 01:36:07,589
hoping that people recognize mushrooms

840
01:36:04,529 --> 01:36:09,359
for the important roles they play the

841

01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:28,880
to discover before it's too late

[Music]

844
01:36:29,399 --> 01:36:34,019
so we can conduct experiments

845
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:50,470
so let me show you know the conclusion

846
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:54,460
of this research on Tuesday we submit

847
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:57,490
our paper to science this is the company

848
01:36:54,460 --> 01:37:00,000
changing of my life if anything will go

849

down in history

850
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:13,029
though the transfer of lots of viruses

851
01:37:07,539 --> 01:37:17,289
all these now unfortunately they sell

submit alone the science on Tuesday is a

high-impact run this is something that

01:44:06,819 --> 01:44:15,609
is scalable

938
01:44:07,869 --> 01:44:17,710
it is ecologic the rational is through

939
01:44:15,609 --> 01:44:22,659
the concerted effort of the great

species anywhere in the world where

942
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:31,720
there are course we can have a new

01:44:27,939 --> 01:44:33,519
species using indigenous specimens the

leveque this is something that is

946
01:44:37,479 --> 01:44:46,939
achievable it's super inexpensive and I

947
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:49,889
think it opens up maybe something

948
01:44:46,939 --> 01:44:52,409
I've mentioned at the moment it must be

949
01:44:49,890 --> 01:44:55,650
for the first motion that there could be

950
01:44:52,409 --> 01:44:59,609
discovered to have antibodies against

951
01:44:55,649 --> 01:45:01,079
the tobacco mosaic virus we now know

952
01:44:59,609 --> 01:45:04,889

01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:16,289
interconnected this affords us the

956
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:23,579
opportunity of being able to mitigate

957
01:45:16,289 --> 01:45:26,159
diseases in plants and animals we can

958
01:45:23,579 --> 01:45:29,130
lower the Bible burden and the vector

959
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:33,960
such as MIT these viruses throughout

971
01:46:14,489 --> 01:46:19,409
and I have no partners I quit this

972
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:23,699

my brother John and I dream to be the

scope of a hypothesis what's here but

979
