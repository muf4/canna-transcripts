going into today room 108. uh this is

8
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:35,879
our water extraction room it's a little

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,160
bit of Chaos in there right now we're

10

just preparing for the day we've got the

11
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,659
machines getting all set up to the pumps

12
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:44,699
and to the hoses everything's been

13
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,619
cleaned perfectly yesterday so it's all

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,179
just sitting there waiting for us we

15
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,919
have hash that's being prepared and

16
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,738
dried in the freeze dryers that will be

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,079
sieving later today and we're gonna go

18
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:57,959
get 6 000 grams of dried cured black

19
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,899
cherry punch flour and throw it into the

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,359
Reactor with a bunch of ice and so I'll

21
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,900
take you guys in here real quick little

22
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,960
tag there

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:12,719
all right so here we go so here's our

24
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:16,438
Whistler equipment you can see that the

25
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:19,200
SPX pumps all to be [ __ ] up and dialed

26
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,118
in this is our Whistler Technologies

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,920
unit that we'll be filling up today we

28
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,280
got our Bubble Bag lights in the corner

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,659
we have our two 32 gallon tanks here

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,599
that we'll be putting our bags into

31
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,000
we've got our cleaning tub here and then

32
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,679
we've got a recirc tub back here 65

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,078
gallons that Craig's setting up right

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:42,180
now to another pump and that allows us

35
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:44,758
to remove the water from the 300 liter

36
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,939
get it into here and then pump it

37
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,299
through and create a closed loop the

38
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,500
freeze dryers are of course right here

39
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,020
they're working with yesterday's

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,019
material and we'll go through those and

41
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:59,158
do a final dry in a little bit and then

42
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:02,399
of course

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,020
the coal draft ice machine which is

44
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,759
making our beautiful ice

45
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:10,878
and you can see this ice is absolutely

46
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,799
perfect perfect

47
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,629
ice

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,959
all right

49
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:20,959
[Music]

50
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:20,959
okay

51
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,039
let's get going

52
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:35,788
[Applause]

53
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500

54
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:47,359
[Applause]

55
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,899

[Applause]

58
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,620
so this process is basically calibrating

59
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:12,359
the scales

60
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,280
we're going to calibrate the scales with

61
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,040
our weights

62
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,919
that are right here

63
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:21,719
and this lets us uh just know that the

64
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,518
scales are working properly once they're

65
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,060
calibrated they won't be moved for the

66
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,060
rest of the day

67
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:30,079
so that's what Uli's doing right now

68
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,119
all right so we're gonna head over to

69
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,979
the Vault and grab the flower that we're

70
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,158
going to run today

71
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:53,098
the vault's just over here

72
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,899
there's another room

73
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,878
this is where we used to one run water

74
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,580
extraction right here

75
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,759
the bfds are still on the wall

76
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,620
and that's where we used to do that

77
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,878
all right so here we are in one of our

78
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,700
vaults

79
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:13,199
got a nice big deep freezer right here

80
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:17,060
and that deep freezer has 6 000 grams of

81
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,060
black cherry punch right here

82
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:21,899
[Music]

83
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,759
there is generally paperwork that you're

84
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,519
going to be wanting to do

85
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,660
um sorry guys I'm zooming in a bit there

86
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,339
is paperwork that you're going to want

87
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,100
to do with this we've got the paperwork

88
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,719
over here and Craig will come in and do

89
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,699
that after me I'm just grabbing the

90
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,020
flower for now so for those of you that

91
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,720

very very very compliant

95
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:52,339
so

96
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,340
let's keep going here

97
00:04:54,918 --> 00:05:00,478
get this 6 000 grams back to

98
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,939
our room that we're going to be running

99
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,939
the hash in today

100
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,939

102
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,939
we made it back

[Music]

104
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:31,379
it's a six kilos of black cherry punch

105
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,418
we're gonna open these bags and get them

106
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:34,800
into the reactor all right here you can

107
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,949
see the quality of what we're working

108
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,329
with

109
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,329
[Music]

110
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:45,180
nice Frosty crisply

111
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:53,939
nugget it's very consistent in every bag

112
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:55,279
great nose really nice bouquet on this

113
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:59,779
flower

114
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,779
we're gonna dump it into the reactor

115
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,199
so

116
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,680
six bags of that we usually give them a

117
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,680
little rinse

118
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:19,319
lots of trichomes stuck in the bag

119
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:22,939
although I think it turned the water off

120
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:26,959
go back to that once we look

121
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:26,959
a little bit got stuck in there

122
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:46,528

[Applause]

128
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,639
to get it even

129
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:28,500
when the weed is dry especially it's

130
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,670
good to get the ice on top and pushing

131
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,040
it down to soak

132

140
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,620
so the ice and the material has soaked

141
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,978
because it's dry material we let it soak

142
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:17,660
for a little bit we'll also start the

143
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:17,659
impeller mixing at a lower rate

144
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:27,338
fire like up to 25 Maybe

00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,580
a little bit higher

147
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,419
you want to get the ice on the outside

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,958
moving it's still not quite moving we're

149
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:47,958
going out

150
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:54,778
walls

151
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,199
do you want that

152
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:45,199
to zero degree

153
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,399
so we're doing a little Reserve here

154
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,759
with Julie and Dan

155
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:59,600
filtering through the two 190s we've got

156
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:02,039
the agitator going

157
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,959
pump number two is pumping everything

158
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:09,719
out of these containers back into the

159
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:13,018
reactor and the reactor has pump number

160
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,000
one which is fully pump right here and

161
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,500
he's filling up the bags with hash so

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,399
the hash will be filtered through the

163
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,379
screens

164
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,860
then the water will come out from the

165
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:25,019
bottom and go back into the reactor and

166
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,539
that's called a reserve we do this for

167
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,879
well a little bit and then we'll do our

168
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:32,639
pull really soon here

169
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:36,080
just pulling the 190 a little patch bag

170
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,080
for catching the contaminants

171
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:47,220
and so see that I don't want to get too

172
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,500
close to the water okay there's the 190

173
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,320
so that's the lowest grade this is

174
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,480
really just used to catch everything we

175
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,140
don't want yet it will still probably be

176
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,420
around 50 THC so it could still be used

177
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:01,439
for plant fat extractions or any type of

178
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:03,539
uh

179
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,180
uh solventless extraction if you so

180
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,259
choose

181
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:08,578
well we want to rinse and clean out

182
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,139
their hash still too though right so

183
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:12,659
this is the job we're doing for a

184
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:15,059
company that wants just the 45 through

185
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:19,078
160 they don't want the 190 or anything

186
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:20,939
above 160 and anything below uh 45 so

187
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,439
this is why you're seeing only two bags

188
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,860
get pulled here

189
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,339
and we'll see a nice big pile of 45 here

190
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,339
for sure

191
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,860
[Music]

192
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,778
I'll lift it up a little bit

193
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,778
that's a nice big Vlog in there

194
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,579
there you go there we go

195
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,379
oh that's right there I got this side up

196
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:56,578
pretty good

197
00:11:54,379 --> 00:12:00,419
all right that's probably good for the

198
00:11:56,578 --> 00:12:03,059
pre-wash there hasn't really I want to

199
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,559
keep as much as we can in this bag okay

200
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:05,778
and when you're lifting it you just want

201
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,939
it yeah

202
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:10,679
what I would suggest is like if ULU

203
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,079
pulls it a little higher for you okay

204
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,179
right so Pull It On All directions like

205
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:17,819
not like that but like this

206
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:21,120
getting it pulled up the bottom is

207
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,680
coming up and then you want to use this

208
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,919
and just sort of move the hash around

209
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:28,500
there's a ton of hash in here

210
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,360
and it'll eventually we'll clean this

211
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,820
last little bit up after because if you

212
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,860
keep putting water in see how the the

213
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,879
there you go that's what I want to see I

214
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,800
want to see the the the

215
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:43,860
sanding there we go turns into the sand

216
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:46,159
muck this big chunks of hash in here

217
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,159
dude

218
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:52,439
once I get it you see it how it's like

219
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,299
slowly but surely turning into hash

220
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,940
turning into like an oatmeal on the

221
00:12:54,299 --> 00:13:00,019
water yeah thick oatmeal yeah now you

222
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,019
can do your squeeze

223
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:12,740
keep it even like don't flip it all the

224
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:16,559
way over this side like this is a huge

225
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:19,259
huge ball and just squeeze the [ __ ] out

226
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,659
of it we're gonna get uh

227
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:24,360
water out of it the more water we get

228
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:26,338
out the faster our freeze dry time is

229
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,800
yeah just squeeze that ball get that

230
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,779
excess water out a lot of people call

231
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,379
this bruising the fruits

232
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:35,820
it's just not so resin strong stronger

233
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:38,059
than you might think even dump this

234
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,060
water

235
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,360
[Music]

236
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:47,578
you want to go get your tray yeah you

237
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,159
can put that back in there

238
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:52,019
perfect and then lift it out and we'll

239
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,199
you can scoop the hash onto the tray

240
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,200
form

241
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:59,000
or you could just pick it up with your

242
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,000
hands

243
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:05,278
like this maybe you need to slip

244
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,259
it for sure cut it in half with the

245
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,338
spoon

246
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:11,100
while we're holding it and we'll just

247
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,540
put it boom boom even for one tree are

248
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,040
you sure it's not a little bit well we

249
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:16,319
can bring it over and you can put half

250
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:18,360
on another tray but okay in the meantime

251
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,760
let me get another one sure yeah so now

252
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,639
you can use the hose again to get

253
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,559
ourselves nice and adjusted look at this

254
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,019
craggy

255
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,119
have we have we pulled a bowl that big

256
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:34,100
ever

257
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,100
that is a big hole bro

258
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,150
[Laughter]

259
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,439
and then this part you can pull out a

260
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:45,439
little wet

261
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:53,458
you can just agitate it with your spoon

262
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,860
and then stir it together and

263
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,599
yeah turn it so I mean and remember some

264
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:01,079
of it gets actually and also washed into

265
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,120
uh the next bag so so you don't have to

266
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:07,319
clean it perfectly we'll rinse this bag

267
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,560
inside the next 45. this is only 145 we

268
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,560
pull

269
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:22,680
you can see right here the pressure

270
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,000
around the uh gasket is very tight and

271
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:27,379
that'll get thinner and thinner and

272
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,379
thinner until it disappears
