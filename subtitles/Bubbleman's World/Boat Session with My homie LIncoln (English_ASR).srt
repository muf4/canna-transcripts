Industry back in the day and in fact one

12
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,679
of the original churches right here when

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,640
we used to do Church before it was

14
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,479
called hash church and we used to go

15

came it was it was pretty cool and it

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,879
was really the the it was how hash

23
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,118
church was started because it was that

24
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:19,158
concept years later up you know just

25
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,359
this last year is when I started it 53

26
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,960
weeks ago and it was the the church that

27
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,000
we used to go to that was the B involved

28
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:29,359
the evolving of it it's absolutely so we

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,040
are out on the beautiful house sound we

30
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,679
got boat is cruising by us in the

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,759
background we got a a variety of

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,118
mansions here just on the side we had to

33
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,118
kind of pull in a little bit close to

34
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,640
the houses because uh the water's a

35
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:41,478
little bit rougher out in the middle and

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,000
I wanted to be able to do a video where

37
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:44,118
I could have my mother ship sitting out

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,519
without being worried that it was going

39
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:50,200
to tip over and uh potentially burn burn

40
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:52,959
the the boat all up so it's nice to be

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,920

out of the gate after hash Church 52 I

46
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,718
have to admit that you knocked it out of

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,920
the park it was an unbelievable

48
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:08,478
experience and you could tell everyone

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,239
was excited about it and they wanted to

50
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,720
be a part of it and it's those people

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,840
wanting to be a part of it and getting

52
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:15,800
excited that makes hash Church what it

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,080
is when when certain people just decide

54
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,879
not to come or enough people decide not

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,319

89
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,878

down of course marlar is a South Park

92
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,399
reference for those that you don't know

93
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,200

94
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,039
Ethiopian guy isn't that jumping the

95
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,598
jumping the border is that the ones that

96
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:57,438
try and take the job God damn it they're

97
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,359

maybe those were the marlars the mar

99
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,079
I'm pretty sure that's God we can't even

100
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,559
remember someone's going to fix it

101
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,519

102

104
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,920
was about man come on it's super easy to

105
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,158
remember it was about that Ethiopian

106
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,560
dude I'm certain and I think all he used

107
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:19,039
to say he had a spaceship no that was

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,839
the one that went derpa derpa no that

109
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,680
was der that was der derka der the is

110
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,359
the is the Arabs this this was the

111
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
Ethiopian dude but yeah nonetheless

112
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,080
we're trying to figure out all of our uh

113
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,279
IST South Park stereotypes that they

114
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,399
Mock and rip

115
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,279
on you know it feels like when you rip

116
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,279
on everyone evenly that it's just right

117
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,439
and as long as you don't like one rip

118
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,319
more than the other it seems like you're

119
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,800
okay you know it's a it's a Dave

120
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,839
Chappelle sort of way of going out about

121
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,960
racism and prejudism so I have an

122
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:53,239
appreciation for the humor freedom of

123
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:53,239
speech freedom of

124
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
speech

125
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,319
that would be wow rang me the first

126
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,720
round let see what this is going to do

127
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,719
bell ringer every time

128
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,560
he see the fairy coming in how about

129
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,919
earlier when we were like literally like

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,519
200 ft behind the ferry that was kind of

131
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:25,079
cool have the camera

132

little Adventure but we didn't bring the

134
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,400
camera so we kind of felt like man these

135
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,639

136

of an adventure we'll uh we went back to

137
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,759
the house grabbed the camera and decided

138
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,319

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,319
it we'll find out put it to the test

165
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:43,079
it's the bio assay right yeah this how

166
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,439
you test it burn it and test it or

167
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,758
smolder it and test it whatever God it's

168
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,959
so nice bro it is actually CU may I take

169
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,960
a look and smell you sure

170
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:56,598
may I like the discussion that you guys

171
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,318
were talking about the parchment paper

172
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:00,000
and about trying to find your next thing

173
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,039
cuz I found that that was really

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,439
interesting today yeah you know I mean

175
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:06,478
that piece right there solvent and that

176
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,560
taking away that little and you guys

177
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,959
getting paper well that's just it right

178
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,319
it's like the better I have a new

179
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,279
material I haven't cut it up into

180
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,039
sections that's why I grabbed this

181
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,519
little bit of uh rosin today and put it

182
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,959
on a fresh piece of parchment that had

183
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:21,318
never been squeezed or used but I also

184
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,918
love the idea I think that uh you know

185
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,439
maybe at the end of it maybe we will

186
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,159
come to the conclusion that parchment

187
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,399
was the best that we could do but I

188
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,400
highly doubt it I think that the

189
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,198
discussion will be to bettering the

190
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,839
whole

191
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:36,759
process well glass would be your next

192
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,119
one correct well a lot of people are

193
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,598
talking about glass but I'm you know

194
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,879
first glass won't do well under pressure

195
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:44,918
it would have to be some sort of special

196
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,560
glass not to crack and and smash also it

197
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:50,198
it potentially holds heat in a different

198
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,478
way I mean that'll be interesting you

199
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,800
know I think it'll be a lot of different

200
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:56,478
Minds coming together to figure it out

201
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,280
but when you get enough people trying St

202
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,560
leave something behind or you just can't

203
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,559
get it off of that well stainless is

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,399
once again it's like yeah this is this

205
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,199
is easy to remove and put on and collect

206
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:11,519
from it's a transition

207
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:14,120
transitionary uh process of the process

208
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,279
where you go from the but or the hash

209
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,360
squeeze out the rosin you've got to

210
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:21,959
squeeze it somewhere to get it off so

211
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,720
right now oil slick pad parchment paper

212
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,399
PTFE all of these things have been used

213
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,400
and of course you know everyone argues

214
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,478
this is better than that I I suggest

215
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,000
that I really don't know which is better

216
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,360
but because I'm smoking a lot of the

217
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,719
product I would like to for sure know

218
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,680
which one is better and that's that's

219
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,760
really why we bring up the uh not the

220
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,239
argument but the discussion yeah

221
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,799
discussion for sure I would think like

222
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,480
something like a template or a small

223
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,159
little like piece but then you're

224
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,159
getting into metals

225
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,879
and yeah I mean that's those are the

226
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,719
presses right like obviously metal and

227
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,879
glass and all the things that presses

228
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,560
would be made of would not be what we

229
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,958
would be collecting rosin from it's just

230
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,719
not going to happen like that we need to

231
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,599
have

232
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,120
some sort of little interface like this

233
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,320
like when a seed cracks and it comes out

234
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:10,799
of the hall there's a little membrane

235
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,959
that allows it to slide out of the um

236
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,000
out of the the seed Hall without being

237
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:18,278
damaged I can't remember the name of it

238
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,799
uh Skunk Man Sam mentioned itos or some

239
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:22,078
sort no there's an actual name for it

240
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,719
this little piece and it and I believe

241
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:26,958
most seeds contain it and it just allows

242
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,240
the embryo to slip nicely out without

243
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:32,239
the root or the caladon which are those

244
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,560
first two round leaves of most plants uh

245
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,320
keeps it from getting

246
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,799
damaged man we're we're drifting in nice

247
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,839
I I see you keeping your eye on the big

248
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:44,039
log there yes it's only a 2 three ft

249
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,720
away from us but you know got to look

250
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,559
out for that man this is nice we're

251
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,639
probably in about 8 to 10 ft of water

252
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:52,639
right now maybe about 30 to 50 ft off of

253
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,639
the uh the shore got to be probably

254
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,720
about what 16 17Â° out here say even a

255
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,639
little warmer it almost feels like maybe

256
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,399
18 feels like it's up there man like

257
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,319
close to beautiful day out here today

258
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,759
burning on the back of my head we just

259
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,320
wanted to share a couple of dabs with

260
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,519
you guys share a little bit of the view

261
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,120
out there with us uh and uh yeah I don't

262
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:18,000
know if I have really much else to

263
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,919
say we dabbed we boated we chilled out

264
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,639
yes I think that's a successful little

265
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,958
video right there thank you for having

266
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,078

268
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,399
hash church that I was going to put my

269
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:31,759
boat on the in the water after 3 and

270
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,559
half hours of us talking and this guy

271
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,200
literally called me a minute or two

272
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:38,078
after hash church and was like went

273
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,639
offline I was like hey marklar you know

274
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:45,638
co-pilot like absolutely man and

275
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:49,240
co-pilot UF here go one second oh where

276
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:51,639
the what's that our paddle go oh I put

277
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,320
it away I literally just put it away

278
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,959
it's under the seat you have to pull it

279
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,600
out at a weird angle kind of push it in

280
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,359
and then pull it out there you go it's a

281
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,200
weird little thing how it kind of fits

282
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,200
one way but not the other

283
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,160
way how big is that log she's a biggie

284
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,519
she's she's a oh yeah she's a day Ender

285
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,240
that one right there you hit that in

286
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,600
your boat going to full speed so many

287
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,240
different worries out there today I

288
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,959
haven't had my boat in the water for

289
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,600
several months if you guys watched on

290
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,039
Periscope that day when I cut in front

291
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,200
of the big yacht and I and the Periscope

292
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,039
went dead and nothing else was said well

293
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,200
at that point I had problems with my

294
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,599
engine so I shut the Periscope off I

295
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,639
eventually got towed in and and uh the

296
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,278
motor needed a ton of work so for 2

297
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,839
months the motor's been rebuilt replaced

298
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,958
overhauled the whole nine yards it is

299
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,399
pimped out and so now the boat is I've

300
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,958
got motor confidence which is important

301
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,639
tight very very tight but how many logs

302
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,679
are out in the ocean right now oh it's

303
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,879
busy out there it was like three we

304
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,078
could go logging out here yeah you

305
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:56,278
literally could go pull out a thousand

306
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,799
logs out of this ocean little chunk of

307
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:59,078
the ocean be honest with you you could

308
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,639
pull logs out of here that would would

309
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:04,879
be probably very beautiful to clean up

310
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:07,720
and do some wood work with you just be

311
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,720
like yeah score well a lot of them come

312
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,600
from uh you know log booms believe it or

313
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,480
not like some of these logs that are

314
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,000
perfectly cut like that one and that one

315
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,879
and that you can see the cut on them

316
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,639
right those are from log booms other

317
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,559
ones that have been Fallen trees that

318
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,320
contain the roots obviously down the

319
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,399
river yeah so it's a mixture of the two

320
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,760
a couple telephone poles right there I

321
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,120
like the vision they're the view they're

322
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,639
getting in the background of anvil

323
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:34,039
Island that's pretty sweet this is sort

324
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,799
of Whistler area behind us it is nice if
