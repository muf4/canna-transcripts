lot this is a

38
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,439
uh unorthodox methodology however I like

39
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,199
the unorthodox when the healing when the

40
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,878
when the healing needs to

41
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,598
occur sometimes that's how it goes

42
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:20,399
down and there's our

43
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:23,399
31° just like that

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Holy

45
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,798
moess so what's it feel like in your

46
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,359
mind

47
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:34,360
first mind so in your mind or something

48
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,920
oh it was no pain just inflammation just

49
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,319
inflammation itchy okay perfect start

50
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:44,318
with this but so witchy pulling youro

51
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,318
light let's put this underneath your

52
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:51,000
tongue and so what do we got there five

53
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:51,000
five drops of

54
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:57,200
P2 so this is uh an inactive full

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,959
spectrum sublingual just keep keep it in

56
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,598
your

57
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,280
mouth move it around M if you want you

58
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,419
can

59
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,598
swallow just a sublingual and

60
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:11,280
[Music]

61
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:15,679
then we're going to take an activated

62
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,680
P2 I'm going to open it up the your your

63
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,840
hand rub that all over your uh rub that

64
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,839
all over your

65
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,400
skin yep see go all real nice

66
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,199
[Music]

67
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,360
oh it really does go on nice hey so you

68
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,360
took the inactive on

69
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,240
your you got another half there that you

70
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,240
can

71
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,089
use so this one's activated so that's

72
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:53,758
activated

73
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:56,359
[Music]

74
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,600
P2 which obviously just means it's been

75
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:03,080
heated so it's active THC or CBN or CBD

76
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,560
this is high CBD low

77
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,680
TC um so it's kill it'll start killing

78
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,680
the

79
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,120
inflammation so why the inactive Orly in

80
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,160
the active being active early just gives

81
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,038
it a broader Spectrum so instead of just

82
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,000
like when you smoke a joint you're just

83
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,879
essentially lighting something on fire

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,279
at 451° or edible at 350 if you boil it

85
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:35,079
it's another temperature so um T and cvd

86
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,959
and canids all and tures all have

87
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:40,918
different temperatures in which they uh

88
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:43,599
will change or activate and those change

89
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,599
the experience modulates differently

90
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,199
different

91
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,400
receptors change your response so

92
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,038
instead of um arrogantly saying it's one

93
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,079
thing CBD is going to stop it I'm

94
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:59,159
telling you well this these five CBD

95
00:05:54,079 --> 00:06:00,439
Rich strains like ACDC R4 Harin sour

96
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,000
tsunami

97
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,918
um Swiss gold just combination of

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,199
strains put together so you give it like

99
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:12,399
the full full spectrum effect so that

100
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,240
sublingual will respond with uh it'll

101
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:19,478
absorb in his glands go into the blood

102
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,280
and it'll respond with a lock and key um

103
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:24,279
system for the IND avonoid system so

104
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,959
you've got your cv1 CV2 and what THC and

105
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,318
CBD and CBN does for that so if you eat

106
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,000
it it's differently so that's why

107
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,639
there's capsule forms okay and that has

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,598
plethora of CV2 receptors if you put it

109
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,680
as a sublingual it's a direct Ping On

110
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:40,000
cv1

111
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,720
receptor so sublingual is for a central

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,478
nervous system so what I'm trying to do

113
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,840
is say hey we put that stuff

114
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:50,199
on and he's he's you know hitting that

115
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,079
receptor and saying pay attention we

116
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:55,560
have something wrong in the body so if

117
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,439
the endoc canono system is uh working

118
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,680
properly doesn't have any deficiency to

119
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,240
keep your body in homeostasis

120
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,800
so that's what we're trying to do here

121
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,079
we're using this as a signaling system

122
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,319
to communicate with us to see if we can

123
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:11,038
help the information go down and

124
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,800
control may or may not work but that's

125
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,998
how I would use

126
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,999
[Music]

127
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,598
candles put that trans dermal gel yeah

128
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,840
what's up some other stuff so this is a

129
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:27,839
cvda I want to lock it in and CVN now

130
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:30,799
you can put this on top so take that

131
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:34,758
take that cream y that's a trans dermal

132
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,680
gel put that directly on there

133
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,439
yep now this is going to lock it in it's

134
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:46,759
going to be a trans dermal it's going to

135
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:46,759
push uh full spectrum cbda inactive and

136
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,918
CVN should be really care it sure felt

137
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,158
good when I put it on my burn this

138
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,359
morning it cooled right down and then it

139
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:58,519
felt like it was like like I couldn't

140
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,240
even feel the wind or any like when my

141
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,158
shirt touched it felt like it was just

142
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,000
like a little thin membrane of

143
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:05,839
protection it's pretty sweet yeah it

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,639
stays on so ideally you're supposed to

145
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,719
use it like this just straight on

146
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,800
straight on right here and then what

147
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,520
that does is it leaves a little gel so

148
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,759
just kind of do it once and it leaves

149
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,719
like a a nice that's what I call it a

150
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,479
gel and then that's transformal so it

151
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,000
absorbs into your

152
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,959
skin is that good or is that that's good

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,079
keep doing keep your foot more if you

154
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,758
want should definitely calm it down if I

155
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,758
were to use cannabis you just told me

156
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,038
that's what I would

157
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:37,200
use that combination of a sublingual

158
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:37,958
with a topical and then a transal on top

159
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,919
of

160
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:43,239
that 1:30 in the morning tonight Kelly's
