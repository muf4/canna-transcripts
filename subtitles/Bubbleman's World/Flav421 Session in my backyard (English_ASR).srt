everything these were the last few and

91
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,840
instead of just like killing them

92
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,399
completely I was like I'll put them in

pretty fast you know for sure I mean

98
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,080
even more so you plant them right in the

99

ground mhm but these guys are yeah I

100
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,719

101
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,399
planting in between the Roses yeah and

102

ton of them but the few that I've hit

111
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,439
I've enjoyed for sure I'm a bit of a

112
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,199
snob when it comes to hitting uh hitting

113
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,399
the nicest thing that you can possibly

114
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,120
hit I love obviously the mother ships

115
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:16,679
I've hit so many of your beautiful pipes

116
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,000

integrity glass

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,279
art between you two

119
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:24,918
guys and I guess the relationship I've

120
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,079
had with glass blowers for the last 15

121
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:29,038
or 20 years Big Time managed to hit some

122
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:32,279
nice pipes in my day when I was a when I

123
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:34,680
was young like like later teenage years

124
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,318
I would come to your shop to check out

125
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,478
what was going on cuz I mean there were

126
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,560
other stores around but there was

127
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,879
nowhere that had quality glass made by

128
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,360
the guys in Bellingham when everybody

129
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,680
was there like Marcel and when Slinger

130
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,639
was in town you know oh way ahead of his

131
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,680
time Slinger lived here at the time like

132
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,639
I mean Slinger and hippo were like

133
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,720
household favorites mhm yeah they were

134
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,160
they were doing their thing it was

135
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,639
really nice it was a unique time I

136
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,439
actually found

137
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,680
recently melting point footage from the

138
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,839
original degenerate art show oh slick

139
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,840
and this footage in my opinion and that

140
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:11,198
art show really spawned the degenerate

141
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,679
art documentary that Slinger went on to

142
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,160
do uh at the time I guess I talked to

143
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,478
him recently a little while ago I asked

144
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,039
him hey why didn't you ever use that

145
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,439
footage and he said I just didn't have

146
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:21,759
it so we weren't really talking much at

147
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,918
that time or he could have probably

148
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,680
gotten in touch with me and I would have

149
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:26,799
made sure that he got it but uh I'm

150
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,280
going to put that footage up um the

151
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,280
interviews with all the different Glass

152
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,839
artists and some of the footage of the

153
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,559
pipes that were in the show uh back in '

154
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:38,799
04 cuz' 04 we did degenerate art and

155
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,199
then in ' 05 we did regenerate art so

156
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,840
those were two shows in a row they were

157
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,960
both great shows and they were both real

158
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,318
fun to be a part of and I definitely uh

159
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:47,079
I can't wait to share the footage of

160
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,840
these

161
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:52,519
blowers 10 plus years ago doing

162

00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:07,199
had there ease surf was there um yeah of

167
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:13,439
course Brian and hippo and

168
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:16,879
Slinger um Chris oh nice mroy mroy came

169
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,360
um Jason Lee showed up absolutely uh or

170
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,599
he showed up for the second one his he

171
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,960
was in both of them I just can't

172
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,079
remember if he himself showed up I

173
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,799
believe also bearclaw it was his coming

174
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,038
out like becoming like he had never been

175
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,759
in a show before was his first show to

176
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,159
be in and uh many more than that I'm

177
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,199
forgetting for sure I'll have to go

178
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,080
through the video to see their faces and

179
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,680
to hear them doing the interviews to it

180
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,240
be great to see them so much younger too

181
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,000
back in the day absolutely you want to

182
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,478
load me up the da there oh I suppose

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,360
that can be accomplished awesome but we

184
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:50,360
figur we'd hit a few out of out of the

185
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,439
qus Banger here out of the cup and then

186
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,598
we've got a few pipes on the sideline a

187
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:59,598
couple of ships that we've got filled

188
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:02,319
with different um things to hit off of

189
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,839
rather than quartz we have the silicon

190
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,319
carbide which of course if you follow

191
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,959
Tony vora's Instagram or Facebook

192
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,120
accounts you can see that he's really

193
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,038
enjoying his silicon carbide uh Bowl

194
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,918
says it's by far the tastiest hit he's

195
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:17,439
taken really you and I can test taste

196
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,038
that out today that's a good idea and

197
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,598
then I've also got the new dab Master

198
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,199
sublimator plugged into the atomizer and

199
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,478
and plugged into the mothership straight

200
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,960
Fab that I got from you y and we'll see

201
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:30,560
if we can't uh maybe hit some uh Vapor

202
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:33,199
rips and maybe even some double deckers

203
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,839
dabbing on top of the and see if we can

204
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,680
feel that difference that Enrico's

205
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,959
talking about when you hit that dab and

206
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,359
pull it through the bed of weed and have

207
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,559
that all sublimate at once there's I

208
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,759
think there's something to be said for

209
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,439
it so dab on the through the top Dabber

210
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,879
part with the with the flowers on the

211
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,880
inside

212
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:52,879
chamber

213
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,879
intriguing I love a quiver my friend I

214
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:01,759
love a quiver yeah I love the options

215
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,278
that was a real nice hit that was great

216
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:07,319
I let that sit for the perfect amount of

217
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:09,519
time to just get the just nice and turpy

218
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,839
yeah but also like I did get a

219
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,799
substantial hit that didn't let me leave

220
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,480
me feeling less than oh yeah totally you

221
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,278
know that's the one thing that I found

222
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,120
incredible when I was first got the

223
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,879
sublimator and I was getting these big

224
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,360
rips but it was kind of he there was

225
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,519
problems at the time it was it was

226
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,639
breaking and this it was in the early

227
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,159
days so it's uh I'm definitely not

228
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:31,278
calling out sublimator it was a brand

229
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:34,120
new product he's increased the quality

230
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,639
of it it hasn't had any breaks on me

231
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,519
since I've reacquired it in the last

232
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,958
week but the old one it just sort of

233
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,240
what happened was eventually it stopped

234
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,838
working enough for me and then it was a

235
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,200
pain in the ass so then I do the

236
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,880
electric nail but the electric nail

237
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,399
always felt like I wasn't quite getting

238
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,078
the hit that I was getting from the sub

239
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,600
now after not using the electric nail

240
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:58,759
for sometime or sorry the sublimator I

241
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,040
found that the um the the the nail was

242
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,519
perfect it was fine but I stopped a

243
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,360
vaporizing herb so one of the things I'm

244
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,000
really stoked about getting that this

245
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,000
back is getting away from this mentality

246
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,159
where one has to be the best or I have

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,519
to choose one over I want them all I

248
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,399
want to be able to hit quartz with a

249
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,919
torch I want to be able to hit a

250
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,879
sublimator with my herb I want to be

251
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,399
able to carry my denail with the three

252
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,240
units and pull out these are all things

253
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,799
that I want in my quiver and as I get

254
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,720
older I'm learning that it's not

255
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:31,278
necessarily A you don't have to choose

256
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,519
one you can be happy with a combination

257
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:36,919
do it all yeah exactly smart don't fair

258
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,240
enough I mean a combination you know we

259
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:40,958
were talking about earlier you know ego

260
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,919
gets in the way of things you know and

261
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,838
it's true it's very true and I agree

262
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:46,159
that like to have an open mind to all

263
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,079
the different things I mean everybody

264
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,078
has a personal preference absolutely you

265
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,078
know but in all reality until you've

266
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,559
actually experienced all the different

267
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,679
varieties how can you know what your

268
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,239
preference is right true enough you can

269
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:00,078
know what you think your preference is

270
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,200
this is true but that's quite different

271
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:05,359
than knowing what your preference

272
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,759
is anyway we're going to rip away on

273
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,240
this cup for a little bit but when we

274
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:10,919
come back we're going to have the

275
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,480
silicon carbide nail on the table and

276
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:16,120
we're going to have the dab Master

277
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,039
suppor on the table wonderful be back in

278
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,560
a

279
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:24,399
bit all right so we've got uh the dab

280
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:26,479
Master sublimator on your right on our

281
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,679
left right here plugged into the

282
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,240
straight Fab and then we have the

283
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:35,759
Silicon carbide hybrid titanium nail

284
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,759
from denail in the Cory cotum drop down

285
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:42,078
in the mothership Fab Egg and I

286
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,559
guess I don't even know if we're so much

287
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,439
comparing

288
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,359
things as much as I mean this this has

289
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,560
been the the one of the best hits I've

290
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,519
had taste wise yeah actually I do agree

291
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:56,119
having used it with you before I I agree

292
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,600
that that that is a very nice tote it's

293
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,200
definitely very tasty but um it'd be

294
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,879
interesting to tell test it up against

295
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,759
the dab

296
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:07,679
Master just to see taste wise cuz the

297
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,838
sublimator is doing something different

298
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,479
other than being titanium this this is a

299
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,600
silicon carbide nail and that's what

300
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,480
they focused on and then it goes down

301
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,120
into your pipe but the sublimator as as

302
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,278
this might not look like much to people

303
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,560
this atomizer this this metal Bowl

304
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:25,838
titanium Bowl but it truly to my in my

305
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,000
opinion it's something about it makes it

306
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,040
the game changer because of the way it

307
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,600
just holds that heat in um the closest

308
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,879
thing I've seen to it actually was

309
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:39,440
denail puking beagles deep dish Banger

310
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:41,720
or S the dog the dog house the one that

311
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,920
you and I've said before I I actually

312
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,000
quite like that thing yeah that dog

313
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:46,479
house was amazing that thing was [ __ ]

314
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,839
cool I pretty much missed that yeah I

315
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,039
and I actually don't understand why they

316
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,360
didn't continue with that sort of

317
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,399
thought process in that line next time

318
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,440
you talk to them you should tell them

319
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,919
that mhm true enough yeah cuz that was

320
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,760
cool there was something going on there

321
00:12:54,919 --> 00:13:00,559
for sure yeah so I don't know what do

322
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,919
you say a little Vapor hit sure always

323
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,759
but we you do to ground up I ground up

324
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:08,479
the harmony o nice I have not tried your

325
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,480
Harmony yet yeah nice small little

326
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,680
pinch yeah with the atomizer the right

327
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,159
temperature you smell the vapor

328
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:22,198
instantly just when it's touching the

329
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:24,639
side of the

330
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:27,639
walls There You Go sir thank you thank

there booo yeah holy Snapples dude that

338
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,439
was a good

339
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,039
rip yeah got me jealous

340
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,720
I need one of those that one just sort

341
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,120
of just jumped up at me well the crazy

342
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,278
thing too is is that you just hit herb

343
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,240
yes it's not like you just took a a five

344
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:15,039
star dab of of the the super melt or

345
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,959
something you know what I mean like you

346
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,599
just if we rosined that it probably

347
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:22,838
would have been just a medium to small

348
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,639
size dab instead of like a third of a

349
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,320
small joint whatever it felt like when

350
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,720
you just exhaled those two big rips

351
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,800
either way so I'm definitely a fan on

352
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,079
that you you produced like some really

353
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,078
nice the

354
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:38,278
goo and it smells great what do they

355
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,800
call it it's not they don't call it

356
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,559
reclaim what do they call it no they

357
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:44,719
call it sublimate sublimate and it truly

358
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,039
what it is is it's a distillate it's

359
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,959
like what Horatio did with this he took

360
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:54,480
his DH he took his dmon yep and

361
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:56,319
he roved it till it evaporated and then

362
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,360
recondensed and everything that was left

363
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,839
in the rotovap was that nasty get rid of

364
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,560
yeah and all that's is the the

365
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,320
recondensation the vapor from the but

366
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,638
the smell of that is so good it doesn't

367
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,959
smell like anything's been burnt or

368
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,600
anything bad has occurred in the process

369
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,039
whereas and The Taste actually doesn't

370
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,959
have like I've never been a fan of

371
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,958
vaporizing cannabis it's just not like

372
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:22,278
flowers it's just not something R yeah

373
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:24,278
and the taste it has the weird funky

374
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:26,240
like burnt popcorn sort of a taste well

375
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:28,278
because I say what we just did there so

376
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,959
much isn't vaping cannabis as much as

377
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:32,278
what we really did did was we just

378
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:34,559
vaporized hash that happened to be

379
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:36,759
diluted on can we we stripped the can

380
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,879
it's like we we extracted it with heat

381
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,399
as in this flash way almost the same way

382
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,600
rosin works the way you get this

383
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,120
pressure and this heat and the oil comes

384
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,519
out at the perfect temperature well

385
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,278
somehow he's figured it out that when

386
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,198
you get that herb in there and I mean

387
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:52,759
we'll do it after we hit the silicon

388
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:53,879
carbide um we'll do a double decker hit

389
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,000
and then we'll well that's what we'll

390
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:59,198
finish it off we get the D lemoning and

391
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,240
the bubble hash with weed in there put

392
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:04,399
the we'll put the herb in the bowl put

393
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,560
the hash on top of the herb in the bowl

394
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,120
and then double decker the delemon down

395
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:11,719
be fun it'll be good yeah so I'll let

396
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,399
that heat up a really important thing

397
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,079
for the sublimator to work properly is

398
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:17,399
to always keep the atomizer hot hot hot

399
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,439
it's got to be the temperature that the

400
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,958
wand is the real job of the wand is to

401
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,240
heat the atomizer I you have to keep

402
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,638
that in for the most part it always keep

403
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,000
it in and the same thing with the carb

404
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,879
cap he said always leave it on if you

405
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,399
let this cool down and it cools down

406
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,600
just a few degrees when you put it over

407
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,078
and you suck that cooler temperature

408
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,040
through it's going to steal some of that

409
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:41,599
magic that only occurs at a certain

410
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,958
temperature for a certain amount of time

411
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,240
which is yeah it's interesting

412
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,439
interesting okay so I guess I'm ready

413
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,560
for a little

414
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,800
Harmony kind of excited here this is

415
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:53,439
really tasty actually yeah well I love

416
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:55,000
VAP and flavors man it's been a while

417
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,120
since I Vaped any herb a lot of people

418
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,240
were shocked because they said Bubble

419
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,879
man's you know they they they were

420
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,440
shocked you don't smoke weed man what

421
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:06,279
are you doing smoking weed listen I'm

422
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:10,720
not smoking weed I'm actually vaporizing

423
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:10,720
the hash off of the weed that's what I'm

424
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,919
doing I mean you can't deny like there's

425
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:27,038
just a certain reality to things you

426
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,360
know and you can't deny the flavor that

427
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,359
comes through

428
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,519
I mean I personally don't know if I

429
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:39,759
would be putting that into any of my any

430
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:41,359
of my pieces but in in the ability to

431
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,879
use it with you you can't deny the

432
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,918
things that are claimed are 100% true I

433
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,120
love this Mothership for it totally yeah

434
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,960
big be pipe holds it careful I never

435
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,439
feel like it's going to tip no it's got

436
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,200
one of the really nice put it in the egg

437
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,960
no yeah no no it's got the widest base

438
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,480
it's seen a wider B in fact that's the

439
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,319
widest base mother I've ever personally

440
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,000
held out of all the ones that have come

441
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,839
through as well and I mean he's got a

442
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,798
bunch of different pipes that you can

443
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,158
put this thing in that he's um carrying

444
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,599
now but one thing I don't like about it

445
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,039
is the plastic like sorry I'm not you

446
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,798
know I'm just giving an opinion and it

447
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,759
has nothing to do with the quality of of

448
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,279
of anything it's just I don't

449
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:25,119
like

450
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:27,079
using anything that has plastic on it at

451
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,678
all and I really don't and and the whole

452
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,439
metal thing just sort of feels like I

453
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,880
understand understand that it's a

454
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,880
necessity to

455
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,440
the

456
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,520
helicopters they're going they're going

457
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:41,159
to get the grass from the ski and

458
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,639
thieves yes but yeah so anyway the metal

459
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,480
just feels a little strange to me you

460
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,759
know being like a I don't want to say

461
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,400
glass snob but you know that's how you

462
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,759
feel some days yes truly I hear that but

463
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,120
yet otherwise you have to admit if it

464
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,279
didn't have the rip that it had you

465
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:59,158
wouldn't even consider no hitting it no

466
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,519
no I would not you're hitting actually

467
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:02,720
function the way it says that it

468
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,440
actually would function exact I wouldn't

469
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,839
I would pass it off as nothing that's

470
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,640
correct but it does they have they

471
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,319
definitely have something there with the

472
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,159
way they we just hit what I would call a

473
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:17,960
medium to small size joint between the

474
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:20,520
two of us oh totally way what a great

475
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,159
pie it literally cut through the hash

476
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,240
that we smoked already not in the sense

477
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:26,919
that I'm higher just different it it's

478
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,960
it took it to the this direction a

479
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,679
little bit you know well it makes it in

480
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,519
in the way it vaporizes it makes it a

481
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,280
little more cerebral it does absolutely

482
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,000
you know as as opposed

483
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,918
to I would agree with that it almost

484
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,440
sativ sa

485
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:48,159
sativ if that's a word thin thin thin

486
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:52,320
Leaf drug variet yes yes the the narrow

487
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:55,039
drug cultivar the nld the nld the nld no

488
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,480
truly it does have some sort of uh

489
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,558
difference to it so how about silicon

490
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,360
carbide I think we should we need to try

491
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:04,519
now so silicon carbide y all right and

492
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,839
then I think we should even go back to

493
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,960
the quartz just to finish it off again I

494
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,759
mean I wouldn't say no no silicone

495
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,880
carbide is at temperature got her at

496
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,359
about 700° you have a dab right there

497
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,400
already got a dab right here

498
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,399
wonderful got a nice

499
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,840
big carb cap here which will come in

500
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,400
handy for this monstrous surface that

501
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:27,399
this is okay

502
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,038
interesting very

503
00:20:55,558 --> 00:21:03,918
interesting great tasting rip

504
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:06,759
it went deep mhm like deep y it's not in

505
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,840
my throat at all it's like deep in my

506
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:14,079
chest the silicone carbide definitely

507
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:16,959
has this I've mentioned it before

508
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:19,720
preserved taste yeah there's something

509
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,319
preserved that doesn't get preserved on

510
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:27,159
most other surfaces and I've tested it

511
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:29,319
against titanium Sapphire ceramic quartz

512
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:32,440
and Titan uh I went back the same one

513
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:35,038
are you Stone there mark

514
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,200
Stone and titanium and quartz and

515
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,200
titanium and quartz and

516
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,519
titanium so there you go here's your

517
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,600
carb cap as well very

518
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,440
nice give me a little bit of an itchy

519
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,119
nose too on the exhale which is always a

520
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,120
good sign a little bit of

521
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,440
spice you definitely need a big carb cap

522
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,278
for a silicon carbide nail yeah you

523
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,720
[ __ ] do for sure yeah that's you know

524
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:01,440
that's actually the sublimator carb cap

525
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,038
he uses for his um torch nail that he's

526
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,080
got going on y but

527
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:09,640
uh I pulled it out to use with this cuz

528
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,000
I love the the nice uh neck on it I love

529
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,679
no no this is good yeah this is a good

530
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,319
little Dabber yeah you know or a good

531
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,080
little uh cap good little carb cap for

532
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,519
sure for

533
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:22,079
sure well feeling pretty Ivory after you

534
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,599
know cup rips okay that is the the

535
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:27,199
flavor

536
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:30,519
is substantially better than any

537
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,278
tie oh yeah yeah it's not even I I only

538
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:34,038
really compare it to quartz quartz you

539
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:37,200
really can only compare it to quartz

540
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:39,359
it's tastier than quartz the only is the

541
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,919
sapphire bit that you have a lot that's

542
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,479
pretty much my favorite it is eh yeah

543
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,440
but it's a pain to carry it around the

544
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,200
sapphire because it's porous it seems to

545
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,880
absorb the material into it so it'll

546
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,480
take it'll be a nice off- whitish color

547
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,159
or clearish opaque and then it'll it'll

548
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,759
absorb the liquid and literally now

549
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,200
unless you want to torch it which you're

550
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,200
not supposed to do you have to leave it

551
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,880
on the nail for quite some time let it

552
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,480
clean to clean off oh that's pain in the

553
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,760
ass so it is a bit of a pain in the ass

554
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,360
I hit it I hit too often to want to do

555
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,200
that so I get you know agree I end up

556
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:16,719
pulling out one of these units I usually

557
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,558
have two or three D Nails going and now

558
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,600
with the sublimator back in the quiver

559
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:27,918
it's uh well it's really opened up the

560
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:30,240
ability to vaporize herb but get a hit

561
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,840
that's more on on par cuz I would say

562
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,200
the hits that we're getting out of this

563
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,038
that are vapor hits they're pretty

564
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,640
[ __ ] good they're on par with the

565
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,200
hits that we're taking that are hash

566
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,320
yeah no I was surprised at how choked I

567
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,278
got like I was just and not choked like

568
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,519
it hurt my throat it was too hot just a

569
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:46,558
huge tooke you got all the res it's a

570
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:48,119
efficient huge [ __ ] to it's efficient

571
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,480
that's for sure and you could tell how

572
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:51,759
huge of a to you got because when I

573
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,558
pulled it out there was oil condensed

574
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:55,158
all on the outside of the down stab

575
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:57,359
which wasn't there prior that's from

576
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,919
from from how it's recondensing super

577
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:04,038
quickly exactly

578
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,720
yeah good fun yeah it is love sunny day

579
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:07,200
you know waiting for friends to come up

580
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,640
yeah we got some buddies coming up we'll

581
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,278
probably be doing more filming this

582
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,600
could be a show on its own or this could

583
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:16,119
be the intro to a big long 3-day show we

584
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,959
have no idea what's going to happen here

585
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,759
no maybe many parts but it'll be fun to

586
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,960
see it turn out it should be fun it

587
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,960
should be fun sounds like someone's here

588
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:30,519
now never know

589
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:33,480
well shall we uh go back to quartz or

590
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:36,119
try one of the

591
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,880
uh I think it's time for a double decker

592
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:39,719
oh well yes that's what I think I'm

593
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,480
going to clear my glass off the table

594
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,558
because it's time for double deckers

595
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,159
okay and we'll get this in the

596
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,278
middle we've got it on

597
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:52,000
temperature we get you a little dab of

598
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:54,398
the L and I mean a little one I don't uh

599
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,119
think we need to go

600
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:59,519
overboard here is this for me to start

601
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,599
or you uh you can go first if you want

602
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:06,278
to put hash in let's do this we'll take

603
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:08,558
this yep and put this in that yep yeah

604
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:08,558
put

605
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,880
Noise

606
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,558
Okay and then the L on the top yes and

607
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,679
then we'll put a little dab of the L

608
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:25,918
right onto the top a little one don't

609
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,399
need a big one of this you really don't

610
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,399
that's uh more than enough okay

611
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:34,439
that is very little it is so I just find

612
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:37,719
when you put yeah when you put too much

613
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,960
on it's not as uh it's it just seems to

614
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,919
be more of a medicinal thing than a than

615
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,919
a recreational

616
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:54,158
thing thank you want there

617
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,679
a little double decker rip for flab

618
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,440
421 see that's a sketchy thing when you

619
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,960
pull it out and if you don't want to

620
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,640
pull it too hard you pulled it out

621
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,679
sketchy you pulled it out by this handle

622
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,840
oh do it together well I don't even do

623
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:23,200
that I just do this to be honest I just

624
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:25,879
go like this okay yeah I just go give it

625
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,880
a quick little kind

626
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,600
of oh yeah okay instead of actually

627
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:32,439
pulling out the base hey still get a

628
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,319
good rip I still get that sort of I got

629
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,440
a hit cuz I see it clear and whatnot but

630
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:40,960
yeah I would never pull it out just by

631
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,759
this especially right now if you

632
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,360
notice this can be much tighter it's

633
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,558
gotten loose what if you pull it on so

634
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,519
now there's no wiggle to it at all this

635
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:54,119
is tight so yeah I have to admit I don't

636
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:56,278
generally pull it out yeah that was

637
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,719
super tasty and I got the end of yours

638
00:26:56,278 --> 00:26:58,919
so I'm going to actually pull this out

639
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,440
clean it

640
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,520
and take another one some hash in there

641
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,919
yeah oh

642
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:07,240
absolutely just a little piece y so then

643
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,520
what I'll do is I'll actually put the

644
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,679
bowl back in and put that back in just

645
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,359
for a minute just to ensure that that's

646
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:16,559
at the temperature that I want it to be

647
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:19,278
at because literally you can forget this

648
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:23,240
up here and that can cool down so much

649
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:25,640
that it just it turns your 10 into a 7.8

650
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,079
it's like a convection of them it is

651
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,759
really when you get to that perfect

652
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,639
temperature it's all

653
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,359
exactly it's more of the science of the

654
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,799
cooking what's happening at a certain

655
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,240
temperature water goes from not boiling

656
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:42,200
to Boiling so there's there are these

657
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,440
sort of intriguing Innovations able to

658
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,798
happen in those little zones where the

659
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:51,038
magic hides yep and I truly believe

660
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:52,480
somehow some way that enrio figured out

661
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,640
some of

662
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:59,240
that all right oh there's the hash in

663
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,440
there too nice nice very nice

664
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,240
good flavor on that grass too like

665
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,840
really yeah well it was like I said

666
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:10,720
grown with just water barely any food

667
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:13,639
given so it had like a 7 or whatever

668
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,600
yeah it was uh it's crystally I'll tell

669
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,759
you I put the microscope under it and I

670
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,359
was like oh yeah well I've tasted worse

671
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,000
weed by people that have put a hell of a

672
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,599
lot more effort into it so yeah well

673
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,480
that's the problem people put too much

674
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:28,359
effort

675
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:31,038
sometimes trying so hard to spend to to

676
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:33,959
make money that they've already

677
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:37,679
spent and I'm not doing any of

678
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,159
that I just I just want to grow a little

679
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,080
medicine it's real nice to have four

680
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,799
five or six different bags of of your

681
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,798
own herb you

682
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:55,359
know oh that was a real light bit rip

683
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:55,359
nice

684
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,159

bell

687
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,319
ringer it's like a triple do sandwich so

688
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:28,839
good you get the itis afterwards I

689
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,759
didn't even do the l r oh you didn't do

690
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:31,918
all I did was was the hash and weed oh

691
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:33,839
there you go you didn't even get the

692
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,799
Triple Decker so there it is I just did

693
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,639
a double decker just a clubhous

694
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:40,000
completely forgetting about completely

695
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,399
forgetting about potentially the

696
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,440
strongest part of the rip and I got to

697
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:45,319
say that was a

698
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,600
ripper so

699
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:51,879
good well we're going to continue to um

700
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:54,798
abuse ourselves with various forms of uh

701
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:58,799
fto canabo inhalation

702
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:00,240
devices mostly canabo systems but uh

703
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,440
we'll get back to you guys this could be

704
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,930
the end but this could be the beginning

705
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:11,119
so for at least one more second

706
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,119
