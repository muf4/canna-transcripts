about well what led us to talk about

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,439
what we're talking about um I think it

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,559
came down to um weren't you looking for

13
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:50,159
your license I thought it was more along

14
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:53,959
the lines of you getting harassed both

15
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,959
at a a traffic stop and then a couple of

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,600
weeks later at the Edmonton airport

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,878
where they detained you took your

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,159
cannabis charged you with cannabis this

19
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:07,798

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,040
this led to from you know okay I'm just

21

24
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,400

Canadian citizens who want to learn how

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,760
regards to either of them if you are

61
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,400
already attached to

62
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,560
those so like Mark said would have come

63
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,760
down to was me being pulled over first

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,598
on February 26th um last month and uh I

65
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,679
was asked if

66
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:00,079
uh basically my car smelled like

67
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,599
marijuana that's what he said it's a

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,920
brown new impressor so it didn't I got

69
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,518
pulled over because in my opinion the

70
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,158
round plate number but we won't get into

71
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,080
those things um so right away the

72
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,679
officer asked me do I have my paperwork

73
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,200
and at that point I had nothing on me I

74
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,799
was in my car so he asked me if I had

75
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,560
any marijuana on me and I hand them a

76
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,599
container like I always do of course I

77
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,318
do you know that's my medicine we should

78
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:25,000
explain to them too how difficult it is

79
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,000
to carry it's not a card in Canada show

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,479
them the

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
paper okay it's not a card in Canada

82
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,039
here here's the piece of paper and the

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,759
piece of paper in question and what

84
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,959
we're looking at has to have this expiry

85
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,399
but unfold it you don't have to show

86
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,080
them dates show them the back of it show

87
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,080
them the length of this piece of paper

88
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,159
this document supposed to car this

89
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,519
letterhead piece of paper it's

90
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:44,000
ridiculous in something the size of a

91
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,879
wallet and you're not supposed to lose

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,479
it and if you fold it up too much and it

93
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:49,759
becomes destroyed and you can't read

94
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,840
part particular addresses mean this fold

95
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,479
across well that's what I'm saying now

96
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,598
imagine you folded that to fit it in a

97
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:58,798
wallet and it's how many years old now

98
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:03,359
three four um this is four years old cuz

99
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,000
I got in 2013 14 15 16 4 years old so

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,159
this this was a photoc copy of the

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,438
original copy that I actually have so I

102
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:15,598
did photocopy that so so you you have to

103
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:17,478
as an mm patient in Canada medical

104
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,159
marijana access regulations and you had

105
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:23,240
a license before March 31st of

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,680
2014 you have to carry around a piece of

107
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,879
paper not a card they make it as

108
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
difficult as possible and I'm sure

109
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,240
someone at one point said let's let's

110
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,599
make it so they have to carry the whole

111
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,400
document not just an easy card that fits

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,000
in your wallet so this is part of the

113
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:41,719
problem with many people the m and the

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,639
acmpr and the

115
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,120
mmpr they don't have the ability to

116
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,319
carry around this large document it

117
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,360
becomes unrealistic and I'm telling you

118
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,918
to try and keep the one on my wall as in

119
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,520
good condition as this is what I handed

120
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:58,000
the officers I handed them my card cuz I

121
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,839
still do have a card but it did expire

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,680
that's be 10 years old or something oh

123
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,319
this is seven years old so this is the

124
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,918
cards he used to be able to get from

125
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,159
from Health Canada he had a card on had

126
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:08,799
a beautiful little picture on there for

127
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,960
it so I'm covering up my address and

128
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,520
then they made it more difficult so I

129
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,038
actually had about half a dozen of these

130
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,879
particular cards and I still carry it on

131
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,399
me and when I get questioned like the

132
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,478
officer that pulled me over an a I

133
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,478
handed him my card and I instructed him

134
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,199
to call Health Canada 24-hour hline to

135
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,478
find out more information in regards to

136
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,759
my license and did he do that um the

137
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:30,159
officer in aiser did yes he did

138
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,639
wonderful so is this something

139
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,400
you know walk us through not only what

140
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,680
happened to you but walk us through what

141
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,799
these people need to know and do for

142
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,400
future references before they get pulled

143
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,360
over so here's my notes calling from

144
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,038
Health Canada so I'm really I put them

145
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,919
down on some other paper here so we can

146
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:47,199
actually go through it what proper links

147
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:48,959
we have to go through and stuff like

148
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,160
that thank you my friends you're welcome

149
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,478
I like that stuff you just put a little

150
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,039
thing there I can sit back so the the

151
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,800
first thing is is is really in reality

152
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,159
when I got arrested and charged in

153
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,400
Edmonton at the Edmonton airport

154
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,479
we both failed to do two things a for

155
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:09,239
one I failed to present an expired copy

156
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:10,360
of my license that is of course we saw

157
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,800
how long it

158
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,919
was and then they failed to do the one

159
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,960
thing that I told them to do right away

160
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:18,560
and it says in here IND different

161

170
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,000

document that they tell that they print

172

174
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,159
to get to I'm going to go through the

175
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,639
steps that you had to do to get to this

176
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,960
particular little piece of Buri document

177
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,918
this is an important document that you

178
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,279
need to actually to refer to because it

179
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,240
talks about the regulations it talks

180
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,878
about the laws in Canada and drugs and

181
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,918

182
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,720

story on how much research he had to do

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,639
to actually dig it up okay so so this

186
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:10,360
was this is something that I told the

187
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,560
officer to do in Edmonton so you call

188
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,960
Health Canada mhm well that 24-hour

189
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,319
hotline is like when I called Health

190
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,318
Canada I was on hold for 2 hours and 41

191
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,319
minutes then they hung up because it was

192
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,680
the end of the day oh then the next day

193
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,919
I was on hold for 2 hours and 8 minutes

194
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,840
and I finally got

195
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,519
through that's where these notes come

196
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,279
from I talked to a really nice lady sh

197
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,598
CH I talked to her back in 2007 and 2008

198
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,318
when I first got my license so each

199
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:38,120
province had an individual person

200
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,000
dealing in representation of that

201
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,680
Province so it's kind of interesting so

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,519
when I talked to her she said first

203
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,918
thing she said to me I said in regards M

204
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,719
mm they said they have no grounds to

205
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:51,079
talk about it the first thing she said

206
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,080
we have no grounds to talk about it John

207
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:57,198
like who has no grounds Health Canada

208
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,680
because the program to them is done okay

209
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,120
right they have no GRS they're not

210
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,959
sharing or providing any information at

211
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,918
all on the mm you can see I've written

212
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,158
this down exclamation mark like they've

213
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,038
actually said this but because I had

214
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:11,680
such a good relationship with Cheryl she

215
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:13,360
told me some steps that I can tell you

216
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,639
because I she I told her what happened

217
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,038
she goes yeah I said I need to educate

218
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,598
people she goes yeah we know all right

219
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:22,158
like so you know she kind of went into

220
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,279
some detail so here's the first thing

221
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:26,000
you've now I I kind of wrote theis here

222
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,679
already this is I've having fun

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,320
information you should know about your

224
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:35,719
mm license and in regards to maybe being

225
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,159
arrested so you need to hold a copy of

226
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,440
your expired license dated March 31st

227
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,278
2014 so Mark's going to kind of talk a

228
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,600
little bit more inform the party there

229
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:46,799
is a 24-hour access line to confirm your

230
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,000
paperwork and they already know this

231
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,719
they don't give you the number by the

232
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,200
way that's why it's not on there she put

233
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,160
they do not give you the number that the

234
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,720
law enforcements can call help that

235
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,079
sense that so they have a number so

236
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,000
that's the reason why it wasn't there I

237
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,160
just it just clicked tell the party

238
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,919
there's a website to look up the

239
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,838
information information go to

240
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,078
www.health

241
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,560

MMA put it across the screen for you

243

244
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,320
mean I'll do it in editing okay this is

245
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,600
going to so it's a nice I like that yeah

246
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,800
okay so here's what it gets tricky it's

247
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,759
pretty cool all right okay so and even

248
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,120
if you type you see this okay first do

249
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,319
we read these first two things these are

250
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,120
the they have step one step two step

251
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,640
three okay I'm going to go through these

252
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,440
other steps to tell the officer who now

253
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,360
questioning you about your legal right

254
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,519
to carry cannabis and just say for

255
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,959

license that you don't have anymore so

260
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,838

261
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,200

262

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,360
website anymore so with this PR page is

327
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,720
going to have access under the amcpr

328

331
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,839
going to be that specific information

332
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,958

333
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,360
to medical marijuana access regulations

334
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,000

00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,439
have D they have the ability to just

379
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,240
ignore things though they do it on a

380
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,160
daily basis with certain things and if

381
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,079
they want to start harassing you there's

382
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,838
always you know there's always the

383
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,479
ability to not do that to read the

384
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,720
situation and be like you know I think

385

397
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:26,958

403
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,120
fine okay what I was getting in here uh

404
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,160
do not fact that's what I was going to

405
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,480
mean it's email and first you're going

406
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:46,759
to email and then you're going to

407
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,800
directly mail but do not facts she said

408
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,919
do not facts do both of those mail both

409
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,159
those but the first thing you do is

410
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:57,439
going to I have to request a copy of my

411
00:14:54,159 --> 00:15:00,278
mm license includes your full name date

412
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,000
of birth address on where the license

413
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:07,278
was issued so not not your address or

414
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,480
and and here's the whole thing so I had

415
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,278
there's another thing I'll talk about

416
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,240
quickly just say you've moved and you're

417
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,838
no longer have that address you're still

418
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,440
licensed to carry your medicine so that

419
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,759
means you're not licensed to grow at

420
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,240
that specific location why to say

421
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,639
anything that's not the truth it's well

422
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,440
you can still get well because if you

423
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,519
want to continue to grow then you have

424
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,440
to reapply through the amcpr but say you

425
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,799
don't want to continue to grow you've

426
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,680
moved you have access to cannabis you

427
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,799
just want I you just want to possess it

428
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:36,559
but I don't have my or you could say

429
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,958
that you haven't lost your license to

430
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,198
grow and you've just lost your license

431
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,518
to

432
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,278
possess seems like okay so we're going

433
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,360
to include the following information

434
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,318

435

437
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,479

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,319
it has to be a valid copy of a piece of

440
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,759
govern government issue ID so it's going

441
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:04,479
to be a passport or your driver's

442
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,639
license there isn't really anything else

443

00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,038
scrolling by like you said scrolling up

489
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,679
on the screen um makes it easy it just

490
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,679
kind of makes life easy I got it all

491
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:55,038
sitting on written out here it's exactly

492
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,519
what health Canada told me to do so it

493
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,839
wasn't like a lawyer or anything I did

494
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,639
this all myself Laura would have charged

495
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,759
a few bucks for this information a lot

496
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,799
of information and then probably would

497
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,798
have sold it afterwards for more well

498
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:09,240
here's another step so say say say you

499
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:11,240
didn't have a copy of your license like

500
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,880
myself the officer in question did not

501
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,919
call Health Canada why do you want to go

502
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,400
home and catch your plane and you want

503
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:19,080
to see it for a couple hours and be on

504
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,798
hold I wanted to go home they delayed

505
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:23,839
the plane for me I got on the plane and

506
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,400
I I took one I taking one for the they

507
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,879
took your hash well I'm going to get

508
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,240
that hash back [ __ ] rights that hash

509
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,760
did I do first thing it is I called

510
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,558
Health Canada didn't call a lawyer

511
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,279
nothing called Health Canada told him my

512
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:38,038
situation told him what was going on

513
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:41,079
then I got all the information I have a

514
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:42,720
copy of my license March 31st I've

515
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,279
attached the letter in question of had

516
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,240
to contact law enforcements and what the

517
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,359
law enforcement needs to do I then got

518
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,079
to hold the crown

519
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:55,319
prosecutor in Edmonton hi the red de

520
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,879
nice Got a Hold Up same name too did you

521
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:59,279
explain to him the situation no I didn't

522
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,600
get an extent to talk to John oh okay

523
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,079
okay so I'm like joh like perfect so I

524
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,038
was told by the secretary cuz he

525
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:05,399
probably hasn't even received the

526
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:07,440
charges yet he may not even get them

527
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,120
until the day of court right right he

528
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,120
might he might not see him but I'm going

529
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,719
to speed up that process so why waste

530
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,279
taxpayers money why waste people's time

531
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,120
why send the lawyers and stuff like that

532
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,639
so of course what I did is I went into

533
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,558
regards my case number I attached him

534
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,919
information regarding I I I faxed him a

535
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,879
copy of what happened and I actually

536
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,840
contacted the lady in question called

537
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,480
that she gave me the direct fact numbers

538
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,678
to the crown prosecutor so say say

539
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,759
you've been charged in any other

540
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,120
Province or anywhere else there it's a

541
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,839
federal offense so you're not dealing

542
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,599
with preven you're dealing with Federal

543
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,798
always with cannabis always with

544
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,199
cannabis so then what I did is I I've

545
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,400
contacted I've got the proper

546
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,960
information to fax this in and phone

547
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,440
numbers I scanned everything a copy of

548
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,960
my license a copy of the information

549
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,080
from Health Canada M and a copy of the

550
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,038
charges in question and sent it all in

551
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:57,558
and cross my fingers and hopefully it's

552
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,798
not hopefully it's well no they have to

553
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:02,359
draw the charges it's 100% they're going

554
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:04,599
to drop the charges listen I've known I

555
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:06,918
we had our friend get busted with what

556
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:09,279
400 plants in his house and he didn't

557
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,720
have his license yet and he had a very

558
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,279
good reason to have a license he just

559
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,960
never got around to it so when he got

560
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,279
charged he immediately went and got his

561
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,640
license not because he was charged but

562
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:21,319
because it was time to a protect himself

563
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,679
properly because what he was doing

564
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:25,558
wasn't what they think he was doing

565
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,038
which was selling to the black market

566
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:31,240
versus growing for himself yes and so uh

567
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:34,400
he got a he got a license with the help

568
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,720
from uh Johnny B and I guess myself in a

569
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,159
sense cuz I hooked him up with Johnny B

570
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,120
of course I mean he would never known

571
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,360
right yeah yeah but really Johnny B

572
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:46,839
hooked him up and uh he got all of his

573
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:49,798
charges dropped like soon after and it

574
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:51,720
was a mandatory 2 and a half year prison

575
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:52,879
was facing kids you know everything what

576
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,759
went on but so it was kind of a

577
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,799
nightmare but it ended up being a real

578
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:59,640
dream in the end and you know it's

579
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:01,480
important that people who are medical

580
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,320
have the protection of medical and it's

581
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,200
also important that we pass or

582
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:09,240
decriminalize or legalize because

583
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,319
everyone deserves to be protected uh

584
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,319
from Cannabis prohibition and we're

585
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:16,399
looking at legalization coming next year

586
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:18,918
July 1st 2018 appar 2018 is what they've

587
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,960
said the liberal caucus has announced

588
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,038
that they're going to uh have

589
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,240
legalization in motion I've seen a lot

590
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:26,599
of the uh points they didn't seem to be

591
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,359
too great no

592
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:32,359
hashes um how about just Li hous four

593
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:35,359
plants per household limit on the plant

594
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:37,359
like 100 cm or something or something

595
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,199
yeah so it's there there's it's a foot

596
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,639
in the door it's better than nothing in

597
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,278
the sense that everybody can grow

598
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,640
cannabis and you got to think not

599
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:45,599
everybody every household but if

600
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,120
everyone was growing or a lot of people

601
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,558
were growing three or four plants you

602
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,798
got to think that the smell is going to

603
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:52,480
be in the air that that whole foot in

604
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,079
the door that made it easy for people to

605
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,038
be discovered will disappear when it's

606
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,759
so normalized that people all around are

607
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:01,319
smell like we yeah it's just like just

608
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,440
like you smell skunk cabbage when you

609
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,480
smell skunk cabbage like skunk skunk

610
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,840
cabbage smells very very much like weed

611
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,480
and I'll tell you nobody has plans to

612
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:11,319
eradicate it or to get it out of the

613
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,400
ditches no one complains about how

614
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,359
horrible it smells really what happens

615
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,519
is if you smell it you go that smells

616
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:20,278
like like really good weed or a skunk or

617
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:22,599
something and that's you know that's

618
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:25,400
because it has that same sort of tarpine

619
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,359
profile in the air but um oh I was going

620
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,000
to make mention please and I and I'm

621
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,719
just thinking about I'm looking over

622
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,440
there's another really important factor

623
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,200
reason why you want to request a copy of

624
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,000
your license even if you have the only

625
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,240
original pull that out way request a

626
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,079
copy and the reason why Cheryl said this

627
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,640
is because you get a really nice cover

628
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,599
letter to law enforcement standing

629
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,278
exactly what to do and I haven't she

630
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:50,038
didn't tell me what it is but she said

631
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:52,679
request a copy and you get a cover

632
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,960
letter so I really I can't wait to see

633
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:56,200
your cover letter yeah yeah no doubt I

634
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,240
can't wait to show you my cover letter

635
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,600
well let's do it up let's get that rip

636
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,599
Mother

637

640
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,038
Wednesday and uh although it might not

641
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,759
have been quite the adventure that John

00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:37,440
necessary to do so now here's here's

651
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:39,119
another thing that was quite interesting

652
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,159
is the officer said do you have a

653
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,239
doctor's

654
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,880
note and my girlfriend said I bet you if

655
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,599
you had a doctor's note and a card that

656
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,640
said aurar in your back pocket they

657
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:50,319
would let you go so it's interesting on

658
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,000
how this new system cuz I did have a

659
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,798
fully expired card it sounds like Health

660
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,960
Canada's Got a li little bit more work

661
00:23:53,798 --> 00:24:00,000
to do in regards to maybe not holding um

662
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,038
a stubborn like childlike perspective on

663
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,558
the mm because it's over but instead

664
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:08,798
recognizing the federal judges court

665
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:11,278
order to uphold it and not ignore it but

666
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,759
actually maybe focus on it head on maybe

667
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,640
even spend a little bit of money to do

668
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:17,079
as much research as they can to find the

669
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,919
holes in this system and where it's been

670
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:20,918
let down I think a lot of the holes come

671
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,640
from the lack of communication from

672
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,840
Health Canada how small Health Canada

673
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,240
really is for this particular job versus

674
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:33,639
how many people are joining every day

675
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:35,599
and the absolute failure to um properly

676
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,278
communicate with law

677
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,918
enforcement uh to protect Canadian

678
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:43,679
patients it's it's insane the the

679
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:46,919
officer in question failed to do his

680
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,600
deal to fail to do his duty Call due

681
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,200
diligence and call Health Canada to

682
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:55,038
verify like here's another thing

683
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,319
educates all police stations and all law

684
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,440
enforcements across Canada with this

685
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:01,200
information I mean it's everybody like

686
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,558
it's a stretch it's a stretch but you

687
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,960
could literally be helping people you

688
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:09,720
know from great crimes because when

689
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,558
we're not wasting the police's time with

690
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,720
victimless crimes that aren't actually

691
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:17,079
crimes that are actually just a complete

692
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,919
and total waste of time money and uh

693
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:22,480
more importantly the duty of protecting

694
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,480
citizens that are In Harm's Way because

695
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,240
you know somewhere there are citizens In

696
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,919
Harm's Way and if the police weren't

697
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,359
wasting their time with patients like

698
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,120
John they would have the ability to

699
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:36,599
maybe spend more time trying to find

700
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:38,839
those crimes and those criminals so it's

701
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:41,319
a stretch I get it but it's one that

702
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:42,959
could be made that makes uh proper sense

703
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:45,319
if you look at it from the right

704
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,360
perspective don't waste our time don't

705
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:49,519
waste your time you know what it three

706
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,119
people lose the taxpayer lose the cop

707
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:54,119
loses and then the person who he could

708
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,639
be protecting also loses I know I know I

709
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:58,319
just I just I just saw this sitting

710
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,720
there and this is some trim bin sift

711
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,918
trim bin sift should we run it through

712
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,558
the squashy I think I think should we

713
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,679
run it through the SAU he's got a trim

714
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:07,440
bin or if you don't you should get one

715
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,320
uh because if you're trimming your own

716
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,600
and with this new legalization coming

717
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,480
forward everybody's going to be able to

718
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:13,359
have a little bit of their own sift yeah

719
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,079
and you're going to be able to do all

720
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,000
these things you able to get

721
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:20,278
screens but I

722
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,640
mean and then we can squish it y but I

723
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,880
mean there's just ways of this this

724
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,440
little thing like these little little

725
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,360
epicness and stuff like that you able to

726
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,038
do get and it was it's I kind of like

you know came this little tube it's kind

728
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:34,640
of cool but uh and then you got the bags

729
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,759
look at this it's like so this is all

730
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,038
taped

731
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,798

732
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:44,000

733
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:46,200
what's happening here in Canada and and

770
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,798
simple trim bin it's a little system

771
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,879
where there's two bins put together and

772
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:10,599

know because we're all about that stuff

775
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,720
but these things work really well um and

776
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,480

now Bo hell yeah dude well dude it's PFF

873
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,278
Wednesday here look what we just

874
00:32:55,798 --> 00:33:01,000
squished actually in one squish we

875
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:04,398
produced two types of

876
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,440
rosin and what's the types butter and

877
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:08,479
and like a shatter consistency one's

878
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,120
really buttery and one's like shatter

879
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,159
they came off the same Squish and The

880
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:16,439
Buttery one from a low temperature press

881
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,080
well they're both from the exact same

882
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,240
press it was one press we opened it up

883
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:24,278
and it was like half of it was butter

884
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,720
and half of it was uh like shaty

885
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:27,519
consistency I want to hit that butter

886
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,759
first what do you think Johnny I bet you

887
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,399
if would have blown it

888
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:35,960
out more to it or

889
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:37,359
like I don't really know what I think

890
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,240
about it to be honest I'll let you know

891
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,319
after I hit it both of them I'll have a

892
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,000
better idea than uh than uh well let's

893
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:48,278
hit this here we go

894
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,638
D4 b r bong ripping on both sides here

895
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:52,119
so now the whole thing is with the

896
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:54,319
butter what I would say and how this

897
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:56,879
whole thing kind of played out is as I

898
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,960
was squishing it before I squished it

899
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,639
really flat I think by not squishing in

900
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,200
the flat leaving that little Gap the

901
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:05,199
other with squished out was more getting

902
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,798
hotter and then the lower temp is

903
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,480
because it was so thick it def didn't

904
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:09,679
heat up as much and that's probably if I

905
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,000
would have kept going it probably would

906
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,639
have all came out like the shatter

907
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,398
that's just my

908
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,960
hypothesis I think that the reason I

909
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:22,039
didn't say what I thought was almost

910
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,440
exactly what he

911
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:26,639
said if that makes any sense yeah just

912
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,119
kind of makes sense you know what's

913
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:33,358
going on with that and stuff like

914
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:36,639
God thinking about it here and that kind

915
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:39,480
of oh was that that was hot yeah son of

916
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,599

925
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,358
this is the danger of dabbing say this

926

1020
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:01,559
so you know what uh it's going to be a

1021
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,599
little bit of some controversy here

1022
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:06,199
talking about the different flavors

1023
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,680
different textures and uh you know just

1024
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:11,239
the different

1025
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,239
um what happened

1026
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:18,920
here one or

1027
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,919
two wow they both taste grap but

1028
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,838
different grape I know the butter is

1029
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,400
more fruity yeah and the shatter one is

1030
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:31,078
just it's more like I don't even know

1031
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,440
what it is see how sits on the tongue

1032
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:36,359
though it's Morey it's just interesting

1033
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,318
it's interesting and how and I think

1034
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:38,559
Darren might have hit that it's

1035
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:41,639
definitely not the strain or the

1036
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,960
cultivar that he said it was no it's not

1037
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:46,559
and I said that I think it might be a

1038
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,519
mixed bag something got in there yeah I

1039
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:51,559
smelt a little bit of the haze in there

1040
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:54,239
that is you know often associated with

1041
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:55,559
an MK Ultra but I mean have you done any

1042
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:58,239
squishes like this where we're getting

1043
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:00,078
two different type of for the same

1044
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:02,559
squish it's kind of not quite to that

1045
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,960
extent of even amounts no it was so

1046
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,679

1047

well you guys saw we showed it with the

1048

uh camera but um it was definitely

1049
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,240
pronounced would it be nice to know the

1050
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:15,039
thickness and all that whole thing will

1051
