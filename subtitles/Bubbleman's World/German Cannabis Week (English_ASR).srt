Rogers from ICBC this is two old school

134
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:26,879
fools you know Ivory White Tower looking

135
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,360
over [ __ ] right now to tell us how sick

136
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,399
the ICBC is in Berlin it's it's sick you

137
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,139
know Mary Jane's amazing it's a it's

138
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,339
great that they both can happen at the

139
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,500
same time because they serve two

140
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,240
different purposes agreed and this is

141
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,639
super like bringing the culture and you

142
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,720
know I and I we support uh cannabis

143
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,240
culture and healing of the nation

144
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,100
culture cool and what ICPC does that too

145
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,620
but we just do it on this like a little

146
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,659
bit next next level totally and we bring

147
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,339
people from about 80 different countries

148
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:55,259
from all around the world to really

149
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:57,839
really really really really really get

150
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:00,778
down in terms of business policy and

151
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,519
activism it definitely looks from the

152
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:04,140
outside like it's a much more corporate

153
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,259
event but I can say from someone who's

154
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,600
been a lot it's really a nice mix of the

155
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:11,640
corporate and the culture the Legacy

156
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,279
culture that that kind of just combines

157
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,740
this really nice sort of uber

158
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:18,480
professional like you're not wasting

159
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,980
your time at an ICBC conference if

160
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,140
you're there to do business you're there

161
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,759
to say export cannabis from Canada

162
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,199
you're going to find people to do that

163
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,519
with if you're looking to sell equipment

164
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,679
for extraction you're going to find

165
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,079
people to do that if you're a consultant

166
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,640
you know whether it's from lighting or

167
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:35,038
growing or processing you're going to

168
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,500
find people to connect to so uh this is

169
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:40,019
my first ICBC in Berlin I have been to

170
