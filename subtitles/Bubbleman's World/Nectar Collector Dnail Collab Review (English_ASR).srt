00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:25,159
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,279
today I'm going to walk you through a

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,960
bit of a product review here I've been

5
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,960
getting really cool things sent to me

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,840
lately from denil and you probably

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,399
already seen this on my channel a few

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,120
times but I haven't actually talked

9
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,280
about it with you guys now this is

10
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:42,119
called the nectar collector it's by no

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,840
means uh not it's nothing new that it's

12
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,038
been around for a while and uh it's a

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,520
really cool concept A different idea

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,039
from a different perspective on dabbing

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,079
and so the nectar collector is like a

16
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,399
straw unit it's a two pieces of glass

17
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,120
that fit together and then you can have

18
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,719
a tip that is also glass or quartz I

19
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,839
believe they make them in I can just

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,159
show you this real quick we can open it

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,560
up a nice little view here how it comes

22
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,880
in the box and so this is the main body

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,159
right here and then you have the mouth

24
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,920
piece up here and these are the two um

25
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,439
pieces that you would heat up to hit uh

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,840
your product and then this is a little

27
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:22,959
bit of a wax and I'll talk to you about

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,118
that in a few seconds here when we

29
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,639
actually put the nectar collector

30
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,359
together so it comes with a really cool

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,879
stand which uh is definitely a essential

32
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,159
this thing would be a super pain in the

33
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:36,478
ass without this stand so getting the

34
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,960
stand with the unit is absolutely

35
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,599
crucial you want to have a safe place to

36
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,639
keep your unit so let us pull out the

37
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,839
main piece here nectar collector it's

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,000
got the three marbles there got a little

39
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,000
bit of water here I can put

40
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:53,718
in certainly don't need much that was

41
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,959
probably a little bit too much right

42
00:01:53,718 --> 00:02:00,759
there it's a very very small amount of

43
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,919
water you put in I go about two

44
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,879
2/3 up the perk in the

45
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,878
center and then just put that there for

46
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,719
one second now this piece here has a

47
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,159
ground glass joint that fits into here

48
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,000
and what they tell you to do with this

49
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,959
little bit of joint wax is to just give

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,598
it a little bit of a a rub on there by

51
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:24,280
no means you have to put a lot

52
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:27,318
on but get some

53
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,120
on and then once you fit that in there

54
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:30,560
it kind of locks it in good and it

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,599
actually what it really does is it

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,519
avoids it from locking it in so you

57
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:36,479
can't get out and it just makes it a

58
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:40,200
little bit safer so that's definitely a

59
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,199
good idea I have never used these yet

60
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,958
but we're going to use them today

61
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,280
there's two sizes one's quite a little

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,759
bit finer one's a little bit larger I'm

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,479
going to go with the fine one today so

64
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,878
we'll get that in there I guess the

65
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,560
joint wax probably wouldn't be a bad

66
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:56,000
idea for that guy

67
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,319
either just kind of give it a little

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,560
strip on there it's very hard almost

69
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:03,679
like a sex

70
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,360
wax joint wax probably exactly what it

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,280
is give a little twist and then

72
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,360
basically I've got a little bit of

73
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,799
delemon extract this Rose Colored um

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,319
extract let me actually get up there and

75
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,040
show you guys cuz it's really looks

76
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,639
quite nice so the one on the right here

77
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,280
is the dmon from Horatio and then on the

78
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,919
left here I have a little rosin that was

79
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,598
made from my good friend

80
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,719
true

81
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:31,039
from true I guess he's from sacka

82
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,639
genetics now and maybe even in the

83
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,199
middle of doing a new thing I'm not sure

84
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,839
I'll keep you guys posted in regards to

85
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,839
that so we've got our

86
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,680
unit right amount of water it's getting

87
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,679
close but it's not going in my mouth and

88
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,080
I guess what we're going to do is we're

89
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,040
going to all right so we got the torch

90
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,239
going here just going to give this a

91
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,560
little give this a little heat

92
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,280
up and I guess the idea is basically

93
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,680
heat the tip up and then just dip it

94
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,560
right down into your product and slurp

95
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,560
it up like your uh hitting a

96
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,798
Slurpee maybe get it out of the wind a

97
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,239
little bit

98
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,239
here there we

99
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,319
go hope I don't have to hit it up much

100
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,759
harder than

101
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,560
that I'm a Noob on this thing so I'm

102
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,919
going to let it sit for a little bit

103
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,000
here don't want to hit it too too too

104
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,159
hot but I didn't heat it up too too hot

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,918
it was no but by no means was it glowing

106
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,039
so let's see if we can't uh

107
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,399
yeah let's see if we can't hit a little

108
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:42,399
of the D

109
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
lemoning

110
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,720
not bad nice little light rip of course

111
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,879
I didn't heat it up very long with the

112
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,240
torch I could have gotten a much bigger

113
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,519
smokier rip I just want real light on

114
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,680
that because I really what I wanted to

115
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,560
show you today was not so much that

116
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,560
piece it's not that hot so I can pull

117
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,800
that right out not that piece

118
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,199
but the part that I'm actually quite

119
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,038
excited about and the reason why denil

120
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,759
sent this to me and not nectar

121
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:39,560
collector

122
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,879
was let's get this on the

123
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,079
table now

124
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:47,279
this is a new whip that dils designed

125
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,279
that

126
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:53,680
goes with your nectar collector

127
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,160
so we can get that guy in there really

128
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,720
easy enough give it a little bit of a

129
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,080
spin just cuz it's keeps a little bit

130
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,440
safer you know you don't want that

131
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,318
falling out while you're using it we're

132
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:08,959
going to turn the denail on I've got it

133
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,639
set to around 750 deges I really prefer

134
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,239
an electronic nail I have to tell you

135
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,038
from someone that hasn't been torching

136
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,800
much over all these years I'm not a big

137
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:19,159
torch guy uh I prefer the electronic

138
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,160
Nails I find that when you don't have

139
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,439
the experience with the torch it's

140
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,919
harder to realize and know the actual

141
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,959
temperatures without a laser temperature

142
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,439
guiding you along the way for all the

143
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,000
different um surfaces from the silicone

144
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,319
carbide from the sapphire to the ceramic

145
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,399
to the quartz to the titanium and even

146
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,280
through the different levels of titanium

147
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:41,679
then of course in the end even some

148
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:45,159
people are smoking out of glass so all

149
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,478
of these different surfaces create um

150
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,680
different

151
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,359
evaporation uh of the Cannabis a

152
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,720
different sublimation if you will it

153
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,439
changes the way it hits depending on how

154
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,639
the material holds that heat

155
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,639
so I prefer the electric nail due to the

156
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,038
fact that it gives me an exact

157
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,918
temperature for what I'm hitting with I

158
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:09,918
think if someone invented a torch that

159
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:12,079
had the laser site on it telling you the

160
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,000
temperature that's a winning product in

161
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,639
my opinion right there and uh you know

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,918
what who's to say that Dil won't be the

163
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,960
guys to come out with such a product so

164
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:24,079
we're going to let that heat up for

165
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,159
about another 30 seconds and then we're

166
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:29,279
going to hit the rosin dab that is

167
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,360
sitting here and I'm quite excited uh

168
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,399
you you know like I said I could have

169
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,960
got a bigger smokier rip if I heated it

170
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,719
up a little bit but more but I worry

171
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,598
that I'm going to heat it up too much

172
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,400
and then there's that process when

173
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,839
you're waiting and you're wondering okay

174
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,079
do I hit it now there's this 5 to 10

175
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,198
second period where you're going to get

176
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:49,800
that

177
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,478
best hit and it's very important uh to

178
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,840
me to try and get that hit every time

179
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:58,878
so hands down electric nails are where

180
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,878
it's at so this thing is pretty darn

181
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,120
cool the first time I got it it I was a

182
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,599
little bit leery of turning it upside

183
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,800
down and the worry of this coming out

184
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:07,759
was a little bit like oh what do you

185
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,960
mean we're going to turn that upside

186
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,720
down what if it falls out uh it hasn't

187
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,959
fallen out on me yet this this moves

188
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,840
quite nicely so as you move the unit

189
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,239
it's not so tight that it can't move

190
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,478
around and swivel and I think we're up

191
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,280
to

192
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:24,560
temperature what we got there 690 well

193
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,959
that's good enough for me let's have a

194
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,959
Rosen

195
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,439
dab

196
00:08:52,519 --> 00:09:00,480
so that was a much much nicer rip

197
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:04,600
obviously I took three times as much

198
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,600
it was rosin and it was extremely tasty

199
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:09,759
rosin both great options if you don't

200
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,759
have the electricity and you're out and

201
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,078
about and you just have this in a nice

202
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,000
little case and you're able to pull it

203
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:17,719
out and slap in one of these little

204
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,958
glass nozzles heat it up and have

205
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,839
yourself a little hit it's surprisingly

206
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,879
how easy it is to hit off of an oil

207
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,360
slick shout out to Joshua and

208
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:28,078
Christopher and the whole team down at

209
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,240
oil slick for producing you know a very

210
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:31,919
good product for our industry

211
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,480
I know that cookie sheets already

212
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,078
existed before but they really brought

213
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,000
them into our industry and and and

214
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:41,759
bettered our industry for it so up to

215
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,440
500° Fahrenheit I believe I heat the

216
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:49,159
nail up and uh I haven't had one melt on

217
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,160
me or have any it actually must go up to

218
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,519
way past 500 cuz the nail itself is at

219
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:56,480
700 right now and I literally drag the

220
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,480
nail across the top of it and uh I don't

221
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,560
feel any sort of taste for me I have a

222
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,240
very high um my oil factory my smell and

223
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:08,599
my taste are very on point and so

224
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,839
anytime even from leaving uh hash or

225
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,278
resin in um certain containers I've

226
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,079
smelt the off gassing from the Plastics

227
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:18,399
and stayed away from them so to each

228
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:20,000
their own in the end and I'm sure you

229
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,480
guys will all have different comments

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,919

231
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,399
