I I I guess I must not have your email

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,079
because I used to do all the invitations

19
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,478
via that Facebook messenger and I just

20
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,079
sent out an email I to the same group I

21
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,400
sent out last week which I remembered I

22
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,239
or the week before which I spaced having

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,359
you on it and so um yeah it was kind of

24
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:22,560

Madison said they would try to come in

27
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,000

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,600
Mark said he would try to come in and

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,239
even Neo maybe it was Neo Mark too that

30
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,599
instead of Mark shalone I can't even

31
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,679

what strains do you know up here uh

202
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,240
without getting attacked by buritis or

203
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,559
whatnot you know we live in the mountain

204
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,200
valleys and they easily get clogged up

205
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:25,479
with moisture and stuff but yeah

206
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,399
spectacular Year all the flowers get to

207
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,120

so yeah things are really good up here

229

231
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,639
really done a number on our farm

232
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,600
so hopefully it's been uh Been a Good

233
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,320
Year of like you know learning about

234
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,800
what the next season will bring for you

235
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,680
guys on the genetic side you know and

236
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:37,879
just kind of paying attention to the

237
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,359
things that are going on in the garden

238
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:42,838
and you know from the plant for

239
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,720
morphology to resistance and you know

240
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,399
just just understanding what the next

241
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,320
season will look like I think is you

242
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,879
know it's always a nice preview into the

243
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,480
you know previous years genetics you

244
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,838
know

245
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,240
so quite a bit with the heavy range that

246
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,440
just ensued but you know luckily I start

247
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,680
started covering things and and really

248
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,560
just making sure that the at least the

249
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,638
rain wasn't on top of the plants um you

250
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,199
have Heavy

251
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,560
Rain Man I was in California for it but

252
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,519
apparently yesterday or the day before

253
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:20,159
it was Thursday or something it was like

254
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:23,000
all day it just rained all day I we six

255
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:26,000
millimeters in like four

256
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,600
months wow yeah it was it was crazy I

257
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,198
mean the East Coast just a different

258
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,480
world but it just you know East Coast

259
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:34,838
man we can have like 20 inches of rain

260
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,440
the last month of your of your crop and

261
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,480
just it changes your world you know so

262
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,279
it's it's a very different environment

263
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,800
um you know everything could be going

264
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,639
perfect until August and September and

265
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,919
then October rolls around and it's just

266
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,240
you're you get beat up you know so it's

267
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:54,198
um it's really important to be proactive

268
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,680
I saw on Brian's uh best friend Farm's

269
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:59,838
Instagram yesterday that they got 4 Ines

270
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:02,078
of rain in 24 hours exactly

271
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,120
you know that's our whole and welcome

272
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,239
Connor I'd love to hear from you in in

273
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,519
just one second um I was just going to

274
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,278
say on the rain tip I mean we we we have

275
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,799
to prepare for Armageddon every fall

276
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,600
type thing too that's why we have seven

277
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,000
different green houses on our property

278
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,399
they're all different styles we keep we

279
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,159
sort of always keep the walls up every

280
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,399
really the greenhouse is just a roof in

281
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,198
the springtime it's a it's walls and an

282
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,600
end wall and all that we get the early

283
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:35,240
we don't even need that early start

284
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,199
because honestly starting in May or or

285
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,120
right in that and getting that late

286
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:42,039
spring window when it's really warm out

287
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,600
like the plants totally catch up you get

288
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:47,799
an incredible year so there really isn't

289
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,639
any need to rush it early in the season

290
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:53,958
so really our green houses are mainly

291
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:57,360
just a roof they're a roof just to keep

292
00:13:53,958 --> 00:14:00,119
acid rain off the buds just kidding but

293
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,079
probably that too um but you know and

294
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,959
and also just rain in general and then

295
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,198
we have to be careful about humidity and

296
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:09,758
just flow through humidity but that's

297
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:12,799
the one thing you know that we we really

298
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,839
we start our light depths June 1 or

299
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,719
middle of June so that we can at least

300
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,800
have one good greenhouse that's probably

301
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,600
going to do well by be being done in the

302
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:26,359
middle of August Because by the end of

303
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,360
August we can plan on rain but this year

304
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,240
we did get rain in the end of August we

305
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,519
got a week weeks worth of rain in the

306
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,278
end of August here in the cies and it

307
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,519
did [ __ ] with some PLS but and and

308
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,360
honestly we've done so much soil

309
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,198
building on our property over the years

310
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,440
this is probably the first year we

311
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,120
didn't use any te's on any of our

312
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,320
property because it was totally

313
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:53,600
unnecessary plants had zero bugs zero

314
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,839
mold zero issues no trellising the odd

315
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,759
plant got tall and heavy and fell over

316
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,480
during some winds but we just put some

317
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,519
bamboo in it and St staked it up most of

318
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,360
our plants are just self they just hold

319
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,078
themselves up you know and and we let

320
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,440
them blow around all year so they

321
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:12,719
continue to be strong and it's sweet for

322
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,560
us so anyway that's that um but welcome

323
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,240
Connor turp wizard from Michigan how you

324
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,239

325
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,480
brother I'm doing great um just trying

326
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:26,799
to get some of my soil beds uh tucked in

327
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,360
for the winter and get everything

328
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,799
prepped um before it gets to too cold

329
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,480
out here we had a really nice season

330
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:37,278
this year um I picked some spots in the

331
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,199
woods that are a little bit more shady

332
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:43,120
so things started flowering sooner which

333
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:45,838
means they ended sooner as well and I've

334
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,159
been really uh enjoying growing in the

335
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,199
woods compared to um the

336
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:56,000
yard that's cool that's cool and and

337
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:58,318
also plant magic Homestead is the farm

338
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,839
that you just certified which is all the

339
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:02,559
outdoor the

340
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,519
genetics uh really enjoyed growing your

341
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,758
genetics this year just by the way we

342
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:10,440
had a lot of really good results from

343
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,360
the all the strains that we they got

344
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,360
from you and and even the GMO which we

345
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,959
told you in the spring was the one one

346
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,318
of the one plants in the greenhouse that

347
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:20,359
didn't get eaten by mice now I don't

348
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:21,078
know if you can put mice resistant on

349
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,560
the

350
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:29,479
label but it didn't get eaten by

351
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:31,078
mice so anyway yeah the strawberry jelly

352
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,759
the which I you can tell us the real

353
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:34,399
names but sometimes I just put the

354
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,480
actual cross on there because it's

355
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,720
easier for me to see what the plant is

356
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,399
while it's growing so that I can Vibe on

357
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:47,600
oh this is a a grape cream cake by

358
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:49,799
banana OG or this is a strawberry pie by

359
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,600
grape cream and then I just get the vibe

360
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,599
on what the plant's

361
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:59,838

Advantage when the the plants are made

that box there was a lot of good stuff

426

year um make space in their Garden for

462
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,038
some seeds that I made in my backyard

463
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,600
you know I don't really consider myself

464
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,640
a breeder I kind of like you know

465
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,839
working with the hash plants that I I

466
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,720
have available and then finding a male

467
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,158
that's interesting to me and you know

468
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,360
combining them and seeing what they do

469
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,960
um you know obviously there's certain

470
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:45,038
traits that I'd like but I don't know if

471
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,519
I'm quite as uh experienced as some

472
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,000
other people who

473
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,639
would uh you know call themselves a

474
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,319
breeder you know but I kind of just say

475
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,200
I'm a my my seed projects I'm making

476
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:57,079
seeds I I don't I don't know if I'm

477
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,000
quite ready for that but yeah it's been

478
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:03,319
really sweet to see everyone 's

479
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,880
um results and to see what the male was

480
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:06,720
bringing into the equation because I was

481
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,880
pretty familiar with the female stock of

482
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,278
everything and um yeah it's been some

483
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,278
Stellar

484
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:16,798
results be

495
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:04,000
from skunk Tech

496
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:07,759
uh GMO which is a local um cut there's

497
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,400
like a couple GMO Cuts floating around

498
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:14,200
Michigan um and

499
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,240
then I've got a crder Gaya which was

500
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,440
selected from JJ Michigan regenerative

501
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,278
farmer so that's kind of like a little

502
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:24,519
Michigan Dem uh

503
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:27,119
collab um I think there's one or two

504
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:30,599
more that I'm drawing a blank on but got

505
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:34,319
like the male the male that you used

506
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:37,678
have have you is it uh alive I mean do

507
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:40,759
you keep the mail alive for the next

508
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:44,120
year no I'm going to be selecting uh a

509
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:47,079
mail probably from the F2 stock I made

510
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:49,519
um and then just keep finding new males

511
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,000
just you know I pop a lot of seeds so I

512
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,839
like to find something that's

513
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
interesting um that catches my eye and

514
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:58,959
that has some lineage that is more

515
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,278
towards um the half side like I'll grow

516
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,600
out some of the females see what the

517
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:03,960
Expressions I'm seeing from that and

518
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,798
kind of hope that some of those traits

519
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,880
get transferred over and um the reason I

520
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:14,079
was mentioning that was because you know

521
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:16,760
you can take a male clone and with Ethyl

522
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,278
on you can transform it to a

523
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:22,119
female and then you get a really good

524
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:25,558
idea of what trines and cannaboids it

525
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:29,519
has the ability to maybe pass on to its

526
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:31,519
projecty it's a lot more sophisticated

527
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,359
breeding what was the name of that

528
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,918
compound that you were saying Sam well

529
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:41,839
it's called ethelon but what it is it's

530
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:44,640
ethylene gas uh yeah I I think it's

531
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:47,720
ethelon is the is the technical name on

532
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,960
it but uh what I'll do is uh on hash

533
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,679
church I will post the name of the

534
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,278
chemical and the name of the paperwor

535
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:59,559
they talk about using it but what's nice

536
00:24:56,278 --> 00:25:06,480
about it unlike SDS which you can use to

537
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:10,000
make uh uh mascul uh female clones and

538
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:13,599
uh the if you do that well that works

539
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,759
very good you make all female crops but

540
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:19,278
this is not dangerous so it's the same

541
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,359
thing that comes out of

542
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,798
bananas you know and if you want to

543
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:27,678
ripen up fruit faster you can put it in

544
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:31,079
a paper bag with rip bananas well this

545
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:35,159
does this same thing but wham bam thank

546
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:39,038
you ma'am the male will turn female uh I

547
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:43,919
think I've showed uh Marcus photos of

548
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:47,200
the work before and uh yeah it's it's

549
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:51,960
it's not so good for form because uh

550
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,558
some of the uh the the the female that

551
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:58,600
the the male that gets transformed into

552
00:25:54,558 --> 00:26:02,240
a female doesn't look particularly

553
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:07,038
female form it has more of a masculine

554
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:11,319
wispy form but the flowers the resin the

555
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:13,278
Turpin they all uh show up and you can

556
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:17,678
get a really good idea what it has the

557
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:19,919
ability to give from that

558
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,880
female Sam is that um I feel like that's

559
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,120
a

560
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,799
diamond that you just

561
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:29,398
dropped it is you dropped what my my

562
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,879
question to you Sam is that similar to

563
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:36,398
you can smoke it is it a is it like

564
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:39,679
selfing but with a with ethylene correct

565
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:41,639
it's like selfing except for you're with

566
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:46,200
selfing what you're doing is you're

567
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,520
taking a a female and making male pollen

568
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:52,679
with this you're taking a male and

569
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:55,079
you're making a female from it got it so

570
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:58,320
it's the reverse of it yeah amazing that

571
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:00,798
is a Jem yeah and it's smokable unlike

572
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,918
anything you've done with STS you cannot

573
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:07,200
smoke it in fact you can't even really

574
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:09,480
handle STS it's dangerous right yeah

575
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,600
yeah that's for those that don't know

576
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,679
that is like the sage wisdom was just

577
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:20,158
cast upon

578
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:22,000
us join hurch Facebook grou did you P

579
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,880
also as well there

580
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,960
Sam what people have to do in the past

581
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:32,240
was you had to take a mail keep it alive

582
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,880
for a few years as a clone hit your

583
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:39,159
ladies with it and then grow those seeds

584
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,840
out and find out so it was a several

585
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:44,399
year process for you to find out when

586
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:47,519
you field tested the progyny seeds that

587
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:50,839
you actually produced with this one it

588
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:53,720
it can for example if you have 10 skunk

589
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:56,439
number one males this will immediately

590
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,919
show you which one has the most resin

591
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,360
which one is the you know it really

592
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,038
really points in the direction and when

593
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,158
I first did this about because I had

594
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:09,398
been using my skunk mail for maybe a

595
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,679
decade or longer then I I tried this on

596
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:16,599
it and I was shocked and surprised how

597
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:18,759
sweet the mail was in other words people

598
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:21,599
are always saying oh you breed the skunk

599
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:24,359
out of skunk you know but uh I did it

600
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:27,319
because I preferred the high the smells

601
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:28,719
The Taste the effects and uh it's my

602
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:33,000
creation of course of course I could do

603
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,759
what I want and uh but what what I found

604
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,398
out was that the mail I had been using

605
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,549
for the last decade was even sweeter

606
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:41,959
than the

607
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:46,839
[Laughter]

608
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,840
girl I think find that out too

609
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,600
right that's a serious gem you just

610
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,480
dropped there and for those of you that

611
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:55,199
want more information on that you would

612
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,640
be implored to join the Facebook hash

613
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,558
church group because that's where Sam's

614
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,200
going to post this information and uh

615
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:06,519
amazing that it uh like Sam has so much

616
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,759
information in his head that he can't

617
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:11,359
just put it all out there we have to

618
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:15,000
have conversations for now I think eight

619
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:17,558
years for that to get extracted so thank

620
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,440
you Sam thank you T

621
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:22,240
wiard of

622
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,640
Sam usually when I'm sitting in my chair

623
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:29,038
some of it sort of just leaks out my ear

624
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,159
247 it's awesome dude and and Josh

625
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,720
inviting uh turp wizard in because it

626
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:35,880
was really turp wizard who somehow

627
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,880
pulled that out of out out of you there

628
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,960
and uh man I'm glad we did this that

629
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,720
right there was worth past church today

630
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,960
that's that's like I don't know if

631
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,200
everyone understands how [ __ ] insane

632
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,519
and profound that information was and I

633
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,278
I'm not sure if you heard this what Sam

634
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:56,000
just said best friends but uh if you

635
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:59,200
didn't yeah when it's really really

636
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,640
important is let's say you have 10 or 20

637
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,360
males of the same variety and you don't

638
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,600
know which one is the best one to use

639
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:13,119
you can either use them all or you can

640
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,678
actually pre-screen them using this get

641
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:18,359
it down to two or three then use those

642
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,480
separately with your ladies and find out

643
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:24,199
which truly is the best of the two or

644
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,200
three or if all three of them are

645
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:32,879
good well I guess that's how church

646
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:32,880
like that's a

647
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,919
w the mic drop that's

648
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,319
yep it'll be seven years from now so

649
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:42,600
some G be like hey do you remember what

650
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,759
hash that was when Sam talked about that

651
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:46,959
chemical that he put on the bananas or

652
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,759
something like I don't remember exactly

653
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,399
can you tell me what number that was and

654
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:55,919
what time he said that I think the

655
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:58,079
chemicals name is ethelon but uh if I

656
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,360
you know my memory is a piece of switch

657
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:03,759
cheese

658
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:08,599
so I don't know we'll pull

659
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:11,599
it cv1 receptors yeah exactly did you

660
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:15,079
hear what he was saying though

661
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:17,918
Brian about gender bending yeah I just

662
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:20,158
CAU I just CAU that with out of the 10

663
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,919
males uh select the two to

664
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,120
three you know the top two before that

665
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:28,720
he's turning males into females to check

666
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:31,479
their tpine and and cannaboid profiles

667
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,240
with with this with this chemical that

668
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:37,120
yeah yeah yeah just say it one more time

669
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:40,319
Sam we need this twice oh okay basically

670
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:44,000
what it is it's using ethelon and you

671
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:47,599
spray it on a mail just as you're GNA

672
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:52,398
begin to flower it and it will turn

673
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:55,678
female it will produce you know 99%

674
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,638
female instead of male flowers if you

675
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,798
didn't spray one par particular area

676
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:05,278
maybe you might get a few male flowers

677
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:07,960
but uh then it allows you to test the

678
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:11,079
the uh with the gas chromatographer or

679
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,480
whatever you can test the turpine and

680
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:17,960
the cannabinoid profile and you get a

681
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:22,200
really good idea of what that

682
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:24,440
male uh can give as part of the

683
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,120
inheritance package that it's going to

684
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,519
get and Sam you could potentially clone

685
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:33,119
that male

686
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:37,480
beforehand right and then have a few of

687
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:41,278
those males around yeah I us on the

688
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:44,798
female from absolutely but you can't you

689
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:47,038
can't it's only a temporary

690
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,638
transformation doesn't permanently

691
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,679
change it's it's like if you use

692
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:56,678
SDS uh you know it's not a permanent

693
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:59,840
transort the DNA hasn't changed all

694
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:03,000
that's changed is the sex expression you

695
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:05,918
know in the case of STS you're making a

696
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,079
female produce male pollen in this case

697
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,159
using ethelon to produce a male that

698
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,359
produces female

699
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:18,559
flowers in

700
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:20,599
uh expression so you can analyze it and

701
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:23,839
see what it is not only that but you can

702
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:25,558
smoke it it's totally safe so would you

703
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,038
recommend that as opposed to we used to

704
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:30,599
use gilc acid back in the day to turn

705
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:33,398
the female to male is that what you

706
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:36,599
would use now but gabic acid is again is

707
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:38,839
female to male and I'm talking male to

708
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:41,240
female it's a it's a completely

709
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:42,678
different picture no no I understand I

710
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,319
was just wondering if there was a

711
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:51,480
different well Gill acid Gill rubic acid

712
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:54,119
didn't even particularly well turn uh

713
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:57,960
females to male because it also made

714
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:59,959
them stretch I mean it it it was [ __ ]

715
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,159
ation when I did that with Ed that's

716
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,159
what it happened it causes

717
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:10,279
a just compared TOS it's a growth

718
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,079
hormone so that makes sense that yeah

719
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,919
because that I got turned on a dilic

720
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,639
acid because when I was working on bonai

721
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:19,078
if you're trying to elongate a

722
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,559
particular Branch for like a Chinese uh

723
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:24,519
you know drop style or Japanese uh

724
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,239
cascading Etc you would use that chilc

725
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:28,239
acid and that's how I got turned onto it

726
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,358
and then started applying it to can

727
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,838
which we did get male pollen from but

728
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:35,279
the stretching and elongation made it

729
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:40,078
very challenging in smaller

730
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:44,320
rooms ex exactly uh I had a 20 foot tall

731
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:47,079
greenhouse and I find Gil ribic acid

732
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,399
unmanageable so don't you usually use

733
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:52,000
gibberelic acid with collodial silver if

734
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:55,799
you're going to use it for I don't use

735
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,280
codal silver I use STS it's much better

736
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,200
it it's just it's it's a toxic compound

737
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,800
where colloidal silver is not so some

738
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,039
people can still they could use collidal

739
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,160
silver if they want because you can

740
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,920
ingest collodial silver in your eyeballs

741
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:12,799
and in your body okay well I've never

742
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,519
used collodial well actually we did

743
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,839
about 25 years ago we tried every

744
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:21,400
different known method and collodial

745
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:25,000
silver was one of them so was gilic and

746
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:27,200
uh but what we found out was that STS

747
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,599
was absolutely the best the most

748
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,759
reliable

749
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:34,400
the only problem is if you're going to

750
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:37,400
transform a female to male you have to

751
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:41,358
make sure that female doesn't have the

752
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,000
Tendencies to express intersex because

753
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:45,759
then

754
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,880
you yeah yeah you enhance the

755
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,640
intersection yes

756
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,680
exactly um we just recently walked

757
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:56,960
through a hem field out in Colona and

758
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:58,318
there is a licensed cultivar called

759
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,519
Umpqua

760
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:05,079
that's up here and one more anyway and

761
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:07,159
it was it's Fe feminized seed and uh we

762
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:09,240
walked through the field and there's

763
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:13,318
probably like a good

764
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:15,639
four or five different fenos in that

765
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:18,239
field which I I thought was sort of

766
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:21,799
surprising and I didn't know if one of

767
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:23,879
the methods that of feminizing is less

768
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,920
stable than the other but I thought with

769
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,160
feminizing it would just be a little bit

770
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,519
more stable than that even though a lot

771
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:34,639
of it

772
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,280
was and it was it was actually a really

773
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,639
sweet CR they

774
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:42,599
wereing probably what they were doing

775
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:46,318
was using poly multi hybrids for either

776
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:49,000
their male pollen source and transformed

777
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:52,719
female to male pollen Source or they're

778
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,519
females and when you have poly hybrids

779
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:59,480
and you breed them poly

780
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:01,440
hybrids you're going to get multiple

781
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,800
phenotypes which can either be an

782
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,079
advantage or a disadvantage depending on

783
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:10,000
what your purpose is most people who

784
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:13,000
cultivate want to get a large crop of

785
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,039
Fairly identical stuff so that they can

786
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,599
you know do the cood and the analyzation

787
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:20,679
and everything else as a package rather

788
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:23,960
than each separate

789
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:25,639
plan yeah and so Josh you know I grew a

790
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,800
lot of those varietals in the states

791
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:31,879
here and I had a chance to do like super

792
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:34,119
hay you know couple different sour Thea

793
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,480
the lifter a bunch of them and what I

794
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,318
really noticed is what Sam just said is

795
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,838
that they're definitely using poly

796
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:43,039
hybrids and even probably Crossing those

797
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:45,759
poly hybrids with other groups of poly

798
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,559
hybrids and that in and of itself when

799
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,319
you looked at the field is like

800
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:51,679
different smells different you know

801
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:54,239
different structure different resistance

802
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:57,039
you know so it was really fascinating to

803
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:59,719
see that over 58 acres and just kind of

804
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,920
like look at it and be like okay

805
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:04,439
distinctively these rows are the same

806
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,200
but they're also very different you know

807
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,240
um so the like the CH profiles were you

808
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,639
know from lifter were like ranging from

809
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:15,439
sour to gassy you know like it just you

810
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:19,118
know and the oqua was like very spicy

811
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,159
and you know um very uh just reminded me

812
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,079
of older varietals from like the the

813
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:27,279
early 90s and late 80s yeah one of the

814
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,200
other handy things that you can do with

815
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,359
uh

816
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:34,519
ethalon is you can use it to create a

817
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:40,239
all male

818
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:44,920
variety from seed so uh the first year

819
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:48,719
you do you make the cross of uh uh a

820
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:51,519
male and a female that have been a trans

821
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:54,159
well the the male was transformed to a

822
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:58,400
female and then you use a straight male

823
00:38:54,159 --> 00:39:03,559
on it 25% of the seeds will be

824
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:05,680
uh y y and uh if you select those one

825
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:10,119
you'll have to find which ones they are

826
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:13,559
because they're not all then uh you you

827
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:17,079
can easily produce crops which are 100%

828
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:20,440
male which uh most people there's no use

829
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:22,880
for that but for fiber in theory an all

830
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,800
male crop would be better because there

831
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,720
would be no problems with the police

832
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,599
because if there's no female plants then

833
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:33,598
you don't have a problem and uh if

834
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:36,800
they're all male male fibers actually

835
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:41,359
finer a little bit finer than female

836
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:44,440
fiber so it produces uh finer woven

837
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:46,719
fabrics if you're interested in that do

838
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,920
you recommend any kind of

839
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:53,000
decorticator uh any kind of small sort

840
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,159
of home style decorticator to where

841
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,838
people could put their hemp stocks in it

842
00:39:55,159 --> 00:40:01,279
and make the fiber and the herd or they

843
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:05,880
could take Nettles nettle F how how many

844
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,680
plants well I've seen ones on Oli Baba

845
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,760
and different things for you know four

846
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,399
or $5,000 so some something like that

847
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,440
and plantwise I mean I don't know I'm

848
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,838
talking for the sustainable farmer where

849
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,358
maybe you're doing an acre or

850
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:24,759
three well then you you you you need a

851
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:27,719
real device not just a a toy because

852
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,160
I've done it by hand and uh that's what

853
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:33,118
I yeah Gardella out of Italy makes

854
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:35,960
larger machines I know domestically

855
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,440
there's only small producers I know John

856
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,838
lupian out of Oklahoma I mean pardon me

857
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,760
out of Nebraska uh was making one

858
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:47,838
because he took the old decorators uh

859
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,960
and kind of made one that was toad but I

860
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,759
know that back in the day Gardella made

861
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,559
the finest ones that you could just tow

862
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,960
to a

863
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,759
tractor and they would uh it would

864
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,720
basically separate the herds from the

865
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,040
wet fire F so the wet fiber would just

866
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:04,000
be hanging on a rod and then you could

867
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:06,079
just pull that off and then dry it um

868
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,679
are they still around Sam

869
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:12,280
Gardella uh I think so but you know I I

870
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:15,519
haven't been keeping in touch with the

871
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:18,760
the hemp industry the way I used to so I

872
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:21,559
I can't really say I mean i' I've seen

873
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:25,880
all kinds of sophisticated French

874
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:28,318
Italian Hungarian Etc uh Machin

875
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:31,200
Czechoslovakian polish

876
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:33,719
but uh I don't know which one is the

877
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:36,279
best and the most practical depending on

878
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:38,480
your crop size because also whether

879
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,640
you're going to do it like you say fresh

880
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,639
or dried because traditionally it was

881
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:48,279
done dried now uh it if you can do it

882
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:49,759
with wet it might be faster and easier

883
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,280
and what he's talking about is the

884
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,000
reading because uh back in the day you

885
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:57,240
used to field red I.E let it sit in the

886
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,239
field and let the bacteria eat the

887
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:03,039
ignant off of it the problem with would

888
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,919
cause it to to turn gray a lot of that

889
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:08,880
polar shmp would turn if you did that AB

890
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,800
absolutely all the French was gray even

891
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,720
the Italian was gray and so Eastern

892
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,680
Europe we would actually take large

893
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:17,559
baths which they had large concrete

894
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,799
baths and they would soak them and so we

895
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:22,480
would water R it so that the bacteria in

896
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,119
the water slowly did that and that way

897
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:29,039
we kept the golden color of the hemp so

898
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:31,599
that's how we did it by water reading um

899
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:34,400
whereas the Gardella machine it pulls it

900
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,519
off green so if you were able to dry

901
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,920
that properly it should come out golden

902
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:42,000
as well because you're no longer dealing

903
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:44,039
with the bacteria eating the agnostic uh

904
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
glues that hold the plant together

905
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:47,838
externally sorry to nerd out there

906
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,760
people oh no you're I love it I was just

907
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:53,639
gonna also just put in um Danny and her

908
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,040
father from the Colorado hemp project

909
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:58,719
they do amazing a lot of amazing workout

910
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:00,199
in Colorado with uh

911
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,639
industrializing uh you know

912
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:03,719
decortication and stuff and and fibers

913
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:05,480
and they do different things in the

914
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:08,199
world and I've been meaning to get in

915
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:11,519
touch with her she's really amazing

916
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:14,039
somebody is saying herd Master Hurd

917
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:16,239
Master uh comes up on Google looks like

918
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:19,639
they have some medium scale offerings

919
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:22,239
somebody is saying um um specifically

920
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:24,159
Tony neg in uh chat so thank you Tony

921
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,519
yeah if if you have a million dollars

922
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:27,118
and I know a lot of people don't have a

923
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:29,000
million dollars but if you do have Aon

924
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,519
million dollar or if you have Rich Uncle

925
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,159
who's got a million dollars go look at a

926
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:37,800
thing called The Hemp train hemp train

927
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:39,799
is very interesting uh Machinery that I

928
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,119
think was actually a Canadian company at

929
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,839
one time Marcus and then they were

930
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:47,318
purchased by a wealthy guy in

931
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:49,159
Pennsylvania in Red Lion PA and I know

932
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:51,759
he's got one of those hemp trains up and

933
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:56,719
running and yeah basically fractionates

934
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:59,640
the herd from the fiber from what I

935
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:01,598
guess is just like the biomass that's

936
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:04,719
just ground into a green powder which

937
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,680
could be extracted for CBD and

938
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:11,959
whatnot and some of that finer fiber can

939
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:16,838
be used for Plastics and and different

940
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,838
things like that but uh yeah I just like

941
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:22,519
the get on board the hemp train like we

942
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,920
all got on board the Soul Train remember

943
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:27,838
the Soul Train in the 70s everyone got

944
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,720
on board all these white people started

945
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:33,719
grooving to the to the music of of Black

946
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:35,399
America and it just became yeah this is

947
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:37,759
definitely the way to go well the hemp

948
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:42,039
train everyone get on board the hemp

949
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,040
train all you could be our new Don

950
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:50,880
Cornelius welcome to the H I saw I saw

951
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,599
video Mark scone I saw a video meme of

952
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,640
that the other day where it said when

953
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:57,559
the cocaine was so pure even white

954
00:44:54,639 --> 00:45:01,199
people could dance and it had all these

955
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:04,160
all these Soul trained whes dancing it

956
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:07,118
was pretty pretty pretty

957
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,838
hilarious all right you know Soul Train

958
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,160
and roller skating and we're get we're

959
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:13,838
getting into a whole new realm but I

960
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:16,279
think uh really the to to just interject

961
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:18,199
for a second so it really speaks to

962
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,800
something called the economy of scale

963
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:23,159
which is that if you could afford one of

964
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,720
those big hemp train type machines those

965
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:28,598
scale then to to run this I mean it's

966
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:31,279
just the operating cost so the plant

967
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:34,000
itself it doesn't make sense to do hand

968
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,960
cortication on a small scale what does

969
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,639
make sense is to have like a processing

970
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,480
center local to your farm where you

971
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:44,000
could bring your your your stocks and or

972
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,358
they could come and pick it up in a

973
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,400
truck or something like that and then

974
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:51,358
return to you the material after it's

975
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,400
been after it's been processed because

976
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:57,000
again just the look at the it's really

977
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,880
cool I think they have a really um

978
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,960
interesting video that describes the

979
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:07,960
process and the overall mechanical feat

980
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:10,838
of separating the herd from the fiber

981
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,599
and Sam you've probably seen this at

982
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:14,159
industrial scale whenever you do

983
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:17,160
something and it's just that sort of

984
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:19,879
like garage or basement scale it's one

985
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:23,118
thing but when you do stuff at at really

986
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:25,920
tremendous scale the power that's needed

987
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,559
to turn those to turn those Motors is

988
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,039
really important to consider and just

989
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:33,680
that they can do it a lot cheaper down

990
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:35,679
the street if you have that sort of

991
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:37,480
investment to be able to put one of

992
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:39,679
those things even the really old

993
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:44,119
machines that I

994
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:46,399
saw they were they were run by steam so

995
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:49,160
they they it had like a small steam

996
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:54,400
engine attached to it and it was from

997
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:58,639
the like 18 20s 30s 40s 50s something

998
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:02,720
like that and I saw that in just outside

999
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:05,239
of uh it was at an Italian Museum a Hemp

1000
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:09,118
Museum outside of ah [ __ ] I can't

1001
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:11,439
remember the name of the city but it

1002
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,440
isn't it true Sam that in the worldwide

1003
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,280
Market of hemp and I don't know this

1004
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,200
because China is a definitely a wild

1005
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,960
card here that all of that Antiquated

1006
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:24,879
equipment is still producing the

1007
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,760
world's bulk of of what's what's

1008
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,519
consumed and and and what's what's used

1009
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,920
I'm not talking about CBD in particular

1010
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:35,079
I'm talking about mostly fiber seed and

1011
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,760
oil that's all made on very Antiquated

1012
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:39,519
assets not stuck I think there's really

1013
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,400
only a few countries that are even

1014
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:46,639
producing fiber to be honest right right

1015
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,720
Slovakia right I know Marcus had a had a

1016
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:49,960
big you know early days of of hemp I

1017
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:51,759
know you were like really heavily

1018
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,440
involved in that stuff in Canada was

1019
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,480
there were you guys using you know large

1020
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:00,000
Machinery at that time to harvest that

1021
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:04,599
material for hemp and you know what when

1022
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,559
did that in 98 in 98 we had a hemp

1023
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:09,039
pageant I remember that's what we called

1024
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,440
it and we invited all these people over

1025
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:11,920
all these different people that had

1026
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,559
interest in the hemp industry and I

1027
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,400
remember there was really wild like we

1028
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:17,599
were just a bunch of kind of young dudes

1029
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:20,119
from Winnipeg kind of like yeah let's do

1030
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,440
this hemp thing and I remember these the

1031
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:24,720
these guys the hack Brothers showed up

1032
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,519
because they they like own diamond mines

1033
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:27,639
in Africa and we were like what brought

1034
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:29,639
them and then it was this like

1035
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:32,279
billionaire guy from Germany named Peter

1036
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:34,118
Steiner who had this piece of hemp metal

1037
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,400
that was like lighter than aluminum but

1038
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:38,680
stronger than titanium and it could cut

1039
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,960
glass uh and it had been shipped around

1040
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:43,039
the world eight or nine times and he

1041
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,440
brought it I held it in my hand I put an

1042
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:49,400
X into a glass asay because we still had

1043
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:52,559
as at the hotels back then and um we

1044
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:55,079
brought over a harvester from Holland

1045
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,798
and we brought over the the guy who

1046
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:01,480
basically ran it and we harvested about

1047
00:48:57,798 --> 00:49:03,079
5 to 10 acres uh at our H pageant with

1048
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,719
all of these people present and I'll

1049
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:08,200
never forget when he it had the two big

1050
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:09,959
red Cutters in the front and he just

1051
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:12,399
ripped through this 5 acre field this

1052
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,559
thing was fast too it was it was Dutch

1053
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,079
made so it was uh you know that it was

1054
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,880
definitely like the Dutch definitely

1055
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,760
know uh how to farm and how to build

1056
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,838
equipment and so it was pretty

1057
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,640
incredible machine I'll never forget

1058
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:27,798
when they ran through this five acre

1059
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:30,719
field the pollen that came off of the

1060
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:33,480
field was like clouds of pollen I'd

1061
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:35,118
never seen anything like it before and

1062
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,599
some people got really nervous because

1063
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,119
they had allergies and they were like oh

1064
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:41,838
my God I'm I'm gonna die right now and

1065
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,318
it didn't surprisingly set off many

1066
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:46,078
people there were a few people that kind

1067
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:47,798
of had to move away but um yeah I have

1068
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,880
pictures of that somewhere I'm not

1069
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:52,920
really sure where those pictures are but

1070
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:55,640
I do have pictures of that Harvester oh

1071
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,920
no how much did that how much did that

1072
00:49:55,639 --> 00:50:01,159
Harvester cost like would the average

1073
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:04,280
farmer who's growing hemp today be able

1074
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:06,399
to afford this this

1075
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,319
Harvester well it was certainly not a

1076
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,519
cheap machine I I can't remember back

1077
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:11,119
then it might have been a quarter of a

1078
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:12,519
million dollars I'm sure today it would

1079
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,960
be five or six or

1080
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:16,480
$700,000 I I I you know don't quote me

1081
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,599
on that it could have been a little bit

1082
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,960
less it could have been a little bit

1083
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,720
more back then but it was not a cheap uh

1084
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,519
piece of Machinery especially to bring

1085
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:26,719
over uh and get to Canada but the work

1086
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:28,719
that it did of the hemp and how fast it

1087
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:31,159
harvested the hemp I certainly wouldn't

1088
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,239
think anyone growing under you know 500

1089
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:35,960
to 1,000 Acres would would be getting

1090
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:39,199
one but um you could Harvest very

1091
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,880
quickly um and it was it was profound

1092
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,039
for us because we were just super young

1093
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,000
this was like

1094
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:47,119
19 no it would have been before 1998

1095
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,679
because I moved in 96 so it probably

1096
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:53,680
would have been 94 95 maybe

1097
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:56,838
9596 when we when we had that done we

1098
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:58,480
grew our we grew our first field in '95

1099
00:50:56,838 --> 00:51:00,719
so it wouldn't have been 95 that was an

1100
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,039
experimental field there was only one

1101
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:06,838
field grown before our field and that

1102
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:09,119
was in '94 and that was by Jeff uh Jeff

1103
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:11,119
Kim and Joe Strobel the tobacco Farmer

1104
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,400
and the lawyer they got the first ever

1105
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,440
license in Canada you know in the the

1106
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,599
last 73 years or whatever it had been

1107
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,720
since temp had been grown in Canada we

1108
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,000
were one of the five or six groups that

1109
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:24,959
got our five acre experimental field the

1110
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,280
next year uh so it was pretty cool kind

1111
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,159
of neat to be a part of that history and

1112
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,640
uh you know I'll never forget inviting

1113
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:33,798
my mentor Ron hickey who had served I

1114
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:36,400
guess at that point he had served six

1115
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:38,798
and a half years in jail for cannabis he

1116
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,440
would end up serving another five plus

1117
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:43,838
years in the federal penitentiary with

1118
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,000
mass murders and rapists and

1119
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:49,159
Psychopaths uh for being a habitual

1120
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,599
florist albe it uh but we brought him in

1121
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:53,920
my Volkswagen van to our first five acre

1122
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:57,079
field and he definitely had tears in his

1123
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:00,000
eyes I'll never forget the um just a

1124
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:02,280
profound Revelation in his soul that was

1125
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,159
occurring you know and I'll never forget

1126
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,519
my partner Martin morovic at the time

1127
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:09,318
either saying this is going to change

1128
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:11,079
the way people think uh not necessarily

1129
00:52:09,318 --> 00:52:13,119
the smoking of it but the driving down

1130
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:15,798
the highway and looking over here and

1131
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,079
seeing like a five five acres was the

1132
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:20,559
most any of us had ever seen and Ron

1133
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,960
grew a lot of cannabis but five acres

1134
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,720
just in one big field in

1135
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,440
1995 uh was substantial and we were

1136
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:29,558
surprised that the time because it

1137
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,159
looked it was buds it was just like it

1138
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:33,839
was it was herb you know it was you know

1139
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:36,719
at the time we had convinced our

1140
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:39,159
minister of uh f it was minister of

1141
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:42,480
Agriculture and Minister of Finance that

1142
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:45,118
uh you know hemp was a distant cousin of

1143
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,318
of the Insidious marijuana and it really

1144
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,358
wasn't the same thing but once we grew

1145
00:52:47,318 --> 00:52:53,039
it and we saw like holy [ __ ] this is

1146
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:55,719
definitely very close to the same thing

1147
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:59,358
big stinky Buds and you know 10 foot

1148
00:52:55,719 --> 00:53:03,358
tall PL well Marcus Marcus there's that

1149
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:05,719
important distinction that important 3%

1150
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:08,960
and and weren't you guys wasn't this

1151
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:11,358
group the people who had kind of defined

1152
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,480
3% and if I remember correctly I'm not

1153
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:16,159
sure that this is true but I thought

1154
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:18,280
it's because that was the limit to which

1155
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,279
they could detect to so they said okay

1156
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,960
we can detect to this limit so therefore

1157
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,680
that will be the limit 3% and now look

1158
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,159
at the ramification that that's had

1159
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:30,118
since right it was the definition it was

1160
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:31,358
on a document I thought it was the peace

1161
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:33,920
treaty the

1162
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:36,920
1962 or whatever the peace treaty was

1163
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,440
for for growing hemp and it was it was I

1164
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,440
remember it was Martin I think that

1165
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:43,039
found it he was reading this very dry

1166
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:47,200
document and it was like an amendment B

1167
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:49,759
and it said if it's below 3% uh it is

1168
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:52,519
deemed hemp while we had linked up with

1169
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,240
John stall who was an expat he went to

1170
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:58,119
the Amsterdam Cannabis Cup in

1171
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:59,798
94 um and I guess he thought it was

1172
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:02,798
going to be some hemp Gathering he was

1173
00:53:59,798 --> 00:54:04,559
living in the Ukraine in Kiev and he was

1174

so you're gonna have to try it again you

1194
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,000
met with Mr stall and and he hooked us

1195
00:55:05,798 --> 00:55:10,400
up with these these farmers and and goo

1196
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,119
botco at The Institute of bass fibers

1197
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,358
and I guess he had been breeding this

1198
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:16,760
zolotonosha I guess he got told some

1199
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,519
years ago that if he didn't get rid of

1200
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,559
THC he had to get rid of hemp and so he

1201
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:24,880
figured out some litness test in the

1202
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:28,079
field I'm frozen again [ __ ] insane

1203
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,079
I'm done

1204
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:39,598
no I I know um ladies and gentlemen

1205
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,798
start your conspiracy theorist websites

1206
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:45,519
now not it's not meant to be

1207
00:55:41,798 --> 00:55:50,239
shared apparently not another day

1208
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:54,440
another day the Illuminati has said

1209
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:58,239
no strange happenings on hash

1210
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,240
church that's it

1211
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:07,239
okay so really quickly we uh got we went

1212
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:08,960
to Romania to look for CBD and hemp uh

1213
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:10,519
probably close to eight or nine years

1214
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,519
ago I forget what it was we went to

1215
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:16,280
Bulgaria and Romania and drove around

1216
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:19,759
and in the province of Mara

1217
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:22,480
maramures outside of Transylvania on up

1218
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,079
against the Ukraine border that's where

1219
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:29,318
we really

1220
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:31,960
found uh waddle fences and uh woven

1221
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:34,318
fences and all the and but also hemp

1222
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,280
here hold this side go and we found this

1223
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:39,400
incredible hemp fiber that's like a

1224
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:41,559
hundred years old it's a big long bag

1225
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,480
and it's just everyone made their own

1226
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:46,160
clothes back in the day and some of the

1227
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:48,119
elders that were in the village even had

1228
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:51,480
like hemp shoes they were like wearing

1229
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:54,400
hemp shoes pants and jackets and they

1230
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:57,039
were [ __ ] sweet I mean this is it's

1231
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,798
like it's heavy fabric yeah it's super

1232
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:00,839
durable for being a hundred years old

1233
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:04,318
you would be so totally surprised and

1234
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:07,519
the bag is even stitched up with thread

1235
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:09,038
that's even more coarse that's also hemp

1236
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:11,199
so the threading on it that they've

1237
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:14,160
stitched the bag together outside of the

1238
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:16,318
weaving is also hemp and it is like

1239
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:18,719
incredible it's easily going to last

1240
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:21,480
another many more hundreds of years so

1241
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:25,318
also it's soft and would be really warm

1242
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:29,000
yeah so they also grew flax because flax

1243
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:31,480
gives you the the soft Linens in between

1244
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:35,000
the hemp and the skin you know you got

1245
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:39,000
the under under layers of flax but also

1246
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:43,039
they had waddle and do natural building

1247
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,400
so a lot of the walls were you know post

1248
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:48,559
and then you just weave in and out this

1249
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:51,599
the thinner sticks or uh whatever and

1250
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:54,039
then you pack it with with uh whatever

1251
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,838
you have so the best thing that you can

1252
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:56,680
do if you're going to use like hemp

1253
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:58,558
cream

1254
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:01,199
or if you're going to use these small

1255
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:03,960
decorators which we're talking about is

1256
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:09,318
you can use the herd the inside part of

1257
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:12,760
the hemp and if you mix oneir clay oneir

1258
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:16,079
herd and I like it that it's oneir herd

1259
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:18,880
you heard and then um and then water you

1260
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:22,760
can mix it up in a in a in a concrete

1261
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:25,640
mixer and then you can make forms or you

1262
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:30,039
can just paste it up against the wall

1263
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:32,558
and clay herd and water makes nearly

1264
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:36,079
like a a concrete on your wall we saw we

1265
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:38,400
saw buildings there that were fully

1266
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,798
beautiful there wasn't like anything

1267
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,639
coming off of them and they had been

1268
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:45,199
done hundreds of years ago with this

1269
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:47,078
hemp creete and waddle fences and all of

1270
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:49,399
the buildings were just really beautiful

1271
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:51,400
and really sturdy and fit right into the

1272
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,440
land and I think also when you're

1273
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:58,079
working with that kind of natural

1274
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:59,519
building materials you can even see like

1275
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,880
some of the buildings or some of the

1276
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:04,159
homes even slumped with some of the

1277
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:06,160
earth as the Earth slumped the house

1278
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:07,838
would sort of slump too so yeah it

1279
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:10,239
wasn't linear and there weren't straight

1280
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:12,639
angles and everything but the house then

1281
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:14,598
sort of became part of the landscape

1282
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:16,358
really beautiful but yet incredibly

1283
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:18,440
functional maybe even a thousand years

1284
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:20,759
later and also they start you started

1285
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:24,838
realizing oh wow so instead of fence

1286
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:26,720
post they just plant trees like Willow

1287
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:28,480
Chestnut

1288
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:31,279
apple trees

1289
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,000
Alder and then and then the tree is all

1290
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,559
you what they they use a technique you

1291
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,960
just cut it at tight every fall and then

1292
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:41,440
in the springtime it sprouts up a bunch

1293
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,358
of branches and a lot of times out in

1294
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,880
the west you're like oh Jesus all these

1295
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:47,159
branches we got to get rid of them we

1296
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,640
don't know what to do let's burn them

1297
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:51,920
but out there they're like you know what

1298
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:55,038
we make them branch and then we cut them

1299
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,720
off Copus yeah we cut the branches off

1300
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,960
and then we use that for all of our

1301
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:02,038
weaving for our walls we use that we

1302
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:04,798
make rakes we' use waddle and do we do

1303
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:06,160
raised beds waddle waddle beds waddle

1304
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:08,880
fencing it's

1305
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:10,679
spectacular uh it's it's amazing way to

1306
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,720
live also when we were in Haiti we went

1307
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:15,960
to Haiti after the earthquake and it was

1308
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:18,798
two weeks after the earthquake and it

1309
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:21,358
was just utter Devastation buildings

1310
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:25,038
down dead bodies everywhere terrible

1311
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:28,279
terrible thing and then uh we started a

1312
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:31,680
birthing Clinic and to to to get food we

1313
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:33,880
had to go in into the inside part of the

1314
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:37,440
island and we started

1315
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:39,358
taking all these uh small motorcycles

1316
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,400
into the Inland and started going oh my

1317
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:44,719
God there's all these houses are still

1318
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,240
unaffected out here because they were

1319
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:49,598
all waddle and and do they were all

1320
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:51,719
woven houses and fencing and it seems

1321
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:53,760
like oh these are primitive housing but

1322
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:56,519
they didn't lose their house they didn't

1323
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,119
lose their crops they had all the food

1324
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:01,358
all the crops that they had before the

1325
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:04,240
earthquake so you know sometimes the

1326
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:06,358
simple methods you know are the smartest

1327

sweet uh with the Frenchie Force we made

1391
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:11,000
last year we we created that string

1392
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,639
called Frenchie force in honor of

1393
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,199
Frenchie dying and passing on to the

1394
01:04:13,639 --> 01:04:18,000
next realm we talked with Kimberly and

1395
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:20,159
we said hey Kimberly we have this really

1396
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,960
beautiful strain that we made and she

1397
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:24,838
and she said I well he was such a force

1398
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:27,599
of nature that we just wanted to you

1399
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:29,599
know we just just she she and we decided

1400
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:33,240
to call it Frenchie's force and uh it

1401
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:37,920
just it's very crystally uh very

1402
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:41,159
florally um it grows really resistant to

1403
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:45,599
um uh it has the guava punch in it as

1404
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:47,278
well uh as some gak varieties um from

1405
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:48,920
from H I definitely think that it was

1406
01:04:47,278 --> 01:04:50,798
the winner in our garden this year that

1407
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:52,760
Frenchies Forest I think also you know

1408
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:56,159
when you put intention like that into

1409
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:59,319
something like we grew it for him we

1410
01:04:56,159 --> 01:05:02,480
crossed it for him we had a really deep

1411
01:04:59,318 --> 01:05:04,639
conversation with Kimberly and oen um

1412
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,559
his daughter their daughter and we

1413
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:08,199
wanted to call it Frenchie's Funk at

1414
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,119

01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:17,719

1421
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:26,159

[Laughter]

water take me back to when I was a

1447
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:46,000
little kid at hockey practice and I'd go

1448
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:47,679
and get all the pops put into one cup

1449
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,119
right oh put I want a little bit of all

1450
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:54,798
of them the swamp water who knows you

1451
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:58,599
know I always thought um mushrooms can

1452
01:06:54,798 --> 01:07:00,119
tame so many tpin and try turpins and to

1453
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:03,559
try to pull out all of the different

1454
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:04,838
tpin that like a mushroom contains is

1455
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:07,880
ores

1456
01:07:04,838 --> 01:07:10,159
andever quite complex so I always

1457
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:12,240
wondered if all of the Tarpin mixed

1458
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:15,000
together smelled like a mushroom kind of

1459
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:19,318
like all the colors together are gray or

1460
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,599
brown or brown yeah gray brown brown

1461
01:07:19,318 --> 01:07:23,239
right yeah that's an interesting way of

1462
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,240
looking at it no I love the variety I

1463
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:27,759
love the spice of life I love that

1464
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:30,239
people have different oil factories and

1465
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,319
have different preferences and that they

1466
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:35,479
also have different environments to grow

1467
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:38,519
things that tend to express things you

1468
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:41,318
know differently and I I just love I

1469
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:43,400
love the variety I I I get asked all the

1470
01:07:41,318 --> 01:07:44,759
time oh if you had one cultivar what

1471
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,318
would you you know what would it be it's

1472
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,160
like I don't know like if I had one

1473
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:49,480
cultivar I'd for sure get bored of it

1474
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:51,960
that's what I can tell you although I

1475
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:54,639
will say I think the one that I had the

1476
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:56,318
longest that I didn't get bored of was

1477
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:58,879
probably the

1478
01:07:56,318 --> 01:08:00,798
which was very fruity and flavorful and

1479
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:04,200
just you know it was like pot to get you

1480
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:06,159
busted it stunk so bad uh so good it

1481
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:08,358
just reaped through the bag you couldn't

1482
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:12,038
steal the stuff uh but when you burned

1483
01:08:08,358 --> 01:08:13,920
it and exhaled it had a hazy smell to it

1484
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:16,359
so it had these two varieties of this

1485
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:19,158
fruity flavor that it tasted like and it

1486
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:21,759
smelled like but on the exhale if you

1487
01:08:19,158 --> 01:08:23,039
exhaled a big puff of it of of bubble or

1488
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:25,640
whatever and you walked out of the room

1489
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:28,920
and you came back in you'd swear someone

1490
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:31,920
was was puffing Haze so I I like that

1491
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,798
that it had these very very different

1492
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,440
groups the two groups that I that I

1493
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:39,439
probably prefer the most I've never seen

1494
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:41,719
them kind of together uh in a in a way

1495
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:45,039
like that so I have a special place of

1496
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:47,880
my heart for for Renee shout out to uh

1497
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:50,519
Dr Renee and shout out to Muhammad who

1498
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:56,520
turned me on to the Renee Way Way Back

1499
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:56,520
when in the 90s much love to those guys

1500
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,400
is the still around or has that been

1501
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:04,479
bred into something else yeah I mean

1502
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:07,238
great Gardener was breeding it into

1503
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:09,358
stuff and you know I've I've heard

1504
01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:10,838
people say they have the Renee but it

1505
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:13,079
it's like the Romulan you know the

1506
01:09:10,838 --> 01:09:15,600
Romulan was shortlived everyone thinks

1507
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:18,399
they have it they don't um I used to get

1508
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,159
it from Romulan Joe himself and he got

1509
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:21,798
it from the group of guys it wasn't his

1510
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:23,358
Cult of art it's just how he really

1511
01:09:21,798 --> 01:09:26,238
became well known that was a very

1512
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:28,239
special plant in the 90s as well and

1513
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:31,119
it just disappeared it was years later I

1514
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,879
saw a cut from an overgrow guy that

1515
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:36,079
white I think his name was White Rabbit

1516
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:39,159
and he had this cultivar that was like

1517
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:40,960
across of the Romulan and it had that it

1518
01:09:39,158 --> 01:09:42,679
it's like the shishka berry you know the

1519
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,279
shishkaberry yeah you can taste it in

1520
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:46,039
the Nicole you can taste it in the

1521
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:49,159
Barbara it's definitely what makes those

1522
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:51,000
two cultivars special but do you see the

1523
01:09:49,158 --> 01:09:53,798
pure shishkaberry like the yellow and

1524
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,279
the red line anymore no not so much they

1525
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:57,679
seem to be things of the past

1526
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:01,039
maybe that's okay maybe that's what

1527
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:03,199
builds that love that loss of not having

1528
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:05,719
it anymore makes it makes you remember

1529
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:09,238
it even maybe better than it really was

1530
01:10:05,719 --> 01:10:11,640
I I don't know but um I do know that the

1531
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:13,519
people are making just just as good of

1532
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,640
things nowadays with the with the new

1533
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,400
cultivars that they're breeding and so

1534
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:19,960
there's always excitement in cannabis

1535
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:22,960
things may come and go but uh there's

1536
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:26,039
always greatness around the next

1537
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:28,079
Corner yeah Romulan

1538
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:31,079
unfortunately we lost it in a bay just

1539
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:33,559
due to white pottery Milo and champagne

1540
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:36,399
I think also had Romulan in it same

1541
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:39,719
problem one of those just very bright

1542
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:42,679
expressive floral cultivars but

1543
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:44,960
unfortunately uh nature and man didn't

1544
01:10:42,679 --> 01:10:49,000
necessarily combine too well on that

1545
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:52,399
one go ahead Brian I've got a I've got a

1546
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,279
Romulan bx4 going right now three fenos

1547
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:58,238
I've still got one outside that's really

1548
01:10:54,279 --> 01:10:59,079
late it's a Romulan bx4 to a sour best

1549
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:02,759
[ __ ]

1550
01:10:59,079 --> 01:11:04,559
ever and two of the fenos I'm learning

1551
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,920
what the they've only run once for a

1552
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,280
quick test and now one of them's outside

1553
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:11,719
only and brought back in all three to

1554
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:14,960
try again but this one I have in the

1555
01:11:11,719 --> 01:11:18,480
yard is really really unique uh I call

1556
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:20,960
it like a seven up soda type of smell on

1557
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:24,079
it so I don't know Romulan really well

1558
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:26,719
the pure ROM but it uh you know a couple

1559
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:29,198
of them come off like seven up lime type

1560
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:31,319
of thing influence not sure where that

1561
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:37,759
comes from or what the original Romulan

1562
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:37,759
tasted like really so yeah the

1563
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:44,039
old Piney to almost grapy a little bit

1564
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:47,039
and most of tiny

1565
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:49,600
lime and the Bud's double covered in

1566
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:52,238
Crystal so that's the the one thing you

1567
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,880
really got to look for it's just the

1568
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:58,399
ridiculous content so that that probably

1569
01:11:54,880 --> 01:12:01,000
will just that's what I've heard yeah we

1570
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:04,158
we yeah they're coated this one's called

1571
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,520
candy coated from uh catsu seeds on that

1572
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:09,960
one

1573
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:12,360
actually and yeah candy coated so looks

1574
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:15,158
triy for sure and then I had I was going

1575
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:17,479
to say I tried this really unique uh

1576
01:12:15,158 --> 01:12:19,119
probably the best tasting resin out west

1577
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:21,919
before I left that I couldn't place

1578
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:25,880
again or find it the cultivar again but

1579
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:29,399
it was Big Sir holy weed on a cook an OG

1580
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:33,760
Big Sir holy OG and that was like the

1581
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:35,679
most unique alien Spike ranges you know

1582
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,600
like Marcus is talking about on the EXL

1583
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:40,039
of the Irene where it came out hazy went

1584
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:43,120
in a different way so that one was just

1585
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:46,560
this really like reach to Hay skunk

1586
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:49,319
Pine um classic kind of I guess later

1587
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:51,719
90s into two early 2000s kind of thing

1588
01:12:49,319 --> 01:12:54,599
with it late 90s from the little bit I

1589
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:55,639
know of that realm but yeah Big Sir holy

1590
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,960
OG

1591
01:12:55,639 --> 01:13:01,520
if anyone knows where that we grew that

1592
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,600
exact cross for a long time up here we

1593
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:06,199
got it from down in Cali so I got from

1594
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:08,880
Coastal seeds Michael Michael kagu from

1595
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:10,839
Coastal seeds in Santa Cruz yeah Michael

1596
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,319
probably still has check him out he's

1597
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:14,440
amazing it also has like he just posted

1598
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:16,319
Maui

1599
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:19,678
woi um

1600
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:22,599
Tai used he used that big sir holy weed

1601
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:25,840
because it is so resistant and really

1602
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:27,600
heavy weiter so like yielded really

1603
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:30,400
heavy and it was almost like anything

1604
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:32,600
that you crossed it with would just be

1605
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:34,479
phenomenal that was a really fun cross

1606
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:37,400
for us to have for a long time also

1607
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:40,959
Bobby and Mary uh the Snodgrass family

1608
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:43,879
genetics did more with that Big Sir holy

1609
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:46,319
weed and also the coastal

1610
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:49,279
Haze they did some work with the coastal

1611
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:52,079
Haze and also the Puna butter cookies

1612
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:55,479
which is the big island South Big Island

1613
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:58,319
Puna buta yeah that that that bu was out

1614
01:13:55,479 --> 01:14:02,279
on dead tour in the in the early early

1615
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:06,279
90s and that's you know my bag seed

1616
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:10,198
story from uh summer tour 1991 was

1617
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:14,158
getting a bag from my friend Ron from

1618
01:14:10,198 --> 01:14:17,000
Shasta hey Pizza Man Ron how are you so

1619
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:19,158
uh yeah uh we planted it like several

1620
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,238
years later and the plants actually they

1621
01:14:19,158 --> 01:14:24,000
never looked healthy because for some

1622
01:14:21,238 --> 01:14:27,158
reason they just looked just very

1623
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:31,158
strange they grew next to plants that

1624
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:33,039
look just fine and those those two seeds

1625
01:14:31,158 --> 01:14:35,519
the plants were like I don't know just

1626
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:37,600
small runs of the litter and very

1627
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,960
purpley buds there's lots of yellow and

1628
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:43,840
purple and orange in there but yeah they

1629
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:46,560
were just Big Sir holy is just yeah

1630
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,560
grateful Deb

1631
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,359
approved I'm sure they helped move it

1632
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:55,039
around wow yeah they certainly did I

1633
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:58,399
mean there was I mean I I we've talked

1634
01:14:55,039 --> 01:15:00,800
about aash church just the influence

1635
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:02,238
that and I think you know Josh and Kelly

1636
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,760
you guys got to agree right the

1637
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:08,519
influence that the dead had in bringing

1638
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:11,679
kind bud from I mean there was kind bud

1639
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:13,000
always in NorCal and Oregon right and if

1640
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:16,359
you think about it that was like the

1641
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,560
Dead's home territory so when they went

1642
01:15:16,359 --> 01:15:20,920
on on tour all the hippies that followed

1643
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,800
them brought really good nugget and

1644
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:25,679
people were like in some arena in I

1645
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,679
don't know Cincinnati

1646
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:30,319
in the 70s and all of a sudden it's like

1647
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:32,600
who stepped in dog [ __ ] it's like no man

1648
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:35,559
that's the way weed smells when it's

1649
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:37,719
proper you know and yeah I remember like

1650
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:40,800
my friends well a lot of people would go

1651
01:15:37,719 --> 01:15:44,279
to the Grateful Dead shows by acid by

1652
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:46,199

country it was like a traveling circus

1661
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:09,158
it was so much fun I would encourage

1662
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:12,800
people to look up on YouTube Grateful

1663
01:16:09,158 --> 01:16:15,238

1665
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:19,000
lot videos from the 1980s and just watch

to people for me being baldheaded kid

1678
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:57,560
that I was back day as a as a punk I

1679
01:16:56,439 --> 01:17:00,919
would go down there and there'd be

1680
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:05,120
people just holding like 6 to 12 in

1681
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:07,440
mushroom amonita mushrooms mushrooms

1682
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:09,800

1683

1686
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:19,159
of the waft of marijuana outside right

1687
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:21,479
on Shakedown Street and then if you go

1688
01:17:19,158 --> 01:17:23,479
inside there's a complete utter fog

1689
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:26,000
inside right front and Stage that kind

1690
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:28,638
of wafted it back cuz there were people

1691
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,920
who sat there and blew smoke at Jerry

1692
01:17:28,639 --> 01:17:34,359
Garcia the entire freaking show so it

1693
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:37,920
was incredible what they did regarding

1694
01:17:34,359 --> 01:17:41,960
cannabis and I have a they have not been

1695
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:46,880
given their due for truly spreading kind

1696
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:49,198
bud nationally a whole other also that's

1697
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:52,359
why we're talking about it we're

1698
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:54,319
talking acknowledging that right it's

1699
01:17:52,359 --> 01:17:56,238
weirdly still happening and I could

1700
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:59,319
definitely say because it's been so long

1701
01:17:56,238 --> 01:18:01,399
ago I'm so thankful if it weren't for

1702
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:04,119
Grateful Dead and kind bud and being

1703
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:06,000
able to like move that around dead tour

1704
01:18:04,119 --> 01:18:09,238
I I mean I wouldn't have made it through

1705
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,880
University I'm so thankful you know I

1706
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:13,559
have all kinds of Majors it also

1707
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:15,880
wouldn't have taken her so long to get

1708
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,880
through

1709
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:23,119
University hey eight years three Majors

1710
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:25,799
all you know she she was on roller

1711
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:29,039
skates with fairy wings and a fair wand

1712
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:31,440
I IM it was a great front for kind bud I

1713
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:34,319
was able to get through anything and

1714
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:37,359
anyone and it totally and that's all

1715
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:38,880
that I had the rain name I didn't know

1716
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:41,599
people would say what do you got and I'd

1717
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:44,600
say It's kind bud and I was getting it

1718
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:47,400
from all the Eugene crew and bringing it

1719
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:50,239
out on tour and then you know giving it

1720
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:52,719
out to people who would come out to San

1721
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:54,359
Francisco who were from New York and

1722
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:55,840
they would pick it up from us and I mean

1723
01:18:54,359 --> 01:18:57,880
we thought thought that we were dealing

1724
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,719
big stuff when we had a half a pound and

1725
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:02,840
we were like you know breaking up a half

1726
01:18:59,719 --> 01:19:04,560
a pound of kind butt that was a big deal

1727
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:08,000
and people would come all the way from

1728
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:10,120
new it would affect the parking lot it

1729
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,840
was just so different so different than

1730
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:16,599
the little brown manila envelopes full

1731
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:20,279
of seedy Mexican weed that you'd get

1732
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:23,639
from like someone who'd be selling weed

1733
01:19:20,279 --> 01:19:26,679
in in New York City and it was easier

1734
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:28,960
quite frankly to buy cocaine that's one

1735
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:32,119
of the reasons why cocaine's popularity

1736
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:34,960
and crack took off in the 80s is because

1737
01:19:32,119 --> 01:19:37,039
they didn't have good nugget but I think

1738
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,880
when the Grateful Dead started reaching

1739
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:42,319
their Echelon in the late 80s and good

1740
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:44,199
nugget came East I think that helped

1741
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:47,319
maybe with the crack epidemic because it

1742
01:19:44,198 --> 01:19:49,638
seemed like a lot of friends that I knew

1743
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:52,079
just needed really really much better

1744
01:19:49,639 --> 01:19:55,000
weed than they were smoking a lot of

1745
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:57,519
them went to Coke and Other Drugs but to

1746
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,840
be quite honest I mean like even like if

1747
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:02,760
you at like a Neil Young concert or like

1748
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:05,960
an Al Brothers concert you'd be hassled

1749
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,920
for smoking weed at the arena like if

1750
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:10,000
you had like just a little one hitter

1751
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,960
people be like oh put that [ __ ] out man

1752
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,238
you're got to throw you out with the

1753
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:17,158
dead people would bring in bongs and

1754
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:19,839
glass and it was just an elaborate

1755
01:20:17,158 --> 01:20:22,399
ceremony that the you know Bill Graham

1756
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:24,840
just paid off the promoters to say look

1757
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:27,079
this is the dead traveling circus they

1758
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:28,560
all smoke weed they're really peaceful

1759
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:30,279
all they want to do is smoke weed and

1760
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:33,679
spin as

1761
01:20:30,279 --> 01:20:37,079
Jerry noodles but I think a lot of the

1762
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:39,440
other bands for some reason it seems

1763
01:20:37,079 --> 01:20:40,198
like didn't have that thing figured out

1764
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:43,759
you

1765
01:20:40,198 --> 01:20:45,799
know they also brought mus you know and

1766
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,719
the mushrooms are known to help with

1767
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,400
addiction you know I mean you can say oh

1768
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:52,480
it was just a party in the parking lot

1769
01:20:49,399 --> 01:20:54,079
well kind of but it also affected their

1770
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:55,238
your ways of thinking it what were you

1771
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:57,399
going to say Mar

1772
01:20:55,238 --> 01:20:59,439
C well I was just going to say there was

1773
01:20:57,399 --> 01:21:02,238
a dark side of things too because

1774
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:04,479
because it was such an open Circus the

1775
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:06,079
police really it was like shooting fish

1776
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:08,439
in a barrel the amount of people that

1777
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:10,519
went to jail for LSD and did 10year

1778
01:21:08,439 --> 01:21:13,678
sentences the people who got busted with

1779
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:15,880
weed it was just it was kind of like

1780
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:19,319
that bummer of prohibition and when when

1781
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:21,800
people kind of hate on cannabis becoming

1782
01:21:19,319 --> 01:21:23,479
legal which tons of that sucks there's

1783
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,880
all sorts of shitty things about legal

1784
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:27,799
cannabis and and endless array of them

1785
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:30,880
what's not on the list of of legal

1786
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:32,840
cannabis is 10year prison sentences uh

1787
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:35,159
for getting caught with a bag of weed in

1788
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:37,520
Arkansas or whatever so there was that

1789
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:41,119
that as well I mean I I I was more of of

1790
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:43,520
the fish uh tour you know I I that's the

1791
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:45,238
tour that I did more of my time on and

1792
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:48,080
it was very much the same way I'll never

1793
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:50,359
forget being at a show in Montana and

1794
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:52,359
the police are up in the buildings on on

1795
01:21:50,359 --> 01:21:54,039
on walkie-talkies and they're looking

1796
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:55,839
down in the parking lot and they're

1797
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:57,920
announcing to the Undercovers that are

1798
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,719
in the parking lot and I don't I'm sure

1799
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,000
it existed during the Grateful Dead days

1800
01:21:59,719 --> 01:22:04,319
but on fish tour it was Go free for

1801
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,520
three so they bust these poor kids and

1802
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,479
then they get them to become narcs and

1803
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,400
go out and bust three more people go

1804
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:12,519
find ecstasy go find acid go find

1805
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:14,879
whatever you can you get three people

1806
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:18,560
you can go free and I I had a lot of

1807
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:20,560
friends end up uh end up in jail uh

1808
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,600
during that time as well so it was this

1809
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,960
beautiful amazing important thing that

1810
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:26,920
was happening and then there was this

1811
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:29,639
real nasty underbelly that I'm that I'm

1812
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:31,840
sure um a guy like Jerry Garcia was

1813
01:22:29,639 --> 01:22:33,920
conscious of and and probably you know

1814
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,520
it probably gave them nightmares the the

1815
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:37,920
idea of how many of these young people

1816
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:40,960
were getting locked up in prison really

1817
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:44,279
just for for tapping into this amazing

1818
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:47,319
like the the police just suck to to hone

1819
01:22:44,279 --> 01:22:49,119
in and be and and to on the weakest on

1820
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:51,079
the most vulnerable on the like just

1821
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:53,158
these like beautiful loving people that

1822
01:22:51,079 --> 01:22:55,079
just wanted to have fun and and get

1823
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:57,839
together and and enjoy you know

1824
01:22:55,079 --> 01:23:00,760
psychedelics and cannabis and amazing

1825
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:03,840
music um there was that part of it as

1826
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:06,480
well so it was it's hard to talk need to

1827
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:09,880
look you need to look at it the way the

1828
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:11,559
police do they were soft easy targets

1829
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:14,960
and they weren't going to kill your mama

1830
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:17,880
daddy and sister like the cartel

1831
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:19,520
would true well and and and and to let

1832
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:22,639
you know Marcus I mean just to give you

1833
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:25,520
a report so on a recent fish tour uh

1834
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:27,760
this recent tour I mean really incidents

1835
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:30,679
with police are kind of few and far

1836
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,920
between because fish tour now is kind of

1837
01:23:30,679 --> 01:23:34,920
like sophisticated audience it cost a

1838
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:36,440
lot of money for tickets so people you

1839
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:40,119
know they're kind of like destination

1840
01:23:36,439 --> 01:23:42,759
shows like people plan their vacations

1841
01:23:40,119 --> 01:23:44,519
around them so there's travel plans that

1842
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:47,079
are being made but there was one

1843
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:49,360
noticeable show this past run of fish

1844
01:23:47,079 --> 01:23:51,719
shows where there were a lot of bus in

1845
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:54,880
the parking lot where basically cops

1846
01:23:51,719 --> 01:23:57,399
were going from car to car people are

1847
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,760
tailgating I mean you know like you said

1848
01:23:57,399 --> 01:24:03,079
Marcus this is like it's like our tribe

1849
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:04,520
we want to go go there turn off the keys

1850
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:07,880
to the ignition we made it to the

1851
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:11,400
parking lot open a nice frothy beer

1852
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:13,199
smoke a joint eat some food you know

1853
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:14,960
socialize with some friends go check out

1854
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:17,678
Shake down street maybe have a balloon

1855
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:20,719
or two if that's what suits you but I

1856
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:23,480
mean the cool thing is that again most

1857
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:25,198
venues where Place places where fish

1858
01:24:23,479 --> 01:24:27,079
plays these days

1859
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:29,559
they got that figured out they're like

1860
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:32,279
okay fish is Coming to Town there's

1861
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:34,600
going to be this crazy group of people

1862
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:36,639
they're going to need the setup you know

1863
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:41,000
and there's going to be campers there's

1864
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:43,118
going to be deep fat friers and Falafel

1865
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,679
and there just it's just there's a whole

1866
01:24:43,118 --> 01:24:47,960
infrastructure that kind of organically

1867
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,800
comes together and it's still so cool

1868
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:52,600
because like if you're a teenager or

1869
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:54,920
like a college Age kid and you got a

1870
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:57,960
couple bucks in your pocket you could

1871
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:59,960
still go on tour and have like an

1872
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:01,880
adventure like you don't know like where

1873
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:04,039
like you might have like a couple nights

1874
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:06,520
tickets lined up like you don't have it

1875
01:25:04,039 --> 01:25:08,920
all figured out but because there's some

1876
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:10,360
uncertainty in your future it's kind of

1877
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,199
cool because you don't really know

1878
01:25:10,359 --> 01:25:14,399
what's gonna happen you'll probably just

1879
01:25:12,198 --> 01:25:17,399
end up going back home and working the

1880
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:19,599
rest of the summer to pay your hotel

1881
01:25:17,399 --> 01:25:22,359
bills but yeah I mean there's like

1882
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:25,199
there's nitrous Mafia at all the shows

1883
01:25:22,359 --> 01:25:27,599
now so wherever you go there's balloons

1884
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:31,158
just everywhere you know and it's just

1885
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:34,760
like you know I don't know I

1886
01:25:31,158 --> 01:25:36,158
mean you know admit I like to do ners

1887
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,000
every now and then but you know I just

1888
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:40,279
think it's just proliferated the scene

1889
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,279
to where it's just just garbagey at L

1890
01:25:40,279 --> 01:25:45,479
leave all their balloons around and like

1891
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:47,479
couple hours later you go down Seventh

1892
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:48,799
Avenue after you know Madison Square

1893
01:25:47,479 --> 01:25:51,718
Garden is let out and there's just

1894
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,960
balloon trash everywhere and it's just

1895
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:55,920
couple guys down an alley still sucking

1896
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:57,760
on one balloon like three guys sucking

1897
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,000
on one balloon because that's all that's

1898
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,639
left you know it's it's kind of it's

1899
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,039
brought a little trashy element to the

1900
01:26:01,639 --> 01:26:07,920
scene but all in all I haven't really

1901
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:10,359
seen the huge bus and organized bus that

1902
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:12,480
like the DEA had a project called dead

1903
01:26:10,359 --> 01:26:14,799
end I think that was in 91 or something

1904
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:18,599
like that and they intentionally sent

1905
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:21,400
agents out on to lot to almost get like

1906
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:23,800
information like infiltrate like try to

1907
01:26:21,399 --> 01:26:25,920
be cool and make a deal but not

1908
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:28,840
necessarily bust somebody but try to

1909
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:31,639
figure out like who their plug is and

1910
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:33,480
try to figure [ __ ] out and I had a Frank

1911
01:26:31,639 --> 01:26:35,639
good close friend of mine who's our

1912
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:38,000
keyboard player in our band who went

1913
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:39,639
down on such a thing that it was just it

1914
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,079
was horrible but you know yeah it was

1915
01:26:39,639 --> 01:26:44,719
just part of prohibition but a crazy

1916
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:46,479
time to be alive and following the band

1917

tinctures and bringing medicines and

1938
01:27:50,279 --> 01:27:55,559
products and it really is I feel like

1939
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:58,800
the origins of like the legalization of

1940
01:27:55,560 --> 01:28:01,400
cannabis came from those those areas and

1941
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:03,360
that from that like sentiment and that

1942
01:28:01,399 --> 01:28:06,039
like sharing of medicine and it was like

1943
01:28:03,359 --> 01:28:09,759
we were learning about dosing and and

1944
01:28:06,039 --> 01:28:11,560
making you know medicated food at the

1945
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:13,520
time and it was I think pretty

1946
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:16,360
sophisticated if even if you want to

1947
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:18,080
call it anecdotal or stuff that was just

1948
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:21,399
happening on the parking lot but I know

1949
01:28:18,079 --> 01:28:23,880
that like with rock Med and um first

1950
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:26,519
responder medicine um a lot of that and

1951
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:28,560
Kelly still does that stuff with with

1952
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:31,600
professional athletes nowadays you know

1953
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:34,360
with you know falling on jumps and and

1954
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:36,199
and everything but uh yeah no it's it's

1955
01:28:34,359 --> 01:28:39,399
amazing how it's

1956
01:28:36,198 --> 01:28:41,599
it's I I think it was and it also was

1957
01:28:39,399 --> 01:28:43,399
the beginning of and yeah Marcus you're

1958
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,159
absolutely right I think whenever

1959
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:48,439
there's a really bright

1960
01:28:45,158 --> 01:28:50,559
spark of some kind of a beginnings of

1961
01:28:48,439 --> 01:28:53,479
something you know it definitely shines

1962
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:57,480
a light makes people interested in

1963
01:28:53,479 --> 01:29:00,718
what's going on there and I think that

1964
01:28:57,479 --> 01:29:03,959
cannabis you know is just that plant

1965
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:05,719
that continues to move us forward and

1966
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:08,118
now it's continuing to it moved us

1967
01:29:05,719 --> 01:29:10,439
forward then you know and it's

1968
01:29:08,118 --> 01:29:13,519
interesting there's not a lot of things

1969
01:29:10,439 --> 01:29:16,879
that we would do illegally like to put

1970
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:19,360
ourselves at risk but why is it that we

1971
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:22,279
continue to put ourselves at risk for

1972
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:24,238
cannabis I know I did and I knew what

1973
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:26,679
the risks were at that time I knew that

1974
01:29:24,238 --> 01:29:30,279
I could look at 25 years easily for what

1975
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:33,440
I was doing or lose my kid I knew that

1976
01:29:30,279 --> 01:29:36,559
but it was still like there's some kind

1977
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:38,638
of a relationship that you have with

1978
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:42,039
that plant to continue to bring it

1979
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:44,440
forward and that energy was on you know

1980
01:29:42,039 --> 01:29:46,439
Grateful Dead lot it is in the fish lot

1981
01:29:44,439 --> 01:29:50,519
or barter fairs and it and it and it

1982
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:53,759
does plant a seed of of some kind of

1983
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:56,159
collective consciousness of humanity for

1984
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:58,280
some something to grow from that there's

1985
01:29:56,158 --> 01:29:59,118
something very like deeper I don't you

1986
01:29:58,279 --> 01:30:01,039
know I don't want to call it

1987
01:29:59,118 --> 01:30:04,880
spirituality or whatever but there's

1988
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:07,639
something very essential about how hum

1989
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:10,239
Humanity exists with each other and how

1990
01:30:07,639 --> 01:30:13,239
we communicate with each other and then

1991
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:16,079
get together and then you know spread

1992
01:30:13,238 --> 01:30:18,319
that information something so beautiful

1993
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:20,880
about it and take everything higher tour

1994
01:30:18,319 --> 01:30:24,158
was that for sure fish tour was that and

1995
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,880
Country Fair was that

1996
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:28,118
Country Fair is not that anymore but it

1997
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:31,118
was that and it was the first time when

1998
01:30:28,118 --> 01:30:34,880
we saw Keith you know was at an Oregon

1999
01:30:31,118 --> 01:30:37,479
Country Fair lineup waiting for food

2000
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:38,520
right or right when you yeah so let's

2001
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:42,279
see

2002
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:44,520
1990 I was in line for some pizza

2003
01:30:42,279 --> 01:30:46,599
somebody earlier had said to me he had

2004
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:49,480
two spray bottles and he said electric

2005
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:51,440
or not and I was like oh well I guess if

2006
01:30:49,479 --> 01:30:54,279
there's a choice and you know which one

2007
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:55,960
I chose so then later I'm in the line

2008
01:30:54,279 --> 01:30:58,639
and this guy said oh I've got something

2009
01:30:55,960 --> 01:31:02,079
to share with you and out of this little

2010
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:04,520
velvet box and then inside of another

2011
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:07,158
little box there's a little silver box

2012
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:11,080
he had this perfectly

2013
01:31:07,158 --> 01:31:13,759
pressed ke like Square oh maybe it was

2014
01:31:11,079 --> 01:31:15,800
89 anyway and he made it it wasn't he

2015
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:18,520
made you know and he pressed it and I

2016
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:21,360
had never seen anything like it and he

2017
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:23,520
shared it with us in line in the pizza

2018
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:26,198
lineup and he was probably in his 60s

2019
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:28,400
and I was just like what is happening

2020
01:31:26,198 --> 01:31:30,879
and I just remember toking on that key

2021
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:35,279
for the first time and it changed my

2022
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:38,920
life yet another like change you know

2023
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:40,279
like what was that and that was yeah and

2024
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:43,399
that was back at a time we used to think

2025
01:31:40,279 --> 01:31:46,679
it took all these hoses and Contraptions

2026
01:31:43,399 --> 01:31:49,238
to make hash we just didn't know you

2027
01:31:46,679 --> 01:31:51,560
know what I mean we just didn't know we

2028
01:31:49,238 --> 01:31:54,039
thought it was a big deal turns out it's

2029
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:56,080
not

2030
01:31:54,039 --> 01:31:58,920
was at the time for certain part of your

2031
01:31:56,079 --> 01:32:02,198
history Sam was probably puffing on the

2032
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:02,199
99.999 back in

2033
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:06,319
'89 absolutely I

2034
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:13,920
was unbelievable I was uh you you're

2035
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:17,118
when did you you fell in love with food

2036
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:20,639
and did food help you fall in love with

2037
01:32:17,118 --> 01:32:23,559
hash and do you find there's like a

2038
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:25,920
thing with preparing high-end food or to

2039
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:29,600
like preparing the hash and make and

2040
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:29,600
making the hash and creating that

2041
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:36,479
space who are you asking there's oh

2042
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:39,158
excuse me I was talking to Connor but

2043
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:42,279
anyone could answer it if they

2044
01:32:39,158 --> 01:32:44,198
wanted just you know was was talking to

2045
01:32:42,279 --> 01:32:47,079
Connor in that in that moment because I

2046
01:32:44,198 --> 01:32:47,079
know he loves the two of

2047
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:54,118
them yeah think there's a lot of a

2048
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:56,920
crossover between uh kitchen prep and

2049
01:32:54,118 --> 01:32:59,880
hash prep you know there's

2050
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:01,600
um oh there's a huge emphasis on being

2051
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:04,199
cleanly in the kitchen which is

2052
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:06,639
definitely crossover for making hash and

2053
01:33:04,198 --> 01:33:08,599
you know prepping your space and getting

2054
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:10,840
everything in order beforehand there's a

2055
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:13,920
French term called Mison plast which

2056
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:17,800
means everything in its place

2057
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:22,639
um yeah I kind of found hash right as my

2058
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:26,279
culinary Journey had started and um I

2059
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:29,480
think there's a lot of uh you know bleed

2060
01:33:26,279 --> 01:33:32,559
over from one the other I find too with

2061
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:35,198
um my new hobby of beeping that there's

2062
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:36,679
a lot of similar things as well like

2063
01:33:35,198 --> 01:33:40,638
you're sifting and using different

2064
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:43,239
screens to separate your honey from your

2065
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:47,079
your wax so I don't know there's there's

2066
01:33:43,238 --> 01:33:49,718
a lot of things that can be similar to

2067
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:53,000
making hash in The Culinary

2068
01:33:49,719 --> 01:33:55,840
world I used to argue with a couple of

2069
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:59,319
people who believed that

2070
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:03,039
bees chased after cannabis plants

2071
01:33:59,319 --> 01:34:06,920
because that they want to get and I expl

2072
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:10,359
to them bees do not have cannabinoid

2073
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:12,440
receptors unlike humans so they're not

2074
01:34:10,359 --> 01:34:14,759
getting high from it they it may be a

2075
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:17,319
great food source for them but it's not

2076
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:17,320
getting them

2077
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:23,440
high yeah they seem to really love the

2078
01:34:19,719 --> 01:34:26,000
male ganja pollen um last year I had a

2079
01:34:23,439 --> 01:34:28,559
pretty big mail and every single day

2080
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,920
they were um going out to check out the

2081
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:34,600
new sites that opened uh there's not too

2082
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:37,279
many flowers that I can compare to that

2083
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:38,880
will continuously release p over that

2084
01:34:37,279 --> 01:34:40,359
long period I'm sure some fruit trees

2085
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:43,239
will or something like that but a lot of

2086
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:45,238
like the flowers kind of just have like

2087
01:34:43,238 --> 01:34:47,919
that that initial burst maybe they get a

2088
01:34:45,238 --> 01:34:50,198
couple more later but ganja seems to

2089
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:52,359
drop a lot of pollen over a a decent

2090
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:55,319
amount of

2091
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:58,158
time I've definitely noticed the

2092
01:34:55,319 --> 01:35:00,559
connection between a hash makers after

2093
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:01,879
watching so many hash makers after

2094
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:05,119
helping kind

2095
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:07,600
of many hash makers on their journey I

2096
01:35:05,118 --> 01:35:09,039
hate to say help create hash makers

2097
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,480
because I certainly didn't do that but I

2098
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:14,238
helped inspire people to become hash

2099
01:35:11,479 --> 01:35:16,678
makers over the last 25 years or so and

2100
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:19,319
I always found that the ones that had

2101
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:21,279
traditional training in a kitchen that

2102
01:35:19,319 --> 01:35:25,759
understood kitchen

2103
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:30,319
Sops and kitchen um cleanliness seem to

2104
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:32,039
shine in the hash making um processes so

2105
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:36,279
lots of my friends that were really

2106
01:35:32,039 --> 01:35:38,519
great chefs uh to No Surprise were also

2107
01:35:36,279 --> 01:35:41,279
great at producing nice hash and also

2108
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:43,719
seem to also grow beautiful cannabis

2109
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:45,279
which is a very important factor you

2110
01:35:43,719 --> 01:35:46,840
know it's it's great if you understand

2111
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:49,759
how to make great hash but if you don't

2112
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:51,600
have the material to make it uh all the

2113
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,480
uh all the Sops in the world are not

2114
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,760
going to produce any fire for you you

2115
01:35:53,479 --> 01:35:57,479
really really have to first understand

2116
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,639
have that sort of old factory

2117
01:35:57,479 --> 01:36:02,678
relationship which I think you know ties

2118
01:35:59,639 --> 01:36:06,560
into that kitchen relationship where you

2119
01:36:02,679 --> 01:36:08,279
have to have a very a you know you have

2120
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:10,760
to have a high level of awareness when

2121
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:13,800
it comes to your old factory your sense

2122
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:17,079
of taste your sense of of visualization

2123
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:19,920
and your sense of creating synergistic

2124
01:36:17,079 --> 01:36:21,760
um Creation with Foods the way certain

2125
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:24,199
foods go together so beautifully and

2126
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:26,679
doing certain things with those Foods

2127
01:36:24,198 --> 01:36:29,919
can create these synergies that you know

2128
01:36:26,679 --> 01:36:33,760
produce more than 1+ 1+ 1 equal 3 but 1

2129
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:36,239
plus 1+ 1 equals 9 and so yeah those

2130
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:38,000
those translate very well and I would

2131
01:36:36,238 --> 01:36:40,079
implore anyone that's out there that is

2132
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,439
a chef and that is good at what they do

2133
01:36:40,079 --> 01:36:44,198
if they enjoy cannabis uh you should dip

2134
01:36:42,439 --> 01:36:46,759
in a little bit into hash making because

2135
01:36:44,198 --> 01:36:48,879
you'll probably shine at it and uh like

2136
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:51,079
you inspire people with your food uh

2137
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:54,440
you'll also inspire people with your

2138
01:36:51,079 --> 01:36:54,439
with your extracts

2139
01:36:55,238 --> 01:36:59,158
I would like is next to

2140
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:06,760
stoneless we're gonna um start um

2141
01:37:03,399 --> 01:37:09,960
organizing bior Regional Dem pure um

2142
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:11,679
high-end food and hash experiences at uh

2143
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:14,880
you know really nice either high-end

2144
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:16,520
Airbnb or some kind of piece of land or

2145
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:21,880
Resort in different areas and what we

2146
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:24,320
want to do is just combine the hash with

2147
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:26,760
with food with glazes is you know with

2148
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:29,559
that Ola Factory experience not to get

2149
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:32,560
super ripped but really just to Super

2150
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:35,480
celebrate the the the aromatic

2151
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:39,639
experience of really good food fresh

2152
01:37:35,479 --> 01:37:41,678
food from the area with awesome people

2153
01:37:39,639 --> 01:37:43,440
and then being able to offer some of the

2154
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:45,599
products to the community that we might

2155
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:49,118
not be able to and we can do that in a

2156
01:37:45,599 --> 01:37:52,119
private session in areas like Maine

2157
01:37:49,118 --> 01:37:54,319
Michigan Oregon California British

2158
01:37:52,118 --> 01:37:57,039
Columbia you know and if the borders

2159
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:59,759
open up we can start hitting up South

2160
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:02,039
America and Europe and and you know

2161
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,800
maybe even Thailand if we if it you know

2162
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:05,599
it starts coming open because that's

2163
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:08,279
that's where that's yeah that's where

2164
01:38:05,599 --> 01:38:10,599
our families are and stuff so um look

2165
01:38:08,279 --> 01:38:13,519
for those Gatherings as we start get uh

2166
01:38:10,599 --> 01:38:18,119
getting together yeah we're gonna do dem

2167
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:22,480
pure popup experience uh

2168
01:38:18,118 --> 01:38:25,679
nights days beauti that out here hey

2169
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:28,319
Marcus I have a question Marcus on the

2170
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:30,520
um in in the The Whistler technology

2171
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:32,679
when you guys are making hash what does

2172
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:34,800
that come out analyzing at you know the

2173
01:38:32,679 --> 01:38:37,679
reason why I'm asking is one of the

2174
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:39,960
challenges here in Vermont is they have

2175
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:41,599
we are we've just gone recreational or

2176
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:45,560
adult use or whatever you want to call

2177
01:38:41,599 --> 01:38:49,000
it but they have a limit on uh THC which

2178
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:51,239
is we all know really stupid but it's a

2179
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,920
artificial limit I think with it

2180
01:38:51,238 --> 01:38:58,559
hopefully either be raised or go away

2181
01:38:53,920 --> 01:39:00,599
later but right now it's 60% THC so is

2182
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,239
that around the ballpark that these

2183
01:39:00,599 --> 01:39:04,560
hashes come out

2184
01:39:02,238 --> 01:39:06,158
at yeah I mean depending on what you're

2185
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:08,000
putting in there you can definitely get

2186
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:10,839
hashes I mean listen I was running

2187
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,880
Afghan Kush I ran God I feel like I ran

2188
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:17,840
like 500 kilos of it I think we ran

2189
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:20,760
about 500 kilos of Afghan Kush oh I

2190
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:23,560
froze am I back

2191
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:25,079
no okay now I'm back sorry it's

2192
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:28,080
conspiracy against me today you were

2193
01:39:25,079 --> 01:39:30,118
freshly Frozen I saw cuz you guys all

2194
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:32,118
freeze up for me so I I know when I'm

2195
01:39:30,118 --> 01:39:35,479
frozen because you guys are all

2196
01:39:32,118 --> 01:39:38,920
like and not moving so I totally get

2197
01:39:35,479 --> 01:39:38,919
that I'm there it is

2198
01:39:50,039 --> 01:39:54,118
again I'm telling you doesn't want to

2199
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,440
give me the

2200
01:39:54,118 --> 01:39:58,238
doesn't want to give me the love you

2201
01:39:55,439 --> 01:40:01,238
know what yes 60% is right in the range

2202
01:39:58,238 --> 01:40:03,638
the highest stuff I made was close to 80

2203
01:40:01,238 --> 01:40:07,519
um the lowest that's come out and this

2204
01:40:03,639 --> 01:40:09,920
is with like a 15 or a 16% cultivar was

2205
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:11,719
the 220 which is usually like you just

2206
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:14,440
throw it away and it was

2207
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:16,960
50% so you can certainly make hash in

2208
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:20,839
that in that 60% range I mean you're

2209
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:22,880
7390 and 120 could be a little higher um

2210
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:24,760
what I'm finding for these legal markets

2211
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:28,239
aside from from California and some of

2212
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:30,159
the some of the US markets is that

2213
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:31,718
because of the expensive licensing and

2214
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:34,238
the expensive

2215
01:40:31,719 --> 01:40:36,800
testing people are mixing a lot of the

2216
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:39,799
microns together which really hurts my

2217
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:42,199
soul like badly but that will also you

2218
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:44,760
know if you're putting your 45 through

2219
01:40:42,198 --> 01:40:46,399
160 Al together and most people now

2220
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:48,920
they're making bubble to press into

2221
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:51,519
rosin as well they don't they don't have

2222
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:56,480
the at least here in Canada so you know

2223
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:59,400
60% is is a pretty solid range um those

2224
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:02,678
rins those rosins are much higher than

2225
01:40:59,399 --> 01:41:05,559
like in the in the 70s or 80s is right

2226
01:41:02,679 --> 01:41:08,359
yeah the rosins come in around 65 to to

2227
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:10,159
80 or so depending on on the material I

2228
01:41:08,359 --> 01:41:13,679
mean you could always start with a much

2229
01:41:10,158 --> 01:41:17,079
lower Frozen again oh no I'm not frozen

2230
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:20,679
when I used to when I used to make

2231
01:41:17,079 --> 01:41:25,920
99.9 out of my skunk number one which

2232
01:41:20,679 --> 01:41:28,399
was uh 177% THC manicured uh so it

2233
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:31,840
wasn't enormously high it was just very

2234
01:41:28,399 --> 01:41:32,920
turpine rich so it was very enjoyable

2235
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:36,960
but

2236
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:40,800
uh when I would make

2237
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:46,480
99.9 uh% resin heads out of it it was in

2238
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:49,159
the low 80s like maybe 82 83 84%

2239
01:41:46,479 --> 01:41:52,638
THC what was the tpine the tpine

2240
01:41:49,158 --> 01:41:54,679
percentage Sam oh you know I didn't

2241
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:59,279
measure it as a percentage I just did

2242
01:41:54,679 --> 01:42:02,158
the profiles to be honest so so so if it

2243
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:07,079
was 80 let's just say 80% what do you

2244
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:10,679
think the makeup of that other 20% is

2245
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:14,439
in I wouldn't be surprised if the tpin

2246
01:42:10,679 --> 01:42:16,960
were you know 10% or more because even

2247
01:42:14,439 --> 01:42:18,079
if they were only three or something

2248
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:22,639
like

2249
01:42:18,079 --> 01:42:25,359
that what I've got there is four or five

2250
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:28,400
times stronger than the the weed he came

2251
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:30,598
from so the tpine should be also four or

2252
01:42:28,399 --> 01:42:33,559
five times higher so I I wouldn't be

2253
01:42:30,599 --> 01:42:35,159
surprised if at all if a lot of what was

2254
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:39,239
missing was

2255
01:42:35,158 --> 01:42:41,679
thines but also too that was dry SI so

2256
01:42:39,238 --> 01:42:46,319
there was also natural

2257
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:48,279
wax the cuticle so yeah right that might

2258
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:54,039
have been that other 10% so if it was

2259
01:42:48,279 --> 01:42:58,039
10% tpes 10% cuticle wax and 80%

2260
01:42:54,039 --> 01:43:01,319
canono that's a pretty canono was THC

2261
01:42:58,039 --> 01:43:04,960
because skunk really doesn't the amount

2262
01:43:01,319 --> 01:43:07,960
of T it's got thcb but at really really

2263
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:11,960
really tiny amounts and the same thing

2264
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:15,079
with CBD I mean it's got a CBD synthes

2265
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:17,158
in it but it's mutated and it's

2266
01:43:15,079 --> 01:43:19,519
nonfunctional so it doesn't really

2267
01:43:17,158 --> 01:43:19,519
produce

2268
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:29,199
CBD we produced rosin that was 84%

2269
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:31,360
cannabinoids and 9% tpes and so that was

2270
01:43:29,198 --> 01:43:32,319
in the in the 90s that was but it had

2271
01:43:31,359 --> 01:43:37,639
like

2272
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:40,079
77% thca and it had some CB like 8% cbga

2273
01:43:37,639 --> 01:43:42,639
and it had a little bit of CBC and

2274
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:46,599
almost 2% of THC

2275
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:48,359
VA um and that if you add Marcus if you

2276
01:43:46,599 --> 01:43:53,480
add up all those numbers What's the

2277
01:43:48,359 --> 01:43:57,319
total unknown it was like 7% unknown

2278
01:43:53,479 --> 01:43:59,718
M so that's your your your waxes and

2279
01:43:57,319 --> 01:44:01,920
your your you want to you know get that

2280
01:43:59,719 --> 01:44:04,679
number as small as you possibly can and

2281
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:07,639
get your cannaboids and tpes both the

2282
01:44:04,679 --> 01:44:12,599
dry sift and water hash will have waxes

2283
01:44:07,639 --> 01:44:17,880
on it unless it's been you know uh you

2284
01:44:12,599 --> 01:44:17,880
know treated with cold winterized yes

2285
01:44:18,079 --> 01:44:24,599
exactly yeah but win winterization also

2286
01:44:21,399 --> 01:44:26,839
when in in that process you you you

2287
01:44:24,599 --> 01:44:29,599
dissolve it up in ethanol and then chill

2288
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:32,440
it to precipitate out any fats waxes

2289
01:44:29,599 --> 01:44:36,440
when you strip off the ethanol you lose

2290
01:44:32,439 --> 01:44:39,439
a fair fraction of the light fraction of

2291
01:44:36,439 --> 01:44:41,638
your tpin in that in that ethanol

2292
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:44,638
recovery when you grow them you're

2293
01:44:41,639 --> 01:44:46,279
losing tpin when you dry them when you

2294
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:50,520
harvest them when you touch them when

2295
01:44:46,279 --> 01:44:54,238
you move them I mean it's yeah that's

2296
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:54,239
the name of the game

2297
01:44:56,359 --> 01:45:03,279
yeah so if you're um you know making

2298
01:45:00,198 --> 01:45:05,960
rosin from 73 bags or isolating bags

2299
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:09,279
making rosin from 90 if it's not you

2300
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:11,800
know six star or seven star because me

2301
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:13,479
and Kelly are on that seven star now and

2302
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:14,239
we can talk about that later but I'm

2303
01:45:13,479 --> 01:45:15,959
just

2304
01:45:14,238 --> 01:45:19,079
saying

2305
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:22,719
um uh what do you recommend like the

2306
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:22,719
mushrooms the home

2307
01:45:35,039 --> 01:45:41,560
someone else M make rosin out of each of

2308
01:45:38,599 --> 01:45:45,319
the fractions and you'll see that the

2309
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:48,000
rosin the difference will be less than

2310
01:45:45,319 --> 01:45:50,719
the resin because when you when you've

2311
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:54,840
got a bunch of different resins are a

2312
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:58,039
little bit different uh but the rosin

2313
01:45:54,840 --> 01:46:02,239
it's it sort of equalizes everything and

2314
01:45:58,039 --> 01:46:02,238
they all get really really pretty

2315
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:13,000
high-end I I would just say that the

2316
01:46:08,479 --> 01:46:15,919
more the the more um uh undesir not

2317
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:19,520
undesirable but the more um uh plant

2318
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:22,639
cuticle and plant matter and just the

2319
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:25,719
lower or your higher that that unknown

2320
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:29,118
fra action the more suited towards

2321
01:46:25,719 --> 01:46:31,079
Edibles and topicals and full spec not

2322
01:46:29,118 --> 01:46:33,679
that there's no value in that full

2323
01:46:31,079 --> 01:46:37,279
spectrum oil treatment you know cancer

2324
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:40,239
patients who need AKA Rick Simpson Oil

2325
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:43,840
just full spectrum oil you're getting

2326
01:46:40,238 --> 01:46:46,319
you know a full spectrum extract there

2327
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:48,920
and and people claim I don't know have

2328
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:52,319
you guys seen this um these Ros and

2329
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:56,158
gummies where I I guess again there's a

2330
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:57,960
fair amount of flavor from the rosin

2331
01:46:56,158 --> 01:47:00,079
that actually goes into the gummy that

2332
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:02,719
flavors the gummy so maybe you're not

2333
01:47:00,079 --> 01:47:05,238
you're using less sugar because it's you

2334
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:07,118
know you don't need to flavor it because

2335
01:47:05,238 --> 01:47:08,198
you're using the extract itself to

2336
01:47:07,118 --> 01:47:11,238
flavor

2337
01:47:08,198 --> 01:47:13,519
it anyone experienced Rous and gummies

2338
01:47:11,238 --> 01:47:15,158
yet yeah there's a bunch of Rous and

2339
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:17,560
gummies that are being made up and

2340
01:47:15,158 --> 01:47:20,439
around here

2341
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:24,159
and they're also using alternative like

2342
01:47:20,439 --> 01:47:28,039
sweeteners a lot of stevia people trying

2343
01:47:24,158 --> 01:47:30,879
um a Tamarind paste or a mango paste

2344
01:47:28,039 --> 01:47:33,000
making some unbelievably gorgeous

2345
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:34,920
gummies with rosin and you definitely

2346
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,158
can taste the rosin in there but they're

2347
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:40,639
pairing it really well like I just just

2348
01:47:38,158 --> 01:47:42,399
a few weeks ago we had like a mango

2349
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:44,199
gummy that was paired with a beautiful

2350
01:47:42,399 --> 01:47:48,719
rosin it was delicious and we had the

2351
01:47:44,198 --> 01:47:51,719
rosin heads chocolate out um in Ontario

2352
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:53,359
has really good rosin flavor in it their

2353
01:47:51,719 --> 01:47:55,359
chocolates amazing they have their

2354
01:47:53,359 --> 01:47:57,039
Buddha heads and all kinds of different

2355
01:47:55,359 --> 01:48:00,118
you know molds they're really really

2356
01:47:57,039 --> 01:48:03,639
sweet and they pair different are you

2357
01:48:00,118 --> 01:48:05,319
guys Al I mean again I'm not I I'm a

2358
01:48:03,639 --> 01:48:06,920
scientist so I always like to try to

2359
01:48:05,319 --> 01:48:09,118
figure things out and whenever you're

2360
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:11,440
looking at the marketplace there's value

2361
01:48:09,118 --> 01:48:14,719
for you know considering you know the

2362
01:48:11,439 --> 01:48:18,919
way a consumer would think too and so I

2363
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:23,520
always think that like in a infused

2364
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:25,440
edible product the best flavor is

2365
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:28,239
no flavor at all you shouldn't you

2366
01:48:25,439 --> 01:48:30,960
shouldn't be able to taste like the

2367
01:48:28,238 --> 01:48:32,559
cannabis extract or all the all the

2368
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:37,039
stuff that kind of comes along for the

2369
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:39,719
ride so is you know again people use

2370
01:48:37,039 --> 01:48:43,118
like CBD isolate yeah that's not full

2371
01:48:39,719 --> 01:48:46,439
spectrum but there are ways of basically

2372
01:48:43,118 --> 01:48:49,439
translating full spectrum medicine into

2373
01:48:46,439 --> 01:48:52,399
ways where the taste and flavor isn't

2374
01:48:49,439 --> 01:48:54,359
really impact but neutralized by I think

2375
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:57,359
what you are saying the other components

2376
01:48:54,359 --> 01:49:02,319
in the formulation itself and now you

2377
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:05,079
completely crossed from you know uh what

2378
01:49:02,319 --> 01:49:07,599
what is it recreational psychoactive

2379
01:49:05,079 --> 01:49:09,920
consumption to food and nutrition

2380
01:49:07,599 --> 01:49:12,199
because now you're really talking about

2381
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:16,239
a food and nutrition product so where

2382
01:49:12,198 --> 01:49:19,598
you could use these plant extracts to

2383
01:49:16,238 --> 01:49:23,079
say okay well uh say I don't know I I

2384
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:25,560
don't have time to uh to to do my dab to

2385
01:49:23,079 --> 01:49:27,800
smoke but I do have time to say eat this

2386
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:30,599
Cliff bar well is there a you know again

2387
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:32,279
a way to put that rosin into something

2388
01:49:30,599 --> 01:49:34,279
like a cliff bar or something that

2389
01:49:32,279 --> 01:49:36,800
somebody could eat on the go a gummy is

2390
01:49:34,279 --> 01:49:39,238
I guess the most convenient example but

2391
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:42,119
you know like I think you were saying is

2392
01:49:39,238 --> 01:49:44,638
right is that you know gummies and yeah

2393
01:49:42,118 --> 01:49:47,639
I play around with melting lots of sugar

2394
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:50,599
in my kitchen too I mean sugar just is

2395
01:49:47,639 --> 01:49:52,760
yeah I mean kind of like necessary evil

2396
01:49:50,599 --> 01:49:55,159
maybe but you know everybody likes to

2397
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:57,199
jolly lancher and this this hard candy

2398
01:49:55,158 --> 01:50:01,638
is really cool because you suck on it

2399
01:49:57,198 --> 01:50:05,158
like a cough drop but um are ways to

2400
01:50:01,639 --> 01:50:08,239
approach using full spectrum extracts

2401
01:50:05,158 --> 01:50:12,158
like rosin but even the more plantier

2402
01:50:08,238 --> 01:50:14,439
extracts in food preparations where

2403
01:50:12,158 --> 01:50:17,719
you're not necessarily oh God that's

2404
01:50:14,439 --> 01:50:19,638
just so loaded with hemp or so loaded

2405
01:50:17,719 --> 01:50:22,760
with cannabis I could I could taste a

2406
01:50:19,639 --> 01:50:25,520
can of butter or I think really the best

2407
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:29,199
best way of medicating is to pair it in

2408
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:32,400
a food that's complimentary or somehow

2409
01:50:29,198 --> 01:50:35,759
it doesn't mask the flavor but uses its

2410
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:39,079
own flavor profile to put like a

2411
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:42,320
bitterness or a sweetness or a sourness

2412
01:50:39,079 --> 01:50:45,760
into it what do you guys think on

2413
01:50:42,319 --> 01:50:48,439
that My worry is the heating up of

2414
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:50,360
volatile organic compound you know it's

2415
01:50:48,439 --> 01:50:52,158
it seems like I'm sure people have

2416
01:50:50,359 --> 01:50:54,960
figured it out and there must be a way

2417
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:57,158
to you know translate that so you get

2418
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:59,198
that flavor and taste

2419
01:50:57,158 --> 01:51:01,158
unchanged but I think if you're heating

2420
01:50:59,198 --> 01:51:03,198
up chocolate or you're heating up you

2421
01:51:01,158 --> 01:51:05,960
know gummies and it's it's quite a hot

2422
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:09,519
temperature I just I worry that those

2423
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:11,840
things will be changed uh particularly

2424
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:14,639
in their in their flavor so I'm sure

2425
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:17,078
someone will figure it out at the very

2426
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:19,279
least they would certainly be let me

2427
01:51:17,078 --> 01:51:21,039
just finish by saying maybe the most

2428
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:23,920
prominent example of that would be like

2429
01:51:21,039 --> 01:51:26,920
cough drop where cough drops basically

2430
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:29,639
have I think it's like camper and Pine

2431
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:33,078
and a few of the kind of like Menthol

2432
01:51:29,639 --> 01:51:35,960
yeah Menthol exactly and so like yeah so

2433
01:51:33,078 --> 01:51:38,198
you could put basically essential oils

2434
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:40,719
into basically a candy right a cough

2435
01:51:38,198 --> 01:51:42,839
drop is candy right take it and then

2436
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:45,078
when you as that cough drop dissolves

2437
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:49,078
you really feel that turke rush and you

2438
01:51:45,078 --> 01:51:51,319
know I mean and I think with edial again

2439
01:51:49,078 --> 01:51:54,679
correct me from wrong I mean maybe some

2440
01:51:51,319 --> 01:51:57,399
people like the edial to taste like herb

2441
01:51:54,679 --> 01:51:59,599
I want my herb to taste like herb but I

2442
01:51:57,399 --> 01:52:02,198
want my you know Edibles I want my food

2443
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:03,760
to taste like food I don't need my food

2444
01:52:02,198 --> 01:52:06,799
to taste like weed but I don't know

2445
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:10,320
maybe other people feel differently I I

2446
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:14,880
can remember when I was younger the more

2447
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:18,238
potent the Cannabis product the more uh

2448
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:23,078
bite there was to my tongue almost like

2449
01:52:18,238 --> 01:52:27,118
peppery uh so when I was if I would eat

2450
01:52:23,078 --> 01:52:30,599
herb dried herb uh it would be a little

2451
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:35,198
bit spicy like that if I would eat dried

2452
01:52:30,599 --> 01:52:38,078
resin or a dri sifted resin it would be

2453
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:41,799
quite peppery if you did a butter or

2454
01:52:38,078 --> 01:52:45,319
ghee extract of that it got I mean

2455
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:47,960
pepper as hell to my tongue so when I

2456
01:52:45,319 --> 01:52:51,559
smoked my first pure

2457
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:54,078
THC I assumed it was going to be peppery

2458
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:57,760
as [ __ ] so I put a little tiny bit on my

2459
01:52:54,078 --> 01:53:01,559
tongue it had zero taste or smell I

2460
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:04,679
couldn't believe it yeah maybe it's the

2461
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:06,920
kopine you because kopine is one of the

2462
01:53:04,679 --> 01:53:09,118
turpins that's in black pepper maybe

2463
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:12,639
there's that's one of the Turin that

2464
01:53:09,118 --> 01:53:15,839
well I haven't done any oral testing but

2465
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:18,679
I wouldn't be surprised if uh marine

2466
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:21,840
loline and a several other ones also

2467
01:53:18,679 --> 01:53:24,078
have a bittery peppery taste I would not

2468
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:27,920
be surprised at

2469
01:53:24,078 --> 01:53:30,118
all I put some on my tongue but I I just

2470
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:33,158
haven't done it there there's a whole

2471
01:53:30,118 --> 01:53:37,118
genre of cannabis chefs and a lot of

2472
01:53:33,158 --> 01:53:39,479
people are using cannabis preparations

2473
01:53:37,118 --> 01:53:40,799
and cannabis extracts and cooking and

2474
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:43,879
kind of like the point that Marcus

2475
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:45,239
raised which is that if you're cooking

2476
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:47,199
if you're making like I don't know a

2477
01:53:45,238 --> 01:53:51,000
stew or a pudding or you're baking

2478
01:53:47,198 --> 01:53:54,519
something you're putting a a thermal

2479
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,599
pressure on this very sensitive plant

2480
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:57,679
material especially when you're talking

2481
01:53:55,599 --> 01:54:00,960
about the tpin right and the turine

2482
01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:04,000
ratio I mean everyone's tasted that

2483
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:05,840
roasted weed smell you get if you take

2484
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:09,359
just weed and put it in the oven and try

2485
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:12,400
to decarb it I never understood that as

2486
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:16,078
part of a uh a brownie recipe people are

2487
01:54:12,399 --> 01:54:19,759
like oh uh when you decarb the weed it's

2488
01:54:16,078 --> 01:54:22,118
much easier for the oil to extract it

2489
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:25,960
but um you burn off all those tpes and

2490
01:54:22,118 --> 01:54:29,238
you have now this roasted weed smell

2491
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:31,840
which is kind of like burnt tpping and

2492
01:54:29,238 --> 01:54:34,319
also just the baking itself will decarb

2493
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:37,880
it so they're they're they're

2494
01:54:34,319 --> 01:54:40,319
stupid right so right right right but

2495
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:41,840
but I I guess the point I'm bringing up

2496
01:54:40,319 --> 01:54:44,759
is kind of like what Marcus was saying

2497
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:45,880
is that if you're using cannabis or

2498
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:49,599
cannabis

2499
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:52,800
preparations in a food a process to make

2500
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:55,960
a food product or a dish and and it

2501
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:59,279
involves heat it's going to either

2502
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:02,599
destroy or somehow rearrange the turpins

2503
01:54:59,279 --> 01:55:04,559
and make like a off flavor in your food

2504
01:55:02,599 --> 01:55:05,760
and you you're thinking well you know

2505
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:08,000
again kind of like what we were saying

2506
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:10,159
with Josh and Kelly you're getting full

2507
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,238
spectrum extract and you're getting

2508
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:13,598
everything that you can the whole plant

2509
01:55:12,238 --> 01:55:15,399
goodness and everything that's in there

2510
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:17,840
but what you're really getting is kind

2511
01:55:15,399 --> 01:55:20,359
of like a bunch of degradation products

2512
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:23,360
you got from adding this full spectrum

2513
01:55:20,359 --> 01:55:26,399
extract which is not th normally stable

2514
01:55:23,359 --> 01:55:29,319
into a process where you basically yeah

2515
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:33,319
turn it into had that problem I would

2516
01:55:29,319 --> 01:55:35,920
make no bake cookies out of haze so I'd

2517
01:55:33,319 --> 01:55:41,359
get like a half a pound of haze and then

2518
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:44,158
I would put uh ghee on top of it and put

2519
01:55:41,359 --> 01:55:46,960
it over a double boiler and I would lose

2520
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:49,719
a lot of tpping so what I started doing

2521
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:52,719
was I did it inside of a pressure cooker

2522
01:55:49,719 --> 01:55:55,399
not at higher temperatures but just so

2523
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:57,560
that I didn't lose anything and that

2524
01:55:55,399 --> 01:56:00,399
helped quite a bit they changed the

2525
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:03,920
taste very slightly but uh I wasn't

2526
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:05,598
losing it like I was before um I also

2527
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:08,279
know that when people are using such a

2528
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:10,319
beautiful high you know quality product

2529
01:56:08,279 --> 01:56:12,679
such as rosin and its full spectrum

2530
01:56:10,319 --> 01:56:14,759
they're definitely doing raw products

2531
01:56:12,679 --> 01:56:16,880
and the gummy that I'm talking about is

2532
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:19,560
a raw product because when you work with

2533
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:21,480
Tapioca And you work with other

2534
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:23,560
different types of binders like that you

2535
01:56:21,479 --> 01:56:26,559
can definitely do raw products without

2536
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:30,000
heating up and making sure that the

2537
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:33,199
raw the THC be

2538
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:35,599
thca yeah I guess so well no because

2539
01:56:33,198 --> 01:56:37,359
remember the rosin is is is being

2540
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:39,480
pressed it's being heated up so it

2541
01:56:37,359 --> 01:56:42,719
depends on how high you know they're

2542
01:56:39,479 --> 01:56:45,000
heating it up but yeah if it's a low 10

2543
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:47,359
rosin then it is gonna be a

2544
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,359
thca we actually figured this out right

2545
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:52,439
here on hash Church a couple years ago

2546
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:55,039
it is thca that that basically comes out

2547
01:56:52,439 --> 01:56:57,118
through what we believe is somewhat of a

2548
01:56:55,039 --> 01:57:00,399
of a steam distillation process where

2549
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:04,559
the moisture is somehow driving a the

2550
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:09,000
the cannabinoids out out but um yeah so

2551
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:11,760
so tapioca you mentioned uh Kelly oh my

2552
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:15,238
gosh I had not previously worked with

2553
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:17,560
tapioca and appreciated how viscous it

2554
01:57:15,238 --> 01:57:20,118
is at room temperature you definitely

2555
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:23,639
need to heat tapioca to get that to move

2556
01:57:20,118 --> 01:57:26,799
it's an order magnitude to or two more

2557
01:57:23,639 --> 01:57:30,039
viscous than just corn syrup I mean it

2558
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:33,440
is just very very viscous and what what

2559
01:57:30,039 --> 01:57:36,800
I also noticed is that if you heat it up

2560
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:40,359
too much it begins to do this

2561
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:44,239
crystallization reaction which totally

2562
01:57:40,359 --> 01:57:46,319
changes the morphology and the the the

2563
01:57:44,238 --> 01:57:48,319
tapioca that you you get out of that

2564
01:57:46,319 --> 01:57:51,118
that's what I use when I make my candy

2565
01:57:48,319 --> 01:57:54,198
too I use tap nice but you know what

2566
01:57:51,118 --> 01:57:56,559
tapioca does it takes a really long time

2567
01:57:54,198 --> 01:57:59,118
it takes a time to cool down before it

2568
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:01,199
actually gels so there's a time in

2569
01:57:59,118 --> 01:58:04,198
between there that it's actually really

2570
01:58:01,198 --> 01:58:07,279
cool before it gels that you can add in

2571
01:58:04,198 --> 01:58:09,118
your rosin and for sure these gummies

2572
01:58:07,279 --> 01:58:12,238
that I'm talking about they don't

2573
01:58:09,118 --> 01:58:16,158
actually get you very high so there is

2574
01:58:12,238 --> 01:58:17,759
definitely some thca you know in there I

2575
01:58:16,158 --> 01:58:21,238
do think that there's some possibilities

2576
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:23,599
for tapioca to still have you know

2577
01:58:21,238 --> 01:58:26,078
without overheating eating it or and

2578
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:28,480
it's a magical thing I with it a lot too

2579
01:58:26,078 --> 01:58:31,238
what were you gonna say Brian can you

2580
01:58:28,479 --> 01:58:34,158
use raw Agave that would actually help

2581
01:58:31,238 --> 01:58:36,959
with the viscosity of it and then

2582
01:58:34,158 --> 01:58:40,960
something to bond it to harden you

2583
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:44,679
know we use Stevia and you can also use

2584
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:49,039
a little bit of some super highly

2585
01:58:44,679 --> 01:58:51,800
concentrated um fruit puree like you can

2586
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:54,118
use mango is a puree that's often you

2587
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:57,119
can buy and you can get it organic and

2588
01:58:54,118 --> 01:58:59,238
is super thick and really concentrated

2589
01:58:57,118 --> 01:59:01,639
the same with Tamarind that's another

2590
01:58:59,238 --> 01:59:04,598
one that's super thick and concentrated

2591
01:59:01,639 --> 01:59:07,719
so you can add small amounts of tapioca

2592
01:59:04,599 --> 01:59:10,078
to it that's not actually very hot and

2593
01:59:07,719 --> 01:59:12,078
it'll be nice to to look at you know the

2594
01:59:10,078 --> 01:59:14,479
lab studies on it because that I don't

2595
01:59:12,078 --> 01:59:16,599
have that's just something that you know

2596
01:59:14,479 --> 01:59:19,000
people are making around here in BC and

2597
01:59:16,599 --> 01:59:20,960
in the cies and they're delicious and

2598
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:22,719
really beautiful and I know the maker of

2599
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:24,560
them and she's doing some amazing work

2600
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:26,399
with different types of sugar herbs too

2601
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:30,320
going yeah she's putting herbs in it

2602
01:59:26,399 --> 01:59:32,118
she's been doing uh even some super

2603
01:59:30,319 --> 01:59:34,719
concentrated vinegar

2604
01:59:32,118 --> 01:59:37,399
shrugs um with different types of herbs

2605
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:39,520
so the gummies like almost have like a

2606
01:59:37,399 --> 01:59:42,039
really Beau vinegar tell people what a

2607
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:45,719
vinegar shrug is a vinegar shrug is is

2608
01:59:42,039 --> 01:59:49,359
just utilizing vinegar instead of

2609
01:59:45,719 --> 01:59:52,439
alcohol as a tincture so it's called a

2610
01:59:49,359 --> 01:59:54,799
shrug instead of a tincture

2611
01:59:52,439 --> 01:59:57,439
and they're really quite flavorful and

2612
01:59:54,800 --> 02:00:00,039
quite wonderful if you you know do

2613
01:59:57,439 --> 02:00:02,879
different compounded herbs and if you

2614
02:00:00,039 --> 02:00:04,000
you can cook down the vinegar like a lot

2615
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:06,480
to where it has a little bit of a

2616
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:09,158
vinegary flavor so the gummies are

2617
02:00:06,479 --> 02:00:10,879
almost like these beautiful fruity wine

2618
02:00:09,158 --> 02:00:12,559
gummies you know those yummy wine

2619
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:14,440
gummies that they I'm sure they still

2620
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:16,719
have them but I don't eat sugar so

2621
02:00:14,439 --> 02:00:20,960
they're delicious anyway Al also just

2622
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:23,399
the whole anything slow cook slow heat

2623
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:26,279
you know the whole slow food movement

2624
02:00:23,399 --> 02:00:29,679
you know that's a great place for the

2625
02:00:26,279 --> 02:00:31,759
for the ganja also um fermentation or

2626
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:35,359
pickling if you have something that's

2627
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:38,199
super spicy you know you could add it to

2628
02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:41,078
a Spicy Pickle or some kind of a little

2629
02:00:38,198 --> 02:00:43,759
sweet side dish so again it's maybe it's

2630
02:00:41,078 --> 02:00:45,559
not your whole meal but it's just a

2631
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:46,280
little part of it you know to get you

2632
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:49,440
kind

2633
02:00:46,279 --> 02:00:51,679
of spiced up or whatever chy or

2634
02:00:49,439 --> 02:00:54,279
something like that yeah good a good

2635
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:57,639
talk though I do think that the

2636
02:00:54,279 --> 02:01:00,920
more any any glaze you know could could

2637
02:00:57,639 --> 02:01:03,400
also be a good

2638
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:07,000
utilization pesto is a good

2639
02:01:03,399 --> 02:01:10,359
one Pine the pesto is a really good one

2640
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:13,000
for like raw even into cooked where it's

2641
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:15,158
that spicy element of the Cannabis that

2642
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,479
burns your throat even or does mine a

2643
02:01:15,158 --> 02:01:20,000
bit and that part can be unpleasant even

2644
02:01:17,479 --> 02:01:23,118
if I like the taste so I know when it

2645
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:25,118
goes in there with an oil or either like

2646
02:01:23,118 --> 02:01:27,799
the raw and the composition of it mixing

2647
02:01:25,118 --> 02:01:30,960
and how it tastes combined with like a

2648
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:35,079
almost a piny Nutty spicy

2649
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:36,679
pesto so yeah Savory and not just sugary

2650
02:01:35,078 --> 02:01:39,039
items where it's you know it's fun to

2651
02:01:36,679 --> 02:01:41,920
explore the TP and and the expressions

2652
02:01:39,039 --> 02:01:44,639
with food and I don't I try not to eat

2653
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:45,880
sugar also so it's one of those when you

2654
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:48,639
do

2655
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:52,880
that when you do that you can make your

2656
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:56,000
pesto instead of out of uh Pine nut you

2657
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:58,560
can make them out of cannabis seeds I've

2658
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:01,560
I've done that was

2659
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:03,639
delicious great idea yeah it makes the

2660
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:06,719
pesto really creamy and if you even

2661
02:02:03,639 --> 02:02:08,840
blend it with hemp seeds it makes a

2662
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:12,319
beautiful pesto also I wanted to add

2663
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:16,319
that even basil you know fresh basil can

2664
02:02:12,319 --> 02:02:18,439
have that super intense bite I found you

2665
02:02:16,319 --> 02:02:20,158
know certain varietals that actually you

2666
02:02:18,439 --> 02:02:22,719
know are really hot in the back of the

2667
02:02:20,158 --> 02:02:24,839
throat too when it's raw so yeah those

2668
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:27,039
two are paired really well together

2669
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:30,000
different kinds of chutneys too yum

2670
02:02:27,039 --> 02:02:33,760
we've been working with like fresh lime

2671
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:35,479
and fresh um mint Chutney and adding a

2672
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:38,079
little bit of flour in their raw and

2673
02:02:35,479 --> 02:02:41,479
that's been it's really delicious fire

2674
02:02:38,078 --> 02:02:43,679
cider a fire cider could be a good for

2675
02:02:41,479 --> 02:02:47,279
it yeah and that's raw as

2676
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:49,039
well nice ranges and ranges in profile

2677
02:02:47,279 --> 02:02:52,238
where you have like the spice to the

2678
02:02:49,039 --> 02:02:54,238
Savory text and and the sweets come in

2679
02:02:52,238 --> 02:02:55,959
with it I like the spicy and the sweet

2680
02:02:54,238 --> 02:02:58,439
idea with chatney that sounds like a

2681
02:02:55,960 --> 02:03:01,359
good one and it's been really fun

2682
02:02:58,439 --> 02:03:04,078
putting the fresh flowers in the raw

2683
02:03:01,359 --> 02:03:06,639
honey and then you leave it in there for

2684
02:03:04,078 --> 02:03:06,639
a good

2685
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:25,840
month um extraction and then you can use

2686
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:28,520
that honey raw in all different types of

2687
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:31,319
things so that's something that I give

2688
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:34,079
to children for like a cough syrup and

2689
02:03:31,319 --> 02:03:35,960
they're just getting thca or CBD we

2690
02:03:34,078 --> 02:03:38,118
mostly use CBD in there but they would

2691
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:41,319
be getting thca with those traces in

2692
02:03:38,118 --> 02:03:44,279
there and that's awesome to use that um

2693
02:03:41,319 --> 02:03:47,558
honey for different types of medicinal

2694
02:03:44,279 --> 02:03:49,800
extracts extracted other herbs Lavender

2695
02:03:47,559 --> 02:03:52,320
in Honey yeah you can put all kinds of

2696
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:54,639
fresh flowers in honey and now you're

2697
02:03:52,319 --> 02:03:59,399
just using this flavored honey yeah we

2698
02:03:54,639 --> 02:04:02,760
did a Mendo breath raw honey with raw

2699
02:03:59,399 --> 02:04:06,839
roses in the in the honey and it was

2700
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:10,280
like wow totally incredible so that's a

2701
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:12,480
beautiful done a maple syrup we haven't

2702
02:04:10,279 --> 02:04:14,880
done maple syrup yet and I'm really

2703
02:04:12,479 --> 02:04:16,759
excited to try it I just I don't I'm

2704
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:20,159
sure it would work because it would

2705
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:22,280
probably erode the the tricomes for sure

2706
02:04:20,158 --> 02:04:25,920
but we're excited to try it have a

2707
02:04:22,279 --> 02:04:28,920
Quebec sugar maple growing here we also

2708
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:31,880
can get water from birch trees so we can

2709
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:34,719
boil down birch as well to get syrup and

2710
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:37,279
then we have some yakon that we grew

2711
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:40,480
this summer we can boil down yakone to

2712
02:04:37,279 --> 02:04:42,078
get syrup so those are the three things

2713
02:04:40,479 --> 02:04:44,399
that we would like to try in I think

2714
02:04:42,078 --> 02:04:46,759
maple syrup would be amazing the the

2715
02:04:44,399 --> 02:04:50,158
Birch syrup would make a great soda

2716
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:53,400
right so delicious yeah that that would

2717
02:04:50,158 --> 02:04:56,118
be Co I'd be interested in that yum well

2718
02:04:53,399 --> 02:04:58,759
come see us have some

2719
02:04:56,118 --> 02:05:00,279
sassa we're here we're waiting for you

2720
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:01,960
well there's a lot of maple syrup here

2721
02:05:00,279 --> 02:05:05,439
in Vermont and so I always wondered

2722
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:08,319
about the intersection between Maple

2723
02:05:05,439 --> 02:05:11,759
sugaring and and cannabis and hemp and

2724
02:05:08,319 --> 02:05:13,158
where those two nutritional things come

2725
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:17,320
together like you've mentioned I mean

2726
02:05:13,158 --> 02:05:20,519
some people are sugar adverse so syrup

2727
02:05:17,319 --> 02:05:22,759
is mostly sugar although I do see signs

2728
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:23,800
for sugar-free syrup I don't know what

2729
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:27,679
that

2730
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:30,360
is I don't know maybe that's a dove or

2731
02:05:27,679 --> 02:05:32,319
something yeah cone syrup would be the

2732
02:05:30,359 --> 02:05:36,479
best syrup for a person that was

2733
02:05:32,319 --> 02:05:38,759
sensitive to to sugars so you know with

2734
02:05:36,479 --> 02:05:42,000
the maple extract so you could basically

2735
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:43,960
make a synthetic maple syrup by adding

2736
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:46,960
like a maple extract to that or

2737
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:48,880
something absolutely and and and I use

2738
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:51,319
that in our in our cooking all the time

2739
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:54,239
I have an awesome organic maple extract

2740
02:05:51,319 --> 02:05:55,920
because you know I don't cook with sugar

2741
02:05:54,238 --> 02:05:58,238
so I'm always trying to think of

2742
02:05:55,920 --> 02:06:00,480
different things outside of the box and

2743
02:05:58,238 --> 02:06:04,238
there's some really beautiful Maple

2744
02:06:00,479 --> 02:06:06,439
extracts that are made up here in Quebec

2745
02:06:04,238 --> 02:06:08,118
like have all of the Essences and it's

2746
02:06:06,439 --> 02:06:10,638
really beautiful but you know the sugars

2747
02:06:08,118 --> 02:06:12,719
are extracted yeah if you're making can

2748
02:06:10,639 --> 02:06:15,039
of butter in general maple syrup is a

2749
02:06:12,719 --> 02:06:18,559
great little additive to add to give it

2750
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:20,439
a little punch and you you you'll end up

2751
02:06:18,559 --> 02:06:22,400
seeing the water separate after your

2752
02:06:20,439 --> 02:06:24,000
butter pools but

2753
02:06:22,399 --> 02:06:27,359
it'll it'll leave a little bit of the

2754
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:30,198
maple essds back in the

2755
02:06:27,359 --> 02:06:32,399
butter well in the cool thing the honey

2756
02:06:30,198 --> 02:06:35,399
when you put the when you put the fresh

2757
02:06:32,399 --> 02:06:37,799
flowers into the honey and then you

2758
02:06:35,399 --> 02:06:40,000
extract it for a couple of months it

2759
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:44,279
would be the same as probably putting it

2760
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:46,679
into maple syrup it extracts The Waters

2761
02:06:44,279 --> 02:06:49,000
from the Fresh flour now you don't have

2762
02:06:46,679 --> 02:06:52,000
to use fresh flour but when you do use

2763
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:54,679
fresh flour it locks in tpin like

2764
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:56,760
amazing when you open up the Honey Jar

2765
02:06:54,679 --> 02:07:01,480
it just smells like the fresh Tarpin of

2766
02:06:56,760 --> 02:07:03,599
the flow and honey yeah so but what

2767
02:07:01,479 --> 02:07:06,558
happens is when the waters are extracted

2768
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:08,960
into that there's a tiny bit of and

2769
02:07:06,559 --> 02:07:11,880
you've got to watch it of fermentation

2770
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:14,679
that might happen and personally I think

2771
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:17,639
that is like so delicious and really

2772
02:07:14,679 --> 02:07:21,719
amazing but there is like something that

2773
02:07:17,639 --> 02:07:23,440
changes when those extracted wat yeah go

2774
02:07:21,719 --> 02:07:27,158
into the honey and I would think the

2775
02:07:23,439 --> 02:07:30,598
same thing for the maple syrup but an

2776
02:07:27,158 --> 02:07:32,799
incredible place to start dispersing and

2777
02:07:30,599 --> 02:07:37,119
talking about the acidic compounds of

2778
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:37,119
canabo and using Birch you would get

2779
02:07:49,679 --> 02:07:56,039
the that's what is B

2780
02:07:53,800 --> 02:08:00,520
uh Papyrus

2781
02:07:56,039 --> 02:08:03,840
bolinus or anyway bolinus and then also

2782
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:06,320
um uh piptoporus binus the mushrooms

2783
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:08,719
that grow on it in aotus so anyway

2784
02:08:06,319 --> 02:08:11,000
there's a lot of the that you see that

2785
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:13,359
name continuing to come up through the

2786
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:16,960
medicinal mushrooms as well it's the

2787
02:08:13,359 --> 02:08:18,639
cambium layer the the the pulsing Waters

2788
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:19,599
through the cambium later that's the

2789
02:08:18,639 --> 02:08:22,000
most

2790
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:25,119
healthy why birches

2791
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:30,279
why chaga is so powerful and it has the

2792
02:08:25,118 --> 02:08:33,439
most sods Super oxide dismutase sodd

2793
02:08:30,279 --> 02:08:37,800
it's a longevity enzyme and chaga has

2794
02:08:33,439 --> 02:08:39,960
more sods than any other herb on Earth

2795
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:42,520
and uh one other thing that has a lot of

2796
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:44,880
sods is turtles so they they're one

2797
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:48,840
thing that lives a long time

2798
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:51,480
and when you find Birch in the forest um

2799
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:53,520
you'll see a whole entire tree you know

2800
02:08:51,479 --> 02:08:56,638
know decomposed on the inside but the

2801
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:59,920
birch bark will look nearly perfect like

2802
02:08:56,639 --> 02:09:02,639
it was still growing because of that you

2803
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:05,399
know s so and that that that that type

2804
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:08,520
of betulinic acid is in there so making

2805
02:09:05,399 --> 02:09:11,319
tea from birch bark is super powerful

2806
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:14,480
and potent for you just putting the bark

2807
02:09:11,319 --> 02:09:17,078
in into water and boiling it not boiling

2808
02:09:14,479 --> 02:09:20,319
more steeping or are simmering and then

2809
02:09:17,078 --> 02:09:22,399
steeping assuming people are herbalists

2810
02:09:20,319 --> 02:09:25,639
and understand what it takes to make you

2811
02:09:22,399 --> 02:09:29,118
know compounds yeah less

2812
02:09:25,639 --> 02:09:32,719
temperature and uh but anyway bark even

2813
02:09:29,118 --> 02:09:38,399
from other trees is powerful Larch you

2814
02:09:32,719 --> 02:09:38,399
know um anyway yeah healing from The

2815
02:09:49,118 --> 02:09:55,880
Forest of the of the too is really it's

2816
02:09:53,198 --> 02:09:59,558
pretty amazing they're really different

2817
02:09:55,880 --> 02:10:02,400
in flavor and I think that the Birch

2818
02:09:59,559 --> 02:10:05,719
water I think is even sweeter than the

2819
02:10:02,399 --> 02:10:09,118
sugar maple water somehow it has some

2820
02:10:05,719 --> 02:10:12,319
kind of a resonant like maybe it's like

2821
02:10:09,118 --> 02:10:14,039
even resinous sweetness that sticks with

2822
02:10:12,319 --> 02:10:17,078
you that where the sugar maple doesn't

2823
02:10:14,039 --> 02:10:19,880
have that but it is true that when you

2824
02:10:17,078 --> 02:10:22,039
do any type of tests on the

2825
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:24,880
triglycerides or all of the different

2826
02:10:22,039 --> 02:10:27,599
polyphenols and things in mushrooms we

2827
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:30,880
find that the ones growing on Birches

2828
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:33,639
have much higher medicinal compounds

2829
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:35,760
than the ones growing on other trees now

2830
02:10:33,639 --> 02:10:38,920
when you're starting to talk about old

2831
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:42,639
growth now you know we can't really

2832
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:44,719
necessarily do those comparisons because

2833
02:10:42,639 --> 02:10:47,078
old growth you know has

2834
02:10:44,719 --> 02:10:49,399
exponential um healing properties but

2835
02:10:47,078 --> 02:10:52,039
Birch really is a winner and and it's

2836
02:10:49,399 --> 02:10:54,519
one that's you know like in forestry

2837
02:10:52,039 --> 02:10:56,078
they they don't they don't utilize they

2838
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:58,679
don't take care of it they think it's a

2839
02:10:56,078 --> 02:11:01,399
weed they cut it down burn it off it's

2840
02:10:58,679 --> 02:11:04,158
lame so there's a lot of areas you know

2841
02:11:01,399 --> 02:11:06,960
in BC and in and in Canada and I know

2842
02:11:04,158 --> 02:11:10,839
definitely in the Eastern us where the

2843
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:13,840
Boreal forest and you know the the fur

2844
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:17,440
Forest hits the Birch Forest a lot of

2845
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:19,719
that area is just being degraded because

2846
02:11:17,439 --> 02:11:22,719
there's not a lot of value for the Birch

2847
02:11:19,719 --> 02:11:24,639
but if we started putting value in the

2848
02:11:22,719 --> 02:11:26,439
mushrooms and we started putting value

2849
02:11:24,639 --> 02:11:30,118
in the medicinal compounds of what's in

2850
02:11:26,439 --> 02:11:32,598
the forest it would even outweigh

2851
02:11:30,118 --> 02:11:36,558
monetarily what they're getting per

2852
02:11:32,599 --> 02:11:38,319
board feet of you know lumber sales but

2853
02:11:36,559 --> 02:11:40,239
I just think that it's just not as

2854
02:11:38,319 --> 02:11:43,198
creative I'm not saying that there's no

2855
02:11:40,238 --> 02:11:46,279
use for lumber there definitely is it's

2856
02:11:43,198 --> 02:11:49,399
just to see the forest as something more

2857
02:11:46,279 --> 02:11:51,840
than just board feet we really could use

2858
02:11:49,399 --> 02:11:55,279
more of that creativity as a human

2859
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:56,719
species to you know upgrade us um and

2860
02:11:55,279 --> 02:11:59,118
our health and well-being there's so

2861
02:11:56,719 --> 02:12:01,679
much intelligence in the forest there

2862
02:11:59,118 --> 02:12:04,839
and also there's little lumps in The

2863
02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:08,480
Balsam fur and in the spruce in the in

2864
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:11,319
the um bark and you can push out the the

2865
02:12:08,479 --> 02:12:15,198
sap out of the bark and collect all the

2866
02:12:11,319 --> 02:12:18,039
sap and that sap and that pitch is super

2867
02:12:15,198 --> 02:12:20,919
useful and topicals warming it up using

2868
02:12:18,039 --> 02:12:23,479
that in your um topicals and combining

2869
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:25,960
that with cannabis is really good also

2870
02:12:23,479 --> 02:12:29,558
in the springtime the the trees

2871
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:31,960
pollinate and they um sporulate and and

2872
02:12:29,559 --> 02:12:34,960
you'll see a whole entire Forest just

2873
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:37,800
pollinating so Gathering pine pollen

2874
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:41,840
from the flowers and the springtime is

2875
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:44,760
incredibly useful to uh uh you know just

2876
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:47,319
human health in general so big up this

2877
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:51,559
is a red belted

2878
02:12:47,319 --> 02:12:51,558
conk the beauty

2879
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:10,000
so I was going to bring up that is kind

2880
02:13:07,439 --> 02:13:11,319
of interesting here watching the the sun

2881
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:14,880
grown fullterm

2882
02:13:11,319 --> 02:13:16,799
uh plants that are matching the colors

2883
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:19,760
uh they're obviously all poly you know

2884
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:22,199
hybrids at this point but you can see a

2885
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:25,400
definite line between the later sativa

2886
02:13:22,198 --> 02:13:28,558
more green with no purple even into Cold

2887
02:13:25,399 --> 02:13:31,158
versus some of the really dark violet

2888
02:13:28,559 --> 02:13:33,920
red pink it's actually funny the the

2889
02:13:31,158 --> 02:13:36,598
drop leaves and the lower set leaves go

2890
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:39,319
yellow and then kind of Fade up into an

2891
02:13:36,599 --> 02:13:41,840
orangey red into Violet so it actually

2892
02:13:39,319 --> 02:13:44,479
matches the tree line in the fall here

2893
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:46,719
for the foliage so it's kind of bringing

2894
02:13:44,479 --> 02:13:49,198
up some interesting thoughts about the

2895
02:13:46,719 --> 02:13:52,359
sugar conversion that fits into the

2896
02:13:49,198 --> 02:13:55,638
Maple and the birch and and how this

2897
02:13:52,359 --> 02:13:57,279
Terre this region of the north all the

2898
02:13:55,639 --> 02:13:59,078
way across the board where you guys are

2899
02:13:57,279 --> 02:14:01,840
up there talking about it over to here

2900
02:13:59,078 --> 02:14:05,279
in Maine which is Big Maple Country here

2901
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:08,480
to Vermont up into Quebec and I just

2902
02:14:05,279 --> 02:14:11,279
kind of watching the sugars FL flow high

2903
02:14:08,479 --> 02:14:15,439
and then dip low in this really big

2904
02:14:11,279 --> 02:14:17,479
binary Spike you know and dip and it

2905
02:14:15,439 --> 02:14:20,638
seems to have a lot to do with pushing

2906
02:14:17,479 --> 02:14:23,558
out smell bouquet for tpping loud loud

2907
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:25,960
in the early morning when the Dew comes

2908
02:14:23,559 --> 02:14:27,800
in and it's the you know the DW points

2909
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:30,239
hit and it's it's just popping off its

2910
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:32,719
smell when it goes to bed at night even

2911
02:14:30,238 --> 02:14:36,000
seems like there's resin cluster and

2912
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:38,399
shine with swelling that happens into

2913
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:41,078
those plants those more colorful plants

2914
02:14:38,399 --> 02:14:42,479
this time of year so I just want to kind

2915
02:14:41,078 --> 02:14:44,599
of throw that out there as an

2916
02:14:42,479 --> 02:14:46,279
interesting aspect where again

2917
02:14:44,599 --> 02:14:50,000
interesting in different regions where

2918
02:14:46,279 --> 02:14:51,519
the different strains can shine and such

2919
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:53,599
and I'm definitely seeing better results

2920
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:56,280
with the indicia based poly with some of

2921
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:59,679
the tpine profiles we talked about from

2922
02:14:56,279 --> 02:15:01,359
lemon um now over to Cherry showing even

2923
02:14:59,679 --> 02:15:03,639
the Cherry brought in some cherry Cam

2924
02:15:01,359 --> 02:15:05,920
that has amazing resistance factor out

2925
02:15:03,639 --> 02:15:08,319
here even tested some of the original

2926
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:11,039
Cherry cam sister to the brother to let

2927
02:15:08,319 --> 02:15:13,399
go long and now and even through storm

2928
02:15:11,039 --> 02:15:16,319
everything I haven't seen any vrtis it

2929
02:15:13,399 --> 02:15:18,558
had a septoria hit late but not one

2930
02:15:16,319 --> 02:15:21,479
piece of betrus yet on the on the whole

2931
02:15:18,559 --> 02:15:23,800
row so seeing some interesting

2932
02:15:21,479 --> 02:15:25,638
stuff and then some you know talk about

2933
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:28,199
this Northern Region for the sugar

2934
02:15:25,639 --> 02:15:31,719
spiking and dipping into this ripening

2935
02:15:28,198 --> 02:15:34,158
period just wanted to throw that out

2936
02:15:31,719 --> 02:15:36,239
there I think once you build up the

2937
02:15:34,158 --> 02:15:38,839
intelligence in your soil and you start

2938
02:15:36,238 --> 02:15:41,039
using that leaf from the forest and a

2939
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:43,920
lot of those inputs from the forest in

2940
02:15:41,039 --> 02:15:46,198
your beds and then you start you know

2941
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:48,440
doing more and more Mulch and the aisles

2942
02:15:46,198 --> 02:15:50,638
in between your beds sort of connecting

2943
02:15:48,439 --> 02:15:52,919
the forest and you and in the end you do

2944
02:15:50,639 --> 02:15:55,840
start getting that underground

2945
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:58,078
connection going on where they will

2946
02:15:55,840 --> 02:16:00,520
communicate with each other they'll even

2947
02:15:58,078 --> 02:16:03,759
probably you know start

2948
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:05,760
transferring sugars and and and even

2949
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:07,079
trace minerals you know back and forth

2950
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:10,159
to each other that's why I think it's

2951
02:16:07,078 --> 02:16:12,759
really valuable you know mulching into

2952
02:16:10,158 --> 02:16:14,638
the transitions out of your garden so

2953
02:16:12,760 --> 02:16:17,840
that you can get you know outside let's

2954
02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:21,199
say outside input into your garden but

2955
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:23,400
the more indigenous layering and buildup

2956
02:16:21,198 --> 02:16:26,319
you're doing the more you're building up

2957
02:16:23,399 --> 02:16:29,000
that soil rizosphere

2958
02:16:26,319 --> 02:16:31,519
intelligence uh and then the atmosphere

2959
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:34,280
and risos spere you know combination

2960
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:37,200
through the gashes exchanges uh they

2961
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:39,079
they start uh building the the cells and

2962
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:40,120
everything to make that happen so yeah I

2963
02:16:39,079 --> 02:16:42,638
mean that's that's what you start

2964
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:44,719
getting when you build your land over

2965
02:16:42,638 --> 02:16:48,159
and over like 10 years from now your

2966
02:16:44,718 --> 02:16:49,959
land will be even next year it'll be

2967
02:16:48,159 --> 02:16:51,879
more but you know what I mean is we're

2968
02:16:49,959 --> 02:16:54,678
we're here for six

2969
02:16:51,879 --> 02:16:57,478
Summers now so it's been 16 years of

2970
02:16:54,679 --> 02:16:59,840
building building the soil and it was

2971
02:16:57,478 --> 02:17:02,318
actually you really crazy this year each

2972
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:04,840
year that we're building our soil more

2973
02:17:02,318 --> 02:17:08,239
and more uh you know we haven't really

2974
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:11,120
been utilizing teas anymore we only

2975
02:17:08,239 --> 02:17:14,439
utilize teas on sort of our new beds or

2976
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:17,519
on fruit trees because it's just o over

2977
02:17:14,439 --> 02:17:20,000
nutrify and the more that our beds

2978
02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:23,318
become mature we're just not really

2979
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:26,558
seeing any pathogens you know we're

2980
02:17:23,318 --> 02:17:28,638
still seeing the aphid that bong aphid

2981
02:17:26,558 --> 02:17:30,759
it's around and about but with all of

2982
02:17:28,638 --> 02:17:32,839
the poly culture that we have around by

2983
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:34,840
the time the plants ready to harvest

2984
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:37,280
there's not really any aphids on at all

2985
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:40,519
maybe little bits here and there we saw

2986
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:44,559
it maybe in our later season but like

2987
02:17:40,519 --> 02:17:49,398
it's amazing if you are seeing your farm

2988
02:17:44,558 --> 02:17:52,518
or whatever your Gardens as you know a

2989
02:17:49,398 --> 02:17:54,358
whole system not just when you walk into

2990
02:17:52,519 --> 02:17:56,159
your garden that your garden is the

2991
02:17:54,359 --> 02:17:59,679
system but that your garden is the

2992
02:17:56,159 --> 02:18:01,879
center part or part of a whole system

2993
02:17:59,679 --> 02:18:03,879
then the whole system helps take care of

2994
02:18:01,879 --> 02:18:07,039
the garden and the plants and that's

2995
02:18:03,879 --> 02:18:10,799
really awesome to definitely know that

2996
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:15,040
the endic system of the ganja plants are

2997
02:18:10,799 --> 02:18:17,358
just so full that the allocation of any

2998
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:20,240
type of pathogen in there is almost like

2999
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:22,239
nil and that's been pretty amazing to

3000
02:18:20,239 --> 02:18:25,239
see and that's definitely by bringing

3001
02:18:22,239 --> 02:18:28,439
more and more intelligence of the Zone

3002
02:18:25,239 --> 02:18:30,679
around us into our Gardens rather than

3003
02:18:28,439 --> 02:18:32,800
trying to create something different in

3004
02:18:30,679 --> 02:18:35,439
our Gardens let's just see what's around

3005
02:18:32,799 --> 02:18:37,119
us and that's why every Garden should be

3006
02:18:35,439 --> 02:18:40,200
different and we shouldn't all talk

3007
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:43,960
about the same exact you know additions

3008
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:46,319
and techniques and and yeah but we do

3009
02:18:43,959 --> 02:18:49,799
are what we are starting to lean towards

3010
02:18:46,318 --> 02:18:53,478
is making big ferments right now in the

3011
02:18:49,799 --> 02:18:57,239
fall as we har everything and then tea

3012
02:18:53,478 --> 02:18:58,840
in the mulch for the winter so then we

3013
02:18:57,239 --> 02:19:02,478
have this sort

3014
02:18:58,840 --> 02:19:04,960
recharge of nutrients and green and

3015
02:19:02,478 --> 02:19:07,558
sugars from the leaves and sugars from

3016
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:09,839
you know the diey off and also the most

3017
02:19:07,558 --> 02:19:11,718
trace minerals and the most minerals

3018
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:15,040
that the plant or the seeds and

3019
02:19:11,718 --> 02:19:17,438
everything have in it you can make a big

3020
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:19,479
fermentation which we have right now and

3021
02:19:17,439 --> 02:19:23,398
then after we mulch everything we just

3022
02:19:19,478 --> 02:19:26,718
do a really big tea over it and then the

3023
02:19:23,398 --> 02:19:29,599
snow comes or if we have some green

3024
02:19:26,718 --> 02:19:33,279
houses that we keep covered for the

3025
02:19:29,599 --> 02:19:35,398
winter then we use uh sprinklers inside

3026
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:37,159
of the greenhouse to just keep it really

3027
02:19:35,398 --> 02:19:38,718
wet on the inside of the greenhouse so

3028
02:19:37,159 --> 02:19:41,920
that the inside of the greenhouse can

3029
02:19:38,718 --> 02:19:46,398
sort of have that cleanliness of water

3030
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:46,398
happening in it and break down

3031
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:59,720
Wade did you have a hash event last

3032
02:19:54,680 --> 02:20:02,920
weekend that you were involved in uh yes

3033
02:19:59,719 --> 02:20:06,358
um and uh hello everyone uh yeah had a

3034
02:20:02,920 --> 02:20:09,960
really wonderful uh Gathering of about

3035
02:20:06,359 --> 02:20:11,239
12 folks I think is how many folks came

3036
02:20:09,959 --> 02:20:13,879
and

3037
02:20:11,239 --> 02:20:15,359
um yeah we got up to all kinds of fun

3038
02:20:13,879 --> 02:20:19,559
things one of the things that I wanted

3039
02:20:15,359 --> 02:20:21,960
to show you all is a a piece of uh dry

3040
02:20:19,559 --> 02:20:22,719
sift one of our local producers is going

3041
02:20:21,959 --> 02:20:25,879
to

3042
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:30,039
be selling uh old

3043
02:20:25,879 --> 02:20:32,398
school uh dry sift solvent list etc etc

3044
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:36,160
etc anyway he's very proud of it and

3045
02:20:32,398 --> 02:20:37,559
he's old school enough that uh the uh

3046
02:20:36,159 --> 02:20:40,079
his marketing thing is going to be a

3047
02:20:37,559 --> 02:20:43,000
little gold leaf lightning bolt on the

3048
02:20:40,079 --> 02:20:46,079
pieces that come out and I kind of like

3049
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:49,120
that because if you um if you were

3050
02:20:46,079 --> 02:20:52,879
smoking hash back in the 70s and had

3051
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:56,920
access to good Afghani or Pakistani or

3052
02:20:52,879 --> 02:20:59,639
it often came with a seal on on the uh

3053
02:20:56,920 --> 02:21:02,239
plaque you'd get uh typically Preston

3054
02:20:59,639 --> 02:21:05,639
gold leaf and whatnot anyway he's of

3055
02:21:02,239 --> 02:21:08,079
that era as am I and I we got into a

3056
02:21:05,639 --> 02:21:09,398
fascinating conversation about hash and

3057
02:21:08,079 --> 02:21:13,280
I raised my hand earlier because I

3058
02:21:09,398 --> 02:21:17,039
wanted to ask y all's opinion about this

3059
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:17,920
um the hash that came back in the 60s

3060
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:21,880
and

3061
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:25,040
70s um came from Fields where male and

3062
02:21:21,879 --> 02:21:26,799
female plants grew together so all the

3063
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:30,840
females were

3064
02:21:26,799 --> 02:21:33,279
fertilized and it's my experience with

3065
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:36,239
analytical testing when you look at the

3066
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:38,479
conoid profiles in cannabis that is

3067
02:21:36,239 --> 02:21:40,079
seeded uh it's significantly different

3068
02:21:38,478 --> 02:21:41,478
than that same plant might have made

3069
02:21:40,079 --> 02:21:45,719
wori

3070
02:21:41,478 --> 02:21:48,159
sensia uh but I really loved the hash

3071
02:21:45,719 --> 02:21:51,079
that was coming into this country back

3072
02:21:48,159 --> 02:21:52,318
in the 60s and 70s and so I'm I'm I'm

3073
02:21:51,079 --> 02:21:54,840
really wanting to throw open a

3074
02:21:52,318 --> 02:21:59,279
conversation and hear some expert

3075
02:21:54,840 --> 02:22:01,280
opinions on the fact that most of the

3076
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:04,960
hash that's available in the legal

3077
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:08,760
cannabis market today is made from CIA

3078
02:22:04,959 --> 02:22:10,919
it's not made from fertilized females

3079
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:14,559
and so it's different hash than what was

3080
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:18,040
happening back then and certainly we

3081
02:22:14,559 --> 02:22:20,318
have higher uh canono content in the in

3082
02:22:18,040 --> 02:22:21,280
the hashish that we're enjoying these

3083
02:22:20,318 --> 02:22:23,920
days

3084
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:28,280
but I just wondered uh what the thinking

3085
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:29,960
from a panel of informed folk is on that

3086
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:32,640
uh the differences between the hash we

3087
02:22:29,959 --> 02:22:35,559
have today that comes you know really

3088
02:22:32,639 --> 02:22:36,599
beautiful hash yeah last weekend I got

3089
02:22:35,559 --> 02:22:38,680
very

3090
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:41,920
stuned but

3091
02:22:38,680 --> 02:22:46,200
um but uh and I'm very St today as well

3092
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:47,879
thank you um yeah I'm I'm just wondering

3093
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:49,960
what's what's the opinion here amongst

3094
02:22:47,879 --> 02:22:53,159
This Crew what is you know there's a

3095
02:22:49,959 --> 02:22:54,358
real difference there and where where

3096
02:22:53,159 --> 02:22:56,398
where do we want to take that

3097
02:22:54,359 --> 02:22:57,920
conversation that's all I got thank you

3098
02:22:56,398 --> 02:23:00,559
for the moment I'm sure I'll have more

3099
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:03,639
to say you know I don't have a lot of

3100
02:23:00,559 --> 02:23:06,920
experience smoking hash that was made

3101
02:23:03,639 --> 02:23:10,680
from male and female plants but what I

3102
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:14,639
do have is in the last year or two when

3103
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:16,639
I came up with this hash hits product uh

3104
02:23:14,639 --> 02:23:18,478
you know I'm so I'm like Sam I'm just so

3105
02:23:16,639 --> 02:23:20,920
used to like taking rocket ships to the

3106
02:23:18,478 --> 02:23:24,478
moon like just pu puffing this pure hash

3107
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:26,239
it's 60 to 80% it's high tping contents

3108
02:23:24,478 --> 02:23:28,199
it's just this intense blast and that's

3109
02:23:26,239 --> 02:23:30,719
what I've loved and I've been almost

3110
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:32,760
blindingly loving it without really

3111
02:23:30,719 --> 02:23:35,679
paying attention I I don't smoke joints

3112
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:37,600
I don't smoke weed so what I found was

3113
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:39,398
when I started the the hash hits which

3114
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:41,318
was really you know the basis of the

3115
02:23:39,398 --> 02:23:43,799
idea was to create a product that would

3116
02:23:41,318 --> 02:23:45,799
build a bridge for people who had no

3117
02:23:43,799 --> 02:23:47,438
paraphilia other than a lighter they

3118
02:23:45,799 --> 02:23:49,599
don't even roll joints they buy

3119
02:23:47,439 --> 02:23:51,279
pre-rolled joints and I wanted to build

3120
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:53,760
a product that allow owed people to kind

3121
02:23:51,279 --> 02:23:55,840
of have a bridge over to hash and

3122
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:58,159
extracts and you know it's just a little

3123
02:23:55,840 --> 02:24:00,200
tube a little paper tube it's got a

3124
02:23:58,159 --> 02:24:02,680
little metal bowl with tiny little holes

3125
02:24:00,200 --> 02:24:04,600
in it that we pack a02 of a gram of hash

3126
02:24:02,680 --> 02:24:05,840
into and of course right away I knew I

3127
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:07,399
wasn't going to be able to pack full

3128
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:09,239
melt hash into this thing because the

3129
02:24:07,398 --> 02:24:11,799
hash would melt and plug these holes and

3130
02:24:09,239 --> 02:24:14,039
you'd suck it into the tube so I had and

3131
02:24:11,799 --> 02:24:17,278
and as well turning someone on who only

3132
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:19,240
smokes pre-rolled joints uh to Hash the

3133
02:24:17,279 --> 02:24:21,279
best product is not the thing to turn

3134
02:24:19,239 --> 02:24:22,760
them on to it's just it's too potent and

3135
02:24:21,279 --> 02:24:24,000
it it's not going to be the experience

3136
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:27,079
that they're looking for so I kind of

3137
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:28,799
had to force my ego aside and smoke you

3138
02:24:27,079 --> 02:24:31,439
know what most people on this panel

3139
02:24:28,799 --> 02:24:32,759
would call mediocre hash but what I

3140
02:24:31,439 --> 02:24:34,920
found was and I've learned this from

3141
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:36,600
smoking so many different you know

3142
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:38,478
people ask me all the time do you prefer

3143
02:24:36,600 --> 02:24:40,439
the torch and nailed do you prefer the

3144
02:24:38,478 --> 02:24:42,079
electric nail do you like the puff Co do

3145
02:24:40,439 --> 02:24:44,159
you like all these different things and

3146
02:24:42,079 --> 02:24:46,200
or vape pens or any of these things and

3147
02:24:44,159 --> 02:24:48,119
what I found is as a cannabis lover that

3148
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:50,800
there's a place for me to love those

3149
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:54,640
things at different times in different

3150
02:24:50,799 --> 02:24:56,478
places and so um it what I had to do

3151
02:24:54,639 --> 02:24:58,639
with these hash hits was I had to start

3152
02:24:56,478 --> 02:25:01,679
r&amp; ding them and smoking them and I had

3153
02:24:58,639 --> 02:25:03,159
a smoke hash of of a non-melt quality in

3154
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:05,279
you know in a couple of decades or

3155
02:25:03,159 --> 02:25:07,520
whatever and so here I am now going for

3156
02:25:05,279 --> 02:25:09,399
an electric skateboard and uh pulling

3157
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:11,319
out a hash hit and and hitting and

3158
02:25:09,398 --> 02:25:14,079
burning as well I hadn't burned in like

3159
02:25:11,318 --> 02:25:16,318
15 years or something so what I did

3160
02:25:14,079 --> 02:25:19,159
notice when I was able to put aside my

3161
02:25:16,318 --> 02:25:21,119
judgments on oh it's not melting and it

3162
02:25:19,159 --> 02:25:22,959
tastes a little burnt and I don't like

3163
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:25,960
it as much as I like this and I just put

3164
02:25:22,959 --> 02:25:29,799
all that aside what I did find was that

3165
02:25:25,959 --> 02:25:31,519
I Lov the lack of intensity in the high

3166
02:25:29,799 --> 02:25:33,840
it was almost like if it was a food

3167
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:36,319
metaphor all I was doing was eating to

3168
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:38,760
be stuffed and for the first time now I

3169
02:25:36,318 --> 02:25:41,359
was just eating a small amount just to

3170
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:43,239
be like not completely satiated but like

3171
02:25:41,359 --> 02:25:46,159
oh that was a nice little treat like I'm

3172
02:25:43,239 --> 02:25:48,719
not you know I'm I'm still present I'm

3173
02:25:46,159 --> 02:25:50,439
not completely blasted out of my skull

3174
02:25:48,719 --> 02:25:53,438
uh not that getting blasted out of my

3175
02:25:50,439 --> 02:25:55,120
skull you know put limitations on me in

3176
02:25:53,439 --> 02:25:56,720
any way I'm a bit of an anomaly like

3177
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:59,000
that as probably many of the people on

3178
02:25:56,719 --> 02:26:02,239
the panel are but what I found was I

3179
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:04,159
really enjoyed the the lack of intensity

3180
02:26:02,239 --> 02:26:06,920
of the high that I also had an

3181
02:26:04,159 --> 02:26:10,239
appreciation for this for these subtle

3182
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:12,040
nuances of the hash that I was now

3183
02:26:10,239 --> 02:26:13,680
experiencing that I knew that this is

3184
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:15,040
what these people that I built this

3185
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:16,720
product for were going to be

3186
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:18,760
experiencing they were going to be able

3187
02:26:16,719 --> 02:26:21,599
to instead of smoke a joint with paper

3188
02:26:18,760 --> 02:26:24,239
and glue and and and matter I could get

3189
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:26,920
them over to hash and they could smoke

3190
02:26:24,239 --> 02:26:28,559
this this hash hit and have a nice

3191
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:31,159
experience without the paper and the

3192
02:26:28,559 --> 02:26:33,478
glue and the and the uh and the Cannabis

3193
02:26:31,159 --> 02:26:35,000
but have that nice experience that's not

3194
02:26:33,478 --> 02:26:36,438
that so many people have told me over

3195
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:38,478
the years when I've given them a dab

3196
02:26:36,439 --> 02:26:41,000
they're just like I don't like that it's

3197
02:26:38,478 --> 02:26:43,599
way too intense I'm blasted out of my

3198
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:45,920
skull uh I just you know there's certain

3199
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:47,640
times that maybe that's not what you

3200
02:26:45,920 --> 02:26:49,840
want and there's lots of times where

3201
02:26:47,639 --> 02:26:51,478
maybe that is what you want so it was

3202
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:54,200
interesting from my perspective to

3203
02:26:51,478 --> 02:26:56,679
remove myself from the bubble man way of

3204
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:58,960
thinking and and smoke something that

3205
02:26:56,680 --> 02:27:01,279
I've almost been judging harshly for the

3206
02:26:58,959 --> 02:27:03,278
last 20 years and I got to stay Wade

3207
02:27:01,279 --> 02:27:04,720
like uh there were times that I I quite

3208
02:27:03,279 --> 02:27:07,040
enjoyed it you know when I'm out on my

3209
02:27:04,719 --> 02:27:09,478
electric skateboard particularly with my

3210
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:11,920
son I don't want to pull out my rig and

3211
02:27:09,478 --> 02:27:13,599
all my gear and have a dab and then put

3212
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:15,318
it all away and put it in the backpack

3213
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:17,960
and clean the Banger and do all of this

3214
02:27:15,318 --> 02:27:19,680
stuff but to just pull a tube out and

3215
02:27:17,959 --> 02:27:22,159
hit it like two or three times and then

3216
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:25,639
put it back in the case and shut it up

3217
02:27:22,159 --> 02:27:26,959
it really was a lovely subtle nuance and

3218
02:27:25,639 --> 02:27:29,159
and I don't know if it's because I'm

3219
02:27:26,959 --> 02:27:31,478
getting older or if I was just able to

3220
02:27:29,159 --> 02:27:34,439
put my ego aside for a short period of

3221
02:27:31,478 --> 02:27:36,679
time where you know we have to remember

3222
02:27:34,439 --> 02:27:38,840
there's so many different enjoyable

3223
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:40,720
aspects of cannabis and one of the

3224
02:27:38,840 --> 02:27:42,960
things from my perspective that I've

3225
02:27:40,719 --> 02:27:45,239
always been trapped in is that I've you

3226
02:27:42,959 --> 02:27:47,879
know not anymore as much but for a long

3227
02:27:45,239 --> 02:27:49,639
time I thought that you know the best

3228
02:27:47,879 --> 02:27:51,559
was this and that everyone needed the

3229
02:27:49,639 --> 02:27:54,199
best and everyone should have the best

3230
02:27:51,559 --> 02:27:57,159
but um what I'm learning is is the best

3231
02:27:54,200 --> 02:28:00,000
is is what's best for you and uh we

3232
02:27:57,159 --> 02:28:02,119
should enjoy cannabis in all her glory

3233
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:04,079
uh whether it's smoking a pin or joint

3234
02:28:02,120 --> 02:28:06,040
or whether it's smoking some some dry

3235
02:28:04,079 --> 02:28:08,239
sifted single screen hash or whether

3236
02:28:06,040 --> 02:28:10,960
it's smoking some six-star full mail

3237
02:28:08,239 --> 02:28:12,840
cash so that's my piece that's what I

3238
02:28:10,959 --> 02:28:15,478
have to say and anyone else that wants

3239
02:28:12,840 --> 02:28:18,079
to answer or Wade wants to reply now

3240
02:28:15,478 --> 02:28:21,398
it's your time if if you if it don't

3241
02:28:18,079 --> 02:28:24,079
bubble it ain't worth the trouble

3242
02:28:21,398 --> 02:28:27,119
well early I remember have we didn't

3243
02:28:24,079 --> 02:28:29,920
have that in the uh in the early 90s or

3244
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:33,560
late 80s so I mean I had access to at

3245
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:36,760
times to quote unquote Afghani hashish

3246
02:28:33,559 --> 02:28:40,239
that was black to Brown that did have a

3247
02:28:36,760 --> 02:28:43,398
gold seal on it but it is definitely I

3248
02:28:40,239 --> 02:28:45,239
think Mojave stated as well that you

3249
02:28:43,398 --> 02:28:48,079
know the the hash that we're seeing

3250
02:28:45,239 --> 02:28:50,920
today is you know is made from all of

3251
02:28:48,079 --> 02:28:53,840
these newer genetics as well as opposed

3252
02:28:50,920 --> 02:28:57,398
to you know those were old older land

3253
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:59,760
races as well that we were ingesting and

3254
02:28:57,398 --> 02:29:02,519
I agree they were both males and females

3255
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:07,120
they were pollinated uh plants so I did

3256
02:29:02,520 --> 02:29:08,920
not get sometimes as High um smoking

3257
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:11,000
that hash I'd always sprinkle it or

3258
02:29:08,920 --> 02:29:13,719
break it down and put it on top of

3259
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:16,359
something um you know to just kind of

3260
02:29:13,719 --> 02:29:18,840
add to it because of the nuances that it

3261
02:29:16,359 --> 02:29:21,520
gave it gave a depth that none of the

3262
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:24,439
Cannabis that you had access to had

3263
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:27,040
because I think of the you know the CBN

3264
02:29:24,439 --> 02:29:29,840
and all of that that are you know

3265
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:32,600
inherent as depending on how it was sift

3266
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:35,079
but also it had a lot of impurities as

3267
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:38,720
well they were packing it with you know

3268
02:29:35,079 --> 02:29:41,520
wax lots of vegetable matter no seeds or

3269
02:29:38,719 --> 02:29:43,079
anything like that but the quality you

3270
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:44,840
can I mean it's like when you go to

3271
02:29:43,079 --> 02:29:46,639
Amsterdam okay right you go to Amsterdam

3272
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:50,120
for the hash you don't go for the flower

3273
02:29:46,639 --> 02:29:53,159
right so go sit there and you smoke a a

3274
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:56,359
Temple ball there in Amsterdam now take

3275
02:29:53,159 --> 02:29:59,799
that same Temple ball and go vaporize

3276
02:29:56,359 --> 02:30:02,680
it it tastes like hand it tastes like

3277
02:29:59,799 --> 02:30:04,478
the essential oils it tastes like all of

3278
02:30:02,680 --> 02:30:08,760
that unfortunately that comes from the

3279
02:30:04,478 --> 02:30:11,159
hand rolling etc etc so I think also by

3280
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:14,000
having things like bubble man's bags

3281
02:30:11,159 --> 02:30:15,439
sing technology has better because

3282
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:17,879
remember they used to used to use right

3283
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:20,760
you used to use particularly just one

3284
02:30:17,879 --> 02:30:23,920
seeve right from the books that I from

3285
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:27,318
the the old book hashish Etc they all

3286
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:30,680
tend to show just one particular screen

3287
02:30:27,318 --> 02:30:33,398
as opposed to a series of screens until

3288
02:30:30,680 --> 02:30:36,960
you know later but uh I sent this invite

3289
02:30:33,398 --> 02:30:40,199
specifically to Mojave because movei uh

3290
02:30:36,959 --> 02:30:43,599
is also a master of the older hashish

3291
02:30:40,200 --> 02:30:47,079
and understanding so move I'm going to

3292
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:50,760
defer and tap head to you because uh

3293
02:30:47,079 --> 02:30:54,159
love you love you too man Moab hey there

3294
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:56,520
D hey there Sam um yeah I I just came in

3295
02:30:54,159 --> 02:30:59,159
at just the right time man I love this

3296
02:30:56,520 --> 02:31:03,800
conversation about traditional hash I

3297
02:30:59,159 --> 02:31:05,600
think it's really important um you know

3298
02:31:03,799 --> 02:31:07,438
uh like Marcus you're you're everyone

3299
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:09,760
like the average guy's just got a

3300
02:31:07,439 --> 02:31:12,639
lighter that that idea I just love the

3301
02:31:09,760 --> 02:31:14,680
concept of like let's really think about

3302
02:31:12,639 --> 02:31:16,799
who the consumer is because I think

3303
02:31:14,680 --> 02:31:20,239
we've really driven the market and the

3304
02:31:16,799 --> 02:31:23,438
industry so much because we're so deep

3305
02:31:20,239 --> 02:31:25,159
into the science and the tech and but

3306
02:31:23,439 --> 02:31:27,520
the average consumer just really needs

3307
02:31:25,159 --> 02:31:30,520
us to kind of like provide them with

3308
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:32,640
what they need in the simplest and most

3309
02:31:30,520 --> 02:31:35,359
available form and traditional hashish

3310
02:31:32,639 --> 02:31:38,398
kind of really nailed that you know I

3311
02:31:35,359 --> 02:31:41,840
mean they really kind of came to this

3312
02:31:38,398 --> 02:31:44,799
like Middle Ground of potency and

3313
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:47,719
portability and stability and yeah there

3314
02:31:44,799 --> 02:31:50,318
it is that's it man that's perfect give

3315
02:31:47,719 --> 02:31:52,000
the people what they need

3316
02:31:50,318 --> 02:31:53,559
yeah but the other thing that I think is

3317
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:55,799
really interesting that I that

3318
02:31:53,559 --> 02:31:57,439
constantly can I ask Marcus question

3319
02:31:55,799 --> 02:31:59,879
quick yeah please how much is that

3320
02:31:57,439 --> 02:32:03,639
retail for

3321
02:31:59,879 --> 02:32:06,559
Marcus this is uh the five tubes are a

3322
02:32:03,639 --> 02:32:10,559
gram and it retails for around like 24

3323
02:32:06,559 --> 02:32:13,000
bucks 25 bucks Canadian okay okay cool

3324
02:32:10,559 --> 02:32:15,039
thank you I'm sorry Mojave no no problem

3325
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:17,079
man um but the other thing I just one

3326
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:20,240
thing I'd love to hear from from the

3327
02:32:17,079 --> 02:32:22,879
group here that constantly fascinates me

3328
02:32:20,239 --> 02:32:26,920
about traditional hashish

3329
02:32:22,879 --> 02:32:31,799
is the somewhat intentional degradation

3330
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:35,120
of the whole plant profile before it was

3331
02:32:31,799 --> 02:32:37,879
pressed and the aging process and the

3332
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:39,160
drying in the Sun and and not just with

3333
02:32:37,879 --> 02:32:42,358
hashish with a lot of different

3334
02:32:39,159 --> 02:32:44,439
traditional cannabis um cultures with

3335
02:32:42,359 --> 02:32:46,159
you know maloi corn cobs and all these

3336
02:32:44,439 --> 02:32:48,600
things people did to like take this

3337
02:32:46,159 --> 02:32:51,000
beautiful perfect plant that we're so

3338
02:32:48,600 --> 02:32:55,680
desperately trying to like achieve this

3339
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:58,840
whole plant full aromatic profile and

3340
02:32:55,680 --> 02:33:01,000
destroyed a lot of that because the way

3341
02:32:58,840 --> 02:33:03,799
they ingested cannabis was different for

3342
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:05,079
one they ingested large amounts you know

3343
02:33:03,799 --> 02:33:07,840
like when you think about hashish

3344
02:33:05,079 --> 02:33:10,200
cultures like Afghanistan I mean Sam

3345
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:13,239
obviously knows this better than anybody

3346
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:16,399
um they filled that Hubbly Bubbly with

3347
02:33:13,239 --> 02:33:20,520
what an ounce a half an

3348
02:33:16,398 --> 02:33:24,840
ounce anywhere from a few a few grams to

3349
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:28,279
uh really yeah like an ounce uh when

3350
02:33:24,840 --> 02:33:31,880
when we used to do it uh here in

3351
02:33:28,279 --> 02:33:35,479
Amsterdam we we would put in two or

3352
02:33:31,879 --> 02:33:38,639
three grams sprinkled on top of the

3353
02:33:35,478 --> 02:33:41,199
glowing coals and just keep doing that

3354
02:33:38,639 --> 02:33:44,680
we could do it for like an hour or two

3355
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:47,640
and uh yeah just keep making bong hit

3356
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:51,720
those two or three grams was for each

3357
02:33:47,639 --> 02:33:51,719
person to make

3358
02:34:04,760 --> 02:34:08,279
they could do it better than me

3359
02:34:08,559 --> 02:34:13,840
maybe what's the what what's the

3360
02:34:10,639 --> 02:34:16,439
economics of a Hubbly Bubbly like so so

3361
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:18,639
Marcus was sort of making a paradigm of

3362
02:34:16,439 --> 02:34:20,318
you know just you know the average guy

3363
02:34:18,639 --> 02:34:23,239
who wants to cons

3364
02:34:20,318 --> 02:34:25,478
or girl whoever you know just somebody

3365
02:34:23,239 --> 02:34:27,439
with a match or somebody with a lighter

3366
02:34:25,478 --> 02:34:30,398
I mean now you need this Hubbly Bubbly

3367
02:34:27,439 --> 02:34:33,120
thing and how much hash are you using in

3368
02:34:30,398 --> 02:34:36,398
a single sitting is it more than you

3369
02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:37,880
have to spend for what Marcus getting

3370
02:34:36,398 --> 02:34:39,920
but we were smoking it with large

3371
02:34:37,879 --> 02:34:42,278
amounts of people so it was what did we

3372
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:46,359
smoke Marcus maybe an ounce or two or

3373
02:34:42,279 --> 02:34:49,120
three or four oh God I'm sure judging by

3374
02:34:46,359 --> 02:34:50,920
the pale pale pale color of everyone's

3375
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:53,640
face I say that it was right right

3376
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:53,639
around there for

3377
02:34:54,840 --> 02:34:59,478
certain but it's also that's that's a

3378
02:34:57,398 --> 02:35:01,799
culture of Growers you know that's a

3379
02:34:59,478 --> 02:35:03,840
culture of hash movers and you know I

3380
02:35:01,799 --> 02:35:05,799
remember when I was moving cannabis I

3381
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:07,120
had pounds and pounds of free cannabis

3382
02:35:05,799 --> 02:35:09,398
my friends that were growing lots of

3383
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:12,359
cannabis always had towns of cannabis so

3384
02:35:09,398 --> 02:35:14,239
it's it's very different from you know

3385
02:35:12,359 --> 02:35:15,920
Joe Blow who's just like I'm not

3386
02:35:14,239 --> 02:35:18,318
connected to this community I'm not

3387
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:20,680
connected to this industry but I still

3388
02:35:18,318 --> 02:35:23,159
want to have an experience with cannabis

3389
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:24,960
and so you know they're very different

3390
02:35:23,159 --> 02:35:27,398
things and there's very there's very

3391
02:35:24,959 --> 02:35:30,079
little Pathways and bridges from the one

3392
02:35:27,398 --> 02:35:32,760
to the other and so obviously you know

3393
02:35:30,079 --> 02:35:35,279
getting cannabis into legal stores here

3394
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:37,800
in Canada has opened that up people have

3395
02:35:35,279 --> 02:35:39,880
access to drinks and creams and all

3396
02:35:37,799 --> 02:35:42,000
sorts of different things and you know

3397
02:35:39,879 --> 02:35:45,159
they don't know much better because it's

3398
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:47,760
actually fairly easy Marcus if you're

3399
02:35:45,159 --> 02:35:50,719
willing to dedicate your time and life

3400
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:53,359
and energy towards Perfection of

3401
02:35:50,719 --> 02:35:56,398
cannabis but few people are willing to

3402
02:35:53,359 --> 02:35:58,680
do that to be honest that's true and I

3403
02:35:56,398 --> 02:36:00,760
think for us what we want for cannabis

3404
02:35:58,680 --> 02:36:03,479
is that you know I don't necessarily

3405
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:05,920
want everyone to do that you know what I

3406
02:36:03,478 --> 02:36:09,079
want everyone to do is have access to it

3407
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:12,398
as an option over just alcohol that's

3408
02:36:09,079 --> 02:36:12,398
what I want

3409
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:28,439
what I had said was what I had said was

3410
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:30,200
I wanted people to have people that

3411
02:36:28,439 --> 02:36:34,200
don't dedicate their lives I want them

3412
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:36,600
to have access to cannabis over just

3413
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:39,240
alcohol and so that's what this getting

3414
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:41,479
it into these stores and still fighting

3415
02:36:39,239 --> 02:36:43,639
this good fight of you know in Canada we

3416
02:36:41,478 --> 02:36:45,959
can't have Edibles over 10 milligrams

3417
02:36:43,639 --> 02:36:48,039
and there's all these limitations still

3418
02:36:45,959 --> 02:36:49,919
and it's you know I think someone wrote

3419
02:36:48,040 --> 02:36:52,319
I think it was Andrew D'Angelo wrote on

3420
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:55,760
Twitter the other day if grocery stores

3421
02:36:52,318 --> 02:36:57,680
had to get expensive licenses and all

3422
02:36:55,760 --> 02:37:00,318
the vendors had to have super expensive

3423
02:36:57,680 --> 02:37:02,479
licenses and you had to test

3424
02:37:00,318 --> 02:37:05,600
rigorously uh we would probably all

3425
02:37:02,478 --> 02:37:05,599
starve in about three

3426
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:11,040
weeks add tobacco to that list too

3427
02:37:08,639 --> 02:37:13,920
Markus or grow our own

3428
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:16,439
food you could add forestry to the list

3429
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:18,760
because the Foresters around here are

3430
02:37:16,439 --> 02:37:20,239
are able to have cops come and arrest

3431
02:37:18,760 --> 02:37:23,040
the community

3432
02:37:20,239 --> 02:37:24,799
to make sure they get to do their job

3433
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:26,640
and it would be weird to think about

3434
02:37:24,799 --> 02:37:30,358
having a cannabis farm which is a

3435
02:37:26,639 --> 02:37:32,559
life-saving Herb Farm to have like that

3436
02:37:30,359 --> 02:37:34,079
kind of ability to go around and be like

3437
02:37:32,559 --> 02:37:35,680
hey these guys are growing weed around

3438
02:37:34,079 --> 02:37:40,239
here you understand don't do anything

3439
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:41,559
about it but I think that um uh Mojave

3440
02:37:40,239 --> 02:37:42,959
what you were talking about with

3441
02:37:41,559 --> 02:37:44,920
different cultures in the world and

3442
02:37:42,959 --> 02:37:46,478
different ways of ingesting cannabis is

3443
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:47,600
it's probably you know more than

3444
02:37:46,478 --> 02:37:50,000
anything a

3445
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:51,840
microbial thing you know microbial

3446
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:56,959
connection or it's creating some kind of

3447
02:37:51,840 --> 02:38:00,398
a different canabo through its

3448
02:37:56,959 --> 02:38:03,719
transformation that's more bioavailable

3449
02:38:00,398 --> 02:38:06,680
to them you know in their lifestyle or

3450
02:38:03,719 --> 02:38:08,559
maybe it's because it lasts longer you

3451
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:10,120
know three or four months down the road

3452
02:38:08,559 --> 02:38:12,278
and that's when they really need it so

3453
02:38:10,120 --> 02:38:14,040
even though it may not be the best for

3454
02:38:12,279 --> 02:38:16,239
the moment you know four months down the

3455
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:17,640
road it's going to have preserved and

3456
02:38:16,239 --> 02:38:20,439
still have been their form so I think

3457
02:38:17,639 --> 02:38:23,239
there's a lot of different techniqu that

3458
02:38:20,439 --> 02:38:25,279
go into making the extractions but I do

3459
02:38:23,239 --> 02:38:28,000
believe that you know the traditional

3460
02:38:25,279 --> 02:38:31,159
ways of making things are worth keeping

3461
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:33,279
around because you know you get all

3462
02:38:31,159 --> 02:38:35,879
headyy about new things and it's fun to

3463
02:38:33,279 --> 02:38:37,640
do that too but you know there's reasons

3464
02:38:35,879 --> 02:38:39,599
why that whole plant traditional

3465
02:38:37,639 --> 02:38:42,239
medicine really was a better medicine

3466
02:38:39,600 --> 02:38:44,800
for the the healing and stuff which is

3467
02:38:42,239 --> 02:38:47,159
good for us to remember and to keep that

3468
02:38:44,799 --> 02:38:50,119
in our realm so we we do we still do a

3469
02:38:47,159 --> 02:38:52,959
good amount of air drying and Trad hash

3470
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:56,120
making on on our farm personally um but

3471
02:38:52,959 --> 02:38:57,959
we also are doing you know the new St

3472
02:38:56,120 --> 02:39:01,000
freeze dryer yeah we have a freeze dryer

3473
02:38:57,959 --> 02:39:04,759
and a press doing well I also just

3474
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:06,398
noticed that sorry U I also just noticed

3475
02:39:04,760 --> 02:39:08,159
like what what Marcus was saying earlier

3476
02:39:06,398 --> 02:39:10,959
that you know I always I was always

3477
02:39:08,159 --> 02:39:13,159
trying to make full melt the most potent

3478
02:39:10,959 --> 02:39:15,759
hash I could but I also found that I was

3479
02:39:13,159 --> 02:39:17,318
like not smoking it at every time that I

3480
02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:19,760
would want to consume I'd kind of save

3481
02:39:17,318 --> 02:39:22,278
it for the end of the day or for like

3482
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:24,680
you know and it was maybe just a little

3483
02:39:22,279 --> 02:39:27,120
bit too potent for looking at

3484
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:29,040
spreadsheets and doing business stuff

3485
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:31,720
and kind of realized it just didn't fit

3486
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:35,040
in my like daily life as well as kind of

3487
02:39:31,719 --> 02:39:38,039
lower potency hash did just closer to

3488
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:39,760
flower you know um so I've been smoking

3489
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:43,080
a lot of like 30

3490
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:44,279
40% um hash that really just it feels

3491
02:39:43,079 --> 02:39:46,159
really good it might have a little

3492
02:39:44,279 --> 02:39:48,319
Sizzle to it but it's not full melt by

3493
02:39:46,159 --> 02:39:50,398
any stretch and just feels really good

3494
02:39:48,318 --> 02:39:52,199
and it also keeps me so that I don't get

3495
02:39:50,398 --> 02:39:54,840
so downregulated so at the end of the

3496
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:56,800
day when everything is kind of eased and

3497
02:39:54,840 --> 02:39:58,439
life is chilled and the sun went down I

3498
02:39:56,799 --> 02:40:00,840
can go and pull out that full melt and

3499
02:39:58,439 --> 02:40:03,600
feel the full impact and it kind of

3500
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:05,920
gives me you know I feel that there's

3501
02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:07,479
kind of an arc to every day to if you

3502
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:11,079
are consuming cannabis throughout the

3503
02:40:07,478 --> 02:40:13,039
day that you want to keep it so you have

3504
02:40:11,079 --> 02:40:15,680
so you can get high and so that you're

3505
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:17,319
functional and I think hash really did

3506
02:40:15,680 --> 02:40:22,359
that and I think that there's something

3507
02:40:17,318 --> 02:40:25,439
also to just the the tpine canabo ratio

3508
02:40:22,359 --> 02:40:27,359
being different on on Lower potency hash

3509
02:40:25,439 --> 02:40:29,079
you know you start to get tpine start to

3510
02:40:27,359 --> 02:40:31,600
degrade and cannaboids start to go up

3511
02:40:29,079 --> 02:40:33,840
per per volume that you're getting in

3512
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:37,359
your body so you get a really different

3513
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:37,359
effect that way

3514
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:58,600
moabi but uh when you seed a crop then

3515
02:40:55,840 --> 02:41:02,719
you cut the Tarpin in about

3516
02:40:58,600 --> 02:41:05,439
half you cut you lower the canono also

3517
02:41:02,719 --> 02:41:09,799
you cut down the total yield of canono

3518
02:41:05,439 --> 02:41:13,720
and turpins but you the T it really

3519
02:41:09,799 --> 02:41:16,519
affects the tpin even stronger than the

3520
02:41:13,719 --> 02:41:18,278
canabo I will say the way the way it the

3521
02:41:16,520 --> 02:41:21,840
way it fits into the chain of custody

3522
02:41:18,279 --> 02:41:25,960
here in Canada not sure if I'm frozen

3523
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:27,398
probably yeah no you're not I'm not well

3524
02:41:25,959 --> 02:41:30,639
everyone else is

3525
02:41:27,398 --> 02:41:32,318
notz okay great um the chain of custody

3526
02:41:30,639 --> 02:41:33,920
in Canada when you make an exceptional

3527
02:41:32,318 --> 02:41:35,799
product and you keep it at minus 20

3528
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:38,159
degrees Celsius and then you send it out

3529
02:41:35,799 --> 02:41:40,438
to the to the government you know

3530
02:41:38,159 --> 02:41:42,879
warehouses and then to the stores they

3531
02:41:40,439 --> 02:41:45,680
don't keep it cold and it's drastically

3532
02:41:42,879 --> 02:41:48,719
affected so the more traditional hashes

3533
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:51,159
are less affected in fact they tend to

3534
02:41:48,719 --> 02:41:52,920
almost get better with being at room

3535
02:41:51,159 --> 02:41:55,559
temperature and aging a little bit

3536
02:41:52,920 --> 02:41:59,120
whereas like I put out beautiful rosin I

3537
02:41:55,559 --> 02:42:02,039
put out a beautiful 65% like four to

3538
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:04,439
five star hash it was it was very light

3539
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:07,399
in color and it ended up like almost

3540
02:42:04,439 --> 02:42:09,880
black after sitting in a warehouse at 30

3541
02:42:07,398 --> 02:42:12,079
32 degrees Celsius in Toronto for three

3542
02:42:09,879 --> 02:42:14,639
days because there was a problem with

3543
02:42:12,079 --> 02:42:16,439
the barcode you know there's in our

3544
02:42:14,639 --> 02:42:19,519
country they're still I use the metaphor

3545
02:42:16,439 --> 02:42:22,120
they're still shipping spinach warm they

3546
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:23,560
don't have a cold supply chain to move

3547
02:42:22,120 --> 02:42:25,240
these products and when you make a

3548
02:42:23,559 --> 02:42:28,639
specialized product like a high-end

3549
02:42:25,239 --> 02:42:32,000
rosin or a full Mount bubble it's very

3550
02:42:28,639 --> 02:42:34,680
difficult to put it out into the into

3551
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:37,398
the world and have the people experience

3552
02:42:34,680 --> 02:42:39,520
it the way you put it out whereas these

3553
02:42:37,398 --> 02:42:43,159
more traditional hashes single screen

3554
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:46,200
hashes they don't have that big of a

3555
02:42:43,159 --> 02:42:48,439
degreg the degreg isn't seen as a

3556
02:42:46,200 --> 02:42:49,680
negative you know for hashes like that

3557
02:42:48,439 --> 02:42:51,279
people want to Pres preserve them they

3558
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:53,398
want to keep them cold they certainly

3559
02:42:51,279 --> 02:42:55,399
aren't curing them there's no curing

3560
02:42:53,398 --> 02:42:57,358
high-end hashes anymore there's just

3561
02:42:55,398 --> 02:42:59,840
preserving them whereas with these

3562
02:42:57,359 --> 02:43:01,960
traditional hash methods they fit more

3563
02:42:59,840 --> 02:43:04,880
into the current supply chain of you

3564
02:43:01,959 --> 02:43:08,318
know everyone not keeping it

3565
02:43:04,879 --> 02:43:11,759
cold well also too when you press it you

3566
02:43:08,318 --> 02:43:13,559
have a tendency to rock it in place I

3567
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:17,000
mean you might squeeze out some of the

3568
02:43:13,559 --> 02:43:20,719
smell by the act of pressing but you're

3569
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:24,719
also it's more stable stabilized as

3570
02:43:20,719 --> 02:43:29,559
pressed piece than it is loose but you

3571
02:43:24,719 --> 02:43:29,559
and I know I know we both prefer loose

3572
02:43:29,879 --> 02:43:35,358
resin yeah absolutely even the resin

3573
02:43:32,760 --> 02:43:37,960
that I'm putting into the hashit is is a

3574
02:43:35,359 --> 02:43:40,920
loose resin it's not we tried you can

3575
02:43:37,959 --> 02:43:43,639
put press hash in it burns very very

3576
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:45,760
differently it almost simmers uh which

3577
02:43:43,639 --> 02:43:49,239
I'm sure we'll eventually do uh you know

3578
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:51,960
because once again um what you think is

3579
02:43:49,239 --> 02:43:53,920
best for everyone isn't it's just what's

3580
02:43:51,959 --> 02:43:56,679
best for you and you really have to open

3581
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:59,159
your mind and and and realize that

3582
02:43:56,680 --> 02:44:02,398
there's a whole variety of people out

3583
02:43:59,159 --> 02:44:04,239
there and for me in Canada in particular

3584
02:44:02,398 --> 02:44:06,039
I'm kind of done after 25 years of

3585
02:44:04,239 --> 02:44:08,359
preaching to the choir I want to turn

3586
02:44:06,040 --> 02:44:10,200
some new people on and I know that I'm

3587
02:44:08,359 --> 02:44:13,720
not going to turn them on with uh you

3588
02:44:10,200 --> 02:44:16,560
know like a 85% THC rosin that I made

3589
02:44:13,719 --> 02:44:18,239
from you know live hash or whatever

3590
02:44:16,559 --> 02:44:20,760
that's great I want to still make that

3591
02:44:18,239 --> 02:44:22,760
make it available as always but I also

3592
02:44:20,760 --> 02:44:25,159
want to turn on this big group of people

3593
02:44:22,760 --> 02:44:27,398
that are completely different uh they

3594
02:44:25,159 --> 02:44:29,398
don't have the experience with it at all

3595
02:44:27,398 --> 02:44:31,199
but I kind of want to move them away you

3596
02:44:29,398 --> 02:44:33,318
know at least have an experience of

3597
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:35,920
moving away from just smoking pre-rolled

3598
02:44:33,318 --> 02:44:37,559
joints which are not considered to be

3599
02:44:35,920 --> 02:44:40,079
the highest quality cannabis in the

3600
02:44:37,559 --> 02:44:42,278
first place it's ground it's mil it ages

3601
02:44:40,079 --> 02:44:46,079
poorly compared to Hash especially in a

3602
02:44:42,279 --> 02:44:47,479
cold uh warm supply chain and so it's uh

3603
02:44:46,079 --> 02:44:50,719
yeah it took a long time to sort of

3604
02:44:47,478 --> 02:44:54,920
figure out that uh may maybe what you

3605
02:44:50,719 --> 02:44:59,840
need is a metered puffco so they can get

3606
02:44:54,920 --> 02:45:02,398
you know a vaporized small hit that's

3607
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:04,439
equivalent of 10 or 20 milligrams

3608
02:45:02,398 --> 02:45:06,318
they're not going to spend $500 on that

3609
02:45:04,439 --> 02:45:07,960
they're going to spend 99 cents on this

3610
02:45:06,318 --> 02:45:09,920
this is the tool you have to make work

3611
02:45:07,959 --> 02:45:11,679
for them they all have this this is what

3612
02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:13,600
they have this is what we need to this

3613
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:15,559
is what we need to supply for them a

3614
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:17,239
product that they can oh I don't smoke

3615
02:45:15,559 --> 02:45:19,278
half because I don't have a pipe I don't

3616
02:45:17,239 --> 02:45:21,600
have a pipe I don't I can't smoke has

3617
02:45:19,279 --> 02:45:23,760
Well here here's a hash hit give this a

3618
02:45:21,600 --> 02:45:25,920
shot it's just a tube you can puff it

3619
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:27,719
with a lighter and you can you can have

3620
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:30,600
that experience and what I've found so

3621
02:45:27,719 --> 02:45:32,599
far you know we did a great uh uh thing

3622
02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:34,600
recently at Northshore cannabis uh with

3623
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:36,520
the future of cannabis project London

3624
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:38,040
and all these great guys they they were

3625
02:45:36,520 --> 02:45:39,880
pushing the envelope they said let's set

3626
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:41,800
up a tent outside in the parking lot and

3627
02:45:39,879 --> 02:45:44,318
we'll have a little smoking session

3628
02:45:41,799 --> 02:45:45,840
outside of this this legal dispensary

3629
02:45:44,318 --> 02:45:47,879
which is pushing the envelope for sure

3630
02:45:45,840 --> 02:45:49,719
it's not really allowed although most of

3631
02:45:47,879 --> 02:45:52,398
us were medical patients smoking in an

3632
02:45:49,719 --> 02:45:54,358
environment that was legal to smoke in

3633
02:45:52,398 --> 02:45:56,159
um but we I met a woman she's not on

3634
02:45:54,359 --> 02:45:58,040
social media she barely you know she's

3635
02:45:56,159 --> 02:46:00,119
only buys pre-roll joints and she sat

3636
02:45:58,040 --> 02:46:02,200
with us for a bit and she said well I'll

3637
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:03,479
I'll try your your product or whatever

3638
02:46:02,200 --> 02:46:05,720
she actually went and bought some Bubble

3639
02:46:03,478 --> 02:46:08,079
Man hash and I just gave her some hash

3640
02:46:05,719 --> 02:46:10,199
hit tubes and she sat there and she just

3641
02:46:08,079 --> 02:46:11,559
put a little dab in and she she smoked

3642
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:13,200
it with her lighter she had a couple of

3643
02:46:11,559 --> 02:46:15,318
Puffs and I just said you know like

3644
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:16,880
what's how how was that in comparison to

3645
02:46:15,318 --> 02:46:19,920
smoking joints and she's like well it

3646
02:46:16,879 --> 02:46:22,278
definitely was a clearer High than I get

3647
02:46:19,920 --> 02:46:24,520
from the joint and it was a little bit

3648
02:46:22,279 --> 02:46:26,279
stronger and and it was just neat to

3649
02:46:24,520 --> 02:46:27,960
hear her perspective of being like yeah

3650
02:46:26,279 --> 02:46:29,439
this was really nice it was like one

3651
02:46:27,959 --> 02:46:31,959
puff I didn't have to smoke a whole

3652
02:46:29,439 --> 02:46:33,840
joint sometimes the joints don't taste

3653
02:46:31,959 --> 02:46:36,519
that good and the hash tasted really

3654
02:46:33,840 --> 02:46:38,040
good so you know one by one if we help

3655
02:46:36,520 --> 02:46:40,319
educate these people that aren't

3656
02:46:38,040 --> 02:46:42,160
watching hash Church they're not on

3657
02:46:40,318 --> 02:46:44,000
social media and Instagram and looking

3658
02:46:42,159 --> 02:46:45,760
at all the photos you kind of got to get

3659
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:48,279
out into the world and I've said this

3660
02:46:45,760 --> 02:46:52,398
before the importance of allowing us to

3661
02:46:48,279 --> 02:46:55,800
gather and smoke is so so very important

3662
02:46:52,398 --> 02:46:59,000
the conversation I froze of

3663
02:46:55,799 --> 02:46:59,000
course I

3664
02:47:03,279 --> 02:47:11,880
froze of those sticks are in that one

3665
02:47:05,840 --> 02:47:15,398
package ATN five five five so so Marcus

3666
02:47:11,879 --> 02:47:17,079
Ju Just for the uneducated user so do do

3667
02:47:15,398 --> 02:47:19,159
uh each one of those represents kind of

3668
02:47:17,079 --> 02:47:21,318
like a joint so like one session right

3669
02:47:19,159 --> 02:47:24,520
so it's five sessions and you said it

3670
02:47:21,318 --> 02:47:27,199
was $60 is that right

3671
02:47:24,520 --> 02:47:29,760
$25 um and it's it's more than five

3672
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:33,159
sessions in the sense it's uh I get

3673
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:34,719
about 10 rips from from this I get about

3674
02:47:33,159 --> 02:47:37,920
10

3675
02:47:34,719 --> 02:47:40,358
rips and people who don't smoke very

3676
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:44,680
much get about 20 so you're getting

3677
02:47:40,359 --> 02:47:46,040
between 50 and 100 pop out of a pack for

3678
02:47:44,680 --> 02:47:49,880
25

3679
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:53,080
bucks so it's it's pretty substantial

3680
02:47:49,879 --> 02:47:54,559
you know 18 18 that that would sell in

3681
02:47:53,079 --> 02:47:58,239
the US wouldn't

3682
02:47:54,559 --> 02:48:00,879
it companies have had meter dosage

3683
02:47:58,239 --> 02:48:03,520
vaporizers um unfortunately it just

3684
02:48:00,879 --> 02:48:07,239
didn't catch on to people or I don't

3685
02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:10,200
think the um the efficacy or the

3686
02:48:07,239 --> 02:48:14,478
expandability was there but uh we had

3687
02:48:10,200 --> 02:48:17,279
meter dosages back prior to Prior prop

3688
02:48:14,478 --> 02:48:19,760
64 I can't think of the exact were those

3689
02:48:17,279 --> 02:48:22,520
vaporizers or were

3690
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:24,239
nebulizers uh they were vaporizers uh

3691
02:48:22,520 --> 02:48:26,800
the problem is is that they were

3692
02:48:24,239 --> 02:48:29,079
internalized batteries so the batteries

3693
02:48:26,799 --> 02:48:31,639
died depending on how long or the

3694
02:48:29,079 --> 02:48:33,600
production because they were made in Pre

3695
02:48:31,639 --> 02:48:37,278
they were not able to charge so there

3696
02:48:33,600 --> 02:48:39,880
were technical realities that were not

3697
02:48:37,279 --> 02:48:43,200
necessarily expressive at the time which

3698
02:48:39,879 --> 02:48:45,079
I think currently there are because

3699
02:48:43,200 --> 02:48:48,240
people were pushing for the latest in

3700
02:48:45,079 --> 02:48:51,600
medical efficacy right so by having a

3701
02:48:48,239 --> 02:48:53,879
small handheld metered

3702
02:48:51,600 --> 02:48:56,800
vaporizer it just didn't catch on with

3703
02:48:53,879 --> 02:48:59,199
people because the the the hit was so

3704
02:48:56,799 --> 02:49:02,679
small for people they were used to a

3705
02:48:59,200 --> 02:49:07,920
larger hit so I think it was multiple

3706
02:49:02,680 --> 02:49:09,559
things uh New newa Market it was uh uh

3707
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:11,439
state-of-the-art at the time but

3708
02:49:09,559 --> 02:49:13,519
unfortunately then we had when they

3709
02:49:11,439 --> 02:49:15,359
would run out they were useless so

3710
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:17,120
people wanted to then recycle them and

3711
02:49:15,359 --> 02:49:19,680
we couldn't recycle the batteries

3712
02:49:17,120 --> 02:49:21,720
because of the componentry Etc because

3713
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:24,439
did you see

3714
02:49:21,719 --> 02:49:28,199
nebulizers I have seen nebulizers we did

3715
02:49:24,439 --> 02:49:30,120
not see them sold to us

3716
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:32,439
yeah yeah that's what I'm saying you

3717
02:49:30,120 --> 02:49:35,000
need you need Simple

3718
02:49:32,439 --> 02:49:36,800
Technology a lighter that's simple

3719
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:39,279
technology that's what this was designed

3720
02:49:36,799 --> 02:49:40,559
for if people don't want batteries

3721
02:49:39,279 --> 02:49:42,359
things that are going to fail they want

3722
02:49:40,559 --> 02:49:44,439
to pull out their lighter and have a

3723
02:49:42,359 --> 02:49:45,920
little pop This Is A specific group I'm

3724
02:49:44,439 --> 02:49:48,238
talking about I'm not talking about

3725
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:51,200
everyone by any means but that's what

3726
02:49:48,238 --> 02:49:53,119
this was designed for and uh it's been

3727
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:55,479
well received in Canada and we're in the

3728
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:57,479
middle of making some deals to bring it

3729
02:49:55,478 --> 02:50:00,159
down to uh you know Washington and

3730
02:49:57,478 --> 02:50:03,159
Oregon and California uh and

3731
02:50:00,159 --> 02:50:05,119
Massachusetts and Colorado and Nevada so

3732
02:50:03,159 --> 02:50:07,959
there's there's there's deals on the

3733
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:10,120
table do you print a label on them that

3734
02:50:07,959 --> 02:50:15,199
says perfect for law enforcement and

3735
02:50:10,120 --> 02:50:15,200
correction officers absolutely

3736
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:21,560
100% no ATN made a good point is well

3737
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:24,398
about like actual volume I think people

3738
02:50:21,559 --> 02:50:26,719
really enjoy taking larger hits and

3739
02:50:24,398 --> 02:50:28,639
feeling the full inhalation and their

3740
02:50:26,719 --> 02:50:31,079
lungs expansion and holding it for a

3741
02:50:28,639 --> 02:50:33,039
second and having even lower potency

3742
02:50:31,079 --> 02:50:35,959
cannabis I think would be really helpful

3743
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:37,600
for that just like um instead of

3744
02:50:35,959 --> 02:50:40,959
downregulating yourself so you need to

3745
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:43,680
take more just have lower potency so

3746
02:50:40,959 --> 02:50:45,599
you're kind of at your threshold already

3747
02:50:43,680 --> 02:50:48,680
and if you enjoy it not to create you

3748
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:52,040
know addictive habits but people do like

3749
02:50:48,680 --> 02:50:53,559
like to do this and and um I find like

3750
02:50:52,040 --> 02:50:55,439
with hash it's kind of nice when you can

3751
02:50:53,559 --> 02:50:58,318
just keep packing the bowl and smoking

3752
02:50:55,439 --> 02:51:00,840
big bowls and same the flower like these

3753
02:50:58,318 --> 02:51:03,119
are repack too you know they they are

3754
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:05,079
they're repack like I've repacked one

3755
02:51:03,120 --> 02:51:07,200
tube like four or five times if you

3756
02:51:05,079 --> 02:51:09,279
light them correctly they they don't

3757
02:51:07,200 --> 02:51:10,960
burn they don't like degrade like you

3758
02:51:09,279 --> 02:51:13,800
know ideally you're not going to smoke

3759
02:51:10,959 --> 02:51:16,159
it forever but it's a nice sort of free

3760
02:51:13,799 --> 02:51:18,879
I mean hash grams of hash are already 20

3761
02:51:16,159 --> 02:51:20,238
to $25 in Canada and the legal Market so

3762
02:51:18,879 --> 02:51:23,119
I thought let's come in at the same

3763
02:51:20,238 --> 02:51:25,079
price but like Pro provide the vessel

3764
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:26,840
for smoking the hash out of and I think

3765
02:51:25,079 --> 02:51:28,478
that that you know convenience is the

3766
02:51:26,840 --> 02:51:30,680
thing that we don't talk about too much

3767
02:51:28,478 --> 02:51:32,159
in the in the Cannabis world you know

3768
02:51:30,680 --> 02:51:33,760
we're like oh what about a puff Co what

3769
02:51:32,159 --> 02:51:37,920
about a measured dose what about a

3770
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:39,800
$4,000 Banger with a $10,000 pipe and a

3771
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:43,040
blowtorch and

3772
02:51:39,799 --> 02:51:45,879
a dosist was the company I was trying to

3773
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:49,279
think of that had done a meter dose of

3774
02:51:45,879 --> 02:51:55,039
small pen um that was spe specifically

3775
02:51:49,279 --> 02:51:57,960
toward medical patients so do s i s if I

3776
02:51:55,040 --> 02:52:01,319
A A A at and if you had to guess what

3777
02:51:57,959 --> 02:52:04,919
would that pack that Marcus showed us

3778
02:52:01,318 --> 02:52:04,920
retail for at

3779
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:12,600
BPG

3780
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:15,000
um it's it's five specific is it meter

3781
02:52:12,600 --> 02:52:17,760
dosages they're not metered it's point

3782
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:20,120
two of a gr so it's not metered in the

3783
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:22,680
sense that you could smoke half of it in

3784
02:52:20,120 --> 02:52:27,640
three puffs or you could smoke one tenth

3785
02:52:22,680 --> 02:52:30,800
of it in in one puff yeah a gram a half1

3786
02:52:27,639 --> 02:52:33,000
to $20 retail depending you know if if

3787
02:52:30,799 --> 02:52:34,920
you know it's it's all on the amount of

3788
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:37,238
cannabis and of course in the packaging

3789
02:52:34,920 --> 02:52:39,318
but from the distributor Etc depending

3790
02:52:37,238 --> 02:52:42,199
on you know manufacturing and cost I

3791
02:52:39,318 --> 02:52:43,719
mean it could be 25 to 30 I don't know

3792
02:52:42,200 --> 02:52:47,079
uh but you know what do you sell them

3793
02:52:43,719 --> 02:52:47,079
for in uh

3794
02:52:47,238 --> 02:52:53,159
Canadian you mute you muted yourself

3795
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:57,159
Mark 25 I 25 I think in the US it would

3796
02:52:53,159 --> 02:52:59,840
be 20 bucks $18 to $20 US 20 to 25 yeah

3797
02:52:57,159 --> 02:52:59,840
that sounds about

3798
02:53:00,238 --> 02:53:04,119
right and people are looking for that

3799
02:53:02,559 --> 02:53:07,159
they're looking for something that's

3800
02:53:04,120 --> 02:53:09,680
specific that's a an easier dosage they

3801
02:53:07,159 --> 02:53:11,079
don't like having to buy a big cone and

3802
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:13,079
then having to burn a little of it

3803
02:53:11,079 --> 02:53:15,478
because as you know the flavors taste

3804
02:53:13,079 --> 02:53:17,840
everything about it really changes from

3805
02:53:15,478 --> 02:53:21,438
the tars and everything that's internal

3806
02:53:17,840 --> 02:53:23,559
so well are looking for smaller dosage

3807
02:53:21,439 --> 02:53:25,439
things it's again it's more that are

3808
02:53:23,559 --> 02:53:28,039
medical specific as opposed to the

3809
02:53:25,439 --> 02:53:30,359
recreational just to clarify is it isn't

3810
02:53:28,040 --> 02:53:32,279
a traditional 28 and that you know

3811
02:53:30,359 --> 02:53:34,079
pre-rolls are kind of like the Run

3812
02:53:32,279 --> 02:53:36,040
litter it's just kind of like the shake

3813
02:53:34,079 --> 02:53:37,760
at the bottom you know after you've

3814
02:53:36,040 --> 02:53:40,000
packaged up a bunch of stuff it's

3815
02:53:37,760 --> 02:53:42,318
basically what it can be that way if

3816
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:44,719
you're specifically doing it the biggest

3817
02:53:42,318 --> 02:53:47,199
problem that I want to say to every

3818
02:53:44,719 --> 02:53:50,559
manufacturer out there is stop using

3819
02:53:47,200 --> 02:53:53,239
cones just just stop it doesn't work

3820
02:53:50,559 --> 02:53:55,840
you're all trying to to to cram too much

3821
02:53:53,238 --> 02:53:57,318
stuff into these cones whereas the most

3822
02:53:55,840 --> 02:53:59,600
successful ones are people like

3823
02:53:57,318 --> 02:54:02,000
connected that do a straight cigarette

3824
02:53:59,600 --> 02:54:02,000
style

3825
02:54:03,238 --> 02:54:09,000
one bought that are pre-made I think uh

3826
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:11,000
it's they granulate it too much what

3827
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:13,359
happens is the last inch an inch and a

3828
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:16,478
half it clogs up and it's useless and

3829
02:54:13,359 --> 02:54:20,318
you're wasting a gram to two grams of

3830
02:54:16,478 --> 02:54:24,199
flour outright so I'm I'm imploring

3831
02:54:20,318 --> 02:54:26,920
every manufacturer who makes cones stop

3832
02:54:24,200 --> 02:54:28,640
just [ __ ] off with it raw all of you I

3833
02:54:26,920 --> 02:54:30,680
understand you you like it and it's

3834
02:54:28,639 --> 02:54:34,079
easier for consumers but every

3835
02:54:30,680 --> 02:54:36,000
manufacturer has gotten [ __ ] lazy and

3836
02:54:34,079 --> 02:54:38,398
what you're using is way too dried

3837
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:41,840
product that burns up way too quickly

3838
02:54:38,398 --> 02:54:45,599
you're not using proper product for your

3839
02:54:41,840 --> 02:54:47,760
actual pre-rolls uh so please just stop

3840
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:48,840
you're insulting us all you're doing it

3841
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:51,000
wrong

3842
02:54:48,840 --> 02:54:52,880
and somebody get out there like

3843
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:55,600
connected and show them how to do it

3844
02:54:52,879 --> 02:54:57,199
right because you're wasting consumer's

3845
02:54:55,600 --> 02:54:59,079
time you're wasting their money and

3846
02:54:57,200 --> 02:55:01,159
you're pissing off new consumers who are

3847
02:54:59,079 --> 02:55:03,478
like hey I got a cone and they're like

3848
02:55:01,159 --> 02:55:05,279
oh I'm halfway so who's got a bowl [ __ ]

3849
02:55:03,478 --> 02:55:06,840
off with that [ __ ] and [ __ ] grow some

3850
02:55:05,279 --> 02:55:08,920
real [ __ ] pot and put it in your

3851
02:55:06,840 --> 02:55:11,398
[ __ ] cone I mean in your actual

3852
02:55:08,920 --> 02:55:14,559
joints and stop with the cones unless

3853
02:55:11,398 --> 02:55:16,519
they're twice the size because it's just

3854
02:55:14,559 --> 02:55:18,478
gumming up way too much because the

3855
02:55:16,520 --> 02:55:20,880
quality of flour is higher than what it

3856
02:55:18,478 --> 02:55:22,959
used to be and if you're putting resin

3857
02:55:20,879 --> 02:55:25,159
in it you absolutely have to stop with

3858
02:55:22,959 --> 02:55:26,398
the coning so I'll get off my soap books

3859
02:55:25,159 --> 02:55:28,760
now but all you cone making

3860
02:55:26,398 --> 02:55:31,159
[ __ ] [ __ ] you go to hell I

3861
02:55:28,760 --> 02:55:33,559
[ __ ] hate you all save the cones for

3862
02:55:31,159 --> 02:55:36,439
the ice cream

3863
02:55:33,559 --> 02:55:39,039
right but CH what about what about the

3864
02:55:36,439 --> 02:55:41,639
gold con cones those are the best aren't

3865
02:55:39,040 --> 02:55:44,040
they the gold

3866
02:55:41,639 --> 02:55:47,318
cones and they can [ __ ] off with the

3867
02:55:44,040 --> 02:55:49,840
gold Co cones too sorry I I I hate to be

3868
02:55:47,318 --> 02:55:52,079
so so adamant passionate about my hate

3869
02:55:49,840 --> 02:55:54,359
and vitrail for them but I buy every

3870
02:55:52,079 --> 02:55:57,840
single one that comes through BPG and I

3871
02:55:54,359 --> 02:55:59,720
try them all i' I roll my own even I use

3872
02:55:57,840 --> 02:56:03,398
a machine that actually rolls them

3873
02:55:59,719 --> 02:56:06,278
evenly so they exist okay including that

3874
02:56:03,398 --> 02:56:08,318
you can roll but manufacturers who are

3875
02:56:06,279 --> 02:56:10,640
putting out these products are

3876
02:56:08,318 --> 02:56:12,680
absolutely crap they're too tightly

3877
02:56:10,639 --> 02:56:14,879
packed and you're just turning off

3878
02:56:12,680 --> 02:56:17,760
consumers to a product that when I was

3879
02:56:14,879 --> 02:56:20,839
in Amsterdam a decade ago plus they were

3880
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:23,238
doing it right they were using cones but

3881
02:56:20,840 --> 02:56:25,000
they were packing them properly you're

3882
02:56:23,238 --> 02:56:27,318
you're you're packing them way too tight

3883
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:29,159
and I've been to many different

3884
02:56:27,318 --> 02:56:31,478
manufacturing facilities and watched

3885
02:56:29,159 --> 02:56:33,879
your people do it as they sit there with

3886
02:56:31,478 --> 02:56:36,119
little tools to pack and Tamp that stuff

3887
02:56:33,879 --> 02:56:38,079
down you're doing it wrong go back to

3888
02:56:36,120 --> 02:56:40,479
how we used to roll and roll them evenly

3889
02:56:38,079 --> 02:56:44,639
across the board am I wrong here people

3890
02:56:40,478 --> 02:56:46,478
am I is my head my ass here you're

3891
02:56:44,639 --> 02:56:49,639
you're you're absolutely right but I

3892
02:56:46,478 --> 02:56:51,920
want to make one notable exception which

3893
02:56:49,639 --> 02:56:54,719
is uh and I'll point out to my friend

3894
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:58,600
Josh here on the upper right the canar

3895
02:56:54,719 --> 02:57:02,119
that I got in the teepe was the canar

3896
02:56:58,600 --> 02:57:04,359
that changed my life so other than yet

3897
02:57:02,120 --> 02:57:06,120
rolling regular joints I'm totally with

3898
02:57:04,359 --> 02:57:08,600
you ATN if they look like a cigarette

3899
02:57:06,120 --> 02:57:11,800
that's cool but the canar I think for

3900
02:57:08,600 --> 02:57:14,399
The Connoisseur is kind of in a separate

3901
02:57:11,799 --> 02:57:18,519
category that it's okay to be nice and

3902
02:57:14,398 --> 02:57:20,840
big and obnoxiously big and well well we

3903
02:57:18,520 --> 02:57:22,399
met Cones were for sharing and and and

3904
02:57:20,840 --> 02:57:24,960
people don't share nearly as much as

3905
02:57:22,398 --> 02:57:26,599
they used to you know covid changed that

3906
02:57:24,959 --> 02:57:28,238
and it's like the little three dog

3907
02:57:26,600 --> 02:57:30,159
walkers are really popular because it's

3908
02:57:28,238 --> 02:57:32,520
like I can go smoke it and put it out

3909
02:57:30,159 --> 02:57:33,920
and I don't have to hide a stinky thing

3910
02:57:32,520 --> 02:57:36,238
and they taste like [ __ ] if you fire it

3911
02:57:33,920 --> 02:57:38,719
up again you know so you know I know

3912
02:57:36,238 --> 02:57:41,439
cones are a bummer and yeah it's it's a

3913
02:57:38,719 --> 02:57:45,398
mess it's crazy you know the the whole

3914
02:57:41,439 --> 02:57:48,639
pre-roll packaged Goods thing is just

3915
02:57:45,398 --> 02:57:50,959
nuts you know and and all the the um

3916
02:57:48,639 --> 02:57:54,358
infused pre-rolls and stuff everyone's

3917
02:57:50,959 --> 02:57:56,799
trying to to make a better pre-roll but

3918
02:57:54,359 --> 02:57:58,359
really it's all ATN it's it it's about

3919
02:57:56,799 --> 02:58:02,438
just like cigarettes cigarettes figured

3920
02:57:58,359 --> 02:58:04,399
out like here's a a a standard form that

3921
02:58:02,439 --> 02:58:06,040
every single cigarette company adopted

3922
02:58:04,398 --> 02:58:08,119
like overnight because the delivery

3923
02:58:06,040 --> 02:58:09,680
system was just better and more

3924
02:58:08,120 --> 02:58:11,720
convenient and everyone even the

3925
02:58:09,680 --> 02:58:13,880
government does it they spend their

3926
02:58:11,719 --> 02:58:15,879
actual joints out from a Paul mul

3927
02:58:13,879 --> 02:58:19,398
equally rolled machine and guess what

3928
02:58:15,879 --> 02:58:19,398
they burn evenly

3929
02:58:19,959 --> 02:58:26,039
they're they're actually rolled uh at

3930
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:29,439
the El's laboratory

3931
02:58:26,040 --> 02:58:32,920
facilities and uh they use a bonac

3932
02:58:29,439 --> 02:58:38,120
cigarette rolling machine to do

3933
02:58:32,920 --> 02:58:40,318
it no doubt visit I visited their

3934
02:58:38,120 --> 02:58:42,600
facility and there's an old High Times

3935
02:58:40,318 --> 02:58:45,639
article I think from 78 that shows them

3936
02:58:42,600 --> 02:58:47,720
actually doing it too it shows the

3937
02:58:45,639 --> 02:58:49,238
machine one of those old cigarette

3938
02:58:47,719 --> 02:58:51,119
machines machines there there's a

3939
02:58:49,238 --> 02:58:53,279
company here in Canada called Ready can

3940
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:56,279
that does it with this cigarette rolling

3941
02:58:53,279 --> 02:58:57,680
technology from the tobacco industry and

3942
02:58:56,279 --> 02:59:00,359
they just sold that company for like

3943
02:58:57,680 --> 02:59:00,359
$900

3944
02:59:00,559 --> 02:59:05,840
million there's a good amount of uh

3945
02:59:03,639 --> 02:59:09,478
small batch Farmers I'm seeing now with

3946
02:59:05,840 --> 02:59:12,439
little glass tip uh straight uh

3947
02:59:09,478 --> 02:59:15,119
pre-rolls and and things that are really

3948
02:59:12,439 --> 02:59:16,960
nice looking and and then some infused

3949
02:59:15,120 --> 02:59:20,239
and all that and so I'm starting to see

3950
02:59:16,959 --> 02:59:23,879
that and I agree with you that you know

3951
02:59:20,238 --> 02:59:25,799
an evenly rolled and a thicker joint

3952
02:59:23,879 --> 02:59:29,799
brings more

3953
02:59:25,799 --> 02:59:33,278
flavor and it allows the resin to kind

3954
02:59:29,799 --> 02:59:35,000
of caramelize and burn on itself as it's

3955
02:59:33,279 --> 02:59:36,319
burning through and really it should be

3956
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:38,120
getting better as it's going down to the

3957
02:59:36,318 --> 02:59:40,359
bottom rather than getting hotter and

3958
02:59:38,120 --> 02:59:42,279
and more packed in and stuff so yeah

3959
02:59:40,359 --> 02:59:43,520
maybe it's like heads up to Future Rola

3960
02:59:42,279 --> 02:59:45,319
and all the different rolling companies

3961
02:59:43,520 --> 02:59:47,279
out there that are you know really

3962
02:59:45,318 --> 02:59:49,359
giving people these as options because I

3963
02:59:47,279 --> 02:59:51,640
think people would start taking the

3964
02:59:49,359 --> 02:59:53,439
option they're not giving you an option

3965
02:59:51,639 --> 02:59:55,559
that's the problem is that you're only

3966
02:59:53,439 --> 02:59:57,720
dealt cones you go to raw and everything

3967
02:59:55,559 --> 03:00:00,680
else I just saw today they even made an

3968
02:59:57,719 --> 03:00:02,959
actual little raw a a cone roller

3969
03:00:00,680 --> 03:00:05,559
attachment that goes on your keychain so

3970
03:00:02,959 --> 03:00:08,358
you can roll a nice little tight joint

3971
03:00:05,559 --> 03:00:11,079
and can perpetuate this [ __ ] so

3972
03:00:08,359 --> 03:00:13,520
sorry I'm it's just my anger don't don't

3973
03:00:11,079 --> 03:00:16,760
jump on the canar people who are making

3974
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:19,640
I'm not dumping on the canar canar

3975
03:00:16,760 --> 03:00:23,279
continue to make those products Jos that

3976
03:00:19,639 --> 03:00:25,959
canar that you gave me at the at that at

3977
03:00:23,279 --> 03:00:28,720
the tee when I met when I met I brought

3978
03:00:25,959 --> 03:00:31,278
that to delest the Bluegrass Festival I

3979
03:00:28,719 --> 03:00:34,278
think a year later and changed a lot of

3980
03:00:31,279 --> 03:00:37,439
people's worlds with that single device

3981
03:00:34,279 --> 03:00:39,479
so thank you kind totally yeah big up to

3982
03:00:37,439 --> 03:00:41,559
you and big up to the makers out there

3983
03:00:39,478 --> 03:00:43,879
and that's that's what's up you know and

3984
03:00:41,559 --> 03:00:46,238
you remember that canar right oh yeah

3985
03:00:43,879 --> 03:00:48,679
definitely yeah for sure it was

3986
03:00:46,238 --> 03:00:51,478
spectacular definitely what is it with

3987
03:00:48,680 --> 03:00:55,600
the canar itself so it's actually using

3988
03:00:51,478 --> 03:00:58,719
leaves of LEF the sun leaf and and then

3989
03:00:55,600 --> 03:01:02,840
also often you know adding a lot of uh

3990
03:00:58,719 --> 03:01:05,519
rosin and uh bubble hash to the

3991
03:01:02,840 --> 03:01:08,079
inside and then having like a stick on

3992
03:01:05,520 --> 03:01:10,079
the inside so you know the chances you

3993
03:01:08,079 --> 03:01:12,120
know a lot of those things can be you

3994
03:01:10,079 --> 03:01:14,840
know have an ounce of hash inside of

3995
03:01:12,120 --> 03:01:17,600
them as well as I mean it burns so

3996
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:19,600
slowly unlike just like a fatty like if

3997
03:01:17,600 --> 03:01:23,079
we had had a fatty the same size the

3998
03:01:19,600 --> 03:01:25,960
fatty would have been gone an hour ago

3999
03:01:23,079 --> 03:01:29,799
that thing took about seriously about

4000
03:01:25,959 --> 03:01:32,358
two hours to burn and I shared it down

4001
03:01:29,799 --> 03:01:35,039
at a a pit right in front of Del

4002
03:01:32,359 --> 03:01:38,120
mccurry's band playing up there and you

4003
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:38,120
could just see

4004
03:01:39,120 --> 03:01:43,600
CLS there look good with the disco ball

4005
03:01:41,879 --> 03:01:45,879
too because it gets the lights going and

4006
03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:48,200
everything so I'm sure it was much

4007
03:01:45,879 --> 03:01:51,559
appreciated in the crowd that's sweet

4008
03:01:48,200 --> 03:01:54,040
canar producers Please keep those movies

4009
03:01:51,559 --> 03:01:56,278
coming the people who like those I mean

4010
03:01:54,040 --> 03:02:00,120
I I think it's a different product than

4011
03:01:56,279 --> 03:02:03,680
just a a a joint if you will or just a

4012
03:02:00,120 --> 03:02:06,760
fatty or something I have to say that I

4013
03:02:03,680 --> 03:02:09,159
I I do love still rolling my own and I

4014
03:02:06,760 --> 03:02:13,439
still love the idea of putting two

4015
03:02:09,159 --> 03:02:15,000
papers together and and making even like

4016
03:02:13,439 --> 03:02:18,000
what we used to call ungrateful dead to

4017
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:20,520
are a fatty right so when you light a

4018
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:23,120
fatty it's not like lighting that nail

4019
03:02:20,520 --> 03:02:26,159
cigarette because you light a fatty it's

4020
03:02:23,120 --> 03:02:28,800
like Whoa man that [ __ ] thing

4021
03:02:26,159 --> 03:02:31,600
just and you

4022
03:02:28,799 --> 03:02:33,879
draw have you guys seen the um perfect

4023
03:02:31,600 --> 03:02:36,079
pre-rolls perfect brand pre-rolls that

4024
03:02:33,879 --> 03:02:37,639
Michael bachus works with they're

4025
03:02:36,079 --> 03:02:38,920
they're pretty far out the the one thing

4026
03:02:37,639 --> 03:02:41,318
that's really cool about them is they

4027
03:02:38,920 --> 03:02:44,680
have two filters on either a filter on

4028
03:02:41,318 --> 03:02:46,559
either side so the concept is that you

4029
03:02:44,680 --> 03:02:50,238
can snap it right down the middle and

4030
03:02:46,559 --> 03:02:52,238
share it or you can cut one filter off

4031
03:02:50,238 --> 03:02:54,760
and have a full one gram joint to

4032
03:02:52,238 --> 03:02:57,359
yourself um it's just it's just a silly

4033
03:02:54,760 --> 03:02:59,680
little idea and the funny thing is they

4034
03:02:57,359 --> 03:03:02,000
he came over to our facility in in La a

4035
03:02:59,680 --> 03:03:03,439
couple years ago just as like a just

4036
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:06,120
like hey I just rolled this up just for

4037
03:03:03,439 --> 03:03:08,439
us to share and he cut it and I was like

4038
03:03:06,120 --> 03:03:10,439
dude that's a product no one's done that

4039
03:03:08,439 --> 03:03:13,238
I mean it's silly and weird but it's a

4040
03:03:10,439 --> 03:03:15,720
total product and there really has an

4041
03:03:13,238 --> 03:03:18,559
interesting infusion technology so they

4042
03:03:15,719 --> 03:03:20,679
the flower actually does stay

4043
03:03:18,559 --> 03:03:22,478
um the tpine profile actually lasts a

4044
03:03:20,680 --> 03:03:25,120
lot longer and it's not just dumping a

4045
03:03:22,478 --> 03:03:27,238
bunch of um extract in there it's it's

4046
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:29,560
pretty interesting um that as far as

4047
03:03:27,238 --> 03:03:32,000
pre-rolls that's one company that's done

4048
03:03:29,559 --> 03:03:32,000
something

4049
03:03:32,920 --> 03:03:38,478
different

4050
03:03:34,840 --> 03:03:40,760
again perfect perfect yeah

4051
03:03:38,478 --> 03:03:46,559
perfect yeah they do they do pre-rolls

4052
03:03:40,760 --> 03:03:48,040
and they do flower um like like Blended

4053
03:03:46,559 --> 03:03:50,398
or I don't know if it's all Blended but

4054
03:03:48,040 --> 03:03:53,479
it's um might be single variety but um

4055
03:03:50,398 --> 03:03:56,000
it's uh loose so it's broken up loose

4056
03:03:53,478 --> 03:03:57,799
flour in a jar for people to roll joints

4057
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:59,639
or pack bowls it's another one of these

4058
03:03:57,799 --> 03:04:02,000
things of like everything that we do and

4059
03:03:59,639 --> 03:04:05,159
we Engage The Flower so much we engage

4060
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:07,439
the product so much but there's a lot of

4061
03:04:05,159 --> 03:04:09,039
there's a lot involved and maybe people

4062
03:04:07,439 --> 03:04:11,439
just don't want to be that invol or

4063
03:04:09,040 --> 03:04:13,439
can't be that involved can't take the

4064
03:04:11,439 --> 03:04:15,120
time to crumble up or get stinky hands

4065
03:04:13,439 --> 03:04:16,398
and go back to work and be scrutinized

4066
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:18,600
or something so they make a product

4067
03:04:16,398 --> 03:04:21,358
where it's like just loose

4068
03:04:18,600 --> 03:04:26,800
um flow it's really interesting it's

4069
03:04:21,359 --> 03:04:26,800
moabi we all know only god is

4070

4121
03:06:38,520 --> 03:06:42,760
the panel if you can open up the YouTube

4122
