because I'm in bed and uh not not real

36
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:45,519
handsome to look at this morning but um

37
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:49,200
yeah learning about

38
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,560
um uh a new health Paradigm in my life

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,600
I've been

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:59,200
uh uh getting used to the idea of uh not

41
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:03,359
enjoying full health and um having to

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,840
learn how to ask for help as a man who's

43
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,800
spent most of his life being ready and

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,120
willing to help others uh I find myself

45
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,360
in a situation where now I I need help

46
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,920
with all kinds of things that I never

47
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:21,319
expected to be in that situation so it's

48
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:24,799
a real eye openening experience and uh

49
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:27,878
I'm actually uh feeling

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,599
um excited it's not really the right

51
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:34,560
word but uh for New Opportunities new

52
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:38,799
chances to learn about myself and about

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,598
how uh our minds work uh in the context

54
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,159
of health and relations with other

55
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:46,719
people so that's kind of where I'm at

56
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:48,679
it's not easy is it Wade I I you know I

57
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:52,759
I I destroyed myself about four years

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:56,400
ago and I I I was unable to walk um like

59
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:59,239
almost at all and uh I remember just

60
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,959
feeling that same way kind of like wow

61
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,920
like I I was ending up going to a lot of

62
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,840
doctors and Physio and stuff so I was

63
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,518
and in my neighborhood there's a lot of

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,479
elderly people and what I noticed was

65
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,200
that I was much slower than them and I

66
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,759
was unable to do things that they could

67
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,318
do and I had like I'd be walking into

68
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,039
the building and then you know like an

69
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,199
85y old guy would be like excuse me and

70
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,199
sort of Shuffle by me while I was you

71
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:27,878
know moving one inch at a time because I

72
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,919
just so badly damaged my lower spine and

73
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:31,840
it really got me thinking the same way

74
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,399
just kind of like wow like this is a

75
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,120
really it just gave me a glimpse into my

76
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,719
potential future if I you know if I can

77
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,640
get there if I can hey brother right on

78
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,959
dude good to see you man we we love we

79
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,158
got mad love for you Wade so yeah it's

80
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,598
uh you know I was even talking to my

81
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:51,438
wife about it the other day we have this

82
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:53,919
long driveway it snowed about 20 times

83
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:56,359
this year and the minute it snows we're

84
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,518
both out there shoveling like crazy and

85
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,040
I'm just kind of like you know there's

86
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,680
going to be a time where we can't can't

87
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,719
do this and I wonder if our brains are

88
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,840
going to accept the fact that we can't

89
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:10,079
do it or if we're just going to do it

90
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,759
until we are injured or hurt and then

91
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,599
maybe we'll listen to our bodies and be

92
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,959
like holy [ __ ] like I don't think I can

93
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:19,759
go out there and shovel the 4,000 pounds

94
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,680
of snow again so I feel for you I know

95
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,240
you have an incredible Community around

96
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,000
you I know that you yourself have been

97
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,360
helping people in similar situations

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,478
that are unable to do things for

99
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,360
themselves and you've been such um sort

100
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:38,639
of a leading energy in that in that help

101
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,560
and I I often you know say it to my wife

102
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,199
because she's very much a helper she's

103
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,079
she doesn't take at all but you have to

104
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:50,680
understand that sometimes the the

105
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:54,279
taking is allowing someone else to help

106
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,360
which is also giving and so don't don't

107
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,519
forget that and I see that you have an

108
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,080
amazing community of people around you

109
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,560

116
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,719

118

the yeah yeah it's really interesting to

122
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,918
me how

123
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,120
um we take for granted our health and

124
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:42,439
our opportunity to do the things that we

125
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:47,560
love to do and um and yeah this came up

126
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:50,079
out of nowhere for me um back in

127
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:55,959
September uh I broke I fractured a ribs

128
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:57,478
sitting up in bed and uh it was like how

129
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,638
does that

130
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:04,519
happen and then um

131
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:08,199
over time yeah over the last few months

132
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:10,799
I've broken a bunch of ribs I I broke a

133
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,598
my collar bone on the left side here

134
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,199
trying to open a childproof pill

135
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:20,719
bottle and just fractured it cleaning

136
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,038
too um and the the type of cancer that I

137
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,120
have is called multiple

138
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:32,519
Myoma and basically it's um certain type

139
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,598
of blood cells uh bone Mar n cells uh

140
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,240
they're called

141
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:43,680
plasmans uh and they make a specific

142
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:46,079
protein that um anyway um I I'm uh my

143
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,840
body is being very good at making lots

144
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,038
and lots and lots and lots of

145
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,758
plasmas and uh what ends up happening is

146
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:58,439
it it there's so many of them they blow

147
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:02,038
holes in the bones uh so um when I look

148
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:05,000
at I've seen xray photographs of my

149
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:06,800
skeleton and it's like someone I was

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,279
shot with a shotgun there's just

151
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,879
hundreds of little holes in the bones

152
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:15,478
throughout my rib cage and Spine and

153
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,680
even my skull

154
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:21,038
um always thought I'd end up being a

155
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,038
holy man you

156
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:31,159
know so anyway yeah that's that's what's

157
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,879
happening and um

158
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,000
probably the biggest drama at the moment

159
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,479
is I have this sort of crazy object here

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,839
I don't know if you can really see it

161
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:44,399
but every time I get out of bed I have

162
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:48,758
to strap myself into this thing because

163
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:53,799
my uh my my H spine several of the

164
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:57,199
vertebrae in my spine are

165
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,240
um are eroded to the point where the

166
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,680
X-ray you can see my spinal cord it's no

167
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,519
longer longer surrounded by bone and

168
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,598
they're concerned about um ended up

169
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,799
paralyzed from U bone intruding on the

170
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:15,800
spinal cord so I'm doing a lot of bed

171
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,240
rest getting up when I can eating well

172
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,879
trying to get lots of rest Pain's

173
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,280
probably the biggest

174
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,919
issue um pain is such an interesting

175
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,318
thing it's really a sensation from the

176
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,799
body to stop doing what you're doing if

177
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,680
you can and if you can't

178
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:40,158
stop uh learn how to live with it

179
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:43,759
um but I um I have a I have a really

180
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:46,240
strong sense in myself that that I will

181
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,120
come through this that this is a thing

182
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:54,839
that uh this is not my end game if you

183
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:57,839
will I have um a very clear sense of I'm

184
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,640
I'm I'm learning about what it's like

185
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,800
for people in my situation now like you

186
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,720
said I've I've spent years helping

187
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:10,039
people in this situation but now I'm in

188
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,320
this situation and it's really um I feel

189
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:13,719
like it's an opportunity for me to help

190
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,440
more people understand what this

191
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:22,560
Situation's like and how U those of us

192
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,640
who uh look to plants and mushrooms for

193
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,399
healing

194
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:30,078
opportunities uh can really explore

195
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:33,519
what's possible um in our Medical

196
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:35,679
uh profession and the things that they

197
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,839
offer

198
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:44,639
um but really for me a lot it comes back

199
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,800
to uh caring for oneself learning to uh

200
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,919
accept

201
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:51,359
gifts uh my beloved Monica pointed out

202
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:54,919
to me that she reminded me of all the

203
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,480
people who have accepted preparations

204
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:58,000
I've made over the

205
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,240
years

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,078
and and they never opened them they put

207
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,360
them on their bed bedside and just left

208
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:09,838
them there like never really used them

209
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,159
and I feel like I'm being given that

210
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:16,279
same opportunity I have people who are

211
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:18,120
offering gifts to me on a regular basis

212
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:21,078
but if I'm not willing to open those

213
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,919
gifts and take advantage of the offering

214
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:26,479
that's been made I'm I'm like having

215
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:29,479
that sitting on the on the counter next

216
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,959
to the bed instead of opening my heart

217
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:35,720
to the uh gifts that are being offered

218
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:40,119
and uh and that's a hard part that's the

219
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:43,519
hard part of of uh

220
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,519

221
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:50,199

00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:07,879
Unitarian Church and it was he set up

309
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:10,319
the sacred mirrors he set up all his

310
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:12,198
paintings not just sacred mirrors he set

311

312
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:18,198

his work two it was live three a lot of

314
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:23,599
that shit's [ __ ] large and I had no

315
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,040
idea so because I had been to Dolly and

316
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,159
if you ever been to the dolly Museum

317
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,480
shit's really small so you never know

318
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,919
what you're going to get when you see an

319
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,159
artist and to see his work on full

320
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:34,679
display

321
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,639

322
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,958
followed ever since needless to say

323
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,839
because it touched my heart and my soul

324
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,479
and everybody who was there and a lot of

325
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:48,160
people were tripping 50th anniversary of

326
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,480

327

going to se tool for the past 25 years

339
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,079
so when they um you know and actually

340
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:26,120
during covid March 12th we were at the

341
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,559
Portland show and we were supposed to go

342
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,360
to Eugene and Beyond and it got

343
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:34,278
cancelled so we decided to take a week

344
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,600
and just go on tour um as you know best

345

mean having tul is her first

349
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,679
concert yeah that's completely insane

350
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,560
mine was Iron Maiden and Twisted Sister

351
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:54,399
and uh I was able to find some better

352
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,119
experiences down the road but I'll tell

353
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,240
you twisted sister in like 1986 was some

354
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,399
serious [ __ ] they don't want they

355
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,359
weren't going to take it they just

356
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:07,759
weren't anymore in

357
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:11,639
1985 but I just wanted to make sure I

358
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:13,240
said hi I miss you guys and um I've been

359
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,360
thinking of y'all I've been judging the

360
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:20,959
Washington craft cup I'm judging rosin

361
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:24,798
and um and I'm also judging BHO and I

362
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:27,279
just I'm so disappointed in C the the

363
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,960
fact that BHO people are using

364
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,038
CRC uh I I I don't know if y'all talked

365
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,558
about it at all but I know Oregon has

366
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:36,679
outlawed the use of

367
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:38,960
CRC um it has not happened in Washington

368
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:40,640
and nearly every entry that I'm smoking

369
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,240
is

370
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,080
CRC I see Mark looking through the top

371
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,160
of his glasses I feel like he's got

372
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:50,159
something to say about that how can they

373
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:55,080
outlaw CRC what the hell is that that's

374
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:58,919
[ __ ] right just a filtration stuff

375
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:02,359
right I mean you don't don't call it CRC

376
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,360
and then you could still do a filtration

377
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:07,959
through

378
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:09,798
some some some media I mean I don't know

379
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,960
I don't like the way it tastes at all I

380
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,038
mean you can taste it in the back of

381
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,919
your mouth um I don't know whether it's

382
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:19,759
the dious Earth that I'm tasting or any

383
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,600
of the other um you know chemicals or

384
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:25,038
bleaching agents or whatever it is that

385
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,319
they're using um in their columns but it

386
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:30,119
doesn't taste good it completely takes

387
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:33,359
away from the tpin

388
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:35,959
and I'll tell you B BHO never quite like

389
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,678
got back on its feet after that Rosen

390
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,840
knocked it down a little bit like I'm

391
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,400
I'm not saying that it's like you know

392
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,119
and I and I remember Johnny B did a

393
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,600
video called the death of BHO and I

394
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:46,519
remember being like holy [ __ ] like I'm

395
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:48,959
glad I didn't make that video because

396
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:52,759
that the BHO Community already kind of

397
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,840
hated me but um [ __ ] I'll say it was

398
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:57,759
certainly a partial death like it was a

399
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,279
blow like a blow I'll never forget like

400
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,558
giddy up being like

401
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,798
oh [ __ ] b b will always be better

402
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:08,319
than Ros and it's too hot and it's burnt

403
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:08,319
and it's like where did that [ __ ] guy

404
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,080
go now I got Nick is in uh Nick

405
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:17,159
Bradley's in there saying Oregon didn't

406
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:19,599
Outlaw CC they outlawed specific media

407
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:22,200
now I know like uh I was just in Hawaii

408
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,558
and you can't even get any type of BHO

409
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,759
extraction there however they have just

410
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:31,678
started doing Rosen and their Rosen was

411
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:33,919
[ __ ] fire uh I have to actually give

412
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,798
major props to Maui Gro and what they're

413
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,400
doing there uh for uh pressure and heat

414
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:44,720
but the quality of the rosin was first

415
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,919
rate uh still expensive it's like $76 a

416
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,519
gram retail it's

417
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,919
expensive um I may be wrong on that but

418
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,679
it's still expensive but at the same

419
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,400
time the quality is getting better and

420
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,840
being a veteran I got a discount but

421
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,159
still the prices are still outrageous

422
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:05,038
I like I like that an I got a

423
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:07,280
discount that's awesome well you know

424
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:11,319
rosin and bubble has as all of y'all

425
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,319
know are just are gonna always be

426
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,720
superior you know what to each its own I

427
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,159
love the idea of everything being

428
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,558
available I've always loved the idea of

429
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,120
you know even things that I'm not

430
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:23,240
interested in there's other people that

431
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,279
have a great interest in it in in that

432
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,480
and so I would fight for people's right

433
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:32,240
to have BHO if that's what they want

434
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,240
um I'm just uh I'm just pretty happy

435
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,880
with my full melts and my rosins but to

436
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,120
each their own for certain It's a

437
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,320
Wonderful Plan I think uh go

438
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:46,079
ahead I was just feeling like if it's a

439
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:48,759
sacramental you know sentient being

440
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:51,639
plant it should stay that way all the

441
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,640
way into the body and when you put a

442
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,679
toxic chemical into something to

443
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,799
transform it to make it somehow more

444
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:02,159
available to the market makes zero sense

445
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:04,279
on a spiritual level and on an herbal

446
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,679
level people can do what they want you

447
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:09,918
know and they will and that's fair fair

448
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,919
enough and I just like to point out that

449
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,840
cannabis is possible to be a sacred

450
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,919
sentient being and the medicine that

451
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:20,918
comes out of it can change lives and uh

452
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:25,720
you know the purer it is the better it

453
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:25,720
is on your microbiome and you're

454
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,038
yep well said Josh for sure at the same

455
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:35,879
time I used to always be amazed at like

456
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:38,919
how people could take

457
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:42,000
isopropanol or or another poison as you

458
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:44,640
call it create this ex extract and then

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,440
like cure cancer out of their body with

460
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,520
it like there's there's got to be

461
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,240
something going on there like regardless

462
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:52,119
like I I can't tell you how many people

463
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,120
I know that did that with like ISO and

464
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:57,639
and butane oil and just taking it and

465
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,158
and and ridding their body of disease I

466
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,360
got to think that

467
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:04,559
uh the power of cannabis is greater than

468
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:06,918
the power of the chemical extracting it

469
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,839
and it seems to hold over right right to

470
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:12,759
the end and I get that the Purity like

471
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,439
I'm I'm a pure guy I I love I very much

472
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:16,599
love the full Mount Bubbles and stuff

473
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,960
and I'm always like you know if my mom

474
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:20,079
got some cancer or something I'd want to

475
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,240
send her like my best full melt you know

476
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:25,038
I I probably wouldn't go buy her

477
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,480
BHO that being said you know it's hard

478
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,919
to buy 30 grams of full melt BHO or 60

479
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,278
grams or you know to have have that

480
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,480
stash whereas at one point in time

481
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:35,359
people really figured it out with BHO

482
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,159
and and that and ISO there was just you

483
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,439
could buy enough of it where it was like

484
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,840
oh some and so needs like 60 grams you

485
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,480
know to start their regimen you could

486
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:48,240
just access it and trying to find 60

487
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,440
grams of full Mount bubble would be like

488
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,960
I don't know $6,000

489
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,600
$110,000 really expensive so I love I

490
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,558
love the idea of people using what they

491
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,519
have access to and in the meantime let's

492
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,720
make sure they have access if you know

493
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:06,558
it's your vision to have the best

494
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,400
cleanest best for your biome product

495
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:09,759
well then we got to do it you know you

496
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,159
got to grow the weed I got to make the

497
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:15,200
hash and we got to make it available

498
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:17,400
dude so come on let's do

499
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,440
this let's do

500
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,159
it I think if you're trying to I think

501
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,840
if you're trying to correct disease like

502
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:28,240
maybe smoking it isn't the actual method

503
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:31,000
anyway maybe not probably move away from

504
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,240
that whole entire modality you know if

505
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
you're GNA like correct you know a

506
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,278
chronic illness and uh that's the beauty

507
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,440
of this fractal medicine is that we have

508
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:47,079
this ability to transform it into

509
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,558
different ways and you know there's

510
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,599
there's there's a lot of ways to to live

circle of people represent uh similar

542
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,038
flavors as what I think I bring in my

543
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:42,320
life and uh so much of what we do is um

544
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,599
you put it out there because it's an

545
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,398
expression of who you are not because

546
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:50,759
you think it's going to bring some sort

547
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:56,439
of fame or uh recognition or uh anything

548
00:25:50,759 --> 00:26:00,158

584
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:46,519
current wisdom you know but I inside we

585

and uh they call it you know this it's

595
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:17,240
just a powerful medicine there's even

596
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,240
stories lore about native peoples uh in

597
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,720
on the on the British Colombian

598
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:25,240
Coast uh you know trading with Chinese

599
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,159
you know for 2,000 years and Le Lee

600
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,440
Miracle is an amazing Storyteller native

601
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,399
woman from Canada everyone should know

602
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,200
about her and she's talking about Jens

603
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:38,439
sing coming from from the Chinese you

604
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,200
know 2,000 years ago and the and her

605
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,960
tribes and her native people never

606
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,798
changed the name they just call it Jin

607
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,480
sing because it came from them 2,000

608
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:49,480
years ago and parts of that remnants do

609
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,558
grow in the forest and you find Jens

610
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,319
sing around here and and I love the idea

611
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,519
that as long as there's been humans

612
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:59,639
there's been trading of medicine and you

613
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,558
know to me that's really powerful and I

614
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,120
like that we're keeping that happening

615
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:07,558
today in this modern world and when when

616
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:10,079
a person says I'm interested in plant

617
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:13,158
medicine I I think they're saying I'm

618
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,839
interested in spirit medicine as well

619
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:17,600
because the plant has a spirit and the

620
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,480
spirit comes from the environment and

621
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,519
the interaction between the human and

622
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,480
that environment and that's where the

623
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:27,599
magic comes from you know that's where

624
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:32,159
pyramids are built or things beyond the

625
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:34,000
human power so I to hold the space for

626
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,880
miraculous

627
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,640
healing and also just you know conscious

628
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,200
conscious living you know just being

629
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,640
conscious you know as best you can and

630
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,640
maybe in this moment I would like to

631
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,720

666
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:51,720
everywhere we go speaking of I'd love to

667

spend a send a special rest in peace to

668
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,600
uh a longstanding hempy who passed this

669
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,799
week his name uh Steve LaVine um he was

670
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,759
on the hemp industry Association board

671
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,519
uh I do believe he actually planted hemp

672
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:09,158
Seas on the dea's lawn so he was a

673
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:11,440
badass one of the sweetest most loving

674
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,519
hempies uh started the Santa Barbara

675
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,960
hemp company was always out educating

676
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:20,759
people for the last three decades on

677
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,319

Barbara rest in peace brother I'll see

680
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:32,558
you on the other side but uh you were an

681
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:35,880
inspiration uh pride and your smile was

682
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:38,119
unrelenting and the world is a

683
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,760
little a little less brighter without

684
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:43,719
you in it I love

685
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:47,038
you well said tan thanks for sharing

686
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:50,519
that um randomly enough Steve was one

687
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,599
gentleman whose paths mine and his never

688
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:55,519
crossed in the 30 years that we were

689
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:58,599
both involved with the plant i' I knew

690
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:02,399
who he was but we had never interacted

691
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:04,918
which is just fairly rare for me in this

692
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,918
sort of community I usually bump into

693
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:10,880
most most folks like that that are

694
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:14,639
lifers that are that are 100% dedicated

695
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,799
to the plant so yeah another cannabis

696
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:21,479
Warrior has gone to the other

697
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:23,759
side puff a um puff really quickly on a

698
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,278
positive note I'd like to just shout up

699
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:30,398
Brian at best friend Farms all of it's

700
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:32,519
positive I would like to say but and

701

Brian from best friend farms in the last

702
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:39,000
week two weeks has become pure

703
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:41,278
certified and his farm is you know

704
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,159
really coming alive over the last few

705
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,720
years you know and the whole main

706
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,799

709
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,480
stoked about Brian and the intention

710
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,519
you're putting into your products and

711
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,200
your farm and and the transformation

712
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,079
of growing all you know the food and

713
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,519
bringing in diversity you know working

714
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:08,719
with hemp Farmers local organic you know

715
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,639
cultivation uh certification groups and

716
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,398
stuff you can tell us more but you know

717
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,679
I think it's really you know Main's you

718
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:16,440
know I don't want to call it a sleeper

719
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,240
State because every State's doing a lot

720
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,559
but Main's doing a lot of interesting

721
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,918
stuff over there so and I know Colin

722
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,239
you're doing a lot of stuff traveling

723
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:27,319
all over the place I think you're in

724
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:29,398
Maine now so big up Colin big up Johnny

725
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,559
be on the

726
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:36,159
pushups thank

727
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:36,159
you thank you glad to be part of

728
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,800
it definitely

729
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,440
medicine yeah the medicine food come

730
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,519
inherently for MERS here you know it's

731
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,119
one of those things like I grew up in

732
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:53,358
the home with both and um you know

733
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,800
people were quieter before now but it's

734
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,960
it's some of the one of those things

735
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,119
that this state here uh you know has the

736
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,358
the landscape for it too where we're not

737
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,039
you know we're cold but it it's not so

738
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:06,480
cold enough to kill off a lot of the

739
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:09,000
blights through the winter and create

740
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,480
you know good top soil Continuum for the

741
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,519
next year and then we just have a lot of

742
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,119
water here uh like Michigan and like you

743
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:17,719
guys have up the A and I think that's an

744
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:19,559
interesting thing I was actually

745
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:24,118
thinking on a lot lately when it comes

746
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:26,838
to uh perhaps a hash Terre or a TP Terre

747
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,358
when you're looking at ambient humidity

748
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:30,078
or moisture

749
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:32,519
um surrounding when you kind of maybe

750
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,480
isolate or look down to the resin or the

751
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:37,400
gland and how it would exist and what

752
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,719
would be maybe a moisture bath versus a

753
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,079
very dry climate which is more conducive

754
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:44,039
for a heavy flower density healthy

755
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,280
flower but I just wanted to bring that

756
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:48,320
up a little and I you know Main's doing

757
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,280
a lot of good things with the medicine

758
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,559
and with the hash and such and starting

759
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,319
to pay attention to some of that

760
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,799
happening wanted to just talk about a

761
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:58,400
little I want to talk about hashir and

762
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,680
the word that you just just

763
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,200
invented um can we please make sure that

764
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:08,759
doesn't go past us um that was awesome

765
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:11,078
dude holy [ __ ] you came up with hashire

766
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:14,800
that hashire I like the the role on that

767
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,800
on that phrasing I was

768
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:21,838
thinking TP hashw I've heard of the I've

769
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:23,719
SE I have a sticker from Northern

770
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:26,799
California

771
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:30,719
terrist oh the terar there's being a

772
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,800
terar and and and begging up your

773
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:37,639
hashar you know I like hashar I like

774
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:40,039
hashar because it it also could include

775
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:42,598
not only you know the Terre the outside

776
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:44,880
but the indoor sort of aspect of it

777
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,838
which you know maybe there's maybe

778
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,280
there's something to that but your

779
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:51,880
hashir and your terar person have to

780
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,359
work together absolutely they have to be

781
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,960
close friends they have to smoke

782
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:58,719
together you'd have to take an effect

783
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,880
the air

784
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,759
you know because the air that's

785
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,559
happening is crucial

786
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,680
so depends on your oxygen War you know

787
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:12,759
it has to B saturation level well it's

788
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:16,838
around the same latitude right isn't

789
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,839
isn't Maine like at the same latitude as

790
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,800
BC that's I'm trying

791
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,519
to you know it's it's

792
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,358
Coastal it it's right it's kind of like

793
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:35,920
the same thing over there right a little

794
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:41,920
bit right no I mean the bottom so like

795
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:45,318
Ontario Hamilton Ontario is 43 parallel

796
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,720
which is the same as Eugene Oregon you

797
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:50,400
would never guess that Hamilton Ontario

798
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:52,519
is the same latitude as Eugene Oregon

799
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,880
until you look it up and then you're

800
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:58,679
like oh weird so like that's why there's

801
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,599
like the on what is it um Niagara on the

802
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:04,639
Lake is a town south of you know on uh

803
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,559
Toronto and it's they have huge hectares

804
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:10,279
filled with with green houses and tons

805
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:13,239
of growing you know some of the

806
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,880
original Canadian LPS were in those

807
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:16,879
those areas but so much to look it up

808
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,119
where's

809
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:23,079
Maine dude some of that some of that

810
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:25,160
southern Ontario resin like some of the

811
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:28,039
best full melt I've ever seen Grown

812
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:29,679
outdoors in Canada comes from not too

813
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,639
far from that

814
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:36,639
area Maine has some extremely talented

815
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:38,838
Growers up here I I'm really impressed

816
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:41,118
with the not only the camaraderie but

817
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,960
also the selection um and the

818
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,079
individuality that everyone brings to

819
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,559
the table here in terms of their growing

820
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,960
you know it's it's it's rare to see so

821
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:54,078
much fire on the

822
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,119
Shelf so I just looked up Portland

823
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:00,880
Portland Maine is

824
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:03,240
43 so that's that's low yeah 42nd 43rd

825
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,240
parallel I've heard 42nd being in the

826
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:11,959
51st parallel is like

827
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:14,318
hardcore it's it's a different like step

828
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,519
of cold and hardc coreness I think it's

829
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,519
why we might be getting all this

830
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:25,119
snow got three feet on

831
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,720
my how much something to do with the the

832
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,760
moisture level right and the moisture

833
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:33,159
level might have something to do with

834
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:38,960
not necessarily the terroir for growing

835
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:42,399
but for for hash making I mean uh H hash

836
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,199
making could be very very different at

837
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,160
different levels of humidity so it

838
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,239
definitely is do you think that the do

839
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,679
you think that the the would it be that

840
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:54,118
the maybe a fuller tpine expression

841
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:57,000
perhaps if it has a more of a bath of

842
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:00,800
moisture around for it to express every

843
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:05,000
aspect of that end that fraction of the

844
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,599
resin anyone know I I would I've seen a

845
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,239
lot of weed over the years not like oh

846
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,838
I've seen a lot of weed not like that

847
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:14,078
it's just we we are up in British

848
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:17,679
Columbia we go down all over all kinds

849
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,960
of contests everywhere and definitely

850
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,239
found that and even in California and

851
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,240
Oregon people use shade cloth in the

852
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:27,318
middle of the day and and the intense

853
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:29,000
heat because the resin heads like they

854
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:30,800
get closer into the bud you might say oh

855
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,880
there's a lot more resin heads because

856
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,039
you have a bigger flower and in the end

857
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,440
you might even have higher yields in

858
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,079
California but you know for example

859
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,200
California I'll just say for example but

860
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,318
uh you know up in British Columbia or or

861
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:47,639
up in the farther north where the the

862
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:51,838
bulbs get more they're get more

863
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:54,598
identified the the the they the flower

864
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:59,239
isn't as tight and the way that the the

865
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:59,240
hash the heads knock off and the

866
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:18,720
or not it's just in these areas you can

867
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:20,159
get a a more full expression in certain

868
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,159
in certain it might be harder it's

869
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:26,519
harder to grow though because you don't

870
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:28,358
get in some ways it doesn't express the

871
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:30,838
same so you have to use a greenhouse so

872
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:33,920
there's a lot that's a huge story it's a

873
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:36,559
huge story so that's why in some cases

874
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,318
we use green houses right because we get

875
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:41,480
the best expression because we're

876
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:43,759
capturing the heat of our Northern

877
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,199
climate and finishing it off before the

878
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,079
cold nights if we try and play around

879
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:51,000
with cold nights around here there's not

880
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,200
a turp to be seen you know what I mean

881
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,880
the the the the plant stops growing of

882
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:59,239
course we have outdoor varietals that

883
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,240
that

884
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:21,318
the resin heads are big and uh make for

885
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:24,318
in some cases even more greasier style

886
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:26,558
hash I agree with that that's what we're

887
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,759
finding here actually and it's a funny

888
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,440
it's interesting because the hash game

889
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,920
has kind of changed a lot to where it

890
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,400
goes to you know full melt or rosin and

891
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,680
people are looking for that real true

892
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,760
turp expression like a lot about the

893
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:43,879
flavor we all know it's going to be

894
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,880
potent but yeah I it's interesting

895
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:51,160
conversation I mean the

896
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,039
outo outdoor main one the out the ego

897
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:55,480
clash in California this year and that

898
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,960
that says something says one thing or

899
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,920
two you could figure out what they are

900
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,760
yeah and I I find all right so I find on

901
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,880
the East Coast predominantly you know to

902
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,680
not not to put this versus anything just

903
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,599
in terms of difference in climate um

904
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:12,239
having that moisture during your cure or

905
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:16,559
your your drying

906
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:19,318
process um it really truly does help um

907
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:22,720
retain a lot of the the the volatiles

908
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:25,920
that are there it it and it seems that

909
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,959
there's almost a uh a more control that

910
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,880
you can bring over the the whole process

911
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:34,440
in itself um that produces a more uh

912
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,838
robust

913
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,960
profile and it's uh it's something that

914
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:41,199
I I've I've really noticed over the

915
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,280
years and and I truly believe that the

916
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:48,558
climate up in Maine up here is really

917
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:51,839
conducive to uh super turpy varietals

918
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,839
and it's it's really due to the

919
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,519
environment we're getting a lot of big

920
00:43:55,639 --> 00:44:00,759
resin heads too like in the 120 range

921
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:04,039
like uh yeah what joshu was saying

922
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,720
really really greasy turpy greasy greasy

923
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:08,318
and then a big big extra big dump

924
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:11,078
especially in the greenhouse later

925
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:14,079
finish that can go to full maturity but

926
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:18,280
we're seeing on the 120 Micron like

927
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:20,760
almost overpowering the 90 by by two lat

928
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,240
what about the 160 on

929
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,760
that sometimes you do see one I haven't

930
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:25,759
been hitting

931
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,680
it yeah I've gotten full m out right up

932
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:34,000
to 190 when I went and years ago I went

933
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,879
to Lugano to run material and I'll never

934
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,719
forget it in fact I took a picture of

935
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,000
the hashes with their microns written

936
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:42,519
down to them and it was kind of a not a

937
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,239
very good picture at the time um but it

938
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:47,318
got printed in Redeye magazine um

939
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:51,199
because it was sort of like from the 25

940
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:54,558
micron to the 190 Micron every single

941
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:57,279
grade uh melted and bubbled and you know

942
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:59,400
substantially too not like one was was a

943
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,800
Sizzler and the other ones were melting

944
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,720
like ice cubes but they were all like

945
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:07,599
ice cubes it was uh I haven't really

946
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:10,639
seen anything like it since I have to be

947
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:13,680
honest we definitely don't get a lot of

948
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:15,960
160 in our off our farm for whatever

949
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:18,598
reason it is and but we'll put it in

950
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,318
there just to clean it up and make it

951
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:25,440
sweet for what's below you know so the

952
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:27,358
220 190 160 just to keep it like super

953
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,400
clean down below we'll we'll go through

954
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:31,920
that effort but we don't get a lot out

955
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,318
of the 160 we play around with

956
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,760
it I can't remember who was talking but

957
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:39,318
they were even talking about 190 and and

958
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,720
possibly using a 250 instead of a 220

959
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:42,800
because they thought the 220 was

960
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:44,519
capturing heads and I remember reading

961
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,640
this conversation and being like okay

962
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:50,119
that's those are like really big

963
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:52,759
heads yeah I think Marcus we talked

964
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:54,760
about that a bit where I was asking

965
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:59,079
would it make sense to to add another

966
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:01,800
bag there to C had 250 years ago I used

967
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:03,760
to have a 250 and not too many people

968
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,440
needed it but just recently there was

969
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,079
another conversation not me or you a

970
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,200
group of guys talking about how they

971
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,480
were capturing all these heads in their

972
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:15,000
190s and they thought that they were

973
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,400
losing some in their 220 and they they

974
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,880
ended up getting a 250 and finding heads

975
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,880
in their 220 and not saying it's

976
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,400
impossible but it's just uh it's neat to

977
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:29,200
see people are doing things that I've

978
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:31,960
never really you know seen I like that

979
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:33,799

using your 304 screen and a lot of the

982
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,200
heads on finding on that and I had the

983
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:43,199
coas come back were actually quite high

984
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:45,960
in THC I was quite surprised so going

985
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,919
with those lower uh screens I just

986
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:52,679
that's 45 microns so that'll be like

987
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:57,519
should be if you purify them in the 40

988
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:58,679
to 60 maybe even 65 range got a 42

989
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:01,759
Micron

990
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:06,239
yesterday uh well I meant THC percent

991
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:09,599

00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,798

1090
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:22,358
it's it's awesome and I and dude the

1091
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:24,639
transformation insane you know and then

1092
00:51:22,358 --> 00:51:26,960
like there it's like the the song your

1093
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:29,480
theme song is Ain't No Stopping Us Now

1094
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,240
you know type thing look at you and you

1095
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:35,000
can't even see him he's half

1096
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:38,000
gone yeah I'm 150.2 pounds morning I've

1097
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,599
been 150 pounds now for over three and a

1098
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,639
half months and I've had my weight off

1099
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:44,519
so I found that happy medium I didn't

1100
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:46,239
try for a weight I didn't set any goals

1101
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:48,318
I just went to where my body naturally

1102
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:50,919
went and now that I've I've done the

1103
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:53,400
research on my see my grandfathers and

1104
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,039
my grandfather's opas and my great

1105
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,200
ancestors were all between 135 and 150

1106
00:51:56,039 --> 00:52:00,199
so this is my natural weight through my

1107
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:02,439
through my Heritage and stuff like that

1108
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:05,719
my father was I posted a picture of him

1109
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:07,798
in 1964 he was 145 pounds you know what

1110
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:09,959
I mean so this is where I was supposed

1111
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:11,199
to be so once you find your natural

1112
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,358
weight you just kind of want to being

1113
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:16,318
happy there I can eat whatever I want

1114
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:18,318
but I I eat more water density foods and

1115
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:21,318
I pay attention to my health I smoke a

1116
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:22,920
lot of dabs too right I mean I did my

1117
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:25,159
biggest dab and I did my most amount of

1118

roping because my arms were hurting a

1178
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:45,280
little bit and then I started looking up

1179
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,880
all this jump roping challenges and

1180
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,798
stuff and then I started seeing this a

1181
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,200
lot of stuff that was like oh if you do

1182
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:55,159
like a thousand jumps a day you

1183
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:57,078
completely transform your body and then

1184
00:54:55,159 --> 00:55:00,480
you start seeing all this beautiful

1185
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:02,079
dancing Styles and all this like timing

1186
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,798
things and stuff and all these different

1187
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,559
kinds of ropes and everything and so was

1188
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:07,960
been kind of enjoying it and I was and

1189
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,839
then I and I heard this thing on the

1190
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,720
radio and whether it's it's kind of

1191
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:14,880
weird but like uh in China they said

1192
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:18,480
that every child has to be able to jump

1193
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:21,680
a hundred times in order to go to school

1194
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:25,159
so that's weird right but then I was

1195
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:27,118
like can I jump a hundred times in a row

1196
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:29,920
in a minute I think it has to be in a

1197
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:32,680
minute think of how many kids might not

1198
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,079
make it like from different countries if

1199
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:36,279
you just were like Hey we're going to

1200
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:39,160
take you and go to school and now I

1201
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,440

1202
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:42,879

1203
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,480
healthy and being able to jump and being

1204
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,920
able to walk and then I started looking

1205
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,920
at all these workouts and these like

1206
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,519

00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:27,240
well true story Man true

1240
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,119
story um we should go back to talking

1241
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:31,358
about the size of the Tricom heads and

1242
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,920
the greasiness and the dryness and the

1243
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:34,000
different environments because I don't

1244
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,318
know if I was done with that

1245
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,440
conversation there uh definitely was

1246
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:42,279
inspired to hear Johnny B's story and

1247
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:44,318
was stoked on that but uh yeah let's see

1248
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,680
if we can someone is someone gonna make

1249
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:50,960
a 420 Micron bag now is that what you're

1250
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:53,239
saying yeah the 420 Micron bag

1251
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:56,679
exactly it's amazing how little

1252
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:58,838
Innovation there really is it's um

1253
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:01,598
it's kind of crazy I mean even myself

1254
00:57:58,838 --> 00:58:03,318
all I did was add some bags it's like in

1255
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,359
the long run I'm kind of waiting for the

1256
00:58:03,318 --> 00:58:07,558
next big thing here to happen rosin was

1257
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:09,960
amazing that was huge that was [ __ ]

1258
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:12,359
pretty gigantic for an and and it goes

1259
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,440
to show you too like you know there's

1260
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:17,239
Direction and I know there's people that

1261
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:19,400
call [ __ ] on Phil's story I have no

1262
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:22,679
reason not to believe Phil's story about

1263
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:25,440
him just you know pressing out the the

1264
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:28,038
hash in parchment to make dabs that was

1265
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,240
you know definitely remember niik doing

1266
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:33,799
that and that whole Colorado crew doing

1267
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:36,239
that um jibs and and kenwall and whatnot

1268
00:58:33,798 --> 00:58:38,318
and so it's just neat that at one point

1269
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:41,639
in time he ran out of hash and for some

1270
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:45,079
reason was driven to put a bud into the

1271
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:49,239
parchment paper and it's amazing too

1272
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:51,798
that people knew that concept from years

1273
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:54,759
past when they were you know pressing

1274
00:58:51,798 --> 00:58:56,519
hash and oil was was gooping out of the

1275
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,000
the filter bags and whatnot and they

1276
00:58:56,519 --> 00:59:00,960
were collecting it and saving it for

1277
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,719
their heads but not enough to actually

1278
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:07,440
have the the the gear turn in their

1279
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:09,519
brain to make that an available thing or

1280
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:14,920
uh you know a process but you can see

1281
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:17,400
how how this changes everything and the

1282
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:20,720
people communicating and sharing

1283
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:23,039
information through this so many people

1284
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:25,598
were able to get eyes on that and I I

1285
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:26,680
remember in the Cannabis industry and

1286
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,280
community

1287
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:33,000
that rosin was the first thing to spread

1288
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:37,319
on Instagram like wild

1289
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,318
fire I froze

1290
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,039
bummer that's a

1291
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:46,960
bummer last four years since it's been

1292
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:48,960
created how many machines are actually

1293
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:52,000
out there in companies that are actually

1294
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,880
processing and making machines you know

1295
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,159
yep how does even one go about figuring

1296
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,160
out which machine to get nowadays

1297
00:59:57,159 --> 01:00:01,920
whereas four years ago they didn't even

1298
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:05,279
exist now you have your choice of

1299
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:08,440
selection depending on your production

1300
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,798
model so I mean it is pretty

1301
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:13,880
incredible

1302
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:16,599
totally people watching that here

1303
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:19,358
remember we were in in Barcelona and and

1304
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:21,039
and you know Brian came out and actually

1305
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:24,159
made it with us while we were in the

1306
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:27,079
hash Museum and now here we are years

1307
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:30,078
later and there's literally machines to

1308
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:33,920
press your tonnage it's quite amazing

1309
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:38,400
just the adaptability as well as where

1310
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:40,760
legalization or um uh accepted adult

1311
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,880
youth in various countries and states

1312
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:46,520
have allowed industrial personnel as

1313
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:48,920
well as chemical chemists to start

1314
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:51,440
playing with this plant that we have

1315
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,599
never had that opportunity prior and

1316
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,720
that are taking it really seriously so I

1317
01:00:53,599 --> 01:01:03,079
could definitely see some other um

1318
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:07,038
Horizon benchmarks on the way yeah

1319
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:11,280
yeah the note oh go ahead Johnny be's

1320
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:13,799
got the first rosin maker out

1321
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:16,839
actually yeah I mean it went from hair

1322
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:20,880
straighteners to Arbor to a hand press

1323
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:22,639
Arbor press to hydraulic Arbor press and

1324
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,000
then yeah because everybody ran out and

1325
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:26,318
started pressing and and destroying

1326
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,679
their girlfriend friends hair

1327
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:30,798
straightener to where they're like you

1328
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:34,279
better go get your [ __ ] own now dude

1329
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:36,358
yeah yeah but yeah I mean you know now

1330
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:40,000
it's not about throughput anymore just

1331
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:42,480
about you know quality selection and you

1332
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,798
know your personal intuition as to how

1333
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,760
you want to make your hash and what you

1334
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:48,119
want to select and there's just so much

1335
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:51,559
you

1336
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:54,000
know will always be connected to the

1337
01:01:51,559 --> 01:01:56,079
amount of people you want to touch so

1338
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,679
it's easy to do small batch and you can

1339
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:01,720
very comfortable in small batch but

1340
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:04,199
trying to do large batch small batch

1341
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:06,959
quality and caliber with the living

1342
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:10,480
soils and the proper growing that is the

1343
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,358
true challenge that in my opinion is why

1344
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,240
we're

1345
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:16,558
here yeah well you've also got the small

1346
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:19,038
screens you've got the the pressure so

1347
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:21,119
you've got a whole series of new

1348
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,079
technology that we've never necessarily

1349
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,920
played it with in the sense of you know

1350
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:26,880
what Micron screen are you particularly

1351
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,760
using for this type of genetic to

1352
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,318
actually get this particular squish at

1353
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,640
what temperature how long was your press

1354
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:38,639
and again it's the lower the temperature

1355
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:40,239
is still the uh the safety of the day

1356
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:43,719
because if you go too high as you know

1357
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:47,078
it every temperature affects flavor

1358
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:49,358
correct absolutely yeah and not not

1359
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:51,519
always not always bad and not always

1360
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:53,358
good right like you know you could see

1361
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:55,838
it in the good way whereas maybe you've

1362
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:58,318
got a cultivar with some monot Turpin

1363
01:02:55,838 --> 01:03:00,400
that aren't like the most enjoyable

1364
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:03,400
those are going to pop off probably

1365
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:06,720
pretty quick in the process re re sort

1366
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:08,798
of showing a new bouquet that is now

1367
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:10,679
there the sesua and the heavier Tarpin

1368
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:13,159
that didn't volatize off quite so

1369
01:03:10,679 --> 01:03:15,759
quickly um sometimes it works the other

1370
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:17,679
way sometimes people are like o i i I

1371
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,720
hear it all the time it smelt like burnt

1372
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:23,000
popcorn this that and the other thing I

1373
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:25,439
don't ever smoke rosin that smells like

1374
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,838
burnt popcorn I'm not sure why people

1375
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,920
think that's what all rosin is like it's

1376
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:32,679
actually as nice as any extract that you

1377
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:35,639
could do if it's done prop it's what

1378
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:37,278
their experience was I think they had

1379
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:39,358
access to some crappy stuff so they

1380
01:03:37,278 --> 01:03:41,599
think it's crappy if they had access to

1381
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:44,239
the Quality rosin even the stuff that I

1382
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:46,400
just recently saw in Hawaii you would be

1383
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:47,919
thinking twice and you wouldn't even

1384
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,838
utter those sort of things out of your

1385
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,798
mouth because the quality is is at the

1386
01:03:50,838 --> 01:03:56,558
nasal and passes right across the pallet

1387
01:03:53,798 --> 01:03:58,960
now yeah and I think back to what Marcus

1388
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:01,480
was saying supply chain is is really

1389
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:04,720
important to note it's it's like if you

1390
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:06,278
don't have your inputs down you're is

1391
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:09,318
you're going to struggle to make quality

1392
01:04:06,278 --> 01:04:11,719
material and especially scale it's just

1393
01:04:09,318 --> 01:04:14,679
it's just it is impossible and and

1394
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:16,439
that's that's the struggle I mean I yeah

1395
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:19,399
that's what we really truly need right

1396
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:22,278
now is is agricultural experience and

1397
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:26,798
Horticultural experience to

1398
01:04:22,278 --> 01:04:28,079
merge uh ideologies to to try to to you

1399
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:30,079
know if they're if that's going to

1400
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,839
happen at scale it's that's that's the

1401
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:34,920
way it has to go but also sort of you

1402
01:04:32,838 --> 01:04:36,558
know the people who run companies and

1403
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:39,079
have an understanding on how to do that

1404
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:40,760
that sort of corporate aspect and

1405
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:43,680
whatever you want to call the rest of us

1406
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:45,880
Legacy you know Roots the Roots and the

1407
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:47,318
suits like you also need to kind of like

1408
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,480
there are things that they're really

1409
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:51,519
good at and if they stopped sort of

1410
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:54,880
doing it in nefarious

1411
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:58,400
ways um it could it it you know like I

1412
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:01,318
said it's it's hard to touch that many

1413
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:03,119
people I I I love the idea of being able

1414
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:05,000
to help my friends and my local

1415
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,720
community and growing and you know

1416
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,159
getting more and more people involved

1417
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:12,679
but I also love the idea of just being

1418
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:14,879
able to say to anyone in my country you

1419
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:17,639
can just go here and get that like it's

1420
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:20,160
available like I I I hate the idea that

1421
01:05:17,639 --> 01:05:22,719
people have been feeling for so long

1422
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:24,318
that when I share something nice and I'm

1423
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:27,358
like oh look at this bubble hash it's

1424
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:30,239
like a six-star it's super nice they

1425
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:31,838
just can't go and get some you know CU

1426
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:34,798
that's what when if I see anyone's

1427
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:37,078
beautiful stash that's what I want to do

1428
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:40,358
locked sorry I froze up there for a

1429
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:42,079
second U but that's Thea that's the

1430
01:05:40,358 --> 01:05:45,199
beauty of you teaching everyone how to

1431
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:48,559
do it because you know it is possible

1432
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:50,439
for a lot of people to do even a four

1433
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,599
you know plant thing in their house

1434
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:54,760
which tons of people do now and and it

1435
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:56,640
is true that more and more people are

1436
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:58,200
beginning to make their own but I get

1437
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:00,480
totally not to take away from have the

1438
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:02,239
beauty of being able to go to the store

1439
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,920
but now that's even a threat for

1440
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:07,838
different reasons but yes hi everybody

1441
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:10,960
Wade I love you just wanted to tell you

1442
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:14,558
how much I loved you and hi everybody

1443
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:16,920
happy Sunday so nice to be here we're so

1444
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:18,960
we have so much snow it's been like such

1445
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:22,680
a journey almost like couldn't find our

1446
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:25,278
place right now because we're so snowed

1447
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:27,558
in it's pretty wild isn't it this is the

1448
01:06:25,278 --> 01:06:30,440
most snow we've seen in the 26 years of

1449
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:30,440
living in British

1450
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:39,000
Columbia yeah definitely I feel like we

1451
01:06:34,519 --> 01:06:41,119
had one maybe like in 2002 or something

1452
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,639
like that that was a really huge winter

1453
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:45,880
but I think this one is surpassing it

1454
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:48,719
because we're just still in early

1455
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,960
January but it's awesome all of the

1456
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:53,318
water that's happening in the mountains

1457
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:57,519
and this kind of snow really seems to

1458
01:06:53,318 --> 01:06:57,519
reset soil too

1459
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:05,240
probably be seeing different pests even

1460
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:07,159
some pests will probably go away and uh

1461
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:09,159
you know so the Cycles continue so we'll

1462
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:12,358
be excited for spring and what these

1463
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:16,480
heavy snows bring us I'm scared I live

1464
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:19,038
in abfer [ __ ] I hope it doesn't oh yeah

1465
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,880
wow you guys had the hellacious

1466
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:24,278
floods yeah my

1467
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,720
basement I I fought water for a while

1468
01:07:24,278 --> 01:07:27,318
but that's okay you know what like you

1469
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:29,239
said we need the water and stuff like

1470
01:07:27,318 --> 01:07:32,079
that but that looks nice I know Mark's

1471
01:07:29,239 --> 01:07:33,879
Place he's got a beautiful view there at

1472
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,318
least you hopefully you don't get like a

1473
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,358
mud

1474
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:39,798
slide

1475
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:41,119
yeah that's the thing all the slides and

1476
01:07:39,798 --> 01:07:42,400
all the things that are happening with

1477
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:44,079
all this weather and all these big

1478
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,000
changes I mean we went

1479
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:48,559
from water like crazy to the minus

1480
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,318
weather to everything freezing to all

1481
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:52,039
this snow then the melts and then in

1482
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:53,838
Ontario I mean I was out there and it

1483
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:56,240
was like plus seven it should be minus

1484
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:57,719
40 you know what I mean like

1485
01:07:56,239 --> 01:08:00,558
it's going to be good out there I think

1486
01:07:57,719 --> 01:08:04,159
we just got everybody's got to

1487
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:06,760
grow how to share the snow it's a great

1488
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:09,000
time it's a great time to make hash it

1489
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:12,319
is so like what what we've done is okay

1490
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:15,278
so on the note of you know having large

1491
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:17,278
large Tricom heads you know there's the

1492
01:08:15,278 --> 01:08:20,079
thing of like oh we're gonna harvest the

1493
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,880
plant early to try and get the lighter

1494
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:23,960
colored hash and then the buds aren't

1495
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:26,159
going to be as full and then they you

1496
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,520
know then that that's that's not cool I

1497
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:30,639
don't you know I don't I don't agree

1498
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,960
with that but it happens it happens some

1499
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,719
Instagram

1500
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:37,679
[ __ ] did you know I

1501
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:40,198
know and then uh the one some of the

1502
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:42,880
best hash we've ever made was upon ganja

1503
01:08:40,198 --> 01:08:45,399
Gill's recommendation um the the the

1504
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,880
snow was coming in and we just washed

1505
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:50,559
hash straight out of the greenhouse so

1506
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,359
it was starting to freeze for the first

1507
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:55,039
time the plants were really nice and we

1508
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:58,679
just took plants and washed them right

1509
01:08:55,039 --> 01:09:01,079
in in the actual Greenhouse itself and

1510
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:03,719
uh it was amazing the the tpping content

1511
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:06,519
on that was amazing we did it at night

1512
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:08,759
too and so I think that you know there's

1513
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,960
there's definitely harvesting the plant

1514
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:14,520
in in the evening you know the morning

1515
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:18,319
hours before the sun comes up and

1516
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:20,159
letting the the the the tricomes uh

1517
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,319
mature as much as they can and then just

1518
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:25,679
finding ways to wash them as fresh as

1519
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:25,679
they can be

1520
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:39,640
silence two and a half month hang dry to

1521
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,960
see if I can make some really good uh

1522
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,960
hash

1523
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:54,839
today so today's the day a bunch of

1524
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:57,120
different screens I'm go some buds on

1525
01:09:54,840 --> 01:10:00,159
some screen and make some hash I hope

1526
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,158
everybody makes some hash

1527
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,760
today do

1528
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:15,440
you I don't know like so like I honestly

1529
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:18,198
I think this idea of of something fresh

1530
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:21,559
and interesting happened when when color

1531
01:10:18,198 --> 01:10:24,279
came into the mix and and I don't I I

1532
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,920
think that it's good hash is good hash I

1533
01:10:24,279 --> 01:10:27,479
don't

1534
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,239
I I don't think there's the education

1535
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:33,479
yet around hash and color and pigment

1536
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:37,599
and why it's a certain color um but I

1537
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:37,599
think you know

1538
01:11:06,279 --> 01:11:11,599
nothing to do this meeting is being

1539
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:12,960
recorded you know and it's that's that's

1540
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,840
the thing I think it's really important

1541
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:19,399
for people to understand is that quality

1542
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:21,880
hash is um has a lot to do with how the

1543
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:24,759
heads were grown and how that resin was

1544
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:27,800
actually cared for before it became hash

1545
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:29,640
um is we're we're really just filtering

1546
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:33,199
the plant material to collect that

1547
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:35,199
material we are the unveils of the flame

1548
01:11:33,198 --> 01:11:37,279
yeah exactly and that's that's exactly

1549
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:39,879
right and that's you know as you've

1550
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:43,039
always said Marcus it's it's Fire and

1551
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:45,119
Fire out um and how you grew that that

1552
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:47,039
varietal if you let it go longer you may

1553
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:50,079
have Amber heads there and your hash

1554
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:51,560
just may be Amber and that might not be

1555
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:56,639
a bad thing

1556
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:59,280
whatsoever um I think that's just

1557
01:11:56,639 --> 01:12:00,440
I'm curi like I just listen sorry to

1558
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:04,000
interrupt you

1559
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:06,960
but yeah do you think then fully mature

1560
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:10,039
Colin and fresh frozen trapped then

1561
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:12,639
would be the most the uh fullest tarpine

1562
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:17,679
profile expression from the plant any

1563
01:12:12,639 --> 01:12:20,039
call on that or car versus fres I think

1564
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:23,319
I would I believe at least maybe the the

1565
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:25,399
canono Spectrum itself is is IM mature

1566
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:27,479
at a more mature state so you might have

1567
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:30,638
a larger spread of and a higher

1568
01:12:27,479 --> 01:12:33,079
percentage point of these miners um in

1569
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:35,239
terms of these you know the volatile

1570
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:36,559
chemicals there I mean I I don't I think

1571
01:12:35,238 --> 01:12:37,919
it depends on the variety I think

1572
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,920
there's a lot to be studied there in

1573
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,279
terms of when to actually take something

1574
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:44,279
for the purpose of the turpion

1575
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:47,840
production um I do think there is a

1576
01:12:44,279 --> 01:12:49,880
falloff point uh where Turpin do peak in

1577
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,679
the the terpenoids itself and all those

1578
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:55,719
those volatiles do start to fall off at

1579
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:57,679
certain weaks so um but there's a lot to

1580
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:59,880
to explore there in terms of

1581
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:02,719
understanding

1582
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,719
that did it say this meeting is being

1583
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,480
recorded when I came in cuz that kind of

1584
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,960
made me chuckle and I thought imagine

1585
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:10,839
like 25 30 years ago if I came into a

1586
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:14,279
room and a voice announced that the

1587
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:16,039
meeting was being recorded that's uh oh

1588
01:13:14,279 --> 01:13:18,279
we would all

1589
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:21,319
left an out I might have even got

1590
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:23,359
stomped out I don't know but uh this

1591
01:13:21,319 --> 01:13:25,759
meeting is being

1592
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:27,679
recorded yeah it's still the antithesis

1593
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:30,480
of my thought and my upbringing from

1594
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:33,840
anything I was taught from using pagers

1595
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:35,959
and payones and being described on the

1596
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,639
side streets and you know hustling and

1597
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:41,079
meeting in bathroom stalls and [ __ ] like

1598
01:13:38,639 --> 01:13:43,359
that and here we are you know completely

1599
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:44,840
comfortable and legal to the point talk

1600
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:46,559
being recorded and we're talking to the

1601
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:50,000
about the drugs and [ __ ] that we used to

1602
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:51,679
deal deal with grow illegally Etc it's

1603
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,359
I'll tell you we really did change our

1604
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:58,480
reality didn't we we did we changed our

1605
01:13:54,359 --> 01:14:00,158
reality who and I know un lot of it

1606
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:02,799
needs to be changed I know there's still

1607
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:04,799
people in cages and all sorts of heinous

1608
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:07,159
[ __ ] going around the world we're not

1609
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:10,079
done but the fact that it could be done

1610
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:12,479
even on a small scale means that it can

1611
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:15,800
be done on a large one which is once

1612
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:20,559
again why it's so important to do things

1613
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:24,600
on a large scale so everyone gets to

1614
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:26,000
enjoy the fruits of our labor wait not

1615
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,600
only that Marcus you're were going to

1616
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,679
cord your drug talk and you're going to

1617
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,239
share it with the world yeah except

1618
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:34,719
Russia they don't [ __ ] with my [ __ ] they

1619
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:36,279
they don't let me play I don't I don't

1620
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:38,439
think you can play Bubble man's world in

1621
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:40,158
Russia

1622
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:42,638
unfortunately

1623
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:45,920
really for sure I get letters every once

1624
01:14:42,639 --> 01:14:50,440
in a while from like Russian government

1625
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:53,480
saying that uh bubble man's world is not

1626
01:14:50,439 --> 01:14:55,559
welcome I guess China

1627
01:14:53,479 --> 01:14:58,000
would I wanted to say say that we're all

1628
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:59,880
talking about us changing you know our

1629
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,800
reality and the way that the industry is

1630
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:05,560
going and the way that the community is

1631
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:08,320
talking about it more in the way that

1632
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:11,199
the world is incorporating cannabis more

1633
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:13,719
but it really is just the Cannabis so

1634
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:16,960
the more that cannabis spreads the more

1635
01:15:13,719 --> 01:15:19,079
ability that minds are open the more

1636
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:22,279
Minds that are open the more heart

1637
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:24,519
spaces that are open and all we are

1638
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:26,960
doing is just stewarding her into more

1639
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,320
and more ways to make this world a

1640
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:33,319
better place and it's just so amazing

1641
01:15:29,319 --> 01:15:38,000
that plant medicine just keeps showing

1642
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:41,960
itself as the Cure All for both mental

1643
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:45,000
physical emotional communal everything

1644
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:47,639
space so I think that this show and what

1645
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:52,679
you've been doing for so long Marcus is

1646
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:55,800
just continuing to allow the plant to go

1647
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:57,600
through doors that it may have not

1648
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:01,199
otherwise gone

1649
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:04,840
through so so much gratitude for

1650
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:06,919
everybody for continuing knocking at the

1651
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,840
doors everybody that's everybody

1652
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:11,520
listening you know we continue to push

1653
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:15,319
this plant forward and show her out in a

1654
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:18,000
good way and have healthy concentrates

1655
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:19,880
and healthy conversations better soil

1656
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
then it's only going to make the world a

1657
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:24,000
better place because then the plant is

1658
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,600
just doing what it's supposed to do

1659
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,719
we'll have a better health Healthy Mind

1660
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:32,120
Body and soil yeah and then hash yeah

1661
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:33,279
and we always talk about you know all of

1662
01:16:32,119 --> 01:16:36,880
the

1663
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:39,519
different uh ways to make hash and how

1664
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:42,560
to decompose you know like break it all

1665
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,280
down and I think that it really just

1666
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,719
gets back to the most important thing

1667
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:49,719
about hash is that we're ingesting it

1668
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:52,319
and that uh we just continue to grow

1669
01:16:49,719 --> 01:16:55,520
through the ingestion of it so I'm G to

1670
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:58,880
have a bong hit right now

1671
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:00,320
love all y'all happy New Year bong rib

1672
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,960
for

1673
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:03,960
Wade is this the first

1674
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:10,280
house yeah this is the first hash one of

1675
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:13,639
the new year

1676
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:16,920
yeah well here's the growing into

1677
01:17:13,639 --> 01:17:21,480
2022 looking at new Innovations new ways

1678
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:24,119
of making hash and uh new ways of

1679
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:27,359
growing guys the industry is changing so

1680
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:30,760
much it's awesome with light and and and

1681
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:34,119
and technology and and all these yeah

1682
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:36,280
like wow I got to look at them a rolling

1683
01:17:34,119 --> 01:17:37,800
machine that rolls like 10,000 joints a

1684
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:40,000
day or something it was at the lift

1685
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:43,199
conference and seeing this [ __ ] that's

1686
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:48,119
happening it's a the future is kind

1687
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:50,039
of growing fast guys well it is growing

1688
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:52,319
but at the same time we're still dealing

1689
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:54,600
with prohibition I'm watching our

1690
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:55,559
dragonfly people who are using a puff go

1691
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,440
Peak

1692
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:59,320
and if I am correct in my understanding

1693
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:03,319
puffco Peak went out of business because

1694
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:06,039
the vaporizing can no longer be mailed

1695
01:18:03,319 --> 01:18:08,079
so I mean even things like that even as

1696
01:18:06,039 --> 01:18:10,439
much as we take two steps forward we're

1697
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:13,079
still taking a few steps back from time

1698
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:15,879
to time so even those that have found a

1699
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:18,359
way for ingestion for our methodology

1700
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:21,159
that's different that's more portable

1701
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:24,799
even they are still coming under attack

1702
01:18:21,158 --> 01:18:27,399
and persuasion and manipulations that's

1703
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:30,480
still do not allow us to inbi our full

1704
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:32,839
freedoms yet so it's a it's why we know

1705
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:35,439
it's not ignorance it's why we know it's

1706
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:38,600
not ignorance it's straight it's the

1707
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:41,479
demons you know it's an agenda it's not

1708
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:43,920
like we're ever G to open their minds

1709
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:46,959
that's like not ever

1710
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:50,158
happening but you know they control the

1711
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:52,119
board and so it's like a game of chess

1712
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:54,198
and you know Kelly kind of nailed it

1713
01:18:52,119 --> 01:18:56,479
we're just there kind of opening all

1714
01:18:54,198 --> 01:18:59,359
these doors like hey cannabis quick

1715
01:18:56,479 --> 01:19:01,399
through here you know still suffering

1716
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:03,759
the whack-a-mole unfortunately you know

1717
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:06,079
what I'm saying but it shows you the

1718
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:08,960
persuasiveness of our persuasion that

1719
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:11,119
we're actually making end roads through

1720
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:13,880
different access and points through

1721
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:16,719
society and that Society is still trying

1722
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:19,119
to you know still put it into its own

1723
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:21,560
pedestal or hide it away still as

1724
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:23,599
opposed to giving it what we actually

1725
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:25,920
crave which is the freedom and the

1726
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:28,960
desire for others to start being able to

1727
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:31,560
go beyond the puffco Peaks to go beyond

1728
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:34,520
these electric attachments Etc to find

1729
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:38,159
the next better ingestion methodology or

1730
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:39,920
modality that is you know again we have

1731
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:42,679
to fight to legalize even simple

1732
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:45,000
modality access much less what we're

1733
01:19:42,679 --> 01:19:48,000
actually em bibing and putting in them

1734
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,158
so it's just interesting the steps and

1735
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,719
that we've had to continuously to take

1736
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:55,079
as we make our progress so it just

1737
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:57,840
reminders people Eternal vigilance still

1738
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:59,920
have to uh get out speak voice write

1739
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:02,000
your letters protest and do the things

1740
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,440
that you know got us here we ain't done

1741
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,600
yet people are still in

1742
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:10,399
jail the best thing we can do is is is

1743
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:13,159
all of what etan just

1744
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:15,519
said and also I'd like to just point out

1745
01:20:13,158 --> 01:20:17,599
that the Snodgrass family and the glass

1746
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:20,040
blowing industry from the very beginning

1747
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,360
in the early 90s felt those exact same

1748
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:25,158
pressures where you know they started

1749
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:27,679
grow blowing glass teaching everyone one

1750
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:30,599
all of a sudden epicenter out of

1751
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:32,319
Eugene next thing you know there's

1752
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:35,000
serious money being made and all of a

1753
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:36,319
sudden the government gets excited so

1754
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,600
you know they they all of a sudden

1755
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:40,519
couldn't you know people couldn't send

1756
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:42,840
glass state to state next thing you know

1757
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:44,840
people are moving here and there so you

1758
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:47,239
know I think

1759
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:50,480
adaptability is the

1760
01:20:47,238 --> 01:20:53,319
actual thing that we need to learn how

1761
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:55,079
to be good at we need to be learn how to

1762
01:20:53,319 --> 01:20:57,679
uh we need to learn how to be good

1763
01:20:55,079 --> 01:21:00,920
adapting yeah it's not it's not survival

1764
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:03,920
of the fittest it's the survival of the

1765
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:07,399
most adaptable it's don't get

1766
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:10,920
whack yeah and if it's whacka then we're

1767
01:21:07,399 --> 01:21:14,279
whacking our own Creations that we lift

1768
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:18,079
up whatever is powerful right now we

1769
01:21:14,279 --> 01:21:20,000
have given power to and if we step back

1770
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:22,479
and we look at it and we would start

1771
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,560
recognizing what we want to feed and

1772
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:27,718
what we don't want to feed that's just a

1773
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:30,400
really important question if we're

1774
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:33,119
talking about health and vitality and

1775
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:35,158
wellness of the earth of the globe of

1776
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:38,119
the people of the residents of this

1777
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:41,519
Earth then we need to talk about what it

1778
01:21:38,119 --> 01:21:43,679
is that we're feeding that's a pathogen

1779
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:47,520
and what it is that we're feeding that's

1780
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:50,679
beneficial and I think that you know as

1781
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:53,199
a human race we've been feeding a lot of

1782
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:56,639
pathogens and then we've been calling

1783
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:59,638
them they and that is our own doing

1784
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:04,760
whatever they is is because we've given

1785
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:07,880
that power that money that energy to

1786
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:11,199
something that is also you know beating

1787
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:14,359
us down um and I think that now that

1788
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:18,759
it's 2022 we really can set out our

1789
01:22:14,359 --> 01:22:21,279
intentions and put our energy and our

1790
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:24,280
kindness and our love towards the

1791
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:26,800
beneficials to colonize the beneficials

1792
01:22:24,279 --> 01:22:30,439
to to procreate to

1793
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:33,639
repopulate so I just think that I'm

1794
01:22:30,439 --> 01:22:35,759
super on that notion of health and

1795
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:38,800
vitality and what that means and I think

1796
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,840
it starts with each individual and so

1797
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,760
just sitting with ourselves I like the

1798
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:45,039
term resonance because it's the

1799
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:48,039
Resonance of the ways but it's also has

1800
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:49,800
the the word resin in it and then that

1801
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:53,238
brings you to hash and then you realize

1802
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:56,800
the hash the hash is just a Resonance of

1803
01:22:53,238 --> 01:22:58,678
the plant M and then there's it's kind

1804
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,760
of this beautiful thing because the the

1805
01:22:58,679 --> 01:23:04,920
tricomes are crystals and then there's

1806
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:07,039
that Cosmic enery and I like that and we

1807
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:10,279
talk a lot about you know you have to

1808
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:13,479
have a good beautiful plant in order to

1809
01:23:10,279 --> 01:23:16,119
have amazing hash and concentrates well

1810
01:23:13,479 --> 01:23:20,000
I mean that's the way it is in life for

1811
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:23,279
some reason humans expect six for

1812
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:26,279
everything but they put one star into it

1813
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:28,840
so let's start putting six stars into it

1814
01:23:26,279 --> 01:23:31,559
and of course you're gonna get six stars

1815
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:34,600
out that's just like what happens

1816
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:38,280
whatever you put in you get out so like

1817
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:40,760
Johnny B in the place yeah Johnny B has

1818
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:43,439
been putting in six stars so he gets out

1819
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:46,719
six stars and it's obvious and it's

1820
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:48,158
really awesome um right you don't get

1821
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:50,158
what you want you get what you deserve

1822
01:23:48,158 --> 01:23:52,279
and you work hard for it then you get

1823
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:53,960
what you deserve so work hard for what

1824
01:23:52,279 --> 01:23:55,880
you want in your garden in your life and

1825
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:58,319
anything that you do and you'll get what

1826
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:01,719
you deserve that's what you only get one

1827
01:23:58,319 --> 01:24:04,119

01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:32,760
industry uh and you know that faith in

1906
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:34,920
humanity thing is a big deal as well

1907
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:36,840
where it's easy to be a pessimist

1908
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:38,399
nowadays especially if you consume like

1909
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:41,960
bad media

1910
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:44,839
247 that's like just eating poison um

1911
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:50,319
you know 247 it's not it's not good for

1912
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:52,600
you and uh it's uh easily accessible so

1913
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:55,198
what my message would be to everyone is

1914
01:27:52,600 --> 01:28:00,480
uh stay positive get out into nature

1915
01:27:55,198 --> 01:28:03,319
enjoy plants enjoy fungi and uh yeah try

1916
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:06,519
not toh let the division happen because

1917
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:08,759
there is a clear division kind of

1918
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:10,440
constantly you know this tension and I

1919
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:12,679
think it's okay for the tension to be

1920
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:15,638
there but doesn't have to be as tight as

1921
01:28:12,679 --> 01:28:18,399
it is right now so let's loosen that

1922
01:28:15,639 --> 01:28:22,679
tension much love to Wade much love to

1923
01:28:18,399 --> 01:28:25,679
etan Josh and Kelly Dr Mark Brian Johnny

1924
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:27,480
B and the folks folks that have left

1925
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,239

1926
01:28:27,479 --> 01:28:33,000
it going for another 15 minutes so you

1927
01:28:29,238 --> 01:28:33,000
guys can all have a chance to wrap up as

1928
01:28:33,279 --> 01:28:39,158
well Marcus Wade is there anything that

1929
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:42,399
some wisdom or anything you would like

1930
01:28:39,158 --> 01:28:45,000
to impart to us as you've been uh in

1931
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:46,920
your new head space and mind space is

1932
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,079
there some wisdom you'd like to share

1933
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,079
with

1934
01:28:49,399 --> 01:28:53,399
us um

1935
01:28:54,840 --> 01:29:01,480
question um one of the things that uh

1936
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:04,920
occurred to me recently is

1937
01:29:01,479 --> 01:29:08,238
um all of the effort that over the years

1938
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:10,639
I put into understanding what's

1939
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:13,759
necessary to create highquality

1940
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:17,679
cannabis uh in terms of practices in the

1941
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:20,600
garden and uh the soils that we built

1942
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:23,560
and um the cultiv ours that we worked

1943
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:27,520
with and uh some of the benefits that we

1944
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:30,080
saw from those things um I've come to

1945
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:33,480
realize that I that I want to bring that

1946
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:38,238
same attention to detail that same

1947
01:29:33,479 --> 01:29:40,959
desire to understand what was going on

1948
01:29:38,238 --> 01:29:43,039
uh in this discussion like with hash you

1949
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,439
know why we see different types of hash

1950
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:47,800
from different environments different

1951
01:29:44,439 --> 01:29:52,359
moisture levels etc etc that whole

1952
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:55,760
exploration of what's possible I'm um

1953
01:29:52,359 --> 01:29:59,639
I'm really feeling a deep commitment to

1954
01:29:55,760 --> 01:30:04,440
myself to understand my body more fully

1955
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:06,719
to understand how it is that I like to

1956
01:30:04,439 --> 01:30:09,238
think of myself as someone who has lived

1957
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:13,639
a good life who has always eaten well

1958
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:17,158
who has always uh pursued good works uh

1959
01:30:13,639 --> 01:30:19,440
you know walk in light if you will uh

1960
01:30:17,158 --> 01:30:22,118
that how I end up in a situation of

1961
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:24,719
having a cancer like this is fascinating

1962
01:30:22,118 --> 01:30:28,198
to me and I want to understand

1963
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:30,520
what's going on there I I look back to

1964
01:30:28,198 --> 01:30:34,919
one of Kelly's observations about

1965
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:36,800
pathogens and allies and how we have put

1966
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:38,359
so much effort into creating pathogens

1967
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:42,920
in our in our

1968
01:30:38,359 --> 01:30:42,920
environment um and it feels

1969
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:52,119
like adapt to what we've done to our

1970
01:30:49,079 --> 01:30:56,000
environment what we've done to our uh

1971
01:30:52,118 --> 01:31:00,238
Zeitgeist if you will the entire ire

1972
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:02,198
um sum of all our experiences and I one

1973
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:03,439
of the reasons that I really love the

1974
01:31:02,198 --> 01:31:05,599
hash

1975
01:31:03,439 --> 01:31:08,479
Church concept the thing that we're

1976
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:11,320
doing here is bringing that light each

1977
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:13,000
of us in our own way work hard to

1978
01:31:11,319 --> 01:31:16,599
manifest that light with within

1979
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:19,279
ourselves and in our work and we have

1980
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:22,079
done very good at getting that word out

1981
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:24,519
into the world but it feels to me like

1982
01:31:22,079 --> 01:31:27,519
for me at least right now

1983
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:29,480
it's important for me to turn inward and

1984
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:32,440
to really explore what's happening for

1985
01:31:29,479 --> 01:31:34,839
me and to understand how what's

1986
01:31:32,439 --> 01:31:37,079
happening for me is really to a large

1987
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:40,480
extent happening for many people around

1988
01:31:37,079 --> 01:31:43,399
the world many of us are struggling with

1989
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:46,879
uh toxins of one sort or another be they

1990
01:31:43,399 --> 01:31:50,238
from the media from our food from

1991
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,239
whatever excuse

1992
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:55,840
me uh

1993
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:55,840
anyway um

1994
01:31:55,880 --> 01:32:02,359
yeah it just feels like a a time for me

1995
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:05,800
to focus within and really understand

1996
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:07,920
more fully my process I love Johnny be's

1997
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:10,279
observations about how he's going about

1998
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:16,039
changing his life each of us in our own

1999
01:32:10,279 --> 01:32:18,759
way are um Pioneers if you will and our

2000
01:32:16,039 --> 01:32:22,519
work over the years has been really

2001
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:24,280
focused on pioneering ending prohibition

2002
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:26,800
helping people understand what this

2003
01:32:24,279 --> 01:32:30,198
plant and our various allies can do for

2004
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:32,560
us and now I think it's at least for me

2005
01:32:30,198 --> 01:32:34,118
it feels like it's a time for me to

2006
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:38,199
understand more

2007
01:32:34,118 --> 01:32:42,118
fully what I can derive from this for my

2008
01:32:38,198 --> 01:32:43,638
own benefit as well as those that I love

2009
01:32:42,118 --> 01:32:46,238
I don't know if that made any sense at

2010
01:32:43,639 --> 01:32:48,760
all but there you go

2011
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:50,559
that's made all the sense in the world

2012
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:52,960
my friend I love you brother thank you

2013
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,400

2018
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:06,920
can get back to how you are and where

2019
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:14,679
you want to

2020
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:19,840
be and I feel like that path inward is

2021
01:33:14,679 --> 01:33:22,279
the path of the true warrior the path

2022
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:27,159
inward is the

2023
01:33:22,279 --> 01:33:31,000
path that we're all afraid to go

2024
01:33:27,158 --> 01:33:34,559
to the path inward is the path that

2025
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:36,800
we're forced to when we've done

2026
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:40,760
everything

2027
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:45,119
outward this is the work that you're

2028
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:49,679
doing is the work that heals all of

2029
01:33:45,118 --> 01:33:51,599
us the work of you going inward heals

2030
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:55,679
the collective

2031
01:33:51,600 --> 01:34:01,280

everybody Dr Mark the man of few words

2155
01:39:34,198 --> 01:39:39,439
today fin close us

2156
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:43,279
out I've been on

2157
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:45,439
mute well you know people like Wade are

2158
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:48,800
are unique because

2159
01:39:45,439 --> 01:39:51,799
um I mean you think just not even

2160
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:54,400
through the collagist network but how

2161
01:39:51,800 --> 01:40:00,719
many people have taken the

2162
01:39:54,399 --> 01:40:00,719
words and knowledge that this one human

2163
01:40:03,079 --> 01:40:09,920
has and

2164
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:12,519
um brought new genetics and new

2165
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:16,279
understanding to what the plant can

2166
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:20,119
do and you know Wade you're a living

2167
01:40:16,279 --> 01:40:23,479
manifestation of the plant

2168
01:40:20,118 --> 01:40:26,880
itself you know I mean it's hard to tell

2169
01:40:23,479 --> 01:40:32,439
where the plant ends and where Wade

2170
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:36,118
begins um uh so I I think that you know

2171
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:38,919
I mean hopefully all of this um

2172
01:40:36,118 --> 01:40:43,039
community that that has come to your

2173
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:45,840
support um is part of the healing energy

2174
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:49,118
that brings you back uh to where you

2175
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:51,719
need to be uh you know the skeletal

2176
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:54,198
system is underpinned by the endoc

2177
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:56,920
canabo system I think there's been some

2178
01:40:54,198 --> 01:40:59,839
very important work done over in Israel

2179
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:02,399
to show that so let's hope by nurturing

2180
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:05,400
your endoc can avonoid system it'll

2181
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:07,158
bring you back to health and uh as you

2182
