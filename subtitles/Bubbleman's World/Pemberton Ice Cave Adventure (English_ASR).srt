00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,039

beautiful beautiful Ice Caves really

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,559
Majestic and and and deeply

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,439
deeply spiritual places very quiet and

12
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:38,238
unique places a place that you won't

13
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,920
spend a lot of your life uh in and so

14
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,199
the short time that you do get to spend

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,000
there it's always very much appreciated

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,719
particularly by me um I just did my wake

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,280
and bake video my 13th episode and took

18
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:53,960

22
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,519
one more RIP just with you guys but I

23
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:07,478
thought I'd do a short little interlude

24
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,600
sort of intro to this video for the day

25
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:11,280
I'm not going to do the regular you know

26
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,319
take the camera and set it up in my

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,640
vehicle so you can kind of drive up the

28
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,758
road with me probably we'll just start

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,319
in the parking lot pulling the sleds off

30
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,680
a lot of it's going to be first person

31
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,959
at least getting to the the spots will

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,920
be first person on my GoPro and then

33
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,199
I'll have my camera as well just to film

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,719
a little bit of the Ice Caves that's

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,079
mostly what I'm looking to do just film

36
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:36,118
some some nice action um oh there we go

37
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,000
getting little little messages about my

38
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,280

189
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,200
get in all it is the hardest cave but

190
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,919
you know what we can do this can't we

191

Ryan or is it too stupid it's not it's

192
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,000
not the sketchiest one but it's it looks

193
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,919
like it's the

194
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,240
hardest I I think I'm good for this you

195
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:52,799
know I don't know I just don't want to

196
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,799
go ripping down into the cave of

197
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,519
course no you got to know that you can

198
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,958
get up so it will flatten out you know

199
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:03,600
no I know I know the thing

200
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,759
getting out getting out

201
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,519
yeah what about over there I see people

202
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,399
have gone over that way that looks like

203
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,200
a PE spot to me oh cuz it's a hole it

204
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,440
looks yeah it could be a PE

205
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,079
spot well maybe we're not going in the

206
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,720
ice cave look at that maybe we're to the

207
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:20,958
next ice cave if I can get my sled

208
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,639
started cuz it stopped working when we

209
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:26,559
got here so it looks like there's some

210
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,559
easy way right

211
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,920
I guess we kind of need gloves for this

212
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,839
hey I didn't bring

213
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,838
gloves yeah next time I

214

221
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,519

568
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:56,240
spots too people have climbed way into

569
00:34:51,320 --> 00:35:00,000
them and you can go and keep going down

570
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:01,679
into the entrance I'm not going to but

571
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,358
pretty cool that's a cool little tunnel

572
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,358

573
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:11,358

580
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,400
going to have to uh take my time and do

581
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,400
one at a time

582
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,200
you can see quite a ways into both of

583
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,240
them yeah it's kind of neat I think I

584

came in that way oh really rolled in on

585
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:18,399

590
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,519

591
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:04,639
I can't even explain to you guys how

592
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,039
ridiculous this thing is see if I can

593
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,318
turn my oh you don't even need the light

594
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:12,000
on here see the

595
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:12,000
ice how trippy it

596
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:22,200
is super super trippy [ __ ]

597
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:42,119
okay so I just climbed through this tiny

598
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:45,119
little port hole and got to I guess what

599
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:49,119
I would call a pretty epic

600
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:51,920
location very limited with my height let

601
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,280
me get to a spot here so I can show you

602
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:59,039
where I'm

603
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,040
at ice cave that way

604
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:06,598
exit outside that

605
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,880
way and then uh looks

606
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:12,079
like a

607
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,240
substantial distance around this corner

608
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,720
can be

609
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:19,118
taken but I won't be doing that so you

610
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:21,358
see sometimes these networks go

611
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,680
forever obviously it makes sense to be

612
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:26,039
very careful when you're in these zones

613
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:28,838
particularly this time of year the Melt

614
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:29,920
is occurring you can hear it happening

615
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:31,318
you don't want to put yourself in a

616
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,760
situation that's more dangerous than it

617
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:38,759
needs to be so be careful out there but

618
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:41,960
uh yeah absolutely stunning

619
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:45,319
stunning head in here for a little

620
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,400

00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:54,199
what cannabis is all about to me using

624
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,639
it as a medicine and allowing myself to

625
00:38:54,199 --> 00:39:00,919
be inspired and to be touched by by

626
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,879
nature in these zones you know glass ice

627

of stuff that we don't want on there so

670
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,400
we are like literally what would you

671
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:21,800
guys say from just the parking

672
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:24,800
lot we are at least 60 I'd say 60 maybe

673
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,440
even 75 km from the parking lot in a

674
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,720
straight line we've traveled further

675
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,679
than that though right yeah how cool was

676
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:34,039
that

677
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:39,440
incredible where we are standing here

678
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:42,279
the ice is at least 15,000 years old

679
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,119
15,000 or more

680
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:50,200
wow pretty cool you take a little Chun

681
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:53,160
back to my whiskey no you know why

682
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:55,879
because actually there could be bacteria

683
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:58,358
I know I know I know water yeah of what

684
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:03,200
bacteria oh yeah prehistoric times could

685
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:07,920
be frozen in this ice and you never

686
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:07,919
know damn Ricardo with the

687
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:15,239

colors red and blue and green and yellow

689
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:19,239
maybe a little

690
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,000
black you got that

691
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:25,719
timer how you doing we're going to turn

692
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,838

693
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:30,838
about the the torch it was

694
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:32,400
not well it wasn't turning off no oh

695
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:34,199
yeah lots of things seem to be doing

696
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,480
that today yeah I wish I had that

697
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:40,399
flashlight part uh carbing this would be

698
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,800
super key but uh well I know it is what

699
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,160
it is your little container there you

700
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,440
know the quartz if it's too hot on top

701
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:50,558
it will be a no buo the plastic would

702
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,720
melt to it I'll just take a big Airy hit

703
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:53,920
in the ice cave nothing wrong with that

704
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,279
what do we at

705
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,119
dir still pretty hot

706
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,240
make me want to find that

707
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,880
flashlight cuz it's not like it would I

708
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:05,799
remember putting it like tight with my

709
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,160
video camera and my camera now had

710
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,160
43 Stone

711
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,480
thing a stone

712
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:25,479
yeah ice how cool is it

713
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:25,480
worked just chilling y in the

714
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:33,599
cave wow that didn't work too

715
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,599
bad doesn't get much Chiller than

716
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,960
that booah there's so many more to pick

717
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,960
up I can throw my carb cap down after my

718
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:48,800
rip all right so want to hold that sure

719
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:52,760
I will hold this I will find

720
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:57,318
this we will do our cleanliness thing

721
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,319
because cleanliness is Godliness

722
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:04,358
the best we can

723
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,519
anyway this is my travel Chaz Banner so

724
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:07,519
it's okay to get some

725
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:16,119
CH all right actually hold that I think

726
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:19,719
there's a real order to this and I think

727
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:23,480
putting the hash on before you need this

728
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:27,598
key yep I think so otherwi you know may

729
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:30,880
scramble and the B may fall over or your

730
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:33,440
torch or anything's possible just not

731
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,440
ready for

732
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:42,440
it yeah and then you missed your da and

733
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,599
you wasted all that for nothing what a

734
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,358
waste and I hate butane as it is yeah

735
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:48,599
exactly it's pretty much like my least

736
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:50,838
favorite thing exactly in this

737
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:54,240
experience oo it's not a bad sound when

738
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:57,838
you're and your dab makes the sound of

739
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:57,838
broken glass

740
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:08,159
wasn't sure when it was going to happen

741
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,559
wasn't sure when we were going to get

742
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:12,318
out here I mean I knew you guys would

743

back same well it's pretty nice here I

796
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,800

00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,519
there

798
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,160
and here you tripped out to see a bear

799
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:14,639
in here though a bear would seem so

800
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:17,719
close yeah I don't think bear is living

801
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:20,118
the stuff Chang s they're sleeping way

802
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:22,399
lower but they go on the ice oh I know

803
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:26,960

804
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:30,039
have apparently a dead duck in their SE

805
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:34,679
really I don't know

806
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:34,679
what whose T is that

807
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,920
uh that's Rory's plan it kind of kind of

808
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,319
felt like it might have been his that's

809
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,800
cool I don't know I don't know I've

810
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:45,519
heard the name a couple times and I

811
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,480
heard I've met Rory a couple of times I

812
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:48,559
heard that there's a couple people

813
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,838
living in a teepe somewhere around here

814
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,920
and uh now I've seen the teepe Rory was

815
00:48:50,838 --> 00:48:55,239
married to

816
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,358
Sarah yeah that's kind of when I met him

817
00:48:55,239 --> 00:49:01,679
well I did a a I did a thing with Blake

818
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:05,598
Jorgenson uh a class yeah

819
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:07,679
and um he was Rory was one of the riders

820
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,160
that Blake had hired to be like just

821
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:12,000

823
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,559

bit that's how I met him and then uh

825
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,319

881
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:29,879
lots of lump little

882
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,039
avalanches and just beautiful beautiful

883
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,760
epicness this is of course the pton back

884
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:36,039
country just a little bit north of

885
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,200
Whistler for those of you wondering

886
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:38,920
definitely not something you want to

887
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:42,358
just drive out here and go into without

888
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:44,639
any uh guides or people that can uh you

889
