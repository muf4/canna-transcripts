1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,799
computer I have never gone live on

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,719
Facebook so this is a

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,679
first I

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:13,399
guess that lots of people use Facebook

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,759
you know like all the mass murderers

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,399
when they're going out killing people at

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,518
uh shopping centers and

8
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,439
stuff all right well I want to say

9
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:24,399
welcome to everyone this is a strange

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,640
hash church this is the first one I've

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,518
ever gone live on Facebook because

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,920
YouTube just wasn't working for us so

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:36,920
welcome everyone to Hash Church uh 3.0

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,960
episode 6 really just going to be a hash

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,640
talk today um hopefully I'm not sure how

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,878
to share this uh but it would be very

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,039
good um oh here we go I would be very

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,479

I should do that um otherwise welcome

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,198

guys there you go Colin you're picking

28
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:14,280
up the slack that's what I'm talking

29
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:17,879
picking up the slack guys um welcome

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:22,159
welcome um hey guys a question for you

31
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:24,879
Colin yes what was the first electronic

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,680
instrument oh the first electronic

33
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:30,438
instrument I'm not sure I think uh wait

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,240
hold on um

35
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:33,758
it's not the theramin there's something

36
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,839
before the

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,159
theramin I don't remember I don't I

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,880
don't know I keep going back to the

39
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:43,280
thein I I don't know I think it is I

40
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,519
think it is the therin but I'm not sure

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,840
that's what I asked I think it is the

42
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,718
theramin U that's a creation that's a

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,040
collaboration actually between bog Moog

44
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:57,280
uh American designer and engineer and I

45
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,960
believe a European friend of his I don't

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,840
we should should look this up uh it's a

47
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,798
very

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,600
important very important point in uh in

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,200
creation of of music musical instruments

50
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,159
it it really set the tone for uh 20 the

51
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,000
20th and 21st century and where we're at

52
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:18,639
it happened shortly after a pretty

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
intense mushroom Journey most

54
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,000
likely um just

55
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,239
like what's that Josh Frozen up just

56
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,518
like everything else good in the world

57
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:35,039
exactly it is the thein actually it we

58
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,120
were correct I I was not surprised one

59
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,479
of my favorite movies Is The Day the

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,840
Earth Stood Still and I am completely

61
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:48,199
wrong it is not Bob moo it is Leon

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,239
Therman that's there you go go figure so

63
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:54,399
very cool the way to do it that makes a

64
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,439
lot of sense i'mna question for you Sam

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:02,120
what was your first variety that you

66
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:04,719
grew that inspired you to make an

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,959
outcross to make a what to make a what

68
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:11,239
make an outcross or or a new hybrid out

69
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,120
of it oh a new hybrid well to be honest

70
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:17,400
the first

71
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,799
de I grew I really grew land races and

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,400
the first one I planted was Mexican but

73
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,120
somebody stole it before it flowered so

74
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:31,080
I didn't get so far with it but I tried

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:33,719
uh the first hybrid that I I created was

76
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,000
uh skunk number

77
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:39,120
one that's amazing so that was your

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,438
first thing and then that went on to

79
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,680
touch and I think this is important for

80
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:45,598
the the audience because I I've been

81
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,519
really the last few years I guess I've

82
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,199
been really diving into the genomic

83
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,280
aspect and the genomic tagging if you

84
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,518
will and better understanding what we

85
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,919
have in our hands that variety has

86
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,840
touched pretty much every modern day

87
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:01,000
cannabis variety that I've seen there's

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,239
very few that it has

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,598
um well not only that but I I added some

90
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:13,560
DNA to it so it it actually says SK

91
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:18,159
number one in the DNA and uh anybody who

92
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:22,199
has SK DNA sk1 DNA uh I actually own

93
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,199
your variety you should start sending me

94
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,040
royalties no back in the day Sam I

95
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,240
remember you telling me that there was a

96
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,400
tarine profile that was spiked on the G

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,199
or the GLC that you would recognize

98
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:38,000
varieties that had skunk in it is that

99
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,000
is that

100
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,720
accurate you there well no but here's

101
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:50,600
what it was when when I made hybrids

102
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:55,280
with skunk number one and say a tie or a

103
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,160
afan or whatever and then I did the GC

104
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,599
analysis tpine

105
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:05,479
analysis of of the mother skunk the

106
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:08,280
mother atam the mother Thai and simple

107
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:15,000
F1 hybrids between them I could

108
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:20,918
recognize it just by the uh GC print out

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:24,279
that which ones were related to the skug

110
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:27,120
or the tie or the appam just by the

111
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:31,519
tpine content when I first discovered

112
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:35,360
this uh 25 30 years ago I was blown away

113
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:38,198
that it was that easy to recogn canvas

114
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,080
by just it tured

115
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:45,280
profile incredible well I certainly

116
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:50,038
remember my first trip to Amsterdam in

117
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:52,799
1995 and uh wow was skunk number one in

118
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:55,360
every coffee shop it was

119
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,650
unbelievable everyone had their version

120
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,199
of

121
00:05:55,649 --> 00:06:01,000
[Music]

122
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,680
it yeah what incredible variety I know a

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,680
lot of the stuff I made as a younger

124
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,400
self I mean having it sequenced by by

125
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,720
Kevin mccaran really shed a lot of light

126
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:13,719
into actually how much of your variety

127
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,400
Sam have infiltrated all of the work

128
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,280
that I've actually done unbeknownst to

129
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:20,399
myself like I thought I I wasn't even

130
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:24,638
working with it and it was it was all in

131
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:28,318
there so well in the beginning mine was

132
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,439
the most consistent stable multi-hybrid

133
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,960
and

134
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,918
it was easy to grow it was easy to use

135
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,758
and uh when you cross it with something

136
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:41,918
else it usually made it better so

137
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,800
everybody was using it for everything

138
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:48,120
and what year was that what year was

139
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:51,759
that Crea well I I released it in uh I

140
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,680
think 76 or 77 but I had worked on it

141
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,879
for a year or two before

142
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,759
that and how much did that have an

143
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:03,840
effect on modern day hash making

144
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:07,720
that cultivar and how it got into

145
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:12,478
soar it's easy to make hash from it with

146
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:15,840
dry sifting which is what I did so uh on

147
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:20,199
that that level it but it's hybrids

148
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:23,279
don't always make cash easy so yeah

149
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:25,919
because I remember my two easiest ones

150
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:31,119
to make cash with

151
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:35,318
was was uh skunk number one and and uh

152
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:39,478
the variety from DNA s stack what was

153
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:41,360
it SLE stack absolutely correct but the

154
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:44,360
hybrid

155
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:48,000
between the hash did like it does with

156
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,080
SLE stack number one I tried it was

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,839
incredible that SLE stack cross with

158
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,758
skunk number one I was there for all of

159
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:58,079
that and that was good times that [ __ ]

160
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:01,080
rained resin and it cleaned really

161
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:04,279
really nice yeah no the SLE stack was as

162
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:08,240
easyest skunk to to make a really really

163
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:11,519
clean hash with dry C and uh it yeah it

164
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,519
was truly amazing I say we start a p

165
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,120
petition and get DNA to bring back the

166
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:19,598
SLE stack where's the SLE stack

167
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:24,319
at well one thing I've asked DNA over

168
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:29,800
and over and over is did they analyze

169
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:33,879
the Turing profile of and the canono of

170
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:36,719
stack because it was really unusual both

171
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:41,240
me and Rob found that as long as we

172
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,320
smoke SLE stack resin we didn't sleep so

173
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,839
normally I go to sleep at 10 o'clock at

174
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,480
night at the latest and when I would

175
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,440
smoke SLE stack I'd stay up till 3

176
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,320
o'clock and I

177
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,560
finally smoke some uh you know a real

178
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,000
couch lock weed to knock me

179
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:02,838
out yeah I fell in the go G train and

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,360
Hayes the same way just you know smoking

181
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,240
that at night is not the best idea if

182
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,240
you actually want to go to sleep at any

183
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,039
at any point in time but uh it is what

184
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,560
it is when it's that good you have to

185
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:16,679
sacrifice a little bit of

186
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,759
sleep hey I wanted to welcome Dave

times and I don't know there's got to be

205

I so back to welcoming Dave suan into

208
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,120
the room his first hash Church episode I

209
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:20,799
met

210
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,799
daveon

the music guy like the guy who does like

214
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,958
is obsessed with perfect sound

215
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,000
you for whatever reason your mic is like

216
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:37,399
Johnny B's mic it just creates the

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
craziest feedback when it's not muted

218
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:44,320
mine's muted I just unmuted myself no I

219

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,000
three times charm Dave I want to welcome

222
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,120
Dave Sullivan to the room he's uh he's

223
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,039
an interesting fellow I liked what he

224
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,639
had to say on the on the demm pure um

225
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:01,559
videos that they've been doing do for

226
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,399
the last uh couple of months and so I

227

wanted to introduce you dude and and

228
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,360
tell the hash Church audience a little

229
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,919
bit about yourself and how you came to

230
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,919
find yourself uh here on the

231
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:17,078
panel well um yeah my name is Dave I

232
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:19,759
live in Oregon and we have

233
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:22,159
a certified organic vegetable farm here

234
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,240
we do a bunch of acreage of uh Market

235
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,958
crops for you know farmers markets and

236
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,000
restaurants CSA and all that kind of

237
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:32,599
stuff and we also

238
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,159
um have a wck

239
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:39,120
farm so we we've been growing cannabis

240
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:42,439
and uh vegetables for you know

241
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,480
approaching 25 years and uh yeah that's

242
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,519
what we

243
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,600
do that's awesome and you're obviously

244
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:54,360
growing jot herbs as well amongst your

245
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,200
food y yep yeah we've uh yeah we we we

246
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,639
we've kind of got a unique system where

247
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,879
where we've sort of incorporate uh G

248
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,039
into our crop rotation and uh that works

249
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,480
really well for us and so obviously with

250
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,399
both growing food and growing uh

251
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,079
cannabis resin you're going and doing it

252
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,879
organically and regeneratively and

253
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:17,319
whatnot I'm suspecting that you have

254
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:21,600
long understood the

255
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:24,399
relationship of the way food and

256
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,440
cannabis is produced and the way it

257
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,559
tastes and smells in an organic living

258
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,800
soil environment

259
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:35,638
versus one that is more scrubbed of

260
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,559
terroir maybe it's an indoor grow now

261
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,639
and it's got artificial lights and it

262
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:44,119
has a a soiless medium and it's being

263
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:47,278
fed fed salt nutrients you you guys must

264
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,399
be well aware of of the intensity of the

265
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:52,919
differences of of those two

266
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,639
relationships yeah I mean it it's it's

267
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:56,120
obviously it goes without saying but I

268
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,680
think one of the

269
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,600
um one one of the real tangible ways you

270
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,439
can see that around us is all the you

271
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,480
know we're in a pretty thriving farming

272
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,000
Community here so there's a lot of uh

273
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,720
monoculture around us like uh Ry grass

274
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,159
and hazelnuts and sugar beet seeds and

275
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,079
things like that so you can you just

276
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:19,078
even seeing the difference between you

277
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:21,559
know our neighbors and our soils that

278
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,479
are that were managed like organically

279
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:25,399
and building up soil over the years

280
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,039
versus the conventional guys that are

281
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:31,159
just blasting herbicides and spraying

282
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:34,759
24d you can just the soil just looks has

283
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:37,679
like a dead look to it and um you know

284
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:40,278
I'm not you know I'm definitely not in

285
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,958
the like uh making hashes and in my

286
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:46,480
wheelhouse and I'm clearly not an expert

287
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:48,838
like you guys but uh I do know that we

288
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,120
we have collaborations with uh some of

289
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,959
the you know who I think are the best

290
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,360
hash makers in the state of Oregon and

291
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,958
they uh it's it's it's not even

292
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,519
questionable to them that you know

293
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:06,559
living soil sungrown herb is uh they get

294
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,560
the best turps off the hash and

295
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,560
and I would say uh you are making hash

296
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,480
by growing it because if we as hash

297
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:18,359
makers have nothing to wash yeah you

298
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,360
know hash makers uh sometimes take a lot

299
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,000
of credit but we shouldn't you know we

300
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:26,879
do we do a job but you what the job that

301
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,600
you do is uh there's a lot more time

302
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,799
that passes and there's a lot more

303
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,720
variable that you're exposed to uh than

304
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,319
than a hash maker there's no doubt about

305
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,079
that what are some of the loudest

306
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,360
strains that you have right now Dave

307
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:40,599
going on in your greenhouse because I

308
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,919
saw that you're getting towards your uh

309
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,759
one of your first steps and

310
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:48,639
everything well the joke these days is

311
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,399
if it's not named after a a dessert or a

312
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:55,560
fruit then no one's really growing it

313
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:58,600
but uh but I'll seriousness um what we

314
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:01,518
have a a really good sour Tangi cut from

315
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,879
I think got Crockett breadit and um

316
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,759
that's super loud and then we have a lot

317
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:10,278
of um a lot my my friend crispy down in

318
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,839
California he he uh he's got a sour

319
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:15,838
diesel headband that everything he

320
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,720
crosses into it is just it's a thorough

321
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,440
bread and um one of the I think one of

322
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,800
the ones that we're hearing is really

323
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,040
good for hash is um it's called this is

324
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,799
the [ __ ] or tits which is kind of a

325
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:30,759
terrible name and Oregon doesn't like

326
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:33,919
the name so we we renamed it Grandpa's

327
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:37,120
finest after the breed who BR it he's

328
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:39,519
he's an Oldtimer from uh from uh K

329
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,959
Valley in California but that's sour

330
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,480
band onto an ogkb and U it just has that

331
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:49,000
really just greasy kind of Himalayan

332
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,959
structure to it you those are probably

333
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,078
some what other have you grown our Tangi

334
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,838
in Northern California and in in in the

335
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,039
W Valley or what are some differences

336
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,880
that you've seen from say Bol to the

337
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:06,318
wamit valley well for us we we didn't

338
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,879
get the S sour Tangi cut until after we

339
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:10,159
weren't really growing down there

340
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:13,679
anymore I've given it somebody's down

341
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:18,799
there but

342
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:19,879
um in southern humble um in particular

343
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,359
I'm sure there's you know there's

344
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:24,600
obviously good micro pockets and regions

345
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:29,318
all over the world but that being you

346
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,759
know the the the famous Emerald Triangle

347
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:34,120
the not even all of Humble County

348
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,000
obviously killer herb comes out of all

349
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:41,198
of Humble County but that particular

350
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,600
Zone uh where the the the Kings range

351
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:46,399
the Lost Coast it's about 28 miles that

352
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,639
that it was just too uh the terrain was

353
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,600
just too uh Steep and drastic to

354
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,519
actually it's the only as you guys

355
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,759
probably all know it's the only part of

356
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,198
the California coast where the 101

357
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,278
doesn't go through there's about I think

358
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,919
28 or so miles of and it's literally

359
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:05,038
just like a 4,000 foot cliff to the

360
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:07,798
ocean the the King's Peak so once you

361
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:11,160
start getting east of the 101 get into

362
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:13,879
you know Eastern humble and um you grow

363
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,759
really big weed you know like it gets

364
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,679
like Sequoia weed like where it just

365
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,480
gets gigantic but it's really hot and

366
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,360
once you're obviously in the in the fog

367
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,640
line on the coast you kind of deal with

368
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,798
all the muck coming off the ocean but

369
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,480
the reason that particular microc climb

370
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,599
is so sweet is because you literally

371
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,120
have this 4,000 foot cliff blocking all

372
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:37,678
the muck off the ocean but you still

373
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:39,599
have that Coastal pattern so um I mean

374
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,360
you almost once you have like a decent

375
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,719
green thumb and fews behind your back

376
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:46,319
you almost have to try to not grow good

377
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:50,640
weed there to not be able to pull it off

378
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:53,200
good and Oregon where we are here is um

379
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,880
you know Southern Oregon you know a lot

380
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,720
a lot of good herb comes out of there

381
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,360
but the wamit valley where we at it's a

382
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:04,000
little wet here so so um what we have

383
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,798
kind of developed our style around is if

384
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,919
if you like kickstarting it so you know

385
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:14,038
we're pulling plastic Late July early

386
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,600
August so that late September um after

387
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:17,440
the Equinox you can finish under the

388
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,839
natural a without having to man

389
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,000
manipulate the schedule anymore and we

390
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:26,879
have found that the climate here in

391
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,279
September is almost identical to uh

392
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,600
Southern humble in October so

393
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,440
to kind of trick your plant into

394
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:33,719
thinking that that it's October

395
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,159
California they don't realize they're in

396
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,079
Oregon we we grow really good herb that

397
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,080
style and uh with some Canadians in the

398
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:44,240
house actually we kind of learned that

399
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:46,519
style I'd say back in the mid 90s we had

400
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,319
some buddies up in

401
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:52,558
um qualcom is that the name of Zone up

402
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:55,480
in up near uh Vancouver Island yeah not

403
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:59,399
Vancouver Island um it's it's

404
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,240
it's like like no no it's it's near

405
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,798
Whistler it's a there's like a bunch of

406
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,200
lakes up there pton and and Qualicom no

407
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,798
not qual qual on the on the coast but

408
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,240
these guys there they were just kind of

409
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:15,679
terracing and um the name of it will

410
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:20,279
come to me but it was like a really cool

411
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:23,640
uh tucked away like way remote yakum

412
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:25,960
Valley what what is it yakum Valley

413
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,840
that's it that's it yeah you got to

414
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,640
drive through louette to get there and

415
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,879
I've dirt biked all over those mountains

416
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,120
man yeah that's it's such a sweet spot

417
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,880
like wild land Carpenter

418
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:41,119
Lake yeah yeah like and um that's what

419
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,280
my blades did there they would just kind

420
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,319
of Terrace the hillsides and just sort

421
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,918
of gorilla Style with shade cloth but

422
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:48,279
they would just tarp their whole Gardens

423
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,159
to get stuff to finish there because the

424
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:53,918
season was so short that's really close

425
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:57,400
to goldbridge and bror which is a really

426
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,400
super cool like very unique little town

427
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,000
that used to be for the gold minds but

428
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,080
now it's like used by professional

429
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,440
skiers and snowboarders photographers

430
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:08,119
and sleders all through the winter

431
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,000
you've seen any Canadian filmed you know

432
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:14,399
Teton movies and whatnot Bray Lauren is

433
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,519
always representing super steep gnarly

434
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,240
mountains and uh incredible beautiful

435
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,720
snow uh and I've got quite a few friends

436
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,159
for a town of you know 46 people or

437
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,480
whatever I probably know 20 of them

438
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:29,240
right right yeah it was a really cool

439
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,640
Zone it definitely let me impression on

440
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,679
me and we we kind of we kind of I mean

441
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,080
when we you know I've been in Oregon the

442
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,280
whole time I've been on the west coast

443
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,000
but we we had a property in in Humble

444
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,558
that we were managing while we were

445
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,038
farming up here and we kind of bit their

446
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,279
Style on that in our early years down

447
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,200
there just to not have all the Harvest

448
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,240
come in at the same time with a small

449
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,480
crew you can kind of stagger it but um

450
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,200
but here in Oregon that

451
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,400
that to grow like the longer kind of

452
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,080
really greasy strains um you kind of

453
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,600
have to Kickstart them to to get him to

454
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,558
finish here not have all so they were

455
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:09,439
light depping up there in northern BC in

456
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:13,879
the mid 90s yeah

457
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:19,480
yeah it's pretty cool hey um talk about

458
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:23,080
big plants uh Paul hail in the house is

459
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:27,159
uh from sub school and vert verness

460
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:30,639
Farms is well known to grow 20 pound

461
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:33,440
plants am I right Paul oh yes sir well

462
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,240
we were lucky enough to do two of

463
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,759
them tell us about yourself we got it

464
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,000
twice well been growing herb a long time

465
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:45,240
I started off uh back in Virginia and

466
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,359
indoors in the 90s and um and the early

467
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,038
2000s went out to Amsterdam got really

468
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:52,079
motivated to start getting into hash and

469
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:54,240
uh but was working with all indoor

470
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,879
material when uh things progressed and

471
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,079
we started got into a farm and started

472
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,720
getting experienced with outdoor started

473
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,918
utilizing some of the same things we had

474
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,919
learned indoors outdoor and one of those

475
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,759
things was root space was a really

476
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,320
really big deal for yield uh along with

477
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:12,038
a long veg time and you know of course

478
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:13,720
with some good fertile soil as well but

479
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:15,119
when we did that Outdoors after you know

480
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,200
getting some advice from up from some

481
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,319
other friends who were saying things

482
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,880
along those lines the yield started

483
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,558
exploding and uh you know we we were

484
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,200
able to have plants that were framed you

485
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:28,599
know 10 feet tall that were in smart

486
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,400
pots maybe 400 gallon smart pots and

487
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,759
then the exact same frame with the

488
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,440
unlimited root

489
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,158
space grown you know literally side by

490
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,440
side the whole time and the plants would

491
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,760
end up about the same size overall but

492
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,440
our yield would be 10 12 13 pounds on

493
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,079
the big hole and it would be four or

494
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,400
five pounds on the little smart pot so

495
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,759
you know after that happened we just

496
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,480
kind of ran with it and dug 12 by 12

497
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,558
holes got them highly amended uh the

498
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,960
years that we got the two 20 Pounders we

499
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,119
both had them in the ground at the very

500
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,319
end of April under some supplemental

501
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:01,599
lighting keep them from flowering but uh

502
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,319
it was really it's really magical when

503
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:08,119
it happens it's uh it makes an amazing

504
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:10,439
season that's sounds awesome I uh I'll

505
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:12,879
never forget my friend uh from overgrow

506
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,640
the mullum bimy madman who I used to

507
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,400
talk he was one of my first Australian

508
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,960
customers that bought bubble bags and I

509
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,440
guess his his father had you know been

510
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,360
involved in just really crossing the

511
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,038
[ __ ] out of this cultivar for years that

512
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:29,240
ended up being the mullum bimby madness

513
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,640
and so this this dude would just be like

514
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,240
no you got to try it you got to try it

515
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,640
and like trying to send me nugs and

516
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,558
stuff and I'd be like no no don't do

517
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,759
that don't do that like this is like the

518
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:40,440
'90s right and so in the end I I ended

519
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:42,200
up getting some beautiful seeds from it

520
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,278
that I still have to this day but he

521
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,080
sent me photos and this this is this

522
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:49,038
this goes to show you how far back it

523
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:51,000
was they were like actual photos not you

524
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,480
know there was no digital sending

525
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,599
pictures so he sent me these photos of

526
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,240
uh this Mullen bimby plant that ended up

527
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:02,199
being I guess it was about 10 to 12 feet

528
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,319
tall tall but it was 18 feet wide uh he

529
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,038
ended up just getting this enormous

530
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,960
amount of cannabis off of it was it was

531
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:12,200
like close to 20 pounds uh and just

532
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,440
beautiful exotic sativa the Mullen bimby

533
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,960
Madness I mean I'm sure skunkman Sam

534
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,200
probably knows more than I do about the

535
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,000
strain but it was slapped with

536
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,880
everything it was just kind of like the

537
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,960
way the Hayes brothers did it Sam you

538
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,080
know where it was like the just taking

539
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,679
different things that came in and and

540
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,678
throwing it in

541
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,278
you know the first time I ever saw the

542
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,038
largest plant on overgrow Marcus is that

543
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:40,038
that guy posted those for the first time

544
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:42,240
and it just let it literally lit the I

545
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:45,200
mean our small community on fire we just

546
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,919
all kind of I'd never seen

547
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,640
20 no it was yeah we've gotten really

548
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,640
close both seasons we had the big ones

549
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,038
uh we had a bunch of 18 and 19 pounds

550
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,159
that that year we had 32 plant pounds or

551
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:03,679
I'm sorry 32 plants and we got a little

552
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:06,240
over 440 pounds so that it was truly a

553
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,759
blessed season and just eye opening what

554
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,519
what I wanted to say though is that on

555
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,000
the biggest plants we've grown they've

556
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,839
also been the healthiest and they come

557
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,240
amazing you know there always been

558
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:16,398
question to people thinking oh these

559
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,519
these older plants they've been through

560
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:20,079
a lot they're not going to really put

561
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,879
out and you know have the same THC

562
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,319
content but they absolutely do if

563
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,919
anything the bigger plants were better

564
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,759
than our smaller plants were at the end

565
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,159
of the day and so so the year you grew

566
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:33,480
those cers tell tell me about that

567
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,559
harvest

568
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,558
party oh my gosh I were they clones or

569
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:41,678
were they

570
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:44,798
seeds they were seeds they were from

571
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:47,679
both both times that we had the big all

572
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:50,918
from bod seed uh it was a

573
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,480
snow the snow was the first one that we

574
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:54,759
did it and then the triple goddess was

575
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,558
the second one that did it and the uh

576
00:25:54,759 --> 00:26:00,359
the snow we have a picture on Instagram

577
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:02,038
I believe 11 people all holding hands

578
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,879
with their arms spread out was about

579
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:07,119
what we measured the circumference on

580
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,720
picture yeah yeah that was that was

581
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:15,158
super fun and how big were the

582
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:18,120
St oh ridiculous like like my around the

583
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,440
stock yeah the the when the w we

584
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,519
actually had a bunch of rain and heavy

585
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,919
winds come through right like a couple

586
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,480
days before we were harvesting and uh we

587
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:29,759
had the support for that we had three

588
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,798
steel cages to hold it in place and the

589
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,200
wind hit it and she crushed all the

590
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:37,079
three steel cages we had to use a come

591
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,240
along and put uh toost we nailed all the

592
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:41,558
way down into the ground to stand her

593
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,880
back up to limp her through the the last

594
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:47,119
few days to harvest but the the weight

595
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,720
of that plant like wet could you

596
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:52,558
unbelievable it

597
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,919
was a treat could you get if you had if

598
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:57,359
you took your two hands could you get

599
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,960
your fingers around the bottom of the

600
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,199
stem B

601
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,720
no you couldn't get them around no no

602
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,360
way

603
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,000
actually yeah that's that's the way I

604
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:12,479
judge them they're they're either a tree

605
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,079
or they ain't a

606
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,120
tree we made a lot of really fun videos

607
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:19,720
where we'd have people inside the tree

608
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,119
you know dabbing and smoking and then

609
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,440
walk out you know and kind of give

610
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,959
perspective of how big those things get

611
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,240
uh but it's you know it's definitely was

612
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,319
a I don't know it's kind of like you get

613
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,359
the Gold Fever now I've got the giant

614
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:33,798
fever it's just it's so fun when they

615
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,479
get that big it's it's truly magical

616
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:37,398
it's it's a different dimension and then

617
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,038
to be able to to to show people what's

618
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:42,558
happening they've never seen that before

619
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:44,558
is just it's electric it's really fun I

620
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,359
had two friends in southern orian that

621
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:50,119
grow really big like that which is the

622
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:51,879
Snodgrass family and they had yeah

623
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:54,798
they've got some some plants and the

624
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,399
Williams Wonder was one plant from down

625
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,319
in southern Oregon that got really

626
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,879
really big and another friend named Jim

627
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:03,678
down there who would grow some some

628
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,919
really big plants uh as well and I know

629
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,798
that they would Harvest sort of the

630
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,880
outside of the plant at first and let

631
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:12,480
the inside kind of grow out within a

632
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,200
week or two and then they would get you

633
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,038
know say two to three harvests off off

634
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,360
these particular varietals and they did

635
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:22,679
come from seed as well so um yeah we did

636
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:24,599
that as well even with the snow and the

637
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,480
20 pounds we took was only the first

638
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:28,639
harvest only the buds we pulled down off

639
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,079
there I never even posted or talked

640
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,320
about the second and then the third

641
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,720
Harvest because if we're going to put

642
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:35,200
that weight together it's just Sil at

643
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,759
that point it's just silly the uh and

644
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,360
and the the reality is all of that stuff

645
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:41,240
went to Hash you know everything that

646
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:45,000
was smaller went to hash and it worked

647
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,000
out fantastic it just kept it just kept

648
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,959
giving sorry about that that's awesome I

649
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:52,759
like the way the camera even flipped

650
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,798
right when you went back the timing was

651
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,599
perfect it it in it it really showed

652
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:59,639
that there was a good quality and a good

653
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:04,398
amount of hash oh right

654
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:07,480
on and that's in the Sierra St up the

655
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:09,639
camera we're in the Sierra we're located

656
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,720
at well on the farm that we did the 20

657
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,640
pounds now we were at 1,800 feet the

658
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,519
farm that we're on now is at 2600 so

659
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,720
we're a little bit higher but we get

660
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,038
amazing both spots get full sun all the

661
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,000
way from the beginning of the day to the

662
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,798
end um but we're located between Tahoe

663
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,240
and plaster bille kind of in the middle

664
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,918
right there what uh one thing we've had

665
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,000
going on really difficult is at the end

666
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:35,000
last year a deputy was killed on a Grove

667
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,919
about 10 it was a Grove that was run by

668
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Cartel and the sheriff has fully

669
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,320
initiated uh raids without warrants and

670
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,240
all the legal anybody even with just

671
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:47,079
plants is getting chopped down so we

672
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,278
have a we have a whole lot of drama on

673
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:50,918
around us but what it's made us do is

674
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:52,880
it's made us kind of regroup the plan

675
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:54,759
for our farm and what what we're going

676
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,679
to get into for this next season The

677
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,640
Following Season here and what that's

678
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:02,440
going to entail is a big project

679
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,440
we have four rows 12et wide that we grow

680
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,640
right now each plant gets about 12 by

681
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,798
12 what we're going to do is we're going

682
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,080
to fill Center the center walkway

683
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:14,079
between the two rows to make a 30 foot

684
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:17,158
wide row then we're going to put six

685
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:19,119
plants in green houses in those rows and

686
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,039
try to get them into the ground around

687
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,398
February March at the latest and see

688
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:24,119
what this plant's really capable of

689
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,000
doing we're going to cover it and then

690
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,398
the greenhouse is going to become part

691
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,798
the structure that's going to hold it in

692
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:32,798
place but uh it's a perfect opportunity

693
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,519
kind of back down on our plant numbers

694
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,079
but it also gives us a chance to really

695
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,278
see how big we can grow them so I'm

696
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:40,359
really fired up for it we're getting

697
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:43,159
planning right now and yeah it's gonna

698
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:46,479
be fun to see I've never grown anything

699
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:51,360
more than about 25 feet

700
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:54,440
tall more than 25 feet yeah about 25

701
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:58,199
feet tall the biggest

702
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:00,240
tallest wow that's huge I think that

703
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,480
bookie was our tallest and I want to say

704
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,319
she was about 17 feet um the triple

705
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,759
goddess was really unbelievable because

706
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:08,759
I didn't I didn't take many pictures of

707
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:12,119
her but she was only six or seven feet

708
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:14,079
tall but she was so big around and the

709
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:15,798
key with that one was these big long

710
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:17,960
branches and the triple goddess I think

711
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:20,000
it was the OG that was in it just made

712
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,159
all these popcorn nugs from the middle

713
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,480
of the stalk all the way out so when I

714
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:26,120
looked at that plant I mean I didn't

715
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,278
even I wasn't even really that excited

716
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:31,119
about it it it I looked at it was big

717
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:33,079
figuring maybe 15 pounds 16 pounds it's

718
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,959
beautiful but ah it's it's just not that

719
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:38,720
big when it hit the scale though again

720
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,200
just shocking holy cow very little flar

721
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,360
and that one we harvested all the way to

722
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,038
the Bone we didn't leave anything for

723
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:47,240
the second third Harvest on anything

724
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:49,158
more than 10 or 12 pounds is a [ __ ]

725
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,399
tree

726
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:55,720
yeah it it is a

727
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:57,439
tree that's awesome I'm sure uh what a

728
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,399
beautiful thing to just be able to tour

729
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,320
one day where you're just like oh let's

730
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:03,278

731
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,158
redwoods it's like oh look honey it's

732
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:06,839
the giant cannabis plants we should

733
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:08,440
probably pull in for a little tour with

734
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,599
the

735
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,639
kids you know what what was fun I

736
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:14,119
remember saying to my wife that well

737
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:17,199
which one are we gonna smoke in today

738
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:20,319
hun it's kind of like getting in a

739
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,759
treehouse no doubt well and I'm sure it

740
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:25,240
made a a whole hell of a lot of hash

741
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:26,359
that's uh it's nice to know with

742
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,919
cannabis especially when the

743
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:29,839
government's all sort of like you're

744
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:33,159
allowed to have four plants and that's

745
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:35,879
it it's like okay like sounds good you

746
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:37,600
know it it's it's kind of crazy our

747
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,919
count been really good to us for a lot

748
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:40,798
of years but with what happened with the

749
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:42,880
deputy last year I I just feel that

750
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,200
they're uh they're going Full Throttle

751
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,639
with eradication no matter what the the

752
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,960
levels are so I it's an up and down ride

753
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:52,079
we'll play with six plants next year and

754
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,399
have a blast doing it so it's all

755
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:57,480
good totally well I have a 98 plant

756
00:32:55,398 --> 00:33:00,558
license here that I can grow for my

757
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,880
medical license or if I wanted to grow

758
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,200
on the other side of things

759
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,360
recreationally I guess we're just

760
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,759
allowed for better than nothing for sure

761
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,278
but at the same time I'm kind of looking

762
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:12,679
forward to the day where we don't treat

763
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:14,480
cannabis like plutonium and feel that

764
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:16,240
you have to protect the whole world from

765
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,360
it and that really you have to limit it

766
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,798
in in any way shape or form it's uh they

767
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:22,719
don't they don't do that with

768
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,278
strawberries don't do it

769
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,600
with be

770
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:32,000
legal I I look forward to when in

771
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:34,959
California you can grow it like

772
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,398
Christmas trees and allow people to come

773
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,679
and pick their own mature plants you

774
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:42,719
know you grow a 100,000 on your your

775
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:45,399
field and then you uh let people come

776
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,360
and pick their own one or two kilo or

777
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:51,079
three

778
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:54,959
kilo plant and sell to them for a 100

779
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:54,960
bucks wrapping them up in the

780
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,679
plas dude how about you ask them do want

781
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,880
me to drill a hole in the bottom of it

782
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,880
for

783
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:07,199
you Sam on the East Coast uh some people

784
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:09,800
do that on their hemp Farms they allow

785
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,199
people to come and they uh they'll weigh

786
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,760
it out for them after they've walked

787
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,598
through the through the

788
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:20,119
field starting

789
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:22,280
to the first place go ahead Brian yeah

790
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,280
uh sheep I think it's Sheep Scott farms

791
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,359
in Maine does that they grow acreage for

792
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,919
hemp and really high quality I actually

793
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:32,799
grew the same strains like last year you

794
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:34,319
know sub Hayes um Hawaiian lifter all

795
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,639
these really pretty good strains and

796
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,480
they were did a free pick your own and

797
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:45,838
uh they

798
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,838
also if it's hemp got below 3% THC

799
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,760
yes sort of yeah how do they value it

800
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,760
what's the cost that they Char per wet

801
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,240
weight I don't know Brian maybe he has

802
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,640
some insight

803
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,879
you

804
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:04,679
know I would I wouldn't know I I'm

805
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,838
actually not sure myself in terms of wet

806
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:09,719
waiter yeah I mean there's such a

807
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:11,799
processing you know energy to it and

808
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:13,358
space provided that I think it's almost

809
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,160
a little bit of it's kind of like a good

810
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:18,838
luck in a way with it and hopefully they

811
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:21,799
know what they're doing I'll tell you

812
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:25,119
people getting it in Switzerland in

813
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,800
2001 when I was driving from uh Val

814
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:31,358
husen in the north down to Lugano in the

815
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,119
South uh we would pass these upic and

816
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:35,440
Switzerland has these things all over

817
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,720
there's like flower ones where you just

818
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,639
drop some Swiss Franks in the little

819
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,199
mailbox thing and you can pick a big

820
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:44,960
bouquet of flowers well they started

821
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:46,719
planting cannabis amongst those upic and

822
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,240
you could legitimately not that I needed

823
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:51,118
to I was hanging out with breeder Steve

824
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,679
and he had tunnels full of dank weed

825
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,079
like it was definitely some of the nicer

826
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:58,318
weed in Switzerland that I saw um so I

827
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,440
didn't really you know do it but I

828
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:02,838
thought wow that is the coolest thing in

829
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,119
the world like you can just go snip some

830
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:07,838
branches off that bad boy and like you

831
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,440
know go go home and and make a tinure or

832
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,599
do do whatever it is you want with it I

833
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:15,000
just it was still just fresh out of the

834
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,280
90s cannabis was still very illegal

835
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,440
everywhere and then here was Switzerland

836
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,400
where in val husen it was like football

837
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,400
fields giant huge

838
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,440
grows um most of the people in

839
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Switzerland grew so much those years

840
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,400
that it all rotted they had no they

841
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,599
didn't understand the how the space that

842
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,119
cannabis took to dry and the environment

843
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:38,519
that was required and so all sorts of

844
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,039
cannabis rotted uh on the stem and also

845
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:43,759
in in the barns but what an incredible

846
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:47,519
site to see uh back then I'm sure you

847
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:52,280
used to go quite a bit too back then hey

848
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:55,559
Sam a absolutely I I saw thousands and

849
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:58,880
thousands of plants not only that but my

850
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:01,799
friends were using mobile darkening

851
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,760
units so they were like hoop CES that

852
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,200
could be

853
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,640
moved and they had a few hundred of

854
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:11,399
these hoop CES so they would uh because

855
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:14,239
I was there for seed production not weed

856
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:18,160
production and what we would do is

857
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:21,598
darken the plants off for uh two three

858
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:23,679
four weeks at the most pollinate it and

859
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,760
then move the darkening system to the

860
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:31,078
next group of plants and the seeds would

861
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:33,200
finish mature it would rev and uh not

862
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:36,599
have any mold problems because in

863
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:39,318
Switzerland if you varieties it could be

864
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:41,960
a lot of problems with uh mold and

865
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:45,079
everything else but uh this this worked

866
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,639
out really good the plants never even

867
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:50,318
finished flowering but they still had

868
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:53,279
pretty good seed yields and uh it was

869
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:55,480
totally easy to

870
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,280
do interesting and that was in

871
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,960
Switzerland was that in the North or

872
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,960
no that was near

873
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,960
Zur

874
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:12,680

and ran it through your bubble bags no

912
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:05,640
it does it have a uh a glandular resin

913
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:07,400
gland it does indeed wow interesting

914
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:09,838
yeah I saw you I saw you getting down

915
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,358
with a few different things yeah back in

916
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,838
the day you know I just was like I was

917
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:15,759
kind of like Well there must be

918
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:17,559
something to this and then I I went on I

919
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,280
would you know there I didn't understand

920
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:21,880
the language a lot I didn't know a lot

921
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,000
of the terms and so it was difficult to

922
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:27,400
do research on something that you didn't

923
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
really know the terms for but eventually

924
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:34,039
I found an article from a BRI uh from a

925
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,920
university on glandular tricomes of of

926
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:39,318
mint and then I bought some mint and I

927
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,119
went home and I made some mint hash ran

928
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:43,920
it in my bubble bags made this little

929
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,039
Gummy mint hash you know dried it out

930
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,358
was kind of like what should I do with

931
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:48,000
this so I was like I'm gonna have a bong

932
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:49,838
rip of it of course so I slapped the

933
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,880
mint hash in the bong and I took a big

934
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:55,239
bong rip and I blew it out it was just

935
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,240
like it was so smooth and and just

936
00:40:55,239 --> 00:41:00,000
Pleasant that I was like you know that

937
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:02,799
that was kind of crazy and when I say a

938
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,318
bong R like because I was now trained in

939
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,240
the art of full melt um first of course

940
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:12,679
by you know the Maestro skunkman Sam in

941
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:14,719
in 95 via not from but via a friend of

942
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:17,480
his I saw the First full melt if it

943
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,838
don't bubble it ain't worth the trouble

944
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:23,519
um and that really sort of uh opened my

945
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:26,039
eyes to it so I would waft the match or

946
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,039
the beine it was a match back then over

947
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:30,199
the over the hash to kind to allow it to

948
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:31,759
melt and stuff not really burn it harsh

949
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:33,759
so that's why it was just this beautiful

950
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,040
pleasant experience I'd really vaporized

951
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,079
the mint so then I was like well I got

952
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:40,318
to do this with cannabis like maybe

953
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,480
maybe it'll soothe the bong rip and I I

954
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:45,239
you know I put a bunch of full melt hash

955
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,119
in and and some mint hash and I took a a

956
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:50,078
rip of that through the tube and was

957
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,960
like just blown away how I didn't wow

958
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,318
the mint so I go and I do this I go onto

959
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,559
the internet and I'm like mint suppress

960
00:41:55,318 --> 00:42:00,239
cough and it's like r J Reynolds $322

961
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,920
million study to come up with

962
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:06,439
mentholated cigarettes I'm like whoa $32

963
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,800
million I used a set of bubble bags and

964
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,679
some

965
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,680
mint and a bong you know it just blew me

966
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,358
away it reminded me of the uh the

967
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,440
Americans spending all that money for

968
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,558
the the pen that would would write in

969
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,519
space and then the Russians just used a

970
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:24,359
pencil I was like that's crazy well

971
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:27,440
that's that's what you know in uh in

972
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:29,119
their system the dumbest idea ideas rise

973
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,599
to the top and then they get funded with

974
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,440
all the money so you know nothing but I

975
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:36,640
think it was uh I think it was a

976
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,880
straight concentrates is actually who

977
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,279
I've been been uh following recently

978
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,800
they've been doing a bunch of glandular

979
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,800
extractions I think they did hops

980
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,720
recently yeah and and I think he was

981
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,640
working on something else too recently

982
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,719
but yeah real interesting to realize

983
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,279
that you know that those glands are

984
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:58,519
really just the protection mechanism not

985
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,599
just but are function has a highly you

986
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:03,239
know evolved protection mechanism for

987
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:05,880
these different plants in this uh

988
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:09,039
wonderful plant kingdom and for our

989
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:12,440
Consciousness talk about a protective

990
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:15,239
mechanism wow there go it's okay Marcus

991
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,200
if we call you a mint head uh you know

992
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:19,919
what I didn't get hard into the mint I

993
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:23,838
got to admit Sam that was the last batch

994
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:28,119
I'm just joking because in La back in

995
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:31,279
the70s mint heads they would put PC p on

996
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:34,039
mint and smoke it and everybody call

997
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,880
them mint heads bro then you can

998
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:39,519
definitely call me a mint head that's

999
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,519
like my regular

1000
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,639
ritual I got it in a salt and pepper

1001
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:46,919
shaker but it's called the PCP Shaker

1002
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:50,239
instead of wake and bake you wake and

1003
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:53,440
Fry oh my God that puts a new meaning to

1004
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:57,479
to the name thin M listen I'll be honest

1005
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:01,760
I am not a fan of disassociative drugs

1006
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:04,639
like PCP and like belladon and like uh

1007
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:08,000
you know just I don't like drugs pamine

1008
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:09,759
is the same K listen any drug that you

1009
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,639
have forgotten that you've taken a drug

1010
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,200
while you're super lit and frying hard

1011
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:19,118
not interested in yeah

1012
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:21,279
Salvia it's the same stuff yeah Salvia

1013
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,838
was uh I've seen too many bad

1014
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,920
experiences in Lugano with that Salvia

1015
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:29,358
stuff it always would start well breeder

1016
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,079
Steve used to think was funny as hell I

1017
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,960
know trust me it was part of what made

1018
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:36,599
it even

1019
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,400
worse yep I I told him if he ever does

1020
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:41,400
that to me it'd be the last thing he

1021
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,519
[ __ ] did well I'll never forget when

1022
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,599
he did it to horge sentes because I was

1023
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,280
sitting there with him and it was just

1024
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,599
us and he said to horge hey do you want

1025
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,000
to get higher than you've ever been with

1026
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,760
a bong and passed him like the you know

1027
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,719
the lighter and the bong and hor was

1028
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,559
like sure I've never horg doesn't even

1029
00:44:55,719 --> 00:45:01,399
smoke a lot he hit this bowl like

1030
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:04,160
nobody's business uh finished it right

1031
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,838
off and then literally proceeded like

1032
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,199
I've never seen anything like it like he

1033
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:09,960
just you could see the moment where he

1034
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:12,480
was like realized he was in this

1035
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,240
full-blown Terror trip and he just like

1036
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,280
grabbed the side of his face and

1037
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:20,558
screamed this terrible scream inside the

1038
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:24,240
warehouse at Steve's place in Lugano and

1039
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:26,440
uh it was not a good vibe I remember it

1040
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,838
actually upset Annie reiken quite a bit

1041
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,679
she she got really upset with

1042
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:33,960
it don't do that to people you know I

1043
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:35,919
like to follow Tim L's two Commandments

1044
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,039
of never giving people a psychedelic

1045
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,480
without their knowledge uh and never

1046
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:41,358
trying to keep people from taking

1047
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,280
psychedelics those are the the two

1048
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:45,719
psychedelic Commandments that I can get

1049
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,240
behind

1050
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:52,759
personally I think all police officers

1051
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:52,759
should probably do a healthy dose of

1052
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,119
LSD I think uh we should take their guns

1053
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,119
away

1054
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,039
first hey on that subject uh what's it

1055
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:08,159
all like with the Canadian police

1056
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:09,480
compared to American police police

1057
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:11,719
because we got all these police that

1058
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,079
just love to beat people up and kill

1059
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:17,519
people how you Canadian police just got

1060
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:20,000
called to a uh what's it called now a

1061
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:22,039
it's like a checkup you know but really

1062
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,960
what it is is it's abuse of power and

1063
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:27,480
it's usually a jilted spouse is like oh

1064
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,639
she has a she has a history of M illness

1065
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,559
can you go check up on her so they

1066
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:35,480
rolled up on this native

1067
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:38,599
woman and killed her in her home this

1068
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,880
happened like two weeks ago maybe Nova

1069
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:44,240
can Canadian please carry

1070
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,079
guns uh tasers and guns absolutely you

1071
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:47,439
know we don't have the level of it

1072
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,039
obviously we don't have the amount of

1073
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,800
people that are down in the US but that

1074
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:54,199
should happen two weeks ago no one can

1075
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:57,960
deny it you know like checking up on her

1076
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:59,358
and end up uh killing her two people got

1077
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,280
killed out in I think it was New

1078
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,239
Brunswick or maybe it was Nova Scotia

1079
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,880
but it was I think it was New Brunswick

1080
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:09,399
and uh another man got uh indigenous man

1081
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,480
got killed out there and then other

1082
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,119
people saw the the chief that got

1083
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,318
attacked that was in March terrible I

1084
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:19,200
would say the biggest issue with police

1085
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:21,480
up here that's super alarming and even

1086
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:25,399
not with police but it's the missing and

1087
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:27,960
and murdered indigenous women is is a

1088
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,519
massive massive problem up here in

1089
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,480
Canada and there's highways up here that

1090
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:35,000
are not associated with the police um

1091
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,000
that are associated with truckers and

1092
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,440
different people on on the road that you

1093
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,039
know there's a lot of killing of of

1094
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,760
indigenous women and so that that's

1095
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:46,358
alarming British Colombian cops don't

1096
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,440
have to have cameras on their body

1097
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:52,598
either so I think that's another push

1098
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,639
here in in British Colombia is to have

1099
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:57,599
cops you know have that accountability

1100
00:47:54,639 --> 00:48:00,000
of of having um body cam

1101
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,160
and I mean Vancouver is a well-known

1102
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,679
like there's some really really bad

1103
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:07,879
spots in Vancouver as beautiful as it is

1104
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:10,399
and and it is a spectacular City to to

1105
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:13,240
visit and everything but there's some

1106
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,000
heavy duty homeless spots and hardcore

1107
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:17,679
spots in Vancouver I mean Canada is

1108
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,239
known as as a wonderful country and and

1109
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:22,960
generally a lot of the people are super

1110
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:26,318
super awesome but there there is a

1111
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,280
definite undertone of of racism I mean I

1112
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:30,599
think Vancouver is the largest seik

1113
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:34,359
population outside of

1114
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:36,720
India um and it's not funny but you know

1115
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:39,078
Vancouver is known as hongcouver maybe

1116
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:42,558
it's funny but anyway there's a lot of

1117
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:45,960
people Toronto

1118
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:49,240
also um anyway so that's that's some of

1119
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,880
the stuff happening up here yeah and the

1120
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:52,479
there's the biker element too and they

1121
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,039
they really hush up the police on a lot

1122
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,000
of stuff the bikers

1123
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:58,639
do yeah I was just curious it seems like

1124
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,679
some intelligent people could really

1125
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:02,558
figure this stuff out really quickly and

1126
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:05,039
and for some reason they choose not to

1127
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,680
but and not to harp on that subject for

1128
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:10,159
too long you know I keep it positive

1129
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:13,639
around here well the police in America

1130
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:16,239
are protected by the police unions what

1131
00:49:13,639 --> 00:49:19,358
you need to do is declare the police

1132
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:21,759
unions domestic terrorist groups and get

1133
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:23,759
the [ __ ] rid of them yeah they need to

1134
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,480
demilitarize the police for certain

1135
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,000
because that was the start of the end

1136
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,519
right there like just don't we don't

1137
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,318
need these guys like in fully armored

1138
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:35,079
vehicles with grenades and machine guns

1139
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:37,519
and you know huge bulletproof everything

1140
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:39,839
like that's dude police is just like you

1141
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:41,679
need to like you're there to help people

1142
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:45,599
not not murder

1143
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:48,480
them deescalation and human rights you

1144
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,720
know like Health you know like

1145
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,559
humanistic intervention you know people

1146
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:54,159
would be nice to go around with the cups

1147
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,839
I mean there's a lot of mental illness

1148
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:58,318
out there and I mean I don't even know

1149
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:00,798
how you legitimately create a police

1150
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:02,719
force that's perfect so I I understand

1151
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:06,079
the difficulty in that but I think the

1152
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:08,480
dialog important I dialogue is important

1153
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,480
and it's you know for me I haven't been

1154
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,079
involved in the dialogue too much I've

1155
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,480
really been just watching and reading

1156
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,318
and listening and it's funny because

1157
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,920
I've been called out by a few people

1158
00:50:15,318 --> 00:50:18,639
like hey you're not backing us up and

1159
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,920
I'm like oh yeah I'm doing I'm gonna do

1160
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:23,759
something and so what I planed to do

1161
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:26,240
I've contacted my partner Claude from

1162
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:29,319
Jamaica and I thought you know is there

1163
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:32,039
a way to get this is mainly about black

1164
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:33,838
lives matter and and sort of you know

1165
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:36,159
the discussion that's going on right now

1166
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:38,639
with the police murdering black men in

1167
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:40,519
this accelerated way and this whole

1168
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:42,719
white privilege and I thought well gez

1169
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:45,559
like how can I use my platform to

1170
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:47,879
involve that conversation so I called my

1171
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:49,880
buddy Claude And I said hey would like

1172
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,559
Richie Spice and some other artists be

1173
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,838
interested and maybe we could get knife

1174
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:55,519
this amazing Rastafarian PhD that I've

1175
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:57,400
had on hash Church before he's just

1176
00:50:55,519 --> 00:51:00,519
brilliant and he on both sides of the

1177
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:02,960
fence from the Rastafarian sort of deep

1178
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:06,119
knowledge Elder Knowledge but also from

1179
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,519
the schooled and educated um side of

1180
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:11,358
things you know maybe get John nine

1181
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:14,239
who's a female artist from Jamaica and

1182
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:16,078
sort of offer them the platform to speak

1183
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:19,558
about white privilege to speak about

1184
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,920
rasa Fara and livid and the music and

1185
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:23,720
and and cannabis and ganja and all of

1186
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,480
these things and so he he was kind of

1187
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:28,000
excited when I when I offered that to

1188
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,880
him so that's a I'm going to try and get

1189
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,679
uh going on hash church here in the very

1190

fresh and so that's uh you know

1192
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:39,039

world because of these serious serious

1211
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:25,318
issues com to the Forefront of people's

1212
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,559
minds and everyone have to kind of

1213
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:29,558
re-evaluate what their position on the

1214
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:31,440
earth is and and really what's going on

1215

what is health and you know all these

1217
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,280
kind of questions that are coming to the

1218
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:39,679
Forefront it's very true there's no

1219
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:43,880
denying it you know just just even with

1220
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:45,318
you know whatever covid-19 is the one

1221
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,798
thing that I've seen that's come out of

1222
00:52:45,318 --> 00:52:50,960
it that I was really quite excited about

1223
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:53,679
was the interest that people had to

1224
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,679
produce their own food and the interest

1225
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,440
that they had to plant a garden and to

1226
00:52:56,679 --> 00:52:59,919
start having a discussion about how do

1227
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,159
you plant a garden where do you get

1228
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,920
seeds what do you plant your garden in

1229
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:05,440
what kind of soil do you use how often

1230
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,079
do you water it and all of a sudden

1231
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,119
these you know they weren't talking

1232
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:10,280
about what was on Seinfeld last week

1233
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,640
they were talking about those

1234
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,480
conversations and although I have a lot

1235
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:17,078
of friends that are involved in those

1236
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,159
conversations already I started hearing

1237
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:21,039
people who have never been involved in

1238
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:22,798
those conversations starting to say

1239
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,239
these things and having these

1240
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:25,679
conversations with their kids because

1241
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,318
their kids aren't at school anymore

the Earth that produces the substances

1249
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,720

00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:28,159
touching on Marcus is what you know

1267

we're we're in a an Awakening right now

1268
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:34,118
and that Awakening is um is pouring over

1269
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:35,960
into social injustice it's it's

1270
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:38,480
highlighting and put a microscope on the

1271
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:42,159
things that should have had a microscope

1272
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:44,280
on them a long time ago and we you know

1273
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:46,639
we're we're we've you know we have to

1274
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:49,880
bring everyone's voice together to fight

1275
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:51,679
for the justice that needs to happen and

1276
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:54,280
we can be better for it and we can all

1277
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:56,399
be more aware of ourselves the

1278
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,119
surroundings that we put ourselves in

1279
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,519
and

1280
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,559
ultimately the future that we hold in

1281
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:03,079
you know in front of us and that's

1282
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:06,040
that's the most important thing and I

1283
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:08,079
think you know I'm doing my best as a

1284
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:10,960
privileged person in all this to listen

1285
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:13,720
to learn to try to understand all the

1286
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:17,798
different facets of of all of this and

1287
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:21,759
to support um and be a support system in

1288
00:55:17,798 --> 00:55:24,239
any way I can um but it's you know that

1289
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,839
that's Marcus doing that show would be

1290
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,879
great you know and and putting some

1291
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:30,519
sponsors together you know that people

1292
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:32,440
can can donate to for a good cause would

1293
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:34,119
be really helpful and you know if

1294
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:36,400
anyone's out there listening now I think

1295
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:40,680
it's important to um pick a great

1296
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:43,280
organization to support and to um you

1297
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:45,118
know make sure that the whatever you're

1298
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,079
giving to that organization is going to

1299
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,960
the cause that you're you're mostly

1300
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:53,119
profoundly um you know getting behind so

1301
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,400
you all have a lot more faith in

1302
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,480
humanity than I do well we've been

1303
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:01,559
around less than you dude you've seen

1304
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:05,400
way more harshit than us ganja Farmers

1305
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:07,280
the ganja Farmers remember recent

1306
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:10,318
demonstration during the recent

1307
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,680
demonstrations at Berkeley when they

1308
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:15,119
looted a bunch of

1309
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:17,440
dispensaries that was a

1310
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,640
bummer yeah that's I feel like that's a

1311
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:23,798
lot of organized crime taking advantage

1312
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:25,440
of the broken system um and

1313
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:27,719
unfortunately a lot of there's a lot of

1314
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,960
good outfits that did get hit I know

1315
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:34,199
Magnolia got hit I know that berly

1316
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:37,798
patience groups got got hit three

1317
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:39,439
times W yeah I I heard harbor side was

1318
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:41,639
just completely it just wiped everything

1319
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,400
out so I I feel for all of those

1320
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:48,558
businesses and it is a shame it's it's

1321
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,400
not okay um you know it's that's a tough

1322
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:52,240
one when you see things like that going

1323
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,559
on I I think it's the ones we need to

1324
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:57,558
reach the most the ones we need to reach

1325
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:59,359
the most are the organized criminals

1326
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:01,559
they're the ones whose Minds have to be

1327
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:03,838
turned around you got to remember that

1328
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:05,640
the Brotherhood of eternal love were a

1329
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:09,078
bunch of

1330
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:11,199
biker criminals before they turned

1331
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:14,880
on

1332
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:14,879
yeah it's interesting

1333
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:21,038
perspective Surfers I have a quick

1334
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,640

00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,559
rosin what

1361
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,280
temp strawberry

1362
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:49,519
angel we're starting to we're starting

1363
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,280
to get more requests for people that

1364
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:54,358
want to supress

1365
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,480
hemp and make cash out of it there's

1366
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:58,639
someone out on the East Coast that's

1367
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,639
like oh yeah we need a bunch of hemp I

1368
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:03,078
was like oh yeah give my friend Dave a

1369
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:04,639
call but yeah I know there's a have you

1370
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:06,960
guys been hearing about that or what's

1371
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:09,558
up yeah I've been I've been pressing

1372
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,559
some hemp uh I think there's a big push

1373
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:13,599
for people trying to get solventless

1374
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:15,640
products on the market from hemp I think

1375
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,039
you know it's a real viscous material I

1376
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:20,519
don't know if anybody's been pressing

1377
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:23,880
any of it or watched any uh hemp before

1378
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:26,599
but uh it's mainly like a 45 25 kind of

1379
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,559
grit to it real

1380
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:30,119
I heard friends don't let friends press

1381
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:33,559
h that's what I

1382
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:37,760
heard that's number one and number two

1383
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:44,240
you press hemp that's 3%

1384
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:46,559
th resin or the rosin will be way way

1385
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:49,199
illegal that's true

1386
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:51,160
yeah it's real visous too because of the

1387
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:53,759
lack of of canono it's really

1388
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:57,399
interesting so most of the people up in

1389
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:59,240
Canada have to grow good hemp under

1390
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:02,680
a

1391
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:04,199
um Regular like recreational license

1392
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:05,960
because if you get a hemp license in

1393
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:08,159
Canada you're basically locked into

1394
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:11,838
their varietals which are not

1395
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:14,639
representative of high CBD cannabinoids

1396
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:17,159
so you know you have to kind of have a

1397
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:19,598
regular recreational license in order to

1398
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:21,399
even bring you know be able to bring in

1399
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:23,760
varietals into your scene but then again

1400
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,280
you have to do it when you start your

1401
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,640
license because you can't bring it in

1402
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:31,798
afterwards it's kind of messed

1403
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:33,598
up well that's you can you can bring

1404
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:38,318
varieties in

1405
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,318
afterwards I I ship seeds to

1406
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:48,639
uh I I shipped uh a kilo a week ago with

1407
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:51,720
a Canadian import license and with u uh

1408
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:53,239
all the legal certificates required and

1409
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:56,000
uh there's no

1410
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:58,199
restrictions all right well there's some

1411
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,239
type of restriction for some I don't

1412
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:02,279
know I was just talking to David Peron

1413
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:06,318
on the uh from the green organic

1414
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:08,960
Dutchman and there's there's you know

1415
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:11,279
for some they can't just bring in

1416
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,280
varials they have to create them after

1417
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:17,000
they have them you I don't again there's

1418
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:19,400
a lot of logistics to it but I know that

1419
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,400
definely that way for are starting I

1420
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:23,358
think a lot of it has to do with people

1421
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,838
all have different levels of knowledge

1422
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:26,960
and because I I'll tell you I had a

1423
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:29,639
friend of mine tell me that absolutely

1424
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:32,199
no way can you bring seeds in Canada and

1425
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:34,239
I was like okay like I know people doing

1426
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:39,480
it but you know that's neither here nor

1427
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:41,879
there Le i' I've supplied 20 of the LPS

1428
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,880
in

1429
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:48,559
Canada well and I can tell you I was in

1430
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:53,000
an LP in Canada staring at these

1431
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:55,599
beautiful skunk Haze plants in um in a

1432
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,719
greenhouse and I was like man like I was

1433
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:00,119
like where did you get the first I said

1434
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:03,480
what are these and he said they're skunk

1435
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:06,838
Hayes and I was like where did you get

1436
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:09,000
these and uh he didn't really know but I

1437
01:02:06,838 --> 01:02:11,358
knew I knew right away where they came

1438
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,278
from and they were beautiful man they

1439
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:17,880
were like seven eight feet tall huge big

1440
01:02:15,278 --> 01:02:22,639
rows of them and just really healthy and

1441
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:22,640
resinous and had my mouth

1442
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:28,119
watering hey I got a quick uh quick in

1443
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,240
put onto the squishing hemp not to

1444
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:34,079
change back to an old subject but just

1445
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:37,399
real quick um you know I was always I

1446
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:39,160
was always a little skeptical of the CBD

1447
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:41,960
push when it first came out I own a

1448
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:44,118
smoke shop and you know we sold a little

1449
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:46,960
bit of CBD and my friends Matt rise

1450
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:48,920
who's one of the first pushers of CBD

1451
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,960
and you know I took the pills and I

1452
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:53,559
smoked some of the early flowers and

1453
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,000
some of the early hash and you know it

1454
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:58,519
it it was cool and everything but really

1455
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,199
when I got a nice an ounce of some

1456
01:02:58,519 --> 01:03:03,838
really high-grade hemp flowers from

1457
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:05,798
organs that my buddy grew all you know

1458
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:08,480
Korean natural farming style and I took

1459
01:03:05,798 --> 01:03:11,278
it home and I actually squished it on my

1460
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:14,480
Rosen press and for the first time I

1461
01:03:11,278 --> 01:03:18,358
took a really fat nice you know like a

1462
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:20,039
really good dab using you know the same

1463
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:22,759
technique I would with some you know

1464
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:24,599
really good fresh Frozen and The

1465
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:27,440
Experience from smoking that hash

1466
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:29,880
convinced me about CBD and I actually

1467
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:34,519
got enough concentrated form to actually

1468
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:37,480
be able to testify to the powers of CBD

1469
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:40,159
and it was only in the form of rosin

1470
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,679
from those really highgrade flowers that

1471
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:43,960
I was able to come up with that

1472
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:46,278
testimony and now I can actually tell

1473
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:51,559
patients what it's all about if if

1474
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:55,000
you're making rosin out of uh a high CBD

1475
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:56,798
variety then the THC level is going to

1476
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:02,079
be a couple of

1477
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:04,920
% true it's notc which is what makes it

1478
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:08,160
good right

1479
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:13,278
true well I would go one step further

1480
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:13,278
and say that with no CBD it's even

1481
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:19,839
better maybe it's time to change your

1482
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:23,278
name from hemp guy to THC

1483
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:24,838
guy I concur Sam I think that uh most

1484
01:04:23,278 --> 01:04:29,199
most varieties I've seen from test

1485
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:31,318
results um on a wide variety of of of uh

1486
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:34,960
different cultivars they're really

1487
01:04:31,318 --> 01:04:37,519
anywhere from like four and up in terms

1488
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,278
of percentages um very rarely is it

1489
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:43,079
actually at the legal limit in which

1490
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:45,199
they're asking everyone to be at so it's

1491
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:48,839
um

1492
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:51,239
it's it's almost impossible to produce

1493
01:04:48,838 --> 01:04:55,759
High CBD varieties that fall within the

1494
01:04:51,239 --> 01:05:00,199
legal limit because the CBD synthesis

1495
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:04,640
reduces THC at a ratio of about 20 to1

1496
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:06,759
which means that if you've got 20% THC I

1497
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:10,798
mean 20%

1498
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:14,920
CBD your CBD level is going to be like

1499
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:17,519
you know more than 1% right THC exactly

1500
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:21,798
yeah and that's that's before you squash

1501
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:23,440
it right exactly and that's that's the

1502
01:05:21,798 --> 01:05:24,960
that's the beauty of it all right now is

1503
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,440
that there's there is very much a gray

1504
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,798
area and I think you know if we keep

1505
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:32,079
working and working these lines I think

1506
01:05:29,798 --> 01:05:34,119
eventually you know as the farm bill

1507
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:36,359
caught up in the in the states I think

1508
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:37,720
you know hopefully I think the the laws

1509
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:40,960
will catch up and everything will be

1510
01:05:37,719 --> 01:05:43,798
worked out to reflect the plant's you

1511
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,720
know ability to produce those

1512
01:05:43,798 --> 01:05:46,759
cannabinoids and those those major and

1513
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:49,480
minor

1514
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:51,839
cannabinoids does anybody know how um

1515
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,920
how transparent these testing companies

1516
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:55,880
are and actually how accurate these

1517
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,278
testings are and all that because I know

1518
01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:00,480
just a lot can be manipulated with

1519
01:05:58,278 --> 01:06:02,358
Statistics and testing and maybe even

1520
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,159
pay off a company or these kind of

1521
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:05,639
things has anyone really looked into

1522
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:08,798
that or are we just kind of trusting

1523
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:12,558
science at that point I have my own lab

1524
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:16,358
for the last 30 years like your own lab

1525
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:20,640
as in you do the the the

1526
01:06:16,358 --> 01:06:24,598
ACTC uh uh uh gas chromatography we had

1527
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:27,558
our own lab set up a decade before Steve

1528
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:27,559
pill

1529
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:33,959
that's amazing Sam so what I'm seeing um

1530
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:36,598
just from my own experience is that it

1531
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,440
depends um what instrumentation the lab

1532
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:41,559
has and the investment they' put into

1533
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:44,679
that said instrumentation so let's say

1534
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:47,880
one lab Lab a will have gas

1535
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:51,000
chromatography hplc and the lab B will

1536
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:53,200
have liquid chromatography and while

1537
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,679
they're both maybe right for those said

1538
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:57,919
Labs they're both going to give

1539
01:06:54,679 --> 01:07:00,358
different and results and we trust those

1540
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:03,000
end results to then go to market with so

1541
01:07:00,358 --> 01:07:05,400
that's the the difficult aspect of where

1542
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,199
the debacle I guess of labs right now is

1543
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,240
that there's no standardization for

1544
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:11,919
anything so we're really left with

1545
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:14,798
trusting their processes once we give

1546
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:18,358
them our material um so that's where I

1547
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:20,199
see the biggest there are public there's

1548
01:07:18,358 --> 01:07:21,759
there are

1549
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:24,199
publish

1550
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,240
methodologies which you can follow and

1551
01:07:24,199 --> 01:07:30,239
you will get the same results with the

1552
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:32,959
same Machinery with the same

1553
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:35,439
materials yeah so okay I hear what

1554
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:38,880
you're saying so but what I'm what I'm

1555
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:41,720
illustrating is the fact that no two no

1556
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:44,000
no two labs are the same where in my

1557
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:46,798
experience where most of them have their

1558
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,838
own set of Sops and instrumentation and

1559
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:53,239
one one might not have instrumentation

1560
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:54,838
that the other might have so right

1561
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:57,759
that's the biggest differentiation when

1562
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:59,400
I send a test result out like banic I

1563
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,039
don't want to name n but there's certain

1564
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:03,798
certain companies give me higher test

1565
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:06,440
results and I I see it from just the way

1566
01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:09,838
that they test stuff so I think there is

1567
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:11,159
a disconnect in terms of that there's a

1568
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:14,318
H

1569
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:16,559
Farm there's a H Farm out here a hemp

1570
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:18,399
Farm out here in Hawaii just real quick

1571
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:22,960
a hemp Farm out here in Hawaii that I

1572
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:25,519
know personally and um he sent in three

1573
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,560
samples of the same exact plant and

1574
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:30,080
labeled them differently just to test

1575
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:32,440
the test lab yeah and he got three

1576
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,439
different

1577
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,838
results how different were they couple

1578
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:41,480
points or like significant uh not not

1579
01:08:38,838 --> 01:08:43,519
super significant no but but enough to

1580
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:45,158
where maybe hey I can't sell that batch

1581
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:48,359
you know what I mean like that kind of

1582
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:49,719
you know that that would matter you know

1583
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:51,480
you mean in terms of the pesticide

1584
01:08:49,719 --> 01:08:53,560
screening or the heavy metal screen or

1585
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:55,919
more more like the percentage like all

1586
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:58,880
of a sudden you have much THC and now

1587
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:02,480
you can't sell that batch legally or

1588
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:05,480
something yeah exactly that's I see I

1589
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:06,959
see it from Lab to lab um and and

1590
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:09,439
there's definitely I don't know Sam if

1591
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:12,880
you've seen this but I I've I've been

1592
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:14,960
told there's a 30% variance um based on

1593
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,520
the the testing methods that that are

1594
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:21,198
used um and that's a huge variant

1595
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:24,679
identical Machinery identical

1596
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:28,479
protocol you get identical results I'm

1597
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:30,520
telling you I I when I set our lab up we

1598
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:33,039
had a lot of trouble getting standards

1599
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:35,279
we finally did obtain proper standards

1600
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:38,000
we tested them

1601
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:42,199
and we knew they

1602
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:46,238
were uh they were claimed to be 98% THC

1603
01:09:42,198 --> 01:09:48,678
when in truth it was 86% THC and I also

1604
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:52,198
sent a sample to Dr Bren Eisen in

1605
01:09:48,679 --> 01:09:54,760
Switzerland and Dr El in Mississippi

1606
01:09:52,198 --> 01:09:57,639
they confirmed my results we had

1607
01:09:54,760 --> 01:10:00,840
identical results to them because the

1608
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:02,840
three of us were doing it

1609
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:05,319
correctly yeah it seems we need you to

1610
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,880
open the lab there's serious scientific

1611
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:09,639
labs and then there's these business

1612
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,480
Labs that open up that you know you know

1613
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,920
maybe they're given higher numbers maybe

1614
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:14,678
they're you know not as good at their

1615
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:17,039
jobs maybe they're not able to follow

1616
01:10:14,679 --> 01:10:18,960
the standards and the Sops as well but

1617
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:21,600
there's definitely I mean if you want to

1618
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,640
see how accurate labs are really the

1619
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,360
only way would be to develop your own

1620
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,360
system where you knew each and every

1621
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:29,479
time like Sam was getting accurate

1622
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:32,799
results that were like verified by two

1623
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:34,319
outside Labs the Eli lab in Mississippi

1624
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,960
and the one in Switzerland those are

1625
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:39,439
like big named labs and then you send

1626
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,719
that same material out to two or the two

1627
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:42,599
they were the

1628
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:46,039
two I'm

1629
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:48,800
say what I'm saying

1630
01:10:46,039 --> 01:10:50,920
SOB Labs I mean it's expensive but if I

1631
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,679
want to know the accuracy like I'll

1632
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,440
definitely send it to more than one lab

1633
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:58,000
and uh you know see what kind of VAR

1634
01:10:55,439 --> 01:10:58,000
ations I

1635
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:05,400
get I wanted to send our weed to Prague

1636
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:08,400
and get the 100

1637
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:08,399
canid

1638
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:15,320
bio that's that's that's kind of the Big

1639
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:16,640
Goal you know get Beyond 12 canabo if

1640
01:11:15,319 --> 01:11:18,158
there's books and everything written on

1641
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,520
all these canabo then why are we fooling

1642

01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:14,239
crazy on the vegetable tip and

1663
01:12:11,319 --> 01:12:17,198
ornamentals even and seeing a lot of

1664
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:20,559
volunteers come up on the land this year

1665
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:23,439
so um yeah just really connecting to the

1666
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:25,760
plants as well the same the same tip I

1667
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:28,399
think that most people are feeling and

1668
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:31,159
kind of digging deep into thoughts and

1669
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:33,079
exploration just through planting of of

1670
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:37,158
local Terre and

1671
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:39,359
even um I guess uh the the ground we

1672
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:43,119
walk on the air we breathe you know the

1673
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:45,198
water that falls here and trying to be

healed by the medicine and fed by the

1675
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:50,399
food that comes from that so working at

1676
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,560
everything every way we can trying to

1677

1706
01:14:08,279 --> 01:14:13,920
thing I just am in recognition that

1707
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:16,880
there's over a hundred cannaboids in the

1708

plant and we are why don't you tell me

1709

01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:25,239
studied you know the plant in and out

1711
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:29,560
basically you're talking to the wrong

1712
01:14:25,238 --> 01:14:33,238
guy I'm a recreational guy THC is where

1713
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:34,600
it's at all the other conides do not get

1714
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:39,599

1715
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:42,199
high well CBM it you know and and I love

1716
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:44,560
that you love getting high um it's just

1717
01:14:42,198 --> 01:14:47,759
it just happens to be that there's other

1718
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:50,639
ailments out there that the ganja helps

1719
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:54,800
and so it's super useful well that's why

1720
01:14:50,639 --> 01:14:57,319
I what you want hey that's why I'm

1721
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:00,239
asking asking you what do you want

1722
01:14:57,319 --> 01:15:02,119
because I know what I want you want th

1723
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:06,119
in the right

1724
01:15:02,119 --> 01:15:08,800
tures what I'm looking for we're after

1725
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:10,439
THC the fra we after

1726
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,639
THC

1727
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:16,279
sorry go ahead my

1728
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:18,480
go I I I don't have much more to say

1729
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:20,439
other than just I like the fractal of

1730
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:22,599
possibilities I like that it's fractal

1731
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:24,519
medicine you know I'm not going to just

1732
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,520
like throw in the towel because we found

1733
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,880
th you know what I mean like I'm out

1734
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:31,440
there like believing there's something

1735
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:33,920
more to it also you know I mean I think

1736
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:36,279
DHC is awesome I'm smoking weed right

1737
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,800
now you know what I mean but uh you know

1738
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:40,559
I like the herbalist aspect of it so you

1739
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,600
know I mean there's there's more to the

1740
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:45,880
ganja than even just the resin you know

1741
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:48,239
I mean there's the roots hold you know

1742
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:50,359
tremendous uh potential in healing

1743
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:52,439
medicine so when we make our medicine

1744
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:54,279
you know we're making whole plant

1745
01:15:52,439 --> 01:15:55,799
medicine and and I think there's value

1746
01:15:54,279 --> 01:15:57,479
to the Lea

1747
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,760
you know I think there's value to the

1748
01:15:57,479 --> 01:16:04,198
seed and to the stem and and and it's a

1749
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:06,560
fact so you know mat you know I I would

1750
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:09,399
love to hear more about endo fidic and

1751
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,520
and uh bacteria and fungi which comes

1752
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:14,079
from the soil you know those are those

1753
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:16,560
are unknown medicinal compounds I mean

1754
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:18,600
they're just beginning to to study those

1755
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:21,960
so do I believe there's more to the

1756
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:25,480
Cannabis than just THC hell

1757
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:28,158
yeah maybe THC just get you high I'm not

1758
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:30,399
trying to say there's not nothing more

1759
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:33,198
I'm saying it won't get you high that's

1760
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:36,519
all I'm saying of course there's there's

1761
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:39,399
all these other con I I developed the

1762
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:42,800
world's first High CBD variety we did

1763
01:16:39,399 --> 01:16:45,960
the same thing with CBC cpg

1764
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:48,440
thcv and uh another half dozen

1765
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,039
cannaboids but they were strictly for

1766
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:52,759
medical use they weren't for

1767
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:55,359
recreational use a recreation what what

1768
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:56,719
is getting high what is getting high

1769
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:59,639
what does that

1770
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:03,840
mean uh it's different for a lot of

1771
01:16:59,639 --> 01:17:08,359
people but uh some people get high quite

1772
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:11,560
literally just to get [ __ ] up not

1773
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:14,519
because they need it or want if they

1774
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,320
want it but I mean you can get high off

1775
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:20,600
of breath you can get high off of breath

1776
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:20,599
work so I mean to say that

1777
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:32,000
only I I say that's fine but it's not

1778
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:32,000
what I I like smoking

1779
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:37,158
THC you've gotten high off breath work

1780
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,239
listen I want to make a comment about

1781
01:17:37,158 --> 01:17:41,799
the breath work one because it's funny

1782
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:44,158
Terrence McKenna had a hilarious quote

1783
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:45,239
on breath work because some because some

1784
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:47,000
you know he was talking about

1785
01:17:45,238 --> 01:17:48,559
psychedelics and someone was like well

1786
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
you don't need to take those drugs you

1787
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,080
can do that with your breath and Terren

1788
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,960
answered him well that's all good and

1789
01:17:53,079 --> 01:17:57,158
fine but when I take a psychedelic and

1790
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:59,560
I'm tripping balls I like to know I've

1791
01:17:57,158 --> 01:18:01,319
taken a

1792
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:06,120
psychedelic I thought that was pretty

1793
01:18:01,319 --> 01:18:09,039
funny it's a old esam Institute uh um

1794
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:12,960
also too I've never done breath work to

1795
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:14,439
the point where I did not exist there

1796
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:17,000
was no

1797
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:20,399
me I I've never been that high with

1798
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:23,560
breor never right but you did take like

1799
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:27,519
a hundred hits of acid so that's

1800
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:29,600
like that's also true but uh there was

1801
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:33,840
no I I guarantee

1802
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:37,039
it I guarantee

1803
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:39,319
it well really you have to understand

1804
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:40,920
with Sam like he may sound abrasive and

1805
01:18:39,319 --> 01:18:42,880
like he's coming off in a certain way

1806
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:46,480
but he really isn't he really just

1807
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:49,000
wanted to know what canabo Josh was

1808
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:51,718
looking for because for him it's if you

1809
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,880
know him well he's very big promoter of

1810
01:18:51,719 --> 01:18:57,000
THC he always promoted even when people

1811
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:59,119
were using medical as a shield when most

1812
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,840
of them weren't medical at all Sam was

1813
01:18:59,119 --> 01:19:03,880
like I like to get high I will fight for

1814
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,440
people who want to get high as hard as

1815
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:07,319
people are fighting for medical right

1816
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:08,559
now like why is either one less

1817
01:19:07,319 --> 01:19:11,439
important than the other they both

1818
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,719
should be allowed and it one reason why

1819
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:16,039
said one reason why it's important to

1820
01:19:13,719 --> 01:19:17,800
acknowledge the medical aspect of it is

1821
01:19:16,039 --> 01:19:20,238
because that's why we're having this

1822
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:22,119
conversation right now we didn't get

1823
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:24,799
into this conversation because everyone

1824
01:19:22,119 --> 01:19:26,840
wanted to get high we got into this

1825
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,840
conversation because it gave medical

1826
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:31,400
relief to people that were in chronic

1827
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:33,760
illness right but check this out how did

1828
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:36,119
we find that out how did we find that

1829
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:38,320
out we found that out by getting high

1830
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:40,599
that's how we found that out I'm I'm in

1831
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:44,198
I'm in acknowledgement of getting high I

1832
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:46,159
love get all day it led us to that the

1833
01:19:44,198 --> 01:19:47,879
medicine component of the plant so I'm

1834
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:49,599
not saying either one is more important

1835
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:51,880
than the other I'm just saying they

1836
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:55,039
should always both be respected and

1837
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:57,600
acknowledged oh I absolutely agree me

1838
01:19:55,039 --> 01:20:01,479
important for the people who need it I

1839
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,480
don't I get

1840
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:06,800
high question I still don't know the

1841
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,239
definition of high what's the definition

1842
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,760
of

1843
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:14,919
high I don't think there is one if if

1844
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:17,520
you need to ask then I'm not sure it

1845
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:19,960
could be explained to you I know when

1846
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,000
I'm high I will say this Logan I've

1847
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:23,359
smoked a lot of hash and a lot of

1848
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,238
cannabis in my

1849
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:31,119
lifetime and remember hearing our friend

1850
01:20:27,238 --> 01:20:32,919
Rob tell me about oh God I was so high

1851
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:34,479
the other day I just couldn't even and I

1852
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:36,079
was like that's like come on like I've

1853
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:38,479
never been that high like what's that

1854
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:40,198
what is that like I I would smoke as

1855
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:42,198
much as I could get to the brink and

1856
01:20:40,198 --> 01:20:45,158
still not be high enough that's just who

1857
01:20:42,198 --> 01:20:48,158
I am but when I went and visited Sam for

1858
01:20:45,158 --> 01:20:50,839
the first time I had a couple of pieces

1859
01:20:48,158 --> 01:20:52,879
of humble pie now he didn't completely

1860
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:54,440
destroy me I didn't pass out or [ __ ]

1861
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:57,279
myself like I thought for sure I was

1862
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:58,719
going going to because I was just so

1863
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:02,198
high and if you want to know what high

1864
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:05,520
is it's like lit

1865
01:21:02,198 --> 01:21:08,158
like like a rocket ship flying through

1866
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,600
space it was unbelievable this man put a

1867
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:11,839
little bit of hash in the bowl and I

1868
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,079
smoked it and it turned into water and

1869
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:17,239
glistened and bubbled and melted and

1870
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:20,719
before I had exhaled it I was so [ __ ]

1871
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:22,238
high I wanted to run out of my body I

1872
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:24,198
was and I'm sitting and I'm trying to

1873
01:21:22,238 --> 01:21:26,238
like not lose my [ __ ] this is like

1874
01:21:24,198 --> 01:21:30,359
someone I look up to I've been invited

1875
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:32,359
into his very very very tiny circle of

1876
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:35,279
people that he allows in and I'm not

1877
01:21:32,359 --> 01:21:37,439
trying to [ __ ] that up but man oh man

1878
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:40,039
and then we smoked I don't know 20 more

1879
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:43,759
of those he smoked for sure 60 more I

1880
01:21:40,039 --> 01:21:46,560
smoked probably 20 more and when I left

1881
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:51,400
like my two sides of my body were like

1882
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:56,239
unplugged I was walking like a weird

1883
01:21:51,399 --> 01:22:00,039
mon remember when we were at Legends

1884
01:21:56,238 --> 01:22:02,359
in Amsterdam here and Wally duck came

1885
01:22:00,039 --> 01:22:05,840
and tried our a really high quality

1886
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:09,759
drives it he passed out cold and fell

1887
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:12,000
backwards yeah oh yeah he then after we

1888
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:14,719
picked him up and brought him over the

1889
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:18,399
table passed out and set his hair on

1890
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:18,399
fire from a candle on the

1891
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:23,880
table that was no joke so those Legends

1892
01:22:22,039 --> 01:22:25,439
of hash parties you know that there's a

1893
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:28,119
perfect example ex Le what is getting

1894
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:30,919
high Legends of hash if you don't know

1895
01:22:28,119 --> 01:22:31,679
about it um it was a party that Sam and

1896
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:36,000
I

1897
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:38,679
started 15 16 17 years ago I don't even

1898
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,319
know and it was really it was during the

1899
01:22:38,679 --> 01:22:41,880
High Times cannabis cop and of course

1900
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:44,238
Sam had been there since the beginning

1901
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:46,719
and I showed up around 95 like six years

1902
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:48,479
later and I would go every year and we

1903
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:50,679
would kind of realize like oh this is

1904
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:52,158
kind of this commercial swaggy event but

1905
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:54,520
it's all we've got but there's these

1906
01:22:52,158 --> 01:22:56,479
amazing people here and everyone's just

1907
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:58,199
promoting themselves and flyers and this

1908
01:22:56,479 --> 01:23:01,238
[ __ ] and that [ __ ] and we were

1909
01:22:58,198 --> 01:23:03,359
all kind of sucked into it and so we

1910
01:23:01,238 --> 01:23:07,319
thought what if we started in a little

1911
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:09,599
party that we we hand chose 50 people

1912
01:23:07,319 --> 01:23:11,840
based on their hash not based on who

1913
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,159
they are based on their hash and that's

1914
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,639
what the party was about and you

1915
01:23:13,158 --> 01:23:17,638
couldn't bring cameras and you couldn't

1916
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:19,440
be on your phone you couldn't um promote

1917
01:23:17,639 --> 01:23:21,279
yourself in any way and give away

1918
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:24,079
business cards and talk business it was

1919
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:26,319
like let's just spend a night where we

1920
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:28,198
eat a beautiful meal we drink some

1921
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:30,960
amazing juices and eat some beautiful

1922
01:23:28,198 --> 01:23:34,519
fruit and we smoke an insane amount of

1923
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:37,480
hash and and uh Sid would bring his

1924
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:40,480
beautiful Afghan pipe some of which were

1925
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:43,638
a hundred plus years old and we would

1926
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:47,718
smoke these Hubbly bubblies with like

1927
01:23:43,639 --> 01:23:49,800
with Sam's insane like 60 to 70% pure

1928
01:23:47,719 --> 01:23:52,158
dry sift the [ __ ] that sent me off on a

1929
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:55,279
rocket ship he's pouring a gram in the

1930
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:56,679
in the no sometimes I put and grams in

1931
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:58,399
it that's what I'm saying it was

1932
01:23:56,679 --> 01:24:00,719
ridiculous like I've never seen anything

1933
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:02,920
like it and it was really truly a night

1934
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:04,359
for people I would tell people who would

1935
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:07,359
be like Oh I'm trying to get a ticket to

1936
01:24:04,359 --> 01:24:09,238
Legends I'd be like you know what like

1937
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:11,238
if you don't want to smoke until you're

1938
01:24:09,238 --> 01:24:13,319
uncomfortably high like you don't want

1939
01:24:11,238 --> 01:24:16,079
to come to Legends because that's really

1940
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:18,479
what that party was designed for and to

1941
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:20,238
do and that would be my explanation of

1942
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:22,718
what is getting high what is getting

1943
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:25,479
high getting high is going to a Legends

1944
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:27,639
of H hash dinner anyone that's ever been

1945
01:24:25,479 --> 01:24:30,799
can attest you will be high and you

1946
01:24:27,639 --> 01:24:33,279
won't have to question what it

1947
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:35,760
was I would say the dragonfly Earth

1948
01:24:33,279 --> 01:24:37,359
medicine parties are pretty good too I

1949
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,639
believe it we get

1950
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:45,880
together marus I remember I remember

1951
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:48,239
meeting you you in uh in in uh I guess

1952
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:51,039
what was 2010 at the High Times canons

1953
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:52,839
cup Marcus and I remember leaving one

1954
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:54,960
night like him hanging out with you and

1955
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:58,039
your your buds and and I walked around

1956
01:24:54,960 --> 01:25:00,600
the circle I think like Dam Square like

1957
01:24:58,039 --> 01:25:02,600
so many times that I ran back into your

1958
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:04,360
friends when they were leaving like

1959
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:07,520
three hours later they're like what are

1960
01:25:04,359 --> 01:25:07,519
you doing I'm like I don't

1961
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:14,319
know I don't know I'm walking

1962
01:25:11,079 --> 01:25:17,719
man yeah I definitely am a big proponent

1963
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:20,000
of medical it was it is what finally

1964
01:25:17,719 --> 01:25:22,719
took away prohibition getting high was

1965
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:25,600
never going to take away prohibition um

1966
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:26,719
but medical definitely was the you know

1967
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,840
and

1968
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:32,000
particularly you know sick children that

1969
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,440
was like the last leg of prohibition

1970
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,560
even the biggest douchebag

1971
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:37,960
prohibitionists couldn't really stand

1972
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:40,480
behind like taking medication away from

1973
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,239
like little Charlotte Fiji or whatever

1974
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:44,118
you know like how how you gonna how you

1975
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:49,079
g to do that and that really that

1976
01:25:44,118 --> 01:25:51,399
cracked the door um that was never to be

1977
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:54,319
closed I mean that was that was the

1978
01:25:51,399 --> 01:25:57,118
impossible happening and and here we are

1979
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:59,198
today still not where we want to be but

1980
01:25:57,118 --> 01:26:00,920
but getting closer and closer oh yeah

1981
01:25:59,198 --> 01:26:04,279
look at that that's an Afghan Hubbly

1982
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:07,199
Bubbly right there he's puffing tough

1983
01:26:04,279 --> 01:26:10,000
let me tell you those Afghani dudes puff

1984
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:13,839
tough that is not uh if you think

1985
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,960
smoking chillums in India or Nepal is

1986
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:19,520
like heavy duty smoking and don't get me

1987
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:21,198
wrong it is these are are more intense

1988
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:24,000
than that it's like putting the Chillum

1989
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:26,519
into a into a water pipe that has you

1990
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,479
know gallon of water in it so it it

1991
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:33,400
pulls quite a chub

1992
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:35,399
chubble anyway so on uh speaking of

1993
01:26:33,399 --> 01:26:38,960
Afghani it made me think of something

1994
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:41,519
Marcus um do you guys is that a texed

1995
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,239
Time Warp gone for yester year up there

1996
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:45,560
is is the time warp still around oh no

1997
01:26:43,238 --> 01:26:47,599
it's still around man it's still on Tex

1998
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:50,119
island with some of the more old

1999
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:53,280
schooler dudes there's all sorts of

2000
01:26:50,118 --> 01:26:56,279
crosses of it out there but the original

2001
01:26:53,279 --> 01:27:00,118
Tech of time War which is just a super

2002
01:26:56,279 --> 01:27:01,719
stretchy crazy you know tie cross um

2003
01:27:00,118 --> 01:27:04,639
that thing is that thing definitely

2004
01:27:01,719 --> 01:27:07,158
exists it's uh it's around and and and

2005
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:09,719
it's not as hard to find as you'd think

2006
01:27:07,158 --> 01:27:12,039
uh if you've got knowledge you go to you

2007
01:27:09,719 --> 01:27:13,600
just go to Tex Island it won't be long

2008
01:27:12,039 --> 01:27:15,359
before you meet someone and you say

2009
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:17,320
words and they hear those words and then

2010
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:19,679
you'll be at like some old school dude

2011
01:27:17,319 --> 01:27:21,198
we can help you yeah exactly just be

2012
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:23,199
like at Rainbow's house or whatever and

2013
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:25,479
be like dude I met rainbow like I was in

2014
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:27,479
his Greenhouse where he gave me a cut he

2015
01:27:25,479 --> 01:27:29,638
gave me a cut in a golden pot like look

2016
01:27:27,479 --> 01:27:29,638
at

2017
01:27:30,039 --> 01:27:33,359
this that's that's good to know that was

2018
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,679
one of my favorite strains back in the

2019
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:37,559
day I thought it was an Afghani because

2020
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:40,039
I got I had a friend from Southern

2021
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:45,600
humble and she had a pile of old Afghani

2022
01:27:40,039 --> 01:27:47,840
seeds and um and and um once in a while

2023
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,480
you get you get some some of the plants

2024
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,760
were really similar to what I remember

2025
01:27:49,479 --> 01:27:55,959
time where being

2026
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:58,920
like but what what year did you smoke it

2027
01:27:55,960 --> 01:28:02,480
um I'd say all through the 90s like

2028
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:06,000
maybe 90 mid 90s to around 2000 and then

2029
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:07,638
uh then I just it it just seemed like it

2030
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:12,039
um

2031
01:28:07,639 --> 01:28:14,079
obviously well early 90s I think uh I

2032
01:28:12,039 --> 01:28:16,319
grew I was growing up on Vancouver

2033
01:28:14,079 --> 01:28:19,359
Island and we were growing T mostly Time

2034
01:28:16,319 --> 01:28:22,158
Warp and uh and that was just a rocking

2035
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:25,359
strain I mean where on Vancouver Island

2036
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:28,839
were you I was in in

2037
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:30,599
Suk yeah it was like probably the worst

2038
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,840
place in North America to learn how to

2039
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:34,600
grow outdoor

2040
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:37,360
weed it's like right off the off the

2041
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:39,400
muck coming off the ocean oh yeah in the

2042
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:41,719
first year we had really in summer

2043
01:28:39,399 --> 01:28:44,719
beginners luck and then I think the

2044
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:48,359
second year

2045
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:50,600
um uh I remember I didn't from October 1

2046
01:28:48,359 --> 01:28:52,639
and until on I don't think I saw the

2047
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:54,360
color blue in the sky till the following

2048
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:56,199
spring

2049
01:28:54,359 --> 01:28:57,880
yeah it was it was rough but that that

2050
01:28:56,198 --> 01:28:59,359
was a pretty resistant strain I'd love

2051
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:00,960
to grow it down here because I know

2052
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:04,359
would do well here in

2053
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:07,600
Oregon well you got Josh offering right

2054
01:29:04,359 --> 01:29:10,920
there nice that's good to know he can

2055
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:13,280
hook you up we'll see if we can get back

2056
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,039
into the US and back into Canada again

2057
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:17,118
because that's the current issue at the

2058
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:18,158
moment yeah I guess the Border still

2059
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:21,679
closed

2060
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:24,759
huh yeah I mean we could go to the US no

2061
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:28,118
problem but we can't can't come back

2062
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:30,320
into Canada without contact tracing and

2063
01:29:28,118 --> 01:29:31,399
a two week quarantine and I just don't

2064
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:34,639
want to you know I don't want to do any

2065
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:36,000
of that it just doesn't doesn't sound

2066
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:37,760
right and I don't need that kind of

2067
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,198
scrutiny and all that I just stay out in

2068
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:43,440
the woods out here far away growing all

2069
01:29:41,198 --> 01:29:46,879
these insane varietals and everything I

2070
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:49,719
mean our Greenhouse the plants are about

2071
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:53,319
six or seven nodes high right now I

2072
01:29:49,719 --> 01:29:56,560
don't know about three two to three feet

2073
01:29:53,319 --> 01:29:59,559
all from seed and we have the

2074
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:02,440
fattest stocks on all the plants right

2075
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:04,560
now and some of the most like crazy

2076
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:07,279
leaves we're not haven't used any te's

2077
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:09,320
yet this year and uh it's just we're

2078
01:30:07,279 --> 01:30:10,920
just going on the incredible soil

2079
01:30:09,319 --> 01:30:14,000
building we've been doing over the last

2080
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:15,920
few years and uh the health is just

2081
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,960
amazing right now and it's just we're

2082
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,239
we're starting to get some incredible

2083
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:23,198
branching coming off the plants right

2084
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:24,718
now so I'd say in a couple weeks we're

2085
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:26,439
probably going to start our first light

2086
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:28,158
dep but it's cold here right now it's

2087
01:30:26,439 --> 01:30:31,319
still in the SI Mid

2088
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:33,198
60s um you know or 70s like we're in

2089
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:37,479
this like super cold front right now we

2090
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:39,599
had an early hail um yesterday and cold

2091
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:43,319
here too and rainy I feel like it's my

2092
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:45,880
fault I went and got my boat out of

2093
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:47,759
storage that's how you make it rain in

2094
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,760
uh in your neighborhood for those of you

2095
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,199
that don't

2096
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:54,440
know right get the boat out yeah go put

2097
01:30:52,198 --> 01:30:56,399
that [ __ ] back away

2098
01:30:54,439 --> 01:30:58,799
hey Colin you know on another show I

2099
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:02,238
remember you talking about growing

2100
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:05,639
clones in an indoor setting and then

2101
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:07,279
seeing by the nutrient um inputs or by

2102
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:11,600
the soil that you were getting more

2103
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:13,800
waxes on your hash or less waxes and and

2104
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:15,600
and you were noticing that the you know

2105
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:17,760
the tricomes were different and I was

2106
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:20,239
wondering what were some of the things

2107
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:22,119
maybe that you that you that you found

2108
01:31:20,238 --> 01:31:24,919
that that changed that and what were

2109
01:31:22,118 --> 01:31:28,519
your what were your goals in the end

2110
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:30,480
yeah yeah so that's great question um

2111
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:36,119
it's like three we'll we'll unpack that

2112
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:38,519
one um so it's uh so yeah so basically

2113
01:31:36,118 --> 01:31:41,319
what I went through was trying to better

2114
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:43,760
understand the resin and how it was

2115
01:31:41,319 --> 01:31:47,279
growing in environmental changes that

2116
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:50,119
affected it um

2117
01:31:47,279 --> 01:31:51,519
so essentially I started looking at

2118
01:31:50,118 --> 01:31:53,960
basically

2119
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:59,440
your you know the vapor density and the

2120
01:31:53,960 --> 01:32:01,399
room the you know the avd so um so that

2121
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:03,000
informed a lot of my decisions on like

2122
01:32:01,399 --> 01:32:06,079
keeping the the humidity a little bit

2123
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,800
higher during veg and then understanding

2124
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:09,840
that if you dried things out the wax

2125
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:11,760
membranes on the on the leaves would dry

2126
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:14,119
out and that would leave the plant

2127
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:16,840
vulnerable to disease and to fungi and

2128
01:32:14,118 --> 01:32:19,039
to all these different uh topical things

2129
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:21,199
that could happen betus that forms in

2130
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:23,198
the flower itself which then can can

2131
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:25,118
actually now we know it can actually

2132
01:32:23,198 --> 01:32:27,759
become sustain

2133
01:32:25,118 --> 01:32:31,039
um so and that's actually been confirmed

2134
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:32,800
which is interesting um for all you home

2135
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:35,198
Growers out there if you do get Petri

2136
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,920
test on your beloved plant just be

2137
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:40,000
careful and know that that is going to

2138
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,600
most likely be with it there's qpcr

2139
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,359
tests that you can get out there that

2140
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:46,600
are fairly cheap you can test all your

2141
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:48,359
plants and get U really accurate results

2142
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:51,440
very quickly for all of you guys out

2143
01:32:48,359 --> 01:32:53,158
there that are um trying to do trying to

2144
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:55,238
better understand your environment and

2145
01:32:53,158 --> 01:32:56,839
the Clones that you might might have so

2146
01:32:55,238 --> 01:32:58,319
that's the other thing is is

2147
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:00,079
understanding how healthy your plants

2148
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:03,079
are actually you know that was another

2149
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:04,960
thing that I started to get into so it's

2150
01:33:03,079 --> 01:33:08,920
really about understanding the

2151
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:11,800
environment so I went from uh very humid

2152
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:13,359
70s 8s and then dropping that humidity

2153
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,760
and understanding where to drop the

2154
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:19,158
humidity for certain varietal or certain

2155
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:22,760
cultivars if you will um and what I saw

2156
01:33:19,158 --> 01:33:24,920
is that during the more humid

2157
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:27,239
environments all the way through flour I

2158
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:30,319
had much better resin that was more

2159
01:33:27,238 --> 01:33:33,399
tacky and a lot stronger and under the

2160
01:33:30,319 --> 01:33:35,238
loop the it was a lot more uniform and

2161
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:37,359
under drier conditions I had more a lot

2162
01:33:35,238 --> 01:33:39,000
more stacked Trion you could see it was

2163
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:41,319
all kind of like jumbling up and when

2164
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:45,359
you touched it they' all kind of hit hit

2165
01:33:41,319 --> 01:33:47,158
each other um so that was the biggest

2166
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:49,920
thing that I learned through doing those

2167
01:33:47,158 --> 01:33:52,519
those those trials um and then medium

2168
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:55,319
itself affected all of that as well

2169
01:33:52,520 --> 01:34:00,320
where I felt like soil

2170
01:33:55,319 --> 01:34:03,479
honestly um was a lot more uh conducive

2171
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:05,920
to a higher res count itself it it felt

2172
01:34:03,479 --> 01:34:07,879
and this is you know all based off of

2173
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,840
Photography and anecdotal for all of you

2174
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:12,039
people out there I don't want to sound

2175
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:13,880
you know pretend like there's there's

2176
01:34:12,039 --> 01:34:18,399
there's a University study behind this

2177
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:21,000
but um what I found was um you know

2178
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:23,879
growing in Coco produced a lot larger

2179
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:27,880
biomass but it didn't follow suit with

2180
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:31,000
my resin and where soil produced a lot

2181
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:34,039
of biomass not as much maybe as the as

2182
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,760
my uh you know my cocoa medium did but

2183
01:34:34,039 --> 01:34:39,118
it still It produced a lot more

2184
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:41,320
desirable um resin on the actual flour

2185
01:34:39,118 --> 01:34:44,479
itself that I could then actually

2186
01:34:41,319 --> 01:34:46,279
Harvest so you know that was really what

2187
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:49,158
you know I learned from doing that and

2188
01:34:46,279 --> 01:34:50,759
um I I personally think that it depends

2189
01:34:49,158 --> 01:34:52,719
on your application in which you're

2190
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:54,639
growing in and I understand the hurdles

2191
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:58,079
in which you're growing

2192
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:59,679
50,000 square feet versus 400 square

2193
01:34:58,079 --> 01:35:03,600
feet and everything in between that and

2194
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:05,520
then also um are you is your environment

2195
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:07,600
you are you are you having to create an

2196
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:10,760
artificial environment and then how does

2197
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:12,560
that refect your medium choice so I'm a

2198
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:14,079
big fan of going directly in the ground

2199
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,320
I think there's a lot of value to that

2200
01:35:14,079 --> 01:35:18,319
the connection to the to the soil is a

2201
01:35:16,319 --> 01:35:20,719
big deal and amendments and

2202
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:22,759
understanding how to play Within the

2203
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:24,600
natural ecosystem is a as you know

2204
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:27,520
you're an expert in that

2205
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:29,960
um you know something that is really

2206
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:32,639
what the plant desires I think at the

2207
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:37,118
end of the day um and it's a lot easier

2208
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:38,679
to uh grow at scale in my opinion when

2209
01:35:37,118 --> 01:35:40,039
uh those environmental factors are

2210
01:35:38,679 --> 01:35:43,279
working in your favor and you're not

2211
01:35:40,039 --> 01:35:45,880
having to tune them uh and then an HVAC

2212
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:47,920
system may break but it all depends on

2213
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:50,920
what your application is you know so

2214
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:53,079
indoor can be great outdoor can be great

2215
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:55,600
um but it you know you've got to have

2216
01:35:53,079 --> 01:35:58,439
the the understanding of your of your

2217
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:59,760
environment um your cultivars that

2218
01:35:58,439 --> 01:36:01,439
you're putting in that set environment

2219
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:03,880
are also very important and then your

2220
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:07,678
inputs for that set environment and the

2221
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:13,079
turine levels so turpine levels

2222
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:16,079
um you know they honestly I think for me

2223
01:36:13,079 --> 01:36:17,439
tpping levels are higher on in a in a

2224
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:20,960
greenhouse setting than they are in

2225
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:23,839
indoor setting for me um however but

2226
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:26,679
medium to medium I see very little

2227
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:29,760
difference unless like from Coco to from

2228
01:36:26,679 --> 01:36:33,760
soil to Coco but if I go to rock wool

2229
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:36,960
for some reason it's it feels a bit left

2230
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:38,360
Less in terms of the the lab results

2231
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,679
basically the lab results tell that

2232
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:43,319
story so and I really let that stuff

2233
01:36:40,679 --> 01:36:46,118
Drive I don't try to have too much of an

2234
01:36:43,319 --> 01:36:47,840
opinion other than um trying to search

2235
01:36:46,118 --> 01:36:49,079
for the answer if that if you if that

2236
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:51,520
makes

2237
01:36:49,079 --> 01:36:54,719
sense yeah that's super that's super

2238
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:57,560
awesome good thanks for that

2239
01:36:54,719 --> 01:37:00,359
yeah what do you think about shade grown

2240
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:03,800
anyone considering shade grown cannabis

2241
01:37:00,359 --> 01:37:07,719
even um for the aspect of hash even or

2242
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:09,719
tpine influence on the hash where I mean

2243
01:37:07,719 --> 01:37:12,118
seemingly like the worms are more alive

2244
01:37:09,719 --> 01:37:15,198
the compost Deadfall from the trees and

2245
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:17,679
stack up for humus is more active

2246
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:20,118
underneath uh shade line tree layer

2247
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:23,279
especially exposing itself to the right

2248
01:37:20,118 --> 01:37:25,399
exposure from east to west facing south

2249
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:29,719
and bleed in of sunlight perhaps like

2250
01:37:25,399 --> 01:37:31,960
very location based shade grown for

2251
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:34,600
production I think you can grow really

2252
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:37,079
high quality in shade but your yields

2253
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:41,159
will be significantly

2254
01:37:37,079 --> 01:37:43,920
less yeah I agree with that yeah we side

2255
01:37:41,158 --> 01:37:45,198
by side depos last year and shade tarp

2256
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:47,480
one and we didn't shade tarp the one

2257
01:37:45,198 --> 01:37:50,678
right next to it and both of them had

2258
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:53,839
tropical Truffle in it and the yield was

2259
01:37:50,679 --> 01:37:55,840
less not significant though um it was

2260
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:58,880
within a couple pounds in the big

2261
01:37:55,840 --> 01:38:01,840
picture but the tpine was far better in

2262
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:03,679
the shade tarp far better it it was it

2263
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:05,279
was notably different you could

2264
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:07,239
literally put two buds from each on a

2265
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:12,039
table and see the difference too in the

2266
01:38:07,238 --> 01:38:14,359
color um it was a little bit less speed

2267
01:38:12,039 --> 01:38:17,158
up went you know and the way that they

2268
01:38:14,359 --> 01:38:20,238
hashed out they they both they both bled

2269
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:22,319
about the same um for yield as far as

2270
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:25,439
that went but the uh the turpine was

2271
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:25,439
higher in the shade tart

2272
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:30,359
yeah that's been our experience too

2273
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:33,399
going to uh Farms you know at different

2274
01:38:30,359 --> 01:38:35,319
places is that if you have like Paul in

2275
01:38:33,399 --> 01:38:38,000
your area you know where it gets

2276
01:38:35,319 --> 01:38:41,198
scorching hot southern Oregon you know

2277
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:43,760
110 all summer long it feels like

2278
01:38:41,198 --> 01:38:46,519
there's a lot of um automatic green

2279
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:48,239
houses that have shade cloths that come

2280
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:50,239
for even two to three hours in the

2281
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:52,919
middle of the afternoon you know that's

2282
01:38:50,238 --> 01:38:54,879
in an automatic setting and stuff so you

2283
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:57,000
know I I personally I would never use

2284
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,719
any shade cloth up here because I barely

2285
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,118
have any sun it feels like you know so

2286
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:02,679
I'm going to take all the sun I can get

2287
01:39:01,118 --> 01:39:04,920
but I think it really matters on your

2288
01:39:02,679 --> 01:39:07,118
environment I wonder in Maine you know

2289
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:09,920
how exposed you are to where you would

2290
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:11,598
necessarily really need that but if what

2291
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:13,880
Paul's saying you know I mean I would go

2292
01:39:11,599 --> 01:39:15,719
for the shade cloth in an exposed area

2293
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:17,760
if it gave me better tping because

2294
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:20,439
ultimately we do it for the

2295
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:22,119
turps as well as the medicinal qualities

2296
01:39:20,439 --> 01:39:23,919
it' be nice to see that experiment that

2297
01:39:22,118 --> 01:39:25,079
Paul did in some different regions

2298
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:29,679
that's for

2299
01:39:25,079 --> 01:39:32,198
sure yeah Central America even hot dry

2300
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:35,399
where we're you know6

2301
01:39:32,198 --> 01:39:37,198
107 for multiple weeks so you know I I

2302
01:39:35,399 --> 01:39:40,559
know cooling it down they definitely

2303
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:40,559
looked happier in that

2304
01:39:41,158 --> 01:39:45,799
environment definitely preserved tpin it

2305
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:47,039
sounds like so that's that's great so

2306
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:50,480
many I

2307
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:52,880
think go ahead I think it probably helps

2308
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:54,238
blocks the soil too you know keeps the

2309
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,639
soil

2310
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:59,839
more moist and more active I would

2311
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:01,760
imagine the roots are a lot happier too

2312
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:05,599
and hey Paul you you've been doing a lot

2313
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:08,360
of more natural farming um practices on

2314
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:10,960
the farm and really adding even more

2315
01:40:08,359 --> 01:40:12,319
attention to your to your beds and and

2316
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,920
doing a lot of that work and I was

2317
01:40:12,319 --> 01:40:16,719
wondering are you noticing a difference

2318
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:21,560
in in your vegetative growth this year

2319
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:23,960
and um yeah just go ahead no I'm sorry

2320
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:25,800
absolutely it's it's exciting um not

2321
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:28,399
only the stocks thicker and everything

2322
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:31,000
that we've got but the uh the smell of

2323
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:32,519
the dirt has really changed and uh you

2324
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:35,599
know Everywhere You Dig in we've got

2325
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:38,040
earthworms we've life we got activity uh

2326
01:40:35,599 --> 01:40:40,360
you know really doing a lot with playing

2327
01:40:38,039 --> 01:40:42,760
with the imos uh you know this beginning

2328
01:40:40,359 --> 01:40:44,519
of the season end last season and I

2329
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:46,560
can't believe how quickly things have

2330
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:49,520
been making making a difference it's

2331
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,520
exciting it's fun to

2332
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:56,360
watch um hey I have a question um

2333
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:58,599
so what is anyone you is there any

2334
01:40:56,359 --> 01:41:01,399
inputs that that anyone's been using in

2335
01:40:58,599 --> 01:41:03,199
terms of uh cover crop that um that

2336
01:41:01,399 --> 01:41:04,960
they're finding that are uh they're

2337
01:41:03,198 --> 01:41:07,039
exciting that they haven't used before

2338
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:08,920
this year is there anyone that's uh is

2339
01:41:07,039 --> 01:41:12,800
you know maybe Josh you can speak on

2340
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:14,719
some of this but uh you know I I'm I use

2341
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:16,639
the same things over and over is there

2342
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:19,000
is there anything new that that anyone's

2343
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:20,679
been been explain you know exploring or

2344
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:24,118
kind of playing around with in terms of

2345
01:41:20,679 --> 01:41:25,639
uh cover crop and uh

2346
01:41:24,118 --> 01:41:28,679
you know I think it really depends I

2347
01:41:25,639 --> 01:41:31,039
could let you know Logan and Dave answer

2348
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:33,599
as well you know my our two senses is up

2349
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:36,800
in this Northern Area the winter Ry has

2350
01:41:33,599 --> 01:41:39,360
been an amazing friend to us this year

2351
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:43,480
and I know the Sudanese sorghum grass is

2352
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:44,960
an incredible um biomass and and it also

2353
01:41:43,479 --> 01:41:46,959
you know in an indoor setting you know

2354
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:49,319
the cover crop does a little different

2355
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:51,118
things but on in a in a greenhouse or an

2356
01:41:49,319 --> 01:41:53,960
environment Outdoors where you don't

2357
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:56,559
have ganja growing the cover crop can

2358
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:59,800
keep micro risal fungi growing and Sudan

2359
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:03,039
sorghum grass is one of the best you

2360
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:05,480
know hosts for micro risal fungi so part

2361
01:42:03,039 --> 01:42:08,439
of the cover crops you know thing is the

2362
01:42:05,479 --> 01:42:10,279
stomata eats the air and Farms the air

2363
01:42:08,439 --> 01:42:13,839
you know puts it putting it into the

2364
01:42:10,279 --> 01:42:16,000
roots and then the other thing is uh the

2365
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:19,440
fact that it's you know the green manure

2366
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:21,840
so I I feel like having Clover it can be

2367
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:25,039
really good but it at times it can also

2368
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:28,840
get the the powdery m can come in on it

2369
01:42:25,039 --> 01:42:32,920
so I think it it matters so I I we mulch

2370
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:35,840
is life for us so right now we just got

2371
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:38,480
done putting all of our winter ride down

2372
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:41,440
and it's incredible how much it's in our

2373
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:43,479
case this winter Ry grows up to be

2374
01:42:41,439 --> 01:42:45,279
incredible grass and it's just so easy

2375
01:42:43,479 --> 01:42:47,039
to pull up and when you see the roots on

2376
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:49,559
it they're just white and supple they

2377
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:51,079
just looks so incredible and you just

2378
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:53,480
realize oh W you don't really need to

2379
01:42:51,079 --> 01:42:55,079
bring anything in when you have a really

2380
01:42:53,479 --> 01:42:59,279
healthy cover crop but you can't really

2381
01:42:55,079 --> 01:43:01,559
do heavy Mulch and cover crop so well

2382
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:04,639
sometimes you just fold the the the

2383
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:07,159
cover crop over and it Reves so right

2384
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:10,159
now I I just feel like more than

2385
01:43:07,158 --> 01:43:12,719
anything it's it's covered the dirt and

2386
01:43:10,158 --> 01:43:15,158
the mulch is is the magic it's the mulch

2387
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:19,158
love and really diversity you know

2388
01:43:15,158 --> 01:43:22,519
buckwheat is is an amazing thing um it's

2389
01:43:19,158 --> 01:43:24,118
very Supple and really nice um to to

2390
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:26,480
roll over

2391
01:43:24,118 --> 01:43:28,839
um those are those are some that that

2392
01:43:26,479 --> 01:43:30,678
come to mind Dave Oran anyone else have

2393
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:34,480
any thoughts on

2394
01:43:30,679 --> 01:43:41,679
that straw local Straw from

2395
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:41,678
the we we I'm sorry you go on wait to

2396
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:48,079
done hello can you guys hear me I can

2397
01:43:45,599 --> 01:43:51,079
hear you I oh you man okay cool yeah go

2398
01:43:48,079 --> 01:43:53,719
for we've been um you know for our field

2399
01:43:51,079 --> 01:43:57,039
crops like for vegetables um

2400
01:43:53,719 --> 01:43:59,198
we're a big fan of like aye and a few

2401
01:43:57,039 --> 01:44:02,960
legumes we usually do like a field pee

2402
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:05,439
and a vetch and fava and like Josh was

2403
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:07,599
saying the the grasses you know kind of

2404
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:10,238
help build up the organic matter and the

2405
01:44:07,599 --> 01:44:12,159
but they they really work well together

2406
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:14,198
and then you know we kind of try to

2407
01:44:12,158 --> 01:44:16,559
knock them in the ground about you know

2408
01:44:14,198 --> 01:44:18,319
a good five weeks before we want to uh

2409
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:19,360
plant so they have plenty time to break

2410
01:44:18,319 --> 01:44:22,158
down and

2411
01:44:19,359 --> 01:44:24,319
decompose um or you know anything that

2412
01:44:22,158 --> 01:44:25,799
we're going to plant later season we

2413
01:44:24,319 --> 01:44:27,920
like them to go the distance and we just

2414
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:29,840
try to knock them down before the uh the

2415
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:33,079
seed becomes viable so you're not

2416
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:34,480
creating more weed problems but in ganja

2417
01:44:33,079 --> 01:44:39,238
in particular we've been a really big

2418
01:44:34,479 --> 01:44:42,000
fan of um of a New Zealand Clover it's a

2419
01:44:39,238 --> 01:44:44,519
white clover and uh really similar to

2420
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:48,039
Dutch clover but the reason we like it

2421
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:50,159
that Variety in particular is it

2422
01:44:48,039 --> 01:44:52,519
generally only grows to be about a foot

2423
01:44:50,158 --> 01:44:54,879
tall you know and it and it can handle

2424
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:58,520
foot traffic traffic and it's drought

2425
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:59,480
tolerant so to get it into your aisles

2426
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:01,840
like because you know we're just growing

2427
01:44:59,479 --> 01:45:03,279
in hoop houses in native soil but the

2428
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:05,199
plantet into your aisles after your

2429
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:07,559
plants are established it kind of

2430
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:09,919
creates a natural mat so you know your

2431
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:11,880
but your buds don't get all dusty and

2432
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:13,880
and uh and dirt on them but then it also

2433
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:17,599
creates a lot of habitat for beneficials

2434
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:18,920
and stuff and we find that if you let it

2435
01:45:17,599 --> 01:45:21,400
you know we usually plan it on our

2436
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:23,560
second round like our July rounds um

2437
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:27,039
after the plants are bigger big enough

2438
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:29,960
to uh not get choked out but if you let

2439
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:32,960
the white clover in particular go to

2440
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:36,639
flowers before you before you uh turn in

2441
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:39,239
The Following season um the the the

2442
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:41,359
spike in nitrogen is is RoR it's like

2443
01:45:39,238 --> 01:45:43,039
it's really impressive how much how much

2444
01:45:41,359 --> 01:45:46,960
nitrogen you get off of that just a

2445
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:49,238
little low line of of the white clover

2446
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:53,239
so that that's been you let it go to

2447
01:45:49,238 --> 01:45:55,359
flour we well we let it go to FL yeah it

2448
01:45:53,238 --> 01:45:57,598
as as as as much as we can we let it go

2449
01:45:55,359 --> 01:45:59,519
to flower you know but some sometimes if

2450
01:45:57,599 --> 01:46:02,199
if we have to get into a hoop house and

2451
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:04,560
plant before it flowers so be it but

2452
01:46:02,198 --> 01:46:07,198
generally that's that's the goal so you

2453
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:10,000
know it'll it'll okay you know we'll

2454
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:13,279
Harvest late October and then uh the

2455
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:17,198
following April May is when it starts to

2456
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:19,639
flower okay cool thank you it's a good

2457
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:22,000
tip right there I would say that it's

2458
01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:25,199
really good to have growing cover crop

2459
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:27,198
during the veget cycle and into the

2460
01:46:25,198 --> 01:46:29,519
beginning part of the flower cycle and

2461
01:46:27,198 --> 01:46:31,359
then it's really good to

2462
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:34,119
drop that

2463
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:37,039
vegetation into a mulch towards the end

2464
01:46:34,118 --> 01:46:39,079
of the flower cycle so that it's really

2465
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:40,920
kind of capping off the top of the soil

2466
01:46:39,079 --> 01:46:44,079
and keeping the moisture in and it's not

2467
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:45,920
creating any stagnant air and then right

2468
01:46:44,079 --> 01:46:48,639
be right as you're harvesting maybe a

2469
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:51,639
week or a few days before you harvest

2470
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:54,199
you could reapply more cover crop seed

2471
01:46:51,639 --> 01:46:57,359
to where it's growing just starting to

2472
01:46:54,198 --> 01:46:59,079
grow as you're harvesting and then that

2473
01:46:57,359 --> 01:47:00,920
would kind of get you right back into

2474
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:03,279
your vegetative cycle so if you're

2475
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:04,679
indoors or if you're in a FL dep or

2476
01:47:03,279 --> 01:47:06,279
you're in a place where you could like

2477
01:47:04,679 --> 01:47:09,279
kind of put another thing in there then

2478
01:47:06,279 --> 01:47:11,559
you'd have the the cover crop growing uh

2479
01:47:09,279 --> 01:47:13,880
which would keep the micro isal fungi

2480
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:15,320
and everything in there the risos spere

2481
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:18,079
happening and then the new plants would

2482
01:47:15,319 --> 01:47:23,118
go in and eat the old

2483
01:47:18,079 --> 01:47:26,000
roots are are you using beans to fix

2484
01:47:23,118 --> 01:47:29,920
nitrogen in your cover

2485
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:32,158
crops uh we we use fava beans is one of

2486
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:34,239
the as one of the beans we grow for for

2487
01:47:32,158 --> 01:47:38,000
for nitrogen

2488
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:42,559
yep yeah yeah it just cuts down your

2489
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:45,679
fertilizer cost yeah I mean we we we um

2490
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:49,520
we definitely see our our organic matter

2491
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:52,279
levels rise from year to year and where

2492
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:54,599
we um are on top of our game with cover

2493
01:47:52,279 --> 01:47:57,479
cropping the the nitrogen levels will

2494
01:47:54,599 --> 01:48:01,199
will increase from from year to year we

2495
01:47:57,479 --> 01:48:03,638
are in uh in um you know we're in we got

2496
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:06,559
a ton of rain here in Oregon so a lot of

2497
01:48:03,639 --> 01:48:09,039
that washes out but in in the hoop

2498
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:11,719
houses in particular we really the the

2499
01:48:09,039 --> 01:48:14,599
nitrogen levels get they build every

2500
01:48:11,719 --> 01:48:17,920
year because you don't get that can

2501
01:48:14,599 --> 01:48:20,520
takes a huge amount of canabus cannabis

2502
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:24,440
will absolutely deplete nitrogen from

2503
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:26,440
soil if you gr enough in the

2504
01:48:24,439 --> 01:48:28,598
I mean nitrogen is the easiest thing in

2505
01:48:26,439 --> 01:48:30,759
the world to create I mean anything

2506
01:48:28,599 --> 01:48:32,960
that's green just melt it in water and

2507
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:36,560
throw it over your I mean it's just same

2508
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:39,399
how much so I for me nitrogen is like

2509
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:41,639
simple you know it's it's to create the

2510
01:48:39,399 --> 01:48:43,799
carbon and to create the organic matter

2511
01:48:41,639 --> 01:48:46,118
which holds the fungi which holds all

2512
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:48,159
the nutrients that's where the work is

2513
01:48:46,118 --> 01:48:50,719
like that's where the attention for me

2514
01:48:48,158 --> 01:48:54,238
that's where the attention goes too and

2515
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:57,319
then um using the aisles for us is like

2516
01:48:54,238 --> 01:49:02,000
the frontier like everything that we

2517
01:48:57,319 --> 01:49:04,960
walk on is just fat organic matter and

2518
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:07,238
over mulch the system you know and and

2519
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:09,279
and if you have big beds on the edge of

2520
01:49:07,238 --> 01:49:13,399
the beds and on the sides of the bed

2521
01:49:09,279 --> 01:49:16,000
just a a large amount of of mulch for

2522
01:49:13,399 --> 01:49:20,638
decom decomposing and we're seeing a

2523
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:23,198
good 8 to 12 inches of of of new soil

2524
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:26,800
that we're folding onto our beds each

2525
01:49:23,198 --> 01:49:29,638
year right now and those aisles are just

2526
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:32,079
all of our our new soil for our beds

2527
01:49:29,639 --> 01:49:34,880
each year and I recognize indoors that's

2528
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:37,198
different and everything however if you

2529
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:39,359
make your beds right um on the edge of

2530
01:49:37,198 --> 01:49:41,879
the beds where it comes up you can get a

2531
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:44,279
lot of mulch in there or or even you

2532
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:48,480
could dig out holes in your indoor beds

2533
01:49:44,279 --> 01:49:51,840
and pack those holes with food

2534
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:54,399
scraps and and different kinds of straw

2535
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:55,400
for for m isn't necessarily the best

2536
01:49:54,399 --> 01:49:58,719
because it doesn't have a lot of

2537
01:49:55,399 --> 01:50:01,479
nutrients in it so stra straws is fine

2538
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:03,399
you know because it's carbon but you

2539
01:50:01,479 --> 01:50:05,079
know with with mulch you're really kind

2540
01:50:03,399 --> 01:50:07,279
of looking for nutrients that's where

2541
01:50:05,079 --> 01:50:12,559
like if if you're mulching with

2542
01:50:07,279 --> 01:50:14,800
comfrey and nettles and grasses and tree

2543
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:16,520
leaves and all that then you have this

2544
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:17,960
crazy diversity with all the trace

2545
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:21,639
minerals in it and that's where the the

2546
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:23,760
real magic comes from Logan I'll jump in

2547
01:50:21,639 --> 01:50:25,560
and share something about Hawaii real

2548
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:28,280
quick cuz we're in a in like a

2549
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:30,920
continuous Farm loop with the Cannabis

2550
01:50:28,279 --> 01:50:32,679
in particular where it's it's a year

2551
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:34,719
round farming so we don't really get a

2552
01:50:32,679 --> 01:50:37,118
season off or anything like that so your

2553
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:39,760
soil's always eating and always

2554
01:50:37,118 --> 01:50:41,960
decomposing and um like what Offa Josh

2555
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:44,119
was just saying a lot of you know more

2556
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:46,078
green material is what I've been been

2557
01:50:44,118 --> 01:50:48,559
going for and just real quickly I drew

2558
01:50:46,078 --> 01:50:50,639
this diagram real quick just to show

2559
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:53,000
like a living soil bed with your

2560
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:55,440
cannabis planted in it and what I've

2561
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:58,679
been doing is planting my edges with the

2562
01:50:55,439 --> 01:51:00,678
with ComFree lemongrass and terara and

2563
01:50:58,679 --> 01:51:03,239
so what I'll do is that the comfrey

2564
01:51:00,679 --> 01:51:05,118
grows so fast I'll just come through it

2565
01:51:03,238 --> 01:51:06,959
when it starts to flour and you let some

2566
01:51:05,118 --> 01:51:09,920
of it flour for the bees and everything

2567
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,880
but chop and drop that onto the beds

2568
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:13,880
just constantly year round and then the

2569
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:16,078
lemongrass I'm adding on there year

2570
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:19,920
round and it's just always growing and I

2571
01:51:16,078 --> 01:51:21,880
got onsite green waste to add to my uh

2572
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:24,078
to my beds all the time and then on top

2573
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:26,599
of that I'm using lots of uh just

2574
01:51:24,078 --> 01:51:28,559
diverse cover crops obviously your

2575
01:51:26,599 --> 01:51:30,599
nitrogen fixers that are in there which

2576
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:33,280
would be my imported seed but I'm trying

2577
01:51:30,599 --> 01:51:35,279
to wean off of the imported seed a lot

2578
01:51:33,279 --> 01:51:37,439
and I'm going more with seeds that are

2579
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:39,599
more prolific in my area which one of

2580
01:51:37,439 --> 01:51:42,799
them is like this uh this edible

2581
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:45,199
amarinth the kalalo from Jamaica and

2582
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:46,560
that one just keeps growing prolifically

2583
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:49,919
and I can just keep chopping and

2584
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:53,679
dropping it and reeding it um to add to

2585
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:56,679
that one thing I do like to uh use is

2586
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:58,639
daon um if you can keep daon in your

2587
01:51:56,679 --> 01:52:00,560
beds all and for some reason it grows

2588
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:02,359
great with cannabis they they're like

2589
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:05,599
really there's something going on with

2590
01:52:02,359 --> 01:52:07,359
the um exit dates or something but these

2591
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:09,800
daon I'll come back through and pull

2592
01:52:07,359 --> 01:52:11,479
them out after they've been in there uh

2593
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:14,599
maybe I'll harvest my cannabis and I'll

2594
01:52:11,479 --> 01:52:16,000
see some of them that that survived and

2595
01:52:14,599 --> 01:52:17,560
you know you come back through and pull

2596
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,399
them out and they're a couple feet long

2597
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:23,000
of 12 to 24 inches long and some of them

2598
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:25,960
are decomposing and if you look through

2599
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,399
the middle of the daon route it's like a

2600
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:30,480
tunnel like a like the outside's like a

2601
01:52:28,399 --> 01:52:32,879
shell and The Middle's like this rotting

2602
01:52:30,479 --> 01:52:36,238
tunnel of like just microbial life and

2603
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:37,880
that's from the top of the soil you know

2604
01:52:36,238 --> 01:52:40,279
that's going straight in so that's like

2605
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:42,599
an air tunnel in a microbial power you

2606
01:52:40,279 --> 01:52:45,759
know super highway and it's just adding

2607
01:52:42,599 --> 01:52:48,679
life deep down into that middle and Su

2608
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:50,480
layer of your of your living soil so I

2609
01:52:48,679 --> 01:52:53,359
really love daon and the same with the

2610
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:55,319
comrey if you pull up a free root to

2611
01:52:53,359 --> 01:52:58,439
replant it somewhere else you see that

2612
01:52:55,319 --> 01:53:01,198
rotting outside kind of decomposing root

2613
01:52:58,439 --> 01:53:05,479
has this channel going deep into the

2614
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:07,198
soil of a brown rot kind of uh Decay

2615
01:53:05,479 --> 01:53:10,678
which which you can just see is like

2616
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:12,879
this bacterial Super Highway and and uh

2617
01:53:10,679 --> 01:53:15,480
like Josh said that nitrogen is just

2618
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:18,880
heavily abundant if you're using that

2619
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:20,000
one more thing about uh the choice of

2620
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:23,960
covering your

2621
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:25,719
soil um wood chips i i notic in cannabis

2622
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:28,840
a lot of people it's kind of stray away

2623
01:53:25,719 --> 01:53:30,880
from wood chips more than than uh maybe

2624
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:32,920
they should and I just started using a

2625
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:35,719
lot more wood chips recently with great

2626
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:38,480
results and uh mixing actually like a

2627
01:53:35,719 --> 01:53:41,560
hard wood with more of like a green wood

2628
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:44,359
we have I live on a coffee farm so we uh

2629
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:46,719
chip the coffee boughs and in just in

2630
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:49,559
one day of leaving these a pile of

2631
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:52,039
coffee chips you'll see this white

2632
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:54,320
mycelium running through it within 24 to

2633
01:53:52,039 --> 01:53:57,279
48 eight hours it's just you can go back

2634
01:53:54,319 --> 01:54:01,279
and open up the the pile of of this

2635
01:53:57,279 --> 01:54:03,519
because it's a soft green wood and um

2636
01:54:01,279 --> 01:54:06,439
you know so it's just this living Mulch

2637
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:08,719
and and that mixed with the native ohia

2638
01:54:06,439 --> 01:54:11,319
wood chips which are more of a

2639
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:14,639
hardwood um have created this whole

2640
01:54:11,319 --> 01:54:16,639
another layer of life that I've haven't

2641
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:19,000
seen on my living soil beds that are

2642
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:21,719
like 10 years old at this point you know

2643
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,520
so some of those uh those kind of tips

2644
01:54:21,719 --> 01:54:26,399
and tricks would definitely implore the

2645
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:29,440
daon some of these deep drilling root

2646
01:54:26,399 --> 01:54:32,598
vegetables maybe or deep drilling things

2647
01:54:29,439 --> 01:54:36,158
like um like your uh your clovers and

2648
01:54:32,599 --> 01:54:38,960
your your you know your comf and having

2649
01:54:36,158 --> 01:54:41,719
it nearby because Rudolph Steiner said

2650
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:44,560
Rudolph Steiner said only a sick Farm

2651
01:54:41,719 --> 01:54:46,920
needs outside inputs so is your farm

2652
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:48,920
sick is your farm sick or is your farm

2653
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:50,920
healthy and I'm not speaking for a farm

2654
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:52,639
that's just starting of course you might

2655
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:55,158
need to bring something in from the

2656
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:56,760
outside but if you're living on an

2657
01:54:55,158 --> 01:54:59,399
established farm and you're planning on

2658
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:02,039
being there for a long time only a sick

2659
01:54:59,399 --> 01:55:03,359
Farm needs outside inut that's what my

2660
01:55:02,039 --> 01:55:05,760
quote that's Rudolph Steiner so I

2661
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:05,759
remember

2662
01:55:06,078 --> 01:55:12,158
that nice well said good uh good tips

2663
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:14,319
and tricks there for sure that's uh

2664
01:55:12,158 --> 01:55:16,000
that's good information you want to be

2665
01:55:14,319 --> 01:55:17,359
knowing these these things from people

2666
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,118
who have actually done it one thing I

2667
01:55:17,359 --> 01:55:22,639
would say about the wood chips too at

2668
01:55:19,118 --> 01:55:25,759
least here in in in Pacific Northwest

2669
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:28,279
cess and mushrooms just love wood chips

2670
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:30,480
they really really love wood chips so

2671
01:55:28,279 --> 01:55:33,960
here in West Vancouver close to where I

2672
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:36,439
live they just wood chipped every um

2673
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:38,078
Boulevard and then put grass over top of

2674
01:55:36,439 --> 01:55:40,439
the wood chip but all of our boulevards

2675
01:55:38,078 --> 01:55:43,118
are basically wood chips so you see cyan

2676
01:55:40,439 --> 01:55:46,000
and mushrooms generally around October

2677
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:48,078
November just popping out all over the

2678
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,118
place you can find them even driving in

2679
01:55:48,078 --> 01:55:52,920
your car by looking for a much larger

2680
01:55:50,118 --> 01:55:54,399
honey mushroom that if you spot those

2681
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:56,639
out of the corner of your eye you can

2682
01:55:54,399 --> 01:55:59,399
pull over and like I've literally

2683
01:55:56,639 --> 01:56:01,599
searched for cyan and mushrooms in my

2684
01:55:59,399 --> 01:56:04,118
vehicle like how ridiculous is that

2685
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:05,719
every every other time I've had to and

2686
01:56:04,118 --> 01:56:07,799
you can see them in Vancouver as well

2687
01:56:05,719 --> 01:56:10,319
but they're simil inata liberty caps if

2688
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:11,880
you go towards the Vancouver airport on

2689
01:56:10,319 --> 01:56:13,920
the right there's this big field of

2690
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:15,679
grass during those months in particular

2691
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:18,440
you'll see people walking with golf

2692
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:20,760
clubs uh they're not golfing they are

2693
01:56:18,439 --> 01:56:23,279
picking psychedelic mushrooms and uh

2694
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:25,199
good on them for doing that so

2695
01:56:23,279 --> 01:56:29,000
yeah that was a big issue in Oly from

2696
01:56:25,198 --> 01:56:31,559
Olympia up to through Seattle was like

2697
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:34,319
Evergreen State College was is was they

2698
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:36,039
mowed all the trees down and chopped all

2699
01:56:34,319 --> 01:56:38,840
and chipped all the trees and then put

2700
01:56:36,039 --> 01:56:41,599
grass over it and then built the college

2701
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:43,599
so everywhere around the college when

2702
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:45,239
Paul stamus was going to college there

2703
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:47,480
and everything like can Essence were

2704
01:56:45,238 --> 01:56:49,479
just part of the campus yeah and then

2705
01:56:47,479 --> 01:56:52,919
they started using like you said wood

2706
01:56:49,479 --> 01:56:54,598
chips all over Seattle um in landscaping

2707
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:57,319
and and it was just basically like put

2708
01:56:54,599 --> 01:56:59,159
wood chips out and they will come so and

2709
01:56:57,319 --> 01:57:02,439
and then sadly they started using a lot

2710
01:56:59,158 --> 01:57:06,078
of fungicides in the uh the

2711
01:57:02,439 --> 01:57:09,598
municipal uh uh wood chip areas to stop

2712
01:57:06,078 --> 01:57:12,039
like the spread of the Psychedelic fungi

2713
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:15,078
and everything but it is really good for

2714
01:57:12,039 --> 01:57:17,078
people to to when they find a a big fat

2715
01:57:15,078 --> 01:57:19,238
patches they could grab a little bit of

2716
01:57:17,078 --> 01:57:22,319
that mycelium and bring it back to their

2717
01:57:19,238 --> 01:57:25,118
land along with fresh wood chips and

2718
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:26,759
grow growing that on their land it's

2719
01:57:25,118 --> 01:57:28,719
good for the forest and it's good to

2720
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:32,639
have that um you know growing on your

2721
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:34,679
property little wild patches G gently

2722
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:37,800
you know we had a we had a house that we

2723
01:57:34,679 --> 01:57:39,880
were growing in years ago and my partner

2724
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:42,000
called me up in a in a flurry and he's

2725
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:43,359
like he's like there's this Drey guy and

2726
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,479
and he's picking something out of our

2727
01:57:43,359 --> 01:57:47,319
out of our front driveway and I'm like

2728
01:57:45,479 --> 01:57:48,359
what like you know we're we're paranoid

2729
01:57:47,319 --> 01:57:49,920
at this time you're not really allowed

2730
01:57:48,359 --> 01:57:51,880
to be growing it's pretty illegal and

2731
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,639
we're just like is this Drey guy like a

2732
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:55,000
like like an undercover agent or

2733
01:57:53,639 --> 01:57:56,560
something you know that's the mentality

2734
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,679
you're thinking when it's super illegal

2735
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:00,159
and you can get in mad trouble turns out

2736
01:57:58,679 --> 01:58:02,399
he's picking all the mushrooms that are

2737
01:58:00,158 --> 01:58:05,158
growing on Art we have this like insane

2738
01:58:02,399 --> 01:58:07,879
flush of mushrooms like buddy took a

2739
01:58:05,158 --> 01:58:11,359
giant bag of of cyan Essence out of

2740
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:13,840
there uh and then we used it for years

2741
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:16,559
and one year I was I was I went to go

2742
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:20,480
there um to pick just a few

2743
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:22,760
mushrooms and my ex partner was there

2744
01:58:20,479 --> 01:58:25,959
literally digging up the the entire

2745
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:29,199
Mycelia bed with a shovel to take it

2746
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:32,239
away I was just like dude like talk

2747
01:58:29,198 --> 01:58:34,439
about a faux paww pick a little but

2748
01:58:32,238 --> 01:58:36,678
don't take a lot when it comes to the

2749
01:58:34,439 --> 01:58:38,759
Mycelia when it comes to the mushroom

2750
01:58:36,679 --> 01:58:41,118
take a lot don't take a little you

2751
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:44,400
shouldn't be able to see where you took

2752
01:58:41,118 --> 01:58:46,479
it from afterwards let's just put it

2753
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:47,799
that way you could take a handful and

2754
01:58:46,479 --> 01:58:48,919
make it Grow from there if you can't

2755
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:50,719
make it work with a handful you

2756
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:52,719
shouldn't be taking it there's two

2757
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:55,078
vibrations in this world fear and

2758
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:57,198
scarcity and love and abundance and

2759
01:58:55,078 --> 01:58:58,719
people have a hard time they get trapped

2760
01:58:57,198 --> 01:59:01,359
in the fear and scarcity and it

2761
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:03,399
definitely does make them do strange

2762
01:59:01,359 --> 01:59:06,559
insecure things that you would just

2763
01:59:03,399 --> 01:59:08,839
think like you know there's enough for

2764
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:13,639
everybody like you don't don't don't

2765
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:17,880
forget the biggest Mantra of mankind

2766
01:59:13,639 --> 01:59:17,880
greed greed is for

2767
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:23,840
real I don't know maybe just a little

2768
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:25,639
humility I like weed

2769
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:29,239
instead of

2770
01:59:25,639 --> 01:59:31,239
greed yeah I uh I hear what he's saying

2771
01:59:29,238 --> 01:59:33,439
though you know the human race

2772
01:59:31,238 --> 01:59:35,279
definitely has a problem with greed

2773
01:59:33,439 --> 01:59:37,519
probably because the whole system is

2774
01:59:35,279 --> 01:59:40,319
based on fear and scarcity and the whole

2775
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:44,440
design is just very inaccurate and

2776
01:59:40,319 --> 01:59:47,078
insanely wasteful and definitely not

2777
01:59:44,439 --> 01:59:50,118
sustainable probably why we're in some

2778
01:59:47,078 --> 01:59:53,840
sort of you know I don't

2779
01:59:50,118 --> 01:59:55,880
know strange Matrix like complex that's

2780
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:59,159
that's uh just you know we're just in

2781
01:59:55,880 --> 02:00:02,039
some strain don't they say that fish in

2782
01:59:59,158 --> 02:00:05,439
the oceans have been reduced by

2783
02:00:02,039 --> 02:00:08,519
75% that we've reduced fish by

2784
02:00:05,439 --> 02:00:11,000
75% man did well the one that Disturbed

2785
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:12,679
me the most was that and it was a freaky

2786
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:16,359
one it was

2787
02:00:12,679 --> 02:00:19,359
like it was about the

2788
02:00:16,359 --> 02:00:21,719
Maman Mass on planet Earth it was from

2789
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:25,198
David aten bro the the guy that did the

2790
02:00:21,719 --> 02:00:28,399
Earth series you know David um he he

2791
02:00:25,198 --> 02:00:29,799
said something oh it was to the tune of

2792
02:00:28,399 --> 02:00:33,598
it was like

2793
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:36,599
77% of all bird life on Earth are

2794
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:39,800
chickens in like commercialized chickens

2795
02:00:36,599 --> 02:00:41,199
77% of the birds in the whole world and

2796
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:43,679
then it was a more it was even a more

2797
02:00:41,198 --> 02:00:47,039
disturbing world word for for the

2798
02:00:43,679 --> 02:00:49,239
mamalian mass it was like cows and pigs

2799
02:00:47,039 --> 02:00:52,000
and they made up this like they made up

2800
02:00:49,238 --> 02:00:54,638
like 96% of mamalian mass along with

2801
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:56,920
with humans uh and then like zebras and

2802
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:57,760
giraffes and lions and [ __ ] that was

2803
02:00:56,920 --> 02:01:01,920
like

2804
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:04,119
4% of what was don't don't forget rats

2805
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:06,880
that's probably a

2806
02:01:04,118 --> 02:01:09,639
few yeah exactly they probably make up

2807
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:11,679
half the percent of all the the

2808
02:01:09,639 --> 02:01:14,118
4% it was kind of

2809
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:15,679
depressing uh in a way of thinking about

2810
02:01:14,118 --> 02:01:17,880
it I thought well we could probably do

2811
02:01:15,679 --> 02:01:19,760
better than that like I I I'm pretty

2812
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:21,560
sure we can do better than that we just

2813
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:23,840
need to uh let go of some of these old

2814
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:26,599
systems systems and come up with some

2815
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:28,760
very new ones when you hear a statistic

2816
02:01:26,599 --> 02:01:30,520
like that it it should just ring a bell

2817
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:32,560
think about what you eat and what you

2818
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:35,400
consume and what you participate in

2819
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:38,760
every day you know for sure that's big

2820
02:01:35,399 --> 02:01:40,279
time that's very accurate in fact very

2821
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:42,520
accurate what are the systems that you

2822
02:01:40,279 --> 02:01:44,158
are supporting knowingly those are the

2823
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:46,280
first ones you try to work through and

2824
02:01:44,158 --> 02:01:47,879
nobody's saying it's easy and you know

2825
02:01:46,279 --> 02:01:51,039
as long as you're working through

2826
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:53,760
getting you know those cut down to

2827
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:56,000
eliminated eventually then this then the

2828
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:57,920
unconscious ones are there which are the

2829
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,520
really frightening ones because that's

2830
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:03,440
how the whole system works it it avoids

2831
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:07,040
even conscious human beings and gets you

2832
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:09,279
in some way or another it's uh it's

2833
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:10,920
quite quite a shitome as Peter Tosh

2834
02:02:09,279 --> 02:02:14,000
would always call it I always thought

2835
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:17,679
that was a very perfect perfect term for

2836
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:20,039
the entire for the entire thing once

2837
02:02:17,679 --> 02:02:22,359
more cannabis and psychedelics have

2838
02:02:20,039 --> 02:02:24,319
helped me see through these things in a

2839
02:02:22,359 --> 02:02:27,198
way that I honestly don't think I ever

2840
02:02:24,319 --> 02:02:30,439
would have had I not uh had those those

2841
02:02:27,198 --> 02:02:32,479
in my life feel blessed for that

2842
02:02:30,439 --> 02:02:35,319
everyone else was abusing alcohol when

2843
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:38,000
they were younger in my age and uh oh a

2844
02:02:35,319 --> 02:02:41,118
dab fell out

2845
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:43,679
Kobe right into the bowl looks sweet

2846
02:02:41,118 --> 02:02:47,399
dude very buttery that like some rosin

2847
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:47,399
that you pressed some hash out of or

2848
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:54,639
what yeah

2849
02:02:52,599 --> 02:02:56,639
you talking to me that's whole plant

2850
02:02:54,639 --> 02:03:01,078
fresh Frozen

2851
02:02:56,639 --> 02:03:04,159
um some papaya whole plant fresh frozen

2852
02:03:01,078 --> 02:03:06,319
Rosen papaya that Papaya's nice I was in

2853
02:03:04,158 --> 02:03:08,039
Jamaica and my friend was telling me

2854
02:03:06,319 --> 02:03:10,519
about the emerald cup and he was like oh

2855
02:03:08,039 --> 02:03:12,399
straight Organics won the solvent list

2856
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:14,760
with his papaya or whatever it was so

2857
02:03:12,399 --> 02:03:16,519
beautiful and I'm like oh man like don't

2858
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:18,159
be telling me about hash that I can't

2859
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:19,679
have and then he's like what do you mean

2860
02:03:18,158 --> 02:03:22,078
I have it right here this is the winning

2861
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:24,399
one from straight Organics cracks it

2862
02:03:22,078 --> 02:03:28,078
gives me a big dab I was just like dude

2863
02:03:24,399 --> 02:03:32,960
that is the most amazing flavor that

2864
02:03:28,078 --> 02:03:37,198
whatever papaya cut he has tastes so

2865
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:39,520
good papaya is so good it's like one of

2866
02:03:37,198 --> 02:03:41,078
my favorite

2867
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:44,520

beautiful real papayas in

2878
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:14,400
Hawaii yeah we grow many varieties of

2879
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:16,840
papayas we got do a lot trouble with you

2880
02:04:14,399 --> 02:04:19,638
have much trouble with fruit flies when

2881
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:22,119
we were growing them in Kawaii we had to

2882
02:04:19,639 --> 02:04:28,118
uh keep them inside of screen green

2883
02:04:22,118 --> 02:04:31,439
houses uh because papaya the the fruit

2884
02:04:28,118 --> 02:04:32,479
flies hit every single papaya if they

2885
02:04:31,439 --> 02:04:35,678
weren't

2886
02:04:32,479 --> 02:04:37,479
protected no no no not the papayas and

2887
02:04:35,679 --> 02:04:40,960
the fruit flies aren't an issue it's

2888
02:04:37,479 --> 02:04:42,558
this ring spot virus that's out here

2889
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:45,559
that's floating around on the island

2890
02:04:42,559 --> 02:04:47,840
it's uh some kind of I don't know I bet

2891
02:04:45,559 --> 02:04:49,559
it's man-made you know what I mean but

2892
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:53,679
uh

2893
02:04:49,559 --> 02:04:56,639
what spreads r do you know the insect

2894
02:04:53,679 --> 02:04:58,520
Vector I don't know the vector myself no

2895
02:04:56,639 --> 02:05:00,920
but that's the reason why they created

2896
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:04,559
the GMO papaya which is like the main

2897
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:06,800
one they grow on the east side of% 90%

2898
02:05:04,559 --> 02:05:09,599
of what they grow in Hawaii is GMO

2899
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:12,320
papayas corre right right that's true

2900
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:15,078
and that's due to the Rings spot virus

2901
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:16,399
um you know so yeah you got to really

2902
02:05:15,078 --> 02:05:18,359
question what's going on with your

2903
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:21,920
farming practices if you're dealing with

2904
02:05:18,359 --> 02:05:24,078
some kind of you know islandwide virus

2905
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:26,440
uh you know what what happened there

2906
02:05:24,078 --> 02:05:31,799
what what we do

2907
02:05:26,439 --> 02:05:33,439
virus so they yeah so they say yeah yeah

2908
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:37,279
that's what they call it anyway DN

2909
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:39,759
Mexican fruit flies made it really

2910
02:05:37,279 --> 02:05:46,319
hard until finally we just grew the

2911
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:49,440
papayas inside of a netted shade crop uh

2912
02:05:46,319 --> 02:05:50,960
and that that stopped M cold that's

2913
02:05:49,439 --> 02:05:52,719
interesting because we don't have that

2914
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:54,639
issue at all with with the with anything

2915
02:05:52,719 --> 02:05:56,599
tropical but if we try to grow like a

2916
02:05:54,639 --> 02:06:00,039
European vegetable like something like a

2917
02:05:56,599 --> 02:06:02,199
squash or a melon or uh anything that's

2918
02:06:00,039 --> 02:06:06,158
like some kind of more like a northern

2919
02:06:02,198 --> 02:06:06,158
European type thing then you

2920
02:06:08,319 --> 02:06:14,759
gota yeah this was in the North Shore of

2921
02:06:12,158 --> 02:06:16,598
kawaii okay okay interesting maybe it

2922
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:20,400
just at a lower elevation or at a

2923
02:06:16,599 --> 02:06:23,360
certain a certain uh humid area or

2924
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:28,319
something like that but even been the

2925
02:06:23,359 --> 02:06:31,598
time you know when

2926
02:06:28,319 --> 02:06:33,078
yeah but yeah the the papayas are so uh

2927
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:35,119
resilient you know they're a tropical

2928
02:06:33,078 --> 02:06:38,319
fruit so anything tropical the bananas

2929
02:06:35,118 --> 02:06:39,679
the papayas the teros the sugar cane you

2930
02:06:38,319 --> 02:06:42,158
know the sweet

2931
02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:44,719
potato anything tropical like you don't

2932
02:06:42,158 --> 02:06:46,799
spray it you don't you don't put

2933
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:48,639
anything on it you know you just kind of

2934
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,000
like maybe just help build the soil and

2935
02:06:48,639 --> 02:06:52,719
mulch things and plant them you know

2936
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,880
what I mean anything that's that's

2937
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:56,439
conducive to the environment just grows

2938
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:59,000
and that's when we talked about food

2939
02:06:56,439 --> 02:07:01,598
sovereignty and the last dragonfly Earth

2940
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:04,238
medicine talk it was all about just you

2941
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:06,760
know using food and things that grow

2942
02:07:04,238 --> 02:07:08,238
properly in your environment so a lot of

2943
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:09,840
that netting and stuff like that

2944
02:07:08,238 --> 02:07:11,678
definitely comes with the European

2945
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:13,679
vegetables that are susceptible to that

2946
02:07:11,679 --> 02:07:15,719
fruit fly that fruit fly will sting the

2947
02:07:13,679 --> 02:07:17,158
fruit and they'll put their larae in

2948
02:07:15,719 --> 02:07:19,960
there and then the thing is done you

2949
02:07:17,158 --> 02:07:23,519
know Papas did really good in Hawaii

2950
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:23,520
until the Mexican

2951
02:07:23,599 --> 02:07:27,800
interesting I wonder if that was even

2952
02:07:25,158 --> 02:07:30,558
maybe just like a scor or something a

2953
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:32,840
certain time of time of uh of in history

2954
02:07:30,559 --> 02:07:37,400
that maybe we had like a scorge of them

2955
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:39,599
as far as I know they're still there

2956
02:07:37,399 --> 02:07:41,078
interesting yeah no problems with fruit

2957
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:43,679
flies on the

2958
02:07:41,078 --> 02:07:45,759
papayas they grow great we do a we do

2959
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:48,599
different varieties red thae papaya we

2960
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:52,039
got this Filipino pink papaya um

2961
02:07:48,599 --> 02:07:55,639
strawberry papayas uh solo papaya

2962
02:07:52,039 --> 02:07:58,279
you know we got a good variety

2963
02:07:55,639 --> 02:07:59,199
of have you grown the ones from Thailand

2964
02:07:58,279 --> 02:08:01,479
that are

2965
02:07:59,198 --> 02:08:03,598
orange yeah that yeah well we got one

2966
02:08:01,479 --> 02:08:06,078
called the red tie and it's got a really

2967
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:08,360
really orange kind of pinkish flesh in

2968
02:08:06,078 --> 02:08:10,599
there you know and and that's that's one

2969
02:08:08,359 --> 02:08:15,000
of our better ones for sure a ripe or

2970
02:08:10,599 --> 02:08:15,000
even green and a papaya salad you know

2971
02:08:15,719 --> 02:08:22,599
wo any pineapples down there well that's

2972
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:25,079
what actually my my main fruit is uh or

2973
02:08:22,599 --> 02:08:27,520
actually my main thing I bring to Market

2974
02:08:25,078 --> 02:08:30,639
would be my white pineapples and we do

2975
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:32,119
anywhere from 2 to 5,000 pounds a year

2976
02:08:30,639 --> 02:08:33,960
we're looking probably this year we'll

2977
02:08:32,118 --> 02:08:37,479
probably get more like three two to

2978
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:39,800
three th000 pounds but um yeah the white

2979
02:08:37,479 --> 02:08:43,118
pineapple man it's this string called

2980
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:46,000
Sugarloaf and the thing is so turpy and

2981
02:08:43,118 --> 02:08:48,519
tasty and sweet and um yeah we're kind

2982
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,198
of known for that and you know we love

2983
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:53,960
it it's like the crown fruit the king's

2984
02:08:50,198 --> 02:08:57,799
fruit and you grow any pineapple ganja

2985
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:59,679
spral out there so I have one that I

2986
02:08:57,800 --> 02:09:01,880
call the white

2987
02:08:59,679 --> 02:09:04,559
pineapple in spirit of the white

2988
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:06,840
pineapples on the farm and um and it's

2989
02:09:04,559 --> 02:09:08,599
one of my one of my really good hash

2990
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:12,239
strains as well to tell you the truth

2991
02:09:08,599 --> 02:09:14,039
and it puts off this really um you know

2992
02:09:12,238 --> 02:09:17,198
floral uh

2993
02:09:14,039 --> 02:09:19,840
fruity turpy hat that uh that is really

2994
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:22,078
sought after too is it pretty obvious

2995
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:24,960
that you're using your white pineapple

2996
02:09:22,078 --> 02:09:27,000
fruit juice on your white pineapple

2997
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:30,439
ganja

2998
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:34,238
varieties I definitely do a few um a few

2999
02:09:30,439 --> 02:09:34,238
ferment and fpjsangprobinsyano

3000
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:55,079
to nothing nowadays man doing the

3001
02:09:53,078 --> 02:09:57,399
natural farming for so long man you just

3002
02:09:55,078 --> 02:09:59,359
learned that that soil really can eat a

3003
02:09:57,399 --> 02:10:01,279
lot unless you're just really blowing it

3004
02:09:59,359 --> 02:10:03,238
you know what I mean the if you got a

3005
02:10:01,279 --> 02:10:06,000
nice living soil that's just really

3006
02:10:03,238 --> 02:10:08,479
respirating and really just vibing out

3007
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:10,559
you can't really do too much wrong to it

3008
02:10:08,479 --> 02:10:14,399
unless you're buying a bunch of imported

3009
02:10:10,559 --> 02:10:17,599
weird things or something but you know

3010
02:10:14,399 --> 02:10:19,558
that's the dry side of the island we're

3011
02:10:17,599 --> 02:10:21,400
over here on the Kona side so luckily

3012
02:10:19,559 --> 02:10:23,840
we're on the dry side even though we've

3013
02:10:21,399 --> 02:10:26,439
gotten uh what is it now I think 30 days

3014
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:29,400
of rain straight but we're coming onto

3015
02:10:26,439 --> 02:10:31,519
the Rain Street season so um the

3016
02:10:29,399 --> 02:10:34,638
Cannabis definitely is not loving that

3017
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:37,000
at all at all so it's the tropics and

3018
02:10:34,639 --> 02:10:38,920
it's rainy so it's kind of like that

3019
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:41,399
double do you almost have to grow you

3020
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:45,118
almost have to grow the tropical land

3021
02:10:41,399 --> 02:10:47,238
racy varieties during the wet season

3022
02:10:45,118 --> 02:10:48,799
that's what I wanted to get into when

3023
02:10:47,238 --> 02:10:51,359
you guys were talking about I think

3024
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:53,960
Colin was talking about um just the

3025
02:10:51,359 --> 02:10:56,198
different uh you know climates and how

3026
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:58,599
they are affecting the turpins and the

3027
02:10:56,198 --> 02:11:00,919
waxiness of the hash that got me

3028
02:10:58,599 --> 02:11:02,599
thinking well you guys were talking was

3029
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:04,760
what has anybody ever thought of this or

3030
02:11:02,599 --> 02:11:07,159
done these experiments where it would be

3031
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:09,440
like you take an Afghan hash strain and

3032
02:11:07,158 --> 02:11:11,638
and you grow it in a in a I mean if you

3033
02:11:09,439 --> 02:11:13,598
had a controlled Greenhouse you dry you

3034
02:11:11,639 --> 02:11:15,960
know you make it a dry desert

3035
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:18,239
environment and you try to mimic that

3036
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:20,760
Afghan kind of high mountain desert

3037
02:11:18,238 --> 02:11:24,000
climate or if you had a tropical land

3038
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:25,880
RAC strain you try to up the humidity

3039
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:27,479
and try to kind of mimic the nature

3040
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:29,359
because in natural farming what we're

3041
02:11:27,479 --> 02:11:32,399
doing like the main teaching is mimic

3042
02:11:29,359 --> 02:11:34,359
nature and bring nature into your system

3043
02:11:32,399 --> 02:11:36,479
so what if you actually went down to the

3044
02:11:34,359 --> 02:11:40,719
genetics of where your plant came from

3045
02:11:36,479 --> 02:11:42,839
on the planet and mimic that nature in

3046
02:11:40,719 --> 02:11:44,960
um a controlled environment I mean I

3047
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:47,719
don't do that I'm I grow in green houses

3048
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:50,078
outdoor and I love it but uh maybe you

3049
02:11:47,719 --> 02:11:51,880
grew an Afghan hash drain in a high

3050
02:11:50,078 --> 02:11:53,960
desert mountain climate

3051
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:56,599
mimicked in your system what do you guys

3052
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:58,719
think about that I think that goes back

3053
02:11:56,599 --> 02:12:00,840
to the the whole idea of terar and

3054
02:11:58,719 --> 02:12:03,319
Appalachia I think Sam has the most

3055
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:08,559
experience in all of us in all this I'd

3056
02:12:03,319 --> 02:12:08,558
love to hear your uh your thoughts

3057
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:16,719
Sam well the one thing I could say is

3058
02:12:13,319 --> 02:12:19,960
that widely varities from Afghanistan

3059
02:12:16,719 --> 02:12:22,399
Pakistan and the surrounding area uh

3060
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:28,000
which were developed for

3061
02:12:22,399 --> 02:12:33,238
uh they they have no natural resistance

3062
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:36,319
to uh petritis and mildew and and these

3063
02:12:33,238 --> 02:12:39,759
kinds of problems so it can be a real

3064
02:12:36,319 --> 02:12:42,000
problem to grow them in a wet humid

3065
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:45,960
environment like in the North Shore of

3066
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:48,118
Kawai or any place else where it's it's

3067
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:52,039
it's really they just don't have

3068
02:12:48,118 --> 02:12:55,319
resistance whereas varieties from uh

3069
02:12:52,039 --> 02:12:59,359
Thailand or Colombia or those places

3070
02:12:55,319 --> 02:13:01,880
those are from hot moist tropical

3071
02:12:59,359 --> 02:13:05,039
environments and if they didn't have

3072
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:06,000
resistance they wouldn't exist anymore

3073
02:13:05,039 --> 02:13:08,559
they'd be

3074
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:10,599
gone right I guess my question is more

3075
02:13:08,559 --> 02:13:13,360
just for you guys that have a a way to

3076
02:13:10,599 --> 02:13:15,159
control your environment uh and just for

3077
02:13:13,359 --> 02:13:18,238
the the purpose of talking hash

3078
02:13:15,158 --> 02:13:22,078
production in general would it would you

3079
02:13:18,238 --> 02:13:24,959
be able to to uh to tease your climate

3080
02:13:22,078 --> 02:13:26,319
to better match the genetics you know

3081
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:28,760
that's kind of where I'm going with I

3082
02:13:26,319 --> 02:13:33,118
think Colin understood what I was saying

3083
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:36,239
yeah of you can do that of course but uh

3084
02:13:33,118 --> 02:13:39,880
there's a couple problems is number one

3085
02:13:36,238 --> 02:13:44,959
most WID Leaf varieties indicas or what

3086
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:44,960
people call them uh they

3087
02:13:45,158 --> 02:13:51,238
uh they don't really have the tpes they

3088
02:13:48,319 --> 02:13:53,558
got lots of THC I I can't criticize them

3089
02:13:51,238 --> 02:13:57,678
for that they got lots of resin but they

3090
02:13:53,559 --> 02:14:01,400
don't have the tping the way that ganja

3091
02:13:57,679 --> 02:14:04,440
smokers have uh conserved and preserved

3092
02:14:01,399 --> 02:14:08,879
and uh created varieties like Thailand

3093
02:14:04,439 --> 02:14:11,879
Colombia etc etc that are are really I

3094
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:13,719
mean no matter how much THC you have

3095
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:17,279
without the right

3096
02:14:13,719 --> 02:14:21,439
tpes it doesn't cut it you you

3097
02:14:17,279 --> 02:14:21,439
need the tpes

3098
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:27,880
that's all I'm

3099
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:30,719
saying yeah I I agree with Sam 100% um

3100
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:32,800
and to to answer the question of of the

3101
02:14:30,719 --> 02:14:35,118
environmental stuff I for the hybrids

3102
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:37,679
that I grow absolutely everything's kind

3103
02:14:35,118 --> 02:14:40,880
of catered to that for resin production

3104
02:14:37,679 --> 02:14:43,158
um when I'm growing a variety it's all

3105
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:45,840
about how I'm catering to that variety

3106
02:14:43,158 --> 02:14:47,799
or group of varieties and I try to group

3107
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:50,239
things together that are kind of related

3108
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:53,199
to one another based on region and I do

3109
02:14:50,238 --> 02:14:56,238
look at where those varieties come from

3110
02:14:53,198 --> 02:14:59,439
from a progeny standpoint standpoint to

3111
02:14:56,238 --> 02:15:03,039
make sure that if I'm putting motor

3112
02:14:59,439 --> 02:15:05,359
breath 15 in there with sour d and chem

3113
02:15:03,039 --> 02:15:07,118
dog D they're all going to play nice

3114
02:15:05,359 --> 02:15:09,639
with my feeding and I don't have to do

3115
02:15:07,118 --> 02:15:12,839
too much work so I try to keep keep

3116
02:15:09,639 --> 02:15:15,078
things um you know I try to think like

3117
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:16,840
that in terms of what my end goal is

3118
02:15:15,078 --> 02:15:17,920
because it's all about hash for what I'm

3119
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:21,520
I'm

3120
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:23,719
producing right I I understand exactly I

3121
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:27,520
can give you a good example I had a

3122
02:15:23,719 --> 02:15:30,078
greenhouse where I was doing triing of

3123
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:32,559
imported seeds from Afghanistan year

3124
02:15:30,078 --> 02:15:35,118
after year after year and so one year I

3125
02:15:32,559 --> 02:15:38,480
had a couple thousand of them growing in

3126
02:15:35,118 --> 02:15:41,719
there but I had also grown a few uh

3127
02:15:38,479 --> 02:15:44,638
original Haze plants in the middle of

3128
02:15:41,719 --> 02:15:49,359
the of the greenhouse in between the

3129
02:15:44,639 --> 02:15:51,599
roads of Afghan plants 90% of the Afghan

3130
02:15:49,359 --> 02:15:55,839
plants got

3131
02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:58,199
uh uh mdeo uh I mean it was this one

3132
02:15:55,840 --> 02:16:01,440
year it was really really bad both the

3133
02:15:58,198 --> 02:16:04,439
environmental conditions and the seed

3134
02:16:01,439 --> 02:16:08,000
variety itself but I

3135
02:16:04,439 --> 02:16:10,960
had uh Haze growing in the middle of

3136
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:13,039
these I had a darkening system so they

3137
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:15,279
were flowering along with the Afghans

3138
02:16:13,039 --> 02:16:19,118
the Afghans were more flowered along

3139
02:16:15,279 --> 02:16:21,519
but the haze didn't have one spot of

3140
02:16:19,118 --> 02:16:24,039
mildew on it none of them

3141
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:27,199
whereas the some of the

3142
02:16:24,039 --> 02:16:31,078
Afghan were quite literally dripping mil

3143
02:16:27,198 --> 02:16:35,318
do white crap off their [ __ ] leaves I

3144
02:16:31,078 --> 02:16:38,519
mean it's you you can't fight mother

3145
02:16:35,318 --> 02:16:40,879
nature and if if you want to use Afghan

3146
02:16:38,519 --> 02:16:44,478
varieties then you better breed it in

3147
02:16:40,879 --> 02:16:48,759
such a way that none of those

3148
02:16:44,478 --> 02:16:51,718
nonresistant varieties uh genes uh for

3149
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:54,760
petritis and Milo are are in them

3150
02:16:51,718 --> 02:16:57,000
because uh it's it's it's you're just

3151
02:16:54,760 --> 02:17:00,079
fighting Mother Nature what you should

3152
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:03,959
do instead is grow things like Haze or

3153
02:17:00,079 --> 02:17:07,478
or other tropical narrow Leaf varieties

3154
02:17:03,959 --> 02:17:11,358
which uh have no trouble growing mildew

3155
02:17:07,478 --> 02:17:15,239
and petritis spre in uh even if your

3156
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:15,239
Greenhouse is a bit hot or

3157
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:23,079
humid I agree

3158
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:24,719
uh I have a question for you what what

3159
02:17:23,079 --> 02:17:27,000
varieties are you growing up there that

3160
02:17:24,718 --> 02:17:29,678
are uh dealing with all all that we have

3161
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:31,760
to deal with on the on the East Coast um

3162
02:17:29,679 --> 02:17:35,000
you know when hurricane season starts to

3163
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:38,519
kick up and the storms start to

3164
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:41,359
come well I'm I'm kind of following what

3165
02:17:38,519 --> 02:17:44,239
uh Sam is saying for a while now with uh

3166
02:17:41,359 --> 02:17:47,120
selecting the right cultivars that do

3167
02:17:44,239 --> 02:17:49,119
well according to the climate here but

3168
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:51,120
when I was even in Northern California I

3169
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:53,479
didn't have the greatest exposure so I

3170
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:56,639
had to deal with mold and betrus and

3171
02:17:53,478 --> 02:17:59,000
mildew and I've had some genetics carry

3172
02:17:56,638 --> 02:18:01,239
over like I mentioned last time some

3173
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:04,318
strawberry fields which is a strawberry

3174
02:18:01,239 --> 02:18:06,280
banana Tang from Crockett uh that I

3175
02:18:04,318 --> 02:18:09,718
crossed to my angel food cake which is

3176
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:11,439
kind of a deep poly strain uh very poly

3177
02:18:09,718 --> 02:18:12,879
hybrid strain I made and then I've

3178
02:18:11,439 --> 02:18:14,239
carried over to here with that one

3179
02:18:12,879 --> 02:18:17,518
that's done very well I've made

3180
02:18:14,239 --> 02:18:19,959
variations from strawberry angel food

3181
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:23,159
now into strawberry Angela which is a

3182
02:18:19,959 --> 02:18:25,678
strawberry angel food by tester Roa so

3183
02:18:23,159 --> 02:18:29,159
I'm having great results outside with

3184
02:18:25,679 --> 02:18:31,398
that that cross into the testarosa um

3185
02:18:29,159 --> 02:18:34,638
it's a skittles magnumopus

3186
02:18:31,398 --> 02:18:36,478
Skittles so what I'm seeing and even uh

3187
02:18:34,638 --> 02:18:39,759
sensing in the tpine profile on the

3188
02:18:36,478 --> 02:18:42,119
strawberry angel food particular cross

3189
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:44,478
um to testos I call Strawberry Angela

3190
02:18:42,120 --> 02:18:47,559
that feno is a is a reminder of the

3191
02:18:44,478 --> 02:18:49,920
grapy royal Kush kind of magnumopus

3192
02:18:47,558 --> 02:18:53,279
thing but I'm just getting great health

3193
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:54,920
results with that type um 24 Karat I

3194
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:59,359
have one outside right now that's a

3195
02:18:54,920 --> 02:19:02,719
beast and super healthy I actually find

3196
02:18:59,359 --> 02:19:06,920
that sat the sativa equatorial sativa

3197
02:19:02,718 --> 02:19:09,518
input just is what we kind of need here

3198
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:12,239
even in main so it's interesting but it

3199
02:19:09,519 --> 02:19:14,040
has to be absolutely the right phenotype

3200
02:19:12,239 --> 02:19:16,000
that's been selected and that just

3201
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:18,519
basically takes letting it run like even

3202
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:21,239
out here I'm year three of selecting and

3203
02:19:18,519 --> 02:19:23,559
I've got about oh

3204
02:19:21,239 --> 02:19:25,718
three chosen types that I go back to

3205
02:19:23,558 --> 02:19:27,840
after three years a sour banana sherbet

3206
02:19:25,718 --> 02:19:31,638
you know that's just amazing comes off

3207
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:35,280
early into late uh September on its own

3208
02:19:31,638 --> 02:19:37,079
full sun and yeah otherwise I'm light

3209
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:39,880
deps we just flipped a week ago on the

3210
02:19:37,079 --> 02:19:42,519
first session and I'm Greenhouse grow

3211
02:19:39,879 --> 02:19:44,759
but I I do both and it's about the

3212
02:19:42,519 --> 02:19:46,679
cultivar about finding that one and I

3213
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:49,880
agree and that will Shine for You indoor

3214
02:19:46,679 --> 02:19:53,000
Greenhouse outside even from into

3215
02:19:49,879 --> 02:19:53,000
different regions I

3216
02:19:54,359 --> 02:20:00,280
believe got to put in the

3217
02:19:57,398 --> 02:20:02,559
work eador on the East Coast has really

3218
02:20:00,280 --> 02:20:04,399
been successful for me over the years in

3219
02:20:02,559 --> 02:20:07,559
the last you

3220
02:20:04,398 --> 02:20:09,398
know however long it's it's something

3221
02:20:07,559 --> 02:20:11,359
that I recommend anyone on the east

3222
02:20:09,398 --> 02:20:14,398
coast to take a look at that's growing

3223
02:20:11,359 --> 02:20:17,200
outside I definitely share Brian's

3224
02:20:14,398 --> 02:20:19,398
sentiment would you guys all agree that

3225
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:22,359
sometimes your best genetic that grows

3226
02:20:19,398 --> 02:20:24,199
for flower production and health and is

3227
02:20:22,359 --> 02:20:26,120
that most vibrant kind of like you were

3228
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:28,520
just saying how how you get you find

3229
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:30,319
that one that shines and everything but

3230
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:32,880
for some reason Huck come that one's not

3231
02:20:30,318 --> 02:20:35,799
really the hash

3232
02:20:32,879 --> 02:20:39,199
producer you guys find that yeah I

3233
02:20:35,799 --> 02:20:41,478
agree yeah my strawberry angel food

3234
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:43,760
drips my strawberry angel food drips TPS

3235
02:20:41,478 --> 02:20:45,519
I got the juiciest flower Ros and I've

3236
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:48,398
been hitting low time flower Ross and

3237
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:50,680
getting this just buttery cream and it

3238
02:20:48,398 --> 02:20:53,439
it really drips even into the cross out

3239
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:55,439
with the tester Roa is still I'm getting

3240
02:20:53,439 --> 02:20:57,920
at the same temperature white chalk

3241
02:20:55,439 --> 02:21:01,239
flower rosin that dumps pretty good but

3242
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:02,960
it's just not that turpine influence and

3243
02:21:01,239 --> 02:21:05,520
then I don't get the best bubble hash

3244
02:21:02,959 --> 02:21:09,559
off it either like the pineapple

3245
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:12,040
fields yeah come out as much yeah yeah I

3246
02:21:09,559 --> 02:21:16,000
find that

3247
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:19,840
too strawberry really great varieties

3248
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:23,040
that gave lousy yield of dry sift

3249
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:28,478
because I'm always after dryp I know the

3250
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:28,479
The Cutting Edge is rosin but I'm old

3251
02:21:28,840 --> 02:21:36,200
school dude your dry sift is Untouchable

3252
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:38,680
bro forget about old school new school

3253
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:42,079
whatever school that [ __ ] is the Holy

3254
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:42,079
Grail enough

3255
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:49,760
said you know one thing that um to kind

3256
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:53,280
of circle back to what Logan was talking

3257
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:57,800
about um and some of you guys might do

3258
02:21:53,280 --> 02:22:01,840
this as well but we don't um we don't

3259
02:21:57,799 --> 02:22:04,079
try to create a a uh I guess what you

3260
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:07,680
were asking about specifically is any of

3261
02:22:04,079 --> 02:22:12,559
us uh try to create an environment for

3262
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:14,000
specific uh you know uh cultivars from

3263
02:22:12,559 --> 02:22:15,318
that that that kind of mimics their

3264
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,719
natural environment where they're where

3265
02:22:15,318 --> 02:22:21,439
they're naed to we don't do that but one

3266
02:22:17,719 --> 02:22:21,438
thing that we do

3267
02:22:21,719 --> 02:22:27,199
is you know we we have a pretty good

3268
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:29,040
climate for it stays like in the 80s

3269
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:31,880
most of the summer might might spike in

3270
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:36,319
the low 90s but then inevitably we'll

3271
02:22:31,879 --> 02:22:39,679
get one or two spikes here usually June

3272
02:22:36,318 --> 02:22:41,719
July August um for you know anywhere

3273
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:45,960
from three days to five days where we

3274
02:22:41,719 --> 02:22:48,799
get a heat spell of 100 degree plus days

3275
02:22:45,959 --> 02:22:51,478
and um the ganja doesn't like that you

3276
02:22:48,799 --> 02:22:53,239
know it grows a lot during I think you

3277
02:22:51,478 --> 02:22:55,239
know during like the three hours of

3278
02:22:53,239 --> 02:22:58,239
super hot weather you know maybe from

3279
02:22:55,239 --> 02:23:00,680
like 1 to 6:00 p.m. it's kind of just

3280
02:22:58,239 --> 02:23:02,680
like hanging in there but the rest the

3281
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:05,800
other 20 hours of the day it's Trucking

3282
02:23:02,680 --> 02:23:07,680
along and and and growing a lot but what

3283
02:23:05,799 --> 02:23:09,959
we do we we don't have like high-tech

3284
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:12,398
like bells and whistles climate control

3285
02:23:09,959 --> 02:23:14,719
green houses but we do have um you know

3286
02:23:12,398 --> 02:23:18,278
rollup sides and a lot of ventilation

3287
02:23:14,719 --> 02:23:21,438
and we've been bringing augs uh big fans

3288
02:23:18,279 --> 02:23:24,040
and shade cloth everything to

3289
02:23:21,439 --> 02:23:27,318
for those heat spells like anything

3290
02:23:24,040 --> 02:23:28,760
that's like you know three weeks or less

3291
02:23:27,318 --> 02:23:31,760
from from

3292
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:33,680
finishing um we definitely see that the

3293
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:36,159
um you know they'll kind of do like that

3294
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:39,359
starfishing and and the Le the leaves

3295
02:23:36,159 --> 02:23:42,760
will taco and the resin count is not as

3296
02:23:39,359 --> 02:23:45,359
good with that super heat so the shade

3297
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:48,040
cloth really you know we try to have a

3298
02:23:45,359 --> 02:23:50,720
lot enough sha cloth on hand so so that

3299
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:52,520
um that we can have you know sort of

3300
02:23:50,719 --> 02:23:54,519
beat the heat with all those houses and

3301
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:57,239
cool it down a good 15 20 degrees in the

3302
02:23:54,520 --> 02:23:58,960
house from outside but one Technique we

3303
02:23:57,239 --> 02:24:01,279
we do here that that works really good

3304
02:23:58,959 --> 02:24:04,079
because we have almost three and a half

3305
02:24:01,279 --> 02:24:06,399
acres in hoop houses between our ganja

3306
02:24:04,079 --> 02:24:07,879
and our vegetable crops and since you

3307
02:24:06,398 --> 02:24:10,159
only need that shade cloth for maybe

3308
02:24:07,879 --> 02:24:11,839
once or twice a year it's a pretty big

3309
02:24:10,159 --> 02:24:13,680
investment in more more materials and

3310
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:16,040
stuff uh one thing we like doing here we

3311
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:18,680
call it the poor man shade cloth where

3312
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:21,359
you get a heat spell and you know either

3313
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:24,520
your Tomatoes or your ganas like in that

3314
02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:27,040
in that crunch time where it's G to be

3315
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:29,319
suffering a bit um we just take buckets

3316
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:31,200
of mud and toss it over the green houses

3317
02:24:29,318 --> 02:24:32,600
and uh that works that works great it

3318
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:34,399
cools it down just the same as shade

3319
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:35,800
cloth and then you know some sometimes

3320
02:24:34,398 --> 02:24:38,199
we'll be lazy about it and let the rain

3321
02:24:35,799 --> 02:24:39,719
wash it off otherwise we'll uh we'll

3322
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:41,800
just you know get up on a tractor and

3323
02:24:39,719 --> 02:24:43,559
wash it off after the heat spell goes

3324
02:24:41,799 --> 02:24:45,920
through but you know between the

3325
02:24:43,559 --> 02:24:49,519
sidewalls and the end walls and fans and

3326
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:51,159
shade cloth um just just with a elbow

3327
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:53,120
grease you know that's kind of like our

3328
02:24:51,159 --> 02:24:54,398
our our low Tech climate control that

3329
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:59,120
really that really

3330
02:24:54,398 --> 02:25:04,239
helps what I used in the Netherlands was

3331
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:07,600
uh an organic uh white Co chalk like

3332
02:25:04,239 --> 02:25:10,239
material that you sprayed on the outside

3333
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:12,840
of the glass house because I I had a

3334
02:25:10,239 --> 02:25:16,959
greenhouse that was about 20 feet tall

3335
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:21,079
and it uh uh was about an acre under

3336
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:25,199
glass and uh every May

3337
02:25:21,079 --> 02:25:27,920
or early may I would spray it and uh it

3338
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:30,560
was the kind that after a couple of

3339
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:34,239
really good hard rains it would start to

3340
02:25:30,559 --> 02:25:39,278
wash off and so by the uh end of the

3341
02:25:34,239 --> 02:25:42,079
year it was uh pretty much gone and I'd

3342
02:25:39,279 --> 02:25:43,680
spray it every year and uh that would

3343
02:25:42,079 --> 02:25:46,600
knock the temperature internal

3344
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:49,720
temperature down at least 10 degrees and

3345
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:53,840
uh I I never saw any negative effects in

3346
02:25:49,719 --> 02:25:57,358
yield quality in fact uh I find Cannabis

3347
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:58,239
like all of you agree uh if it's grown

3348
02:25:57,359 --> 02:26:01,760
too

3349
02:25:58,239 --> 02:26:05,520
hot veg maybe it can take it but

3350
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:10,398
flowering it is not good for flowering

3351
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:13,000
cannabis excess heat Sam I have a

3352
02:26:10,398 --> 02:26:16,719
question then how the

3353
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:18,359
hell did that bubble that was made in

3354
02:26:16,719 --> 02:26:20,760
Jamaica back in the day when we were

3355
02:26:18,359 --> 02:26:23,600
there together that was just beautiful

3356
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:26,520
big clear domes remember the doctor he

3357
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:27,880
grew oh I remember dude how because I

3358
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:30,680
was always thinking about that I'm like

3359
02:26:27,879 --> 02:26:31,879
it was so insanely hot up on the top of

3360
02:26:30,680 --> 02:26:34,359
that little mountain where he was

3361
02:26:31,879 --> 02:26:36,599
growing that [ __ ] and it was like like

3362
02:26:34,359 --> 02:26:38,239
the sun it was just always like melting

3363
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:39,720
the resin glands off of it I just

3364
02:26:38,239 --> 02:26:41,719
thought I was like I don't know how you

3365
02:26:39,719 --> 02:26:44,959
could have like how the hell does he

3366
02:26:41,719 --> 02:26:47,639
have that many do everybody else hear

3367
02:26:44,959 --> 02:26:50,879
him I what's

3368
02:26:47,639 --> 02:26:53,478
that oh no I you broke up and the

3369
02:26:50,879 --> 02:26:55,039
connection went bad for a minute sorry

3370
02:26:53,478 --> 02:26:57,438
about that I just wondered how you could

3371
02:26:55,040 --> 02:27:00,479
grow such great Herb in Jamaica in the

3372
02:26:57,439 --> 02:27:03,600
in the insanely intense heat like

3373
02:27:00,478 --> 02:27:06,000
nonstop from morning noon till night and

3374
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:10,239
and produce well what what you're not

3375
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:14,799
comparing it to Marcus is what would the

3376
02:27:10,239 --> 02:27:18,559
same canvas have been grown if it was uh

3377
02:27:14,799 --> 02:27:22,119
10 degrees cooler like why I grew in why

3378
02:27:18,559 --> 02:27:25,159
I grew in Santa Cruz we always had ocean

3379
02:27:22,120 --> 02:27:28,160
fogs in the morning and stuff it it was

3380
02:27:25,159 --> 02:27:31,398
so much cooler than Central California

3381
02:27:28,159 --> 02:27:34,239
over the hills and and I tell you the

3382
02:27:31,398 --> 02:27:36,840
Cannabis liked it well here's what I'm

3383
02:27:34,239 --> 02:27:38,959
thinking though at that point in time I

3384
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:43,359
don't think I'd ever seen you smoke

3385
02:27:38,959 --> 02:27:46,478
anything from anyone ever you just only

3386
02:27:43,359 --> 02:27:48,559
smoked your own but you smoked that and

3387
02:27:46,478 --> 02:27:50,840
I thought wow this has to be really good

3388
02:27:48,559 --> 02:27:52,318
hash for him to be like I'm going to

3389
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:56,159
smoke

3390
02:27:52,318 --> 02:27:58,239
that it was great I was I was running

3391
02:27:56,159 --> 02:28:01,279
out of the house I had with

3392
02:27:58,239 --> 02:28:04,439
me it was still pretty big that ball was

3393
02:28:01,279 --> 02:28:07,960
still pretty big it was abolutely

3394
02:28:04,439 --> 02:28:10,398
excellent and we would probably had some

3395
02:28:07,959 --> 02:28:13,119
if not the best some of the best smoke

3396
02:28:10,398 --> 02:28:15,039
in Jamaica on the whole [ __ ] Island

3397
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:16,520
oh I would go without a shadow of a

3398
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:18,200
doubt and say that was accurate man

3399
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:20,720
because still to this day when I go back

3400
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:22,840
there and I make full melt bubble from

3401
02:28:20,719 --> 02:28:25,278
Jamaican cultivars and then I go around

3402
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:26,880
mostly to the Steamers you know I love

3403
02:28:25,279 --> 02:28:28,880

3481
02:31:40,318 --> 02:31:43,959
dark and there's lights in the

3482
02:31:42,079 --> 02:31:46,398
background from the stage and he's just

3483
02:31:43,959 --> 02:31:49,398

3492
02:32:08,478 --> 02:32:12,278
drummers are in the front with a bunch

3493
02:32:10,159 --> 02:32:16,680
of cannabis plants right all in the

3494
02:32:12,279 --> 02:32:18,239
front of the stage it was so good I just

3495
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:20,840
uh it was one of my all-time most

3496
02:32:18,239 --> 02:32:22,719
favorite moments in Jamaica was the F my

3497
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:24,760
favorite thing I've ever filmed on my

3498
02:32:22,719 --> 02:32:27,199
channel and it's got like two or three

3499
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:29,520
thousand hits like it's

3500
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:32,680
absolutely go hit that [ __ ] up and find

3501
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:32,680
it because it's worth checking

3502
02:32:32,920 --> 02:32:38,920
out big up kid is you know something I

3503
02:32:36,478 --> 02:32:41,039
wanted to add into about the uh you were

3504
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:43,079
talking about the uh the bubble hash and

3505
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:45,840
that heat you know or that that plant

3506
02:32:43,079 --> 02:32:47,680
growing in the heat up there I've grown

3507
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:49,880
you know a lot of years I went and grew

3508
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:52,120
in different climates in NorCal but I've

3509
02:32:49,879 --> 02:32:54,398
growing here my whole life in Hawaii as

3510
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:57,560
well and there's just something there's

3511
02:32:54,398 --> 02:33:00,478
something going on with with the the

3512
02:32:57,559 --> 02:33:02,478
equatorial region that you're growing in

3513
02:33:00,478 --> 02:33:04,719
and what I mean by that is you know

3514
02:33:02,478 --> 02:33:06,799
obviously the tropics and the dry desert

3515
02:33:04,719 --> 02:33:09,159
and all that or the northern climates or

3516
02:33:06,799 --> 02:33:11,199
whatever but there's something about the

3517
02:33:09,159 --> 02:33:13,799
that Tropic

3518
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:16,120
equatorial um it's something about the

3519
02:33:13,799 --> 02:33:17,840
way the sun shines the Angles and the

3520
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:20,359
degrees that you're getting and you're

3521
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:22,719
getting this you know it's you know the

3522
02:33:20,359 --> 02:33:25,040
diff obviously like uh like hemp guy was

3523
02:33:22,719 --> 02:33:27,039
talking about the the different you know

3524
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:29,080
turpine profiles of the tropics you're

3525
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:31,319
getting way more this fruity floral

3526
02:33:29,079 --> 02:33:34,318
thing going on and then you know in

3527
02:33:31,318 --> 02:33:36,359
those drier regions but anyway you know

3528
02:33:34,318 --> 02:33:39,199
I've just noticed that growing in Hawaii

3529
02:33:36,359 --> 02:33:40,920
in particular every every cult ofar that

3530

know and not to say anything's better or

3534
02:33:48,639 --> 02:33:51,959
worse than anything it's just a

3535
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:53,760
beautiful plant in general but something

3536
02:33:51,959 --> 02:33:55,759
about the tropics you know and that

3537
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:59,800
might be the answer to your question I

3538
02:33:55,760 --> 02:34:02,520
think Bubble Man word look at what I

3539

share a few minutes of that right now

3586
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:50,318
Jamaica is my all-time favorite place in

3587
02:36:48,159 --> 02:36:52,959
the whole world to travel and hopefully

3588
02:36:50,318 --> 02:36:54,719
when this whole covid-19 thing is up

3589
02:36:52,959 --> 02:36:57,719

3591
02:37:01,879 --> 02:37:08,759
Rock hey Josh hey Josh do healthy plants

3592
02:37:06,478 --> 02:37:12,760
get

3593
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:15,079
viruses you know it's really really hard

3594
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:17,840
for a healthy plant to get

3595
02:37:15,079 --> 02:37:20,920
viruses that's one thing I will say

3596
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:23,040
that's the truth right definitely

3597
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:26,120
definitely I think we should all take a

3598
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:28,560
lesson from the uh plant kingdom that's

3599
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:30,120
I just wanted to add that quick I think

3600
02:37:28,559 --> 02:37:31,519
that was one of the best things to add

3601
