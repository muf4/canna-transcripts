00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,640
Hey everybody, welcome to the Cannabis

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,879
Journal Club, where we review and

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,718
interpret United States cannabis patents

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,480
and scientific journals with concise

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,119
overviews of complex scientific

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,199
literature in an understandable and easy

7
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,278
to consume manner to expose the

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,760
knowledge hidden in the scientific

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:24,000
literature. We do not claim any medical

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,640
utility. We advise you to obtain your

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,839
own copies of these public documents and

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,679
share them with your doctors and family.

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,079
Welcome, Dr. Allen. What are we going to

14
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,759
talk about today?

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,160
We're gonna be we're going to be talking

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,320
about cannabis is a new classification

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,078
of antibiotic.

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,878
Oh, that sounds like a big one. That

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,878
sounds like a big one.

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,840
Yes. Well, this is Cannabis Journal Club

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,399
and I'm Dr. David Allen. I'm a retired

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,719
cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon and

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,558
I'm board certified in cardiac surgery

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,399
and general surgery and I'm self-taught

25
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,399
in the cannabis science the

26
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:09,920
endocanabonoid sigman system and today

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,478
we have a cannabis epiphany or a

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,079
cannabis

29
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:18,000
revelation that cannabis or

30
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:22,000
cannabonoids are a new class or

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
classification of antibiotics.

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,840
And

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,840
um the reason I say that is because

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:34,359
cannabis and cannabonoids kill bacteria

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,920
and viruses by really unknown

36
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:41,519
mechanisms. And

37
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,079
uh all antibiotics are classified by the

38
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,759
mechanism of action of how they kill

39
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:50,000
bacteria.

40
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:52,519
And they all kill bacteria by one

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
mechanism, not multiple

42
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:59,920
mechanisms. So for instance, penicellin

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,280
kills bacteria by disrupting the cell

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,920
wall integrity which protects the

45
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,598
bacteria and uh it allows the bacteria

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,000
to die because the cell wall is is not

47
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,159
protecting the bacteria. So there's

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,800
three main

49
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:20,159
mechanisms of uh

50
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:23,120
of uh bacteriaidal activity

51
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,959
uh and and the first one is disrupting

52
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,719
the cell wall membrane or cell

53
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:32,280
wall and the second one is uh disrupting

54
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,439
RNA

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,919
synthesis and the third major mechanism

56
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:42,159
is disrupting DNA synthesis of the

57
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:44,238
bacteria and so membrane dis membrane

58
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:49,280
disruption just to start with the number

59
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,959
one uh such as CBD and CBG are lipopilic

60
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,719
and they interact with bacteria cell

61
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,560
membranes. They actually insert into the

62
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,719
lipid billayer increasing membrane

63
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,158
permeability disrupting membrane

64
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:04,318
integrity and causing leakage of

65
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,318
cellular contents.

66
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,238
So this is exactly right. So can you

67
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,039
explain that a little bit to uh to the

68
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,039
to the viewers?

69
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:17,239
Well, uh, bacteria are really

70
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:19,000
batteries and they maintain themselves

71
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,840
by

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,479
moving positive and negative charges in

73
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:29,280
and out of the bacteria. And uh if you

74
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:32,318
disrupt this mechanism of maintaining

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,039
the the proper charges inside and

76
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:38,318
outside the bacteria, it causes the

77
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:42,318
bacteria to to absorb things it doesn't

78
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:44,598
want to absorb. So for instance, uh

79
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:47,919
maintaining cell wall integrity is

80
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:50,719
important to prevent the bacteria from

81
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:55,199
absorbing too much water.

82
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:58,919
So if you put a bacteria in a a plain

83
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:01,839
water with no salt in it, hypotonic

84
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:05,919
solution, what happens is the water will

85
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,959
go into the bacteria cell and cause the

86
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:12,479
back bacteria to explode because it has

87
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,560
too much water in it. And so maintaining

88
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,560
cell wall integrity is important for

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,639
bacterial survival because they're

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,839
really little batteries. And if you

91
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:26,160
discharge the battery then it kills the

92
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:30,679
the uh bacteria. And actually that's why

93
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:34,000
salt kills a lot of bacteria because it

94
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,959
disrupts this mechanism of maintaining

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,720
the proper

96
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:42,560
uh amount of water inside the bacterial

97
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,479
because all the mechanisms inside the

98
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,280
bacteria they need a certain

99
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:50,240
concentration of water and salt. And if

100
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,799
you disrupt that they don't work. So the

101
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,040
that by disrupting this mechanism you

102
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,960
disrupt all the cellular functions. And

103
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,600
this is particularly effective against

104
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,159
gram positive bacteria. Correct? As

105
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,560
their single uh their single layer uh

106
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,479
cell walls is more susceptible than the

107
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,720
double layered gram negative bacteria.

108
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:17,120
Is that true? I believe that is true. Um

109
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,440
the exact mechanism of why cannabonoids

110
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,160
kill bacteria is not fully delineated.

111
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,839
And apparently cannabonoids kill

112
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,720
bacteria by multiple mechanisms not just

113
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:31,359
a single mechanism like antibiotics. And

114
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,080
so that fact in itself

115
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,080
uh the fact that cannabonoids kill

116
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:36,599
bacteria by an

117
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,599
unrelated

118
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,800
mechanism to the other classes of of

119
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,600
bact bacteriacidal antibiotics

120
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,439
means that cannabis cannabonoids are a

121
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,680
new

122
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:53,519
classification of antibiotic. And so

123
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,079
this is what the drug war doesn't want

124
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:59,439
you to

125
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,439
know. Uh

126
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:07,199
that that this cannabis kills bacteria

127
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:10,239
by an unrelated mechanism of action uh

128
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,960
that kills bacteria. So this is exactly

129
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,199
like the discovery of of penicellin. Now

130
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,879
when they first discovered penicellin

131
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,478
they knew it killed bacteria but they

132
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,719
didn't know the mechanism of action and

133
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:27,120
they had to wait for science to catch up

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,400
to delineate that knowledge. But uh the

135
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,360
drug war doesn't want doctors and

136
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,478
scientists to to know this information

137
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,840
that it kills bacteria

138
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:44,079
uh by an unrelated mechanism of action

139
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:48,719
to the other classes of uh antibiotics.

140
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:50,560
So talk to your physician about this and

141
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,440
they will be look at you with a

142
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,319
surprised look on their face

143
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,800
uh that you know something that they

144
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,479
have not been taught in medical school

145
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,639
and interference with cellular

146
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,719
processes. Canab cannabonoids may

147
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,280
disrupt bacterial metabolism and

148
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,919
replication. For example, CBD has been

149
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:13,038
shown to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis

150
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:15,279
in some bacterial strains strains

151
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:18,318
impairing cell division and growth. They

152
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,079
can also affect elux pumps, reducing a

153
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,680
bacterium's ability to expel

154
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,279
antibiotics, thus enhancing antibiotic

155
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,918
efficacy.

156
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,559
That's exactly right.

157
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,598
That's incredible as well. These are

158
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,439
really mindblowing

159
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:37,279
statements and and obviously this isn't

160
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,038
I you know we're we're making it this

161
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,959
new discovery. People have obviously

162
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:44,240
known about this but just seem to want

163
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,159
to bury it and not expand upon it

164
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,519
because it would be it would seemingly

165
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,479
be so helpful in the medical field.

166
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,959
Well, if this was to be proven, and and

167
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:57,758
it will be proven at some point, it

168
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:01,560
would go against the control substance

169
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:05,160
act, which clearly states that there's

170
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,759
no medical utility for cannabonoids,

171
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,160
cannabis in the United States and not

172
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,639
safe under doctor supervision. So if you

173
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,280
were to prove that cannabis is a new

174
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,879
classification of

175
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:19,719
antibiotic, that would mean that the CSA

176
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,840
classification, schedule one

177
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,759
classification is a lie. It's

178
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:27,000
inappropriate to say cannabis has no

179
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,639
medical

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,599
utility. And so the drug war doesn't

181
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,599
want this knowledge out.

182
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,038
Makes sense. Makes sense. They never

183
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,000
have. They never have.

184
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:44,240
Very interesting. Um, so yeah, we've got

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,519
our key examples of CBD, highly

186
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,039
effective against uh the Oh jeez, I

187
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,039
couldn't even pronounce it pronounce it.

188
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,039
Stafalophocus

189
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:58,958
orius. Stafloccus orius. Stafloccus

190
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,919
orius. Right. Okay. And then CBG shows

191
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,479
potent activity against MRSA, which is

192
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,639
of course uh by targeting cytoplasmic

193
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,200
membranes and inhibiting cell division.

194
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,039
This is MRSA is one that really travels

195
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,278
around prisons, right? This is an

196
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,240
infection that that is popular in

197
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:19,519
prison. Methasylan resistant staff

198
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:24,799
arius. Yes. And it's resistant to a lot

199
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:27,839
of different antibiotics too. So

200
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:32,879
um very interesting. Now I also wrote an

201
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:37,600
article uh CBD in the treatment of Ebola

202
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:40,679
uh because uh it it's CBD is proven in

203
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:45,360
medical literature to stop cytoine

204
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:49,079
storm and subsequent disseminated

205
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,839
intravascular coagulation or DIC and

206
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,440
microvascular clotting. So, I wrote an

207
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,800
article

208
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:01,120
uh about

209
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:03,599
CBD in the treatment of Ebola and new

210
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,200
evidence has come out since this article

211
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:11,240
was printed. uh and un University of

212
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:15,519
Washington has proven that uh

213
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:18,278
CBD inhibits vir uh covid viral entry

214
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:22,078
into the cell because it

215
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:27,278
blocks what's called the AC2 receptors

216
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:32,639
acetal co-enzyme A receptors and the co

217
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:35,838
virus uses the AC A2 receptors to gain

218
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:40,000
entry into the Well, the Washington

219
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:44,680
study also proved that CBD decreases the

220
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,639
amount of viral protein production by

221
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:51,399
90%. So, the Washington study proves

222
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:55,360
that CBD is useful in

223
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:56,440
the prevention and the treatment of

224
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,320
Ebola

225
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:03,320
infections. And so

226
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:07,640
uh cannabonoids have a wide variety of

227
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:11,278
antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal

228
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:14,639
properties that have not been delineated

229
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:17,039
uh as yet. And since they don't teach

230
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,319
this in medical school,

231
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:23,439
uh it may be quite a while longer until

232
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,440
this evidence uh appears in the

233
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,440
literature.

234
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,519
But in the meantime, you can check out

235
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,078
Cannabis Journal Club with Dr. David

236
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,120
Allen and Bubbleman, and we will make

237
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:39,679
sure to bring this information to the

238
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,480
light every time.

239
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,319
