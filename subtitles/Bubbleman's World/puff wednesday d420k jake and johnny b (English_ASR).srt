beautiful

48
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:25,000

puff Wednesday be very very very very oh

53
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,640
oh oh oh no no no I was going to say be

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,200
very very careful when pulling out a tie

55
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,759
nail from someone's

56
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,238
bong particularly a mother ship now

57
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,560
people that own mother ships are very

58
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,800
particular because they spent the kind

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,360
of money on them and whatnot whenever

60
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,760
Flav or um even if Rose is is by I

61
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,159
always let them do it just cuz it's

62
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,199
theirs and it's such an easy thing to

63
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:59,519
chip this I guess it would even though I

64
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,280
took it out and made it seem pretty

65
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,680
loose and and got you so comfortable you

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,120
started pulling it out and I've been

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,760
playing with it it would be it would be

68
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,879
all of a minute later that you go to put

69
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:11,199
it down this is so strong titanium is

70
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,560
very hard very very hard and you just

71
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,919
have to tap the glass and you'll chip it

72
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,120
so we'll just keep it in

73
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,199
there I guess I got John a little

74
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,120
comfortable there being so loose with my

75
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,639
with my un I was comfortable he got he

76
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,599
got comfortable you know what but um

77
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,039
with glass might as well just yeah it

78
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:30,839
does and and what I've learned about

79
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:34,158
glass breaking is that uh it's best if

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,000
the owner breaks it in all my years of

81
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,639
owning glass I find that if the owner

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,438
breaks it that's your best case scenario

83
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,039
anyone else break it's like to break

84
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:43,959
glass because uh well you know what it's

85
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:47,280
like to have glass broken and my Prairie

86
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,799
cup got broken you know yeah took it to

87
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,239
the Prairie cup and it got knocked off a

88
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,879
table accident happen and it's being

89
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,759
fixed of course shine glass is fixing

90
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,798
her up and the problem with this a piece

91
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:58,479
like this is it's not really fixable

92
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,519
it's not fixable it's not really that

93
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,438
you could fix it you could just replace

94
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,959
the cost of it which is like who wants

95
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:06,840
to break someone's Mothership and then

96
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,519
uh this is an interesting topic what do

97
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,479
you guys think about smoking heady glass

98
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,438
with people um what happens if you break

99
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,199
their piece what if you chip their their

100
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:17,879
piece what if you do something that they

101
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,519
wouldn't have done and their piece gets

102
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,560
broken what is the responsibility I mean

103
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,439
you know if it's a $100 piece I I guess

104
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,360
we try to fix it maybe even if it's a

105
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:28,839
couple of hundred piece but do you do

106
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,560
you really replace like a $25,000 piece

107
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:33,478
if you break it

108
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,000
I think best not touch it otherwise well

109
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,399
we we we we are honored enough to be

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,240
sitting with people that we know that

111
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:43,918
let us puff on 3040 $50,000 bongs and

112
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,199
and around that it's like the bong's

113
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,599
handed I guess I take things for

114
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,478
Advantage when I'm sitting here with you

115
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,919
all the time cuz I'm always puffing on

116
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,959
this Mothership oh yeah well even the

117
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,478
way I did it if we watch the video the

118
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,478
way I did it so loose I bet you in the

119
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,519
video we could see you watching me do

120
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,800
that and have the realization I could do

121
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:03,279
that because it was less than 25 seconds

122
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,960
later you had this of course you were I

123
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,119
going to do a double you know what it's

124
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,959
a tough one not it's a tough one where

125
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,918
it's you know it's like especially with

126
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:15,359
a piece like this now Nate Dizzle gave

127
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:17,799
me this piece on a trip that him myself

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,199
uh Steve Hops and a few other people uh

129
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,400
were on this trip I met them in

130
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,000
Amsterdam at the airport I took them to

131
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:27,399
Amsterdam and drove them um to Germany

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
to the frankenthal uh the city of

133
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:30,679
frankenthal which is basically where the

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,038
rure factory is and they did

135
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,959
collaborations together Nate Dizzle gave

136
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,639
me this piece as a sort of thank you

137
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,680
yeah and and Nate does not like the

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,160
Rastafarian color scheme he it's a color

139
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,759
scheme he rarely ever does interesting

140
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,360
so it was kind of cool that he did it

141
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,720
for this particular

142
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,600
situation so it's definitely a nice

143
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,319
piece I remember when I was first

144
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,439
hitting it it's a nice one anyway we'd

145
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,840
love to hear about your comments uh and

146
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,399
what you guys think about glass and

147
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,159
sharing glass and what the etiquette is

148
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,638
what is the common knowledge etiquette

149
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,120
like for me the common knowledge is

150
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,680
simple if I break someone's piece I

151
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,478
replace it I either pay them the money

152
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,199
value or you know offering to fix the

153
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,680
piece nowadays isn't as big of a help as

154
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,680
you might think cuz the piece might hold

155
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,478
a particular value um that value will be

156
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,360
extremely affected if not completely

157
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:25,560
lost when someone else touches the piece

158
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,319
and fixes it especially if they fix it

159
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,360
um you know in a way that doesn't really

160
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,360
give Credence to the p P which I I've

161
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,000
seen on a few occasions pieces that were

162
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,720
fixed and I was just like o almost

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,639
shouldn't have fixed that well it's like

164
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,479
um I think etiquette would be if you

165
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,840
break a piece of glass if the owner of

166
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,279
the the guy that blew the glass can't

167
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:48,478
fix it well then I mean it should I

168
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,839
don't know if it would go on from

169
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,199
somebody else if that would be the

170
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,839
decision but I mean personally if if you

171
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,079
break a bong you got to be responsible

172
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,638
for that bom it's a tough one especially

173
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,199
when you're playing around with you know

174
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,560
it's a particular tough one when you

175
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,800
have a group of people it's almost like

176
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,519
a class like there's different classes

177
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,000
of people in the bong world there's

178
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,799
people that are puffing on $50,000 bongs

179
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,639
and then there's people that are

180
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,439
literally puffing on like broccoli pipes

181
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,079
that they made in their dorm room

182
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,959
awesome I support both of them but do

183
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:20,359
you give the guy with the broccoli pipe

184
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:23,198
a $50,000 piece to hit that's the

185
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,080
question I would Marcel did I know

186
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,360
others that do on a daily basis I know

187
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,120
others that don't I'd love to hear what

188
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,439
you guys have to think about that I'm

189
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,879
always happy to give people the benefit

190
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:33,918
of the doubt and pass a piece over

191
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,120
although I was very also eager to be

192
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,918
like even as I was pulling this out I

193
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,639
thought to myself John is going to do

194
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:44,038
this the minute you oh I knew it I knew

195
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,000
it and I I that's why I was like no no

196
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,878
no don't do that don't do that just such

197
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,879
a strong I can't wait to get the quartz

198
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,240
I have to admit I'm I'm done with the

199
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,960

201
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,000

222
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,399
there too I'll definitely take this by

223
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:48,559
all means dab it up on this beautiful

224
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,879
sunny day these are a few plants uh

225
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,639
congales that uh got a little too tall

226
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,278
uh were a little too hot in the tent

227
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,879
when I went to Jamaica those couple of

228
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:58,078
times I wasn't really able to care for

229
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,240
them so I pulled them out and put them

230
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:03,599
on my deck they're producing beautiful

231
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,879
resin and they've got about a 12 to 20

232
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,519
in nugget on each one of them a couple

233
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,559
of them so they should make a nice wash

234
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,000
I think that'll be a Congo run hey just

235
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:17,000
do the whole two Congo plants I I think

236
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,240
that's an amazing idea yeah I I I will

237
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,440
vote Yes vote Yes on that vote

238
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,959
Yes and in the meantime clean that

239
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,279
Dabber off well not quite see my

240
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:31,278
throat's a little agitated so I'm trying

241
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:33,838
not to cough because coughing is

242
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,320
do you watch our videos next video I'm

243
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,680
going to do is just going to be John's

244
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,040
coughing from all of our videos I'll do

245
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,159
like a a split a split of me

246
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,439
going we already did me dabbed out that

247
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:46,399
was awesome though like that that's a

248
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,240
good dab out session that was a good dab

249
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,839
you know what I mean jet leg and killer

250
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,959
hash yeah dabed me out it dabbed you out

251
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,959
it just that's what just happens it does

252
00:09:53,958 --> 00:10:00,799
we were busy we were running around it's

253
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:04,399
a high uh it's a it's a High um

254
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:07,719
bar to keep up with where it's just like

255
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:11,519
nonstop constantly from one place to the

256
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,519
next all right let's try that

257
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:18,518
out it's John not

258
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:22,039
coughing I'm

259
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:25,560
trying I got a little bit of an agitated

260
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:29,039
throat that was because I was testing 27

261
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,039
strains in a period of basically 48

262
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,519
hours

263
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:33,199
when we were at the Prairie Harvest cup

264
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,879
and how did you find the the strains for

265
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
the most part um you know what there's

266
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,600
some good strains there there's a lot of

267
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,120
stuff that should never been enter that

268
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,800
was not organic I think if you're

269
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,039
entering into a any kind of a cup if it

270
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:46,599
isn't organic why even bother to be

271
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,159
honest I mean the flavor is just you can

272
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,440
really taste it and stuff but I mean

273
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,399
everybody's got the good gardening

274
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,079
techniques and uh some uh just want to

275
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,399
enter into a cup and you it was very

276
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,879
very visual with some of the entries and

277
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,679
it was just like why they even enter

278
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,360
wouldn't it be nice if the Cannabis cups

279
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,199
were different in the sense that you

280
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,159
still got to inflate your own ego uh by

281
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,480
growing or processing the best hash or

282
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:12,600
herb by winning but the judges were

283
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,440
actually people who were sick using

284
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,320
cannabis medicinally and they were given

285
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,639
a 3 to 5 day period where you sent all

286
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,639
the samples to their homes and stuff and

287
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:25,680
you got real feedback real like sort of

288
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,159
what's the medicine true person feedback

289
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,559
that was that was telling you yeah like

290
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:31,078
oh I found that it would be it was be so

291
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,278
powerful to hear someone be like you

292
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:34,958
know I'm just looking to relieve my

293
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:37,278
glaucoma and that tasted like or it

294
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,799
worked great or it caused an appetite

295
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,120
stimulant or maybe there was chemicals

296
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,240
and they didn't like the harshness on

297
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,679
their throat like their voice would be

298
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,079
so much so much stronger and it would

299
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:50,759
make cups such a better thing if that

300
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:53,519
was the the outcome you could somehow

301
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,200
how do we do that I don't know but it

302
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,879
sure would be a cool thing I guarantee

303
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,278
you no one's thinking about doing it

304
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,759
that out of the 500 people that are

305
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:02,240
planning to do can

306
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,759
I I think the whole thing is is like

307
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,799
July 1st we always talk about as

308
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,000
cannabis day is it's all about medical

309
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,078
and if you were going to hold any kind

310
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,519
of cup I think it should be based around

311
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:12,000
medical and it should be based around

312
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:13,879
medicine and having medical patients

313
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,240
like you're talking about being able to

314
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,519
actually judge strains that work for

315
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,120
their condition and then that way we can

316
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,679
find out what trins are working for

317
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,399
different conditions at the same time I

318
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:25,319
don't the result would be more valuable

319
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,078
yeah you know when you actually finish

320
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,000
it with that information rather than the

321
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,638
results of oh the lemon OG Kush one so

322
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,440
we have to go buy Lemon ogi Kush seeds

323
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,240
and even in in chat yesterday I did a

324
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,440
chat and I you know some young guys from

325

absolutely honestly what the hell know

347
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,519
what you know what um what it was is for

348
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,199
the most part bags are going to make it

349
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,519
pure for you I don't maybe you weren't

350
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:34,240
drying it I don't know maybe you were

351
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,120
over mixing it cuz I'm telling you oh I

352
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,519
was 110% the old days everybody was

353
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,000
using beaters we were all getting all

354
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,519
our half inch drills with our big drill

355
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,278
bits in there mixing you grown different

356
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,720
pot no you didn't change the way you

357
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:51,000
grew pot not at all so that's powerful

358
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,839
to to see that you were like cuz really

359
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,919
that bubble was not like what I would

360
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,839
call what I talked to people about one

361
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:59,439
thing that I realized is is using an

362
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,759
eight bag system completely was the game

363
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,759
yeah that's a big one I mean that's a

364
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:06,680
big one the drying techniques not just

365
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,879
like chunks there's another big one um

366
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,838
properly freezing it right away or you

367
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,120
know there there's I like fresh frozen

368
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,560
that's the variable here is is

369
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,879
everything I make now is fresh frozen

370
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,559
whereas before I used to dry out the

371
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:25,198
herb used the Sugar Leaf right so it it

372
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:27,078
was just me not really I was I was using

373
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,519
the Sugar Leaf should still produce a

374
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:30,519
beautiful quality though you know what

375
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,159
it wasn't just it was yeah yeah the

376
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,000
variables that you were variables that

377
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,958
were there right I was trying to take

378
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,120
all my garbage to try and make something

379
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,319
amazing well you've got something

380
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,799
amazing now John I mean all your bubble

381
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,639
is a

382
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:46,639
nine out of 10

383
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,639
easy isn't it great that we it's just a

384
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,079
matter of variables you know like 120 I

385
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,360
kind of always thought that the real

386
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:59,439
hard part was growing the weed and it's

387
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,959
definitely the more variable

388
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,639
you know I I talk so much about how each

389
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:05,119
different Micron smells and the

kind of tell you about it in a minute

452
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,960
here but uh uh for those right away when

453
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:39,519
I mention this they're going to be like

454
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,720
whatever happened to your 2XL Dominator

455
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,519
bubble man what happened to your Lush

456
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,759
light my Lush light was in a tent uh

457
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,798
during the summer the this uh I wasn't

458
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,319
able to care for the tent I was away on

459
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:52,400
trips um my wife was very pregnant and

460
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,918
has other children and was you know busy

461
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,720
T trying to take care of that basically

462
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,320
uh they stretched out they didn't Bloom

463
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,319
when they were supposed to so I've taken

464
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,759
them all out of the the tent I've

465
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:02,759
cleaned the tent right up and I'm

466
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:05,679
waiting for the cooler weather and every

467
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,640
day just seems to be epically beautiful

468
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,960
so I'm hoping that sometime in October

469
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,200
I'll be able to light the tents back up

470
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,558
and that's when I'll get both my LED

471
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,080
lights going and uh at that point I'll

472
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,279
let John tell you a little bit about

473
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,639
this

474
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,839
particular LED light even though he is

475
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,280
taking a bong rib right now well this

476
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,119
particular LED light a for one it works

477
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:31,359
on

478
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:31,359
a 400 W power supply it's got drivers in

479
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:42,359
it it is um a complete Clos loop

480
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:46,120
system so this here which is so

481
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:48,119
cool so so cool I guess the best way we

482
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:49,918
can see you can see it's it's got a Clos

483
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,519
loose system here and it cools the whole

484
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,840
system two drivers on the top that work

485
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:58,158
into a 120 you just plug it right in and

486
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,079
um from what we read and what we've seen

487
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,120
it gives

488
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:06,240
um

489
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:07,879
basically the same power as the sun it's

490
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,640
all has to do with the deflection of the

491
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,280
LED lights yeah he was really he was

492
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,159
really I met the guy as well and he was

493
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,879
a he had a little light Monitor and he

494
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,039
was showing the numbers and basically

495
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,679
like testing the Sun and then testing

496
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:23,158
the light and uh you know it definitely

497
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,038
seemed that the numbers were as high I'm

498
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,280
not going to go out on a limb and say

499
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,200
that it was scientific fact but we well

500
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,319
you know what we we were you're looking

501
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,120
at I like to try it so Johnny brought me

502
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,319
one over and I'll definitely figure out

503
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,959
a way to get this into my tent maybe

504
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:38,798
I'll have to grow some real little uh

505
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,720
tiny little plants maybe I'll do a

506
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,960
little see of green over this LED light

507
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,679
or something so it uh shows more lumens

508
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,519
than uh th000 Watt and it uh shows it's

509
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,720
brighter than the sun got to wear some

510

607
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,599
the salmon house on the hill it's one of

608
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,000
my favorite restaurants in all of

609
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,480
British Columbia never been excited it's

610
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,599
absolutely spectacular the chef is on

611
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,558
point and the food is always really

612
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:03,359
delicious and the view is uh you know

613
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,399
all basically Vancouver I was going to

614
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,278
say you're talking about something so

615
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,960
delicious was that Ninja dab oh yeah in

616
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:13,400
that ninja dab was an amazing I feel

617
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,240
like you need to be nin dab that flavor

618
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,440
alth I hit it out of the mothership I'm

619
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,960
going to transfer over transfer over so

620
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,440
yeah was about the flavor you talk about

621
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,240
the foods sorry I interrupted you but no

622
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,880
problem BR when you get a flavor of that

623
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,960
type of hash with that type of has I'm

624
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,080
going to do a quick clean in this

625
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,960
because that

626
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,960
reclaim comes off instantly look at that

627
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,240
oh nice when it's

628
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,519
fresh and it's I could see that it was

629
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,919
fresh freshly dripping down the pipe

630
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,398
I'll maybe just give this one a real

631
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,278
quick clean

632
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:47,798
too always keep your tools clean I think

633
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:49,398
you recently were talking about that yes

634
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:50,839
we were talking about it it's hard to

635
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:52,278
keep them clean all the time I like

636
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:54,599
that's kind of why I did the grung off

637
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:56,240
video I got a bunch of haters on it oh

638
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:57,599
that's the worst advertising I've ever

639
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,798
seen I was like I wasn't trying to

640
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,519
advertise I was just showing you how to

641
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,398
clean my bong and I'm not like trying to

642
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:04,759
clean it so it's Gallery

643
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:06,918
clean but oh I think I think what some

644
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:09,720
people should really realize is is the

645
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:11,200
reason why we do and post things that we

646
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,919
like it's because it's what we like

647
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,720
we're not advertising it's stuff that we

648

with the ganja plant itself illegal

707
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,879
without exception and therefore do not

708
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,960
allow locally grown cannabis plants to

709
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,360

793
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:14,119

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,880
to have a dab out in front of the Salmon

795

House I also of course brought the pure

796
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,679
hash joint at any point in time I

797
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:23,960
figured uh you know we might all

798
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,399
probably right after our meal I think we

799
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,519
should stand on top of that can no it'll

800
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,798
be right out in front on their deck

801
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:33,399
of our table oh we have a deck table

802
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,240
outside no we have a table inside and

803
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:37,518
then there's a deck outside so you go

804
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,480
from your table inside outside to the

805
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,679
deck and that's where we'll have uh

806
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,278
going to be that's where we'll have our

807
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,679
puff all right so this is probably

808
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:47,119
bigger than it needs to be but that's

809
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,840
how I'm feeling right now I need a

810
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:53,038

etiquette of smoking out of expensive

1119
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,440
bongs and potentially breaking a bong

1120
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,358
this is a new type of etiquette the

1121
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,280
etiquette of Turning People onto dabs

1122
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:57,000
without destroying them if you want to

1123
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,640
turn someone on in a way that's you know

1124
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,239
it's reasonable and within their range

1125
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,440
of being able to

1126
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:06,159
