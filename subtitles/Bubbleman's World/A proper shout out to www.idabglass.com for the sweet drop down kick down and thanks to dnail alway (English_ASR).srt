00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,840
carbide nail Flav told me it wasn't

17
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,399
really a good idea that I was going

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,200
directly into it so I really needed to

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,920
get on this drop down game this is my

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,600
first drop down so I really want to

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,359
thank you guys the silicon carbide nail

22
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:14,559
is going in I want to thank the guys at

23
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,200
denail for setting this up because I

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,359
don't know the guys at ID daab it was

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,600
Brian and Stevie who sort of put the

26
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,200
word out for me and let them know that I

27
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:25,118
was looking for a nice drop down for my

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,000
fab EG and uh well that's just a real

29
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,478
nice drop down I got to say what do you

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,959
guys think look pretty good make you

31
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,078
guys feel a little bit better now that

32
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:38,319
the uh the titanium is not directly in

33
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:41,118
my joint of the Fab EG so I've got it

34
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,758
turning on heating up as we

35
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,280
speak

36
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:49,560
so I think we'll

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,079
go with the last of Johnny

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,320
bees

39
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:56,239
Jamaican gave him the Lamb's bread my

40
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:58,559
seedling from 19 and A2 years ago 1995

41
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,359
when I was married in Negril I collected

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,560
some seeds on Orange Hill Hill uh up

43
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,840
past the cliffs in the grill there and

44
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,800
uh I brought those Seeds home I kept

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,080
those seeds up until May of 2014 in

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,560
which I cracked eight of them but only

47
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,800
one actually cracked seven passed away

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,479
one became the female that I am now

49
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,719
about to smoke out of this lovely drop

50
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,119

51
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,400

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,640

friends to make all this work and uh

54
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,598

from denil were were 20 years ago you

58
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,360
know they were probably playing around

59
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,878
in a playground somewhere maybe even

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,560
still still in diapers I don't know

61
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,079

62
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,479
they're just in their 20s still but

63
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,760
awesome that you guys could come this

64
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,840
full circle around to this Lamb's breed

65
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,560

700 got it set uh today to about 710

71
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,640
people ask me all the time why I have

72
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:13,239
different settings sometimes it's how I

73
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,359
feel sometimes it's my hash some hash I

74
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,640
prefer a lower temp some hash I prefer a

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,159
higher temp sometimes the wax membrane

76
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,518
is a little bit thicker in which case we

77
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,079
uh you know we don't mind a little bit

78
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,959
of a warmer temperature to get that that

79
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,480
oil boiling out of there oh the piece

80
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,640

00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:02,639
sorry that works with the carbide nail

92
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:07,840
so the silicon carbide bowl is enormous

93
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:11,199

that the ID dab carb cap and it actually

97
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:32,079
is big enough to work on the Cary nail

98
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,120
and it comes with a Dabber as well I've

99
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,719
got the dry sift sitting here on the uh

100
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,680
Skillet tool so I'm going to use that

101
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,080
but we'll transfer over to the carb cap

102
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,079
when we're done the

103
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,839

104
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,840

incredible man 710 de Fahrenheit on the

106
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,759
silicon carbide nail it's doing a light

107
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,199
smoke it's very very tppy that was an a

wonderful turp rip like I said with the

109
