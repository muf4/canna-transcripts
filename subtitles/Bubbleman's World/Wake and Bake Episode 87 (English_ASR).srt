seeing the photo the avatar that I

00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,820
changed yesterday in the YouTube page

12
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,219
hey you guys want to have a little bit

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,439
of a nerve-wracking sickening moment

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,448
with me

15
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:41,820
yesterday not long after the amazing

16
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:44,878
all-woman hashed Church panel I went to

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,600
go onto my youtube channel and it was

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,368
gone it just said err you can't access

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,838
this account and I started going into my

20
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:53,250
phone and I went into my computer and I

21
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:56,070
went in on my other computer and it just

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,768
it wasn't really working it was kind of

23
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,018
working like I could I could go into a

24
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:02,698
page that had YouTube opened already and

25
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:07,069
I could push play on the video and it

26
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:08,730
would play no problem but I'll tell you

27
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:10,559
nerve-racking happened again this

28
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,820
morning I did a little Google and found

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,670
out that YouTube's having a little bit

30
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:17,399
of problems I can't tell you how sick I

31
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,260
felt of the idea of losing my channel of

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,380
losing my ability to come and hang out

33
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,710
with you guys every morning of losing

34
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:28,500
that all-female hash hash Church panel I

35
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:31,169
was sick to my stomach I'm not gonna lie

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,310
thank God I googled quickly and found

37
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,710
out YouTube is indeed [ __ ] it was a

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,079
little scary I'm not gonna lie

39
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:44,250
so we got 107 people watching 113

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,658
whatever it jumps it drops 908 we've

41
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,319
been live for a couple of minutes and

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,000
yeah just you should download an archive

43
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,859
of all your videos well Brett Armstrong

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,409
most of my videos are archived because

45
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:57,090
I've produced them by editing them and I

46
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,240
have all the raw footage the edited

47
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:03,299
footage etc however wake-and-bake

48
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,669
episodes and anything that I do live

49
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,729
like hash Church those need to be saved

50
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,318
so I'm going to be doing some saving I

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,100
would also ask you the public if you

52
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,129
have your favorite

53
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,019
so go and rip it off with YouTube it

54
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:17,609
would be appreciative because if we lose

55
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,680
all these hash churches wouldn't it be

56
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,230
nice to have someone say I have them

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,210
bubble man now I've got some time and

58
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,479
I'm gonna try and rip as many as I can I

59
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,320
think I have the first 30 or 36 or so

60
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:32,189
but I need to rip the rest

61
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,310
excellent chase that's what I like to

62
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:37,829
hear well good good yeah this is a

63
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,360
classic dude this is the only Barcelona

64
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,820
legends of course I got sick to my

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,400
stomach and couldn't be there I showed

66
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:46,859
up and yea jebediah Haney we know it

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,260
dude the the hash Church episode

68
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,750
yesterday was one of the best a stretch

69
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:55,199
oh so it's whatever those women did a

70
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,139
stand-up job they crushed the men in my

71
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,969
opinion not in regards to their

72
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,439
knowledge and their information but how

73
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:03,560
they went about sharing it how

74
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,530
compassionate they were to one another

75
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,719
how they allowed each other to talk

76
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,250
what's up bee Beecher I just thought it

77
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,020
was [ __ ] great I loved everything

78
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,259
about it I learned from it and I'm going

79
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,320
to step up my game I'm not going to

80
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:21,419
allow these strong male personalities to

81
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,039
walk all over hash Church anymore and

82
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,839
it's you know what I don't want to

83
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,459
offend people and I know the minute I

84
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,110
start giving people a little kind of

85
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,450
like hey you know like it's not cool to

86
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,340
tell everyone we owe you it's not really

87
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:33,899
cool to tell everyone that you you know

88
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,670
like just the little things that some of

89
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,530
the panel members have done over the

90
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:40,769
years I just want it to be

91
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,240
I don't think piranhas is available in

92
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,280
Denver I just want it to be a good show

93
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,110
I want everyone to be get the exposure

94
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,680
that they require at the same time I

95
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:52,290
don't want it to turn into just about

96
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,849
that person and so I'm having a little

97
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:55,769
bit of problems with a few people who

98
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:59,639
seemingly can't talk about anything

99
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:01,740
other than themselves and I get that I

100
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,719
understand how most of us are talking

101
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,180
about ourselves a lot of the times but

102
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,979
you know try to step out sometimes try

103
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,569
to have empathy for the person talking

104
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,579
and put yourself in their shoes and

105
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:14,189
listen to them rather than to try and

106
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,199
you know get something up off of your

107
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:18,779
you know like crush the person but I

108
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,629
just want to see some of our more mature

109
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,489
members you know be as kind and

110
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,219
compassionate as the ladies were because

111
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,340
my god they

112
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,600
classy I was a class act now some of the

113
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:32,089
stuff that was being in chat was

114
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,000
unfortunate was being said in chat it is

115
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:38,569
weird how guys just can't seem to deal

116
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,899
with powerful beautiful articulate women

117
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:43,819
and there was a small a few guys that

118
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:46,370
just couldn't do it they just had to say

119
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:48,110
stupid [ __ ] they just had to say you

120
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,879
know things that were coming from their

121
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,370
insecurities and I saw a little bit of

122
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,959
that light you know I I let Sal go on

123
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,879
one that definitely hurt one of the

124
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,279
panelists feelings when he said

125
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,319
something you know that was it was

126
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,149
hurtful and it made this girl feel

127
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,490
really bad and it was probably because

128
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:06,049
he's insecure and upset and maybe he's

129
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,509
older I don't know and I have nothing

130
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,639
against you salad you were by no means

131
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:12,980
the worst ones because I let you go with

132
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,750
it but some people got banned so I dude

133
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,129
come on we have some ladies these are

134
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,930
our mothers and our sisters and our

135
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:21,529
grandmothers how are you around those

136
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,910
women are you not if it's off-topic and

137
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,709
doesn't interest you then a split

138
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,750
tastebuds you don't need to say negative

139
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:27,109
[ __ ] I don't think it was off-topic at

140
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,970
all

141
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,250
I think they stayed on topic the entire

142
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,770
time and talked about cannabis which is

143
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,410
what hashed Church is about yeah I mean

144
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:40,370
it's sad to see super sad to see these

145
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,920
sort of sexual insecurities or

146
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,259
intimidations they did a great job I

147
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,879
just want to thank them from for coming

148
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:50,870
out and I'm gonna definitely have many

149
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,519
of those ladies on again no of course

150
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,410
not

151
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,120
well that's not your taste bud 420 some

152
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,740
of those women do make cash in fact I've

153
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,649
made hash with some of those women so

154
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,300
imagine how wrong you are and it's not

155
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:04,279
about making hash some of those people

156
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,750
are helping people palliative Lee died

157
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:07,309
the end of their lives some of those

158
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,829
people are teaching people about

159
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,649
cannabis that are elderly and in old age

160
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:14,719
I mean in my opinion it was [ __ ]

161
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:16,189
awesome I'm surprised you're here

162
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,830
actually defending that it wasn't

163
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:20,870
awesome like honestly it was great I

164
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:22,849
thought it was really top-notch and

165
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,420
hashed Church is not all about making

166
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:29,540
hash it's just not you know and those

167
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:32,000
were women not girls you know there's a

168
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,150
different girls and boys are children

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,769
men and women are adults

170
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:40,250
yeah Hillary Blackson absolutely

171
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:43,609
legend 100% she's awesome person she's

172
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,620
one of my best friends and I don't think

173
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,759
girls hate salad all I think Sal just

174
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,620
got a little uncomfortable and that's

175
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,810
okay it doesn't mean we have to now bash

176
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,180
on Sal this is the mentality of a chat

177
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,860
room and I'll tell you what you guys are

178
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,418
an incredible chat room because I've

179
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,069
gone around lately and I looked at some

180
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:59,649
of these YouTube live videos that are

181
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:02,810
out there the may weather the mechanic

182
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:05,029
Conor McGregor holy Christ was that

183
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,038
negative then I found live Simpsons and

184
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:08,779
family guys if you want to see the worst

185
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,629
YouTube comments you could ever possibly

186
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:14,029
imagine go look up a live Simpsons or a

187
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:15,740
live Family Guy and watch like 10

188
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:18,228
minutes of the chatroom it made me feel

189
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,579
sick to my stomach I felt sad for these

190
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:21,859
people that they were creating this

191
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:24,318
energy amongst themselves just getting

192
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,759
it you are a very [ __ ] cool chatroom

193
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,319
Nine Inch colas and we owe it to

194
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,479
ourselves because we want to hang out

195
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,250
with cool people we don't want to wake

196
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:33,610
up and piss each other off and fight

197
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:37,370
with one another and that's why Sal

198
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,840
today you are the winner my friend you

199

00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:44,300

202
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,900
bitching about you no I'm not I'm just

203
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,699
trying you were used as an it as an

204
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:53,269
example of what was going on yesterday

205
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:55,968
so if you will allow me to sell I would

206
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:58,848
love to send you a t-shirt today I've

207
00:07:55,968 --> 00:08:02,990
got small I've got large I've got double

208
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:04,879
extra-large and I like you Sal I've seen

209
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,918
you say a lot of cool things in the room

210
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,509
and I definitely don't want you to leave

211
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:10,939
the room or not be a part of our group

212
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:13,129
because we enjoy what you have to offer

213
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:14,658
and what you share I just it was

214
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:16,459
unfortunate that one of the things you

215
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:18,110
said yesterday really pissed off my good

216
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:20,269
friend and made her feel bad about

217
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,400
herself you know we don't want to we

218
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:24,198
don't wanna make people feel bad I don't

219
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,579
know if I have the extra-large Sal I

220
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,770
think I might have taken the extra-large

221
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:29,028
everyone's an extra large I got three

222
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:32,208
times extra-large

223
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:34,129
I got small I got three times

224
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:36,259
extra-large and large the only other

225
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:39,500
option Sal is that I could send you a

226
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:41,718
pin would you rather have a pin I could

227
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,700
send you a nice karma Cup pin I could

228
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,129
send you one that says are you elite or

229
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,879
I could send you one that says karma cop

230
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:51,179
but I don't have your size

231
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,830
shirt and I feel bad about that yes he

232
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:55,229
says he's an extra-large but I only have

233
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,690
large and three times extra-large three

234
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,659
times is really big but I guess you

235
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,490
could always shrink it what we got here

236
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:04,589
Sal is this like the biggest shirt ever

237
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:08,730

240
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,610

247
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,610
don't be so sorry dude don't worry about

248
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:37,439
it at all it's it's all good we just

249
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,700
gotta sometimes realize that little

250
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,660
things that we might punch into the

251
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,190
screen can actually feel make people

252
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:46,469
feel terrible about themselves and I

253
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,940
know your imprint your your your vision

254
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,110
isn't to come into the chat room and

255
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,880
make someone feel bad about themselves

256
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,980
and sometimes we might not understand

257
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,080
when we're when we're speaking from our

258
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,490
insecurities and not our heart that the

259
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,990
same way when we speak from our heart

260
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,700
and we can touch someone and they can be

261
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,919
humbled by it they can be you know

262
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,390
really appreciate the empathy it's quite

263
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,919
the opposite when we come from our

264
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:07,230
insecurities when we shoot something out

265
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,879
it's like a dagger or like a razor blade

266
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,620
all of a sudden my friends bleeding on

267
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:15,269
our arm holding yourself in the corner

268
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,519
saying I felt bad I'm just saying so

269
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:19,529
let's try to keep it positive let's try

270
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,169
to keep each other positive and if

271
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:24,449
someone's negative I think it's okay for

272
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:26,789
us to turn it around and go into it and

273
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,590
discuss it now if someone's a troll and

274
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:32,849
their hole means and impression is to

275
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:34,530
just come here and hijack the the

276
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,600
conversation than to try and hijack it

277
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:39,149
into a more negative than the banhammer

278
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,409
is like in full effect

279
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:42,929
we just get rid of those people we don't

280
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:44,549
need them so what do we got nine

281
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:46,289
seventeen and only one hundred and

282
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:47,639
forty-seven viewers in the room what's

283
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:49,589
going on we usually have a couple of

284
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:53,549
hundred by now kind of surprised

285
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:57,960
actually I guess it's time for a little

286
00:10:53,549 --> 00:11:00,088
Viking back east yeah you know what Sal

287
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,620
didn't even say the worst thing okay all

288
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:03,390
he said was

289
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,210
that he was happy that someone else was

290
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:08,370
gonna talk that does that that talks

291
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,620
about something other than sex and my

292
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,089
friend who brought up sex well it was

293
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,169
hard for her to bring that up she felt

294
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,360
like she was really kind of putting

295
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:16,889
herself out there so you know when we

296
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,350
put ourselves out there we don't want to

297
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:21,960
get we don't want to get smacked nobody

298
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:25,019

promote your products and you want to

327
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:57,389
promote yourself and you want everyone

328
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,870
to answer you're getting a million

329
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:01,679
people asking you questions go do it in

330
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,450
another room

331
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,359
give them your emails it's not cool to

332
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,959
take up the hash search room for your

333
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,959
personal sales

334
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:13,569
I've been so uncomfortable

335
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:14,939
telling the people that are doing things

336
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,970
that I don't like cuz I don't want to

337
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:21,760
step on anyone's toes the gloves are off

338
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:27,360
I'm coming hard everyone needs to step

339
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:27,360
the [ __ ] up or a goon no it's Oregon I

340
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:37,980
love the Sapphire no it cannot handle

341
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,750
any quick temperature change like that

342
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,750
Selena was wonderful great job very

343
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:48,669
empathetic and compassionate girl doing

344
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:51,700
a good job out there in the Okanagan all

345
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:55,329
of them really all of them really were

346
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,820
amazing some I didn't even know I liked

347
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,080
Rosie I thought she was cool she had

348
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:03,330
great information she was really

349
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:09,190
articulate no I just dabbed on some

350
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:12,850
God's green crack - a turf dip which is

351
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,170
crazy because I have many Terps that I

352
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:18,540
went and picked up the other day I went

353
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:21,549
and picked up typical dello Sour Diesel

354
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:24,969
picked up some Clementine from Blue

355
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:27,458
River and then I also picked up the

356
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:31,509
lemon tree my last vial of lemon tree

357
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:33,669
and I picked up some sour tangi because

358
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:39,789
they [ __ ] love sour - Angie why

359
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:42,278
wouldn't I very nice well there you go

360
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:44,620
foxy she's a very very nice person like

361
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:47,620
very her and Hillary are kind of on par

362
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:51,159
for just how kind and considerate they

363
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,500
are in this scene we're gonna do it

364
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:55,899
again mmm

365
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,028
great welcome back Mike Hendricks we're

366
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:59,740
just talking a little bit about all the

367
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:01,750
Terps on the guard green crack well you

368
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,639
know Green crack is a pretty classic God

369
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,708
is very unique I would like to get the

370
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:09,429
terpene profile for God bud because it

371
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:12,819
has this soapy strange terpene mix I get

372
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:16,088
the tiniest little bit about it but mmm

373
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:19,870
but not quite what you get from just

374
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:21,139
straight God also I'm you know I'm a

375
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,328
bigger fan of

376
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:25,399
exotic narrowly drug cultivar terpene

377
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:28,578
profiles so those are the ones I prefer

378
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:31,639
the most what do I think about back to

379
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:33,318
the future I liked it it was a great

380
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,669
movie all three of them you know if you

381
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:36,588
grew up in the 80s you were [ __ ]

382
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:38,269
loved in that [ __ ] even watching them

383
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:46,100
recently with my kids was kind of

384
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:52,188
enjoyable what are you gonna say nice

385
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:53,629
emcee oh yeah exactly you don't want to

386
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:54,948
be smelling your blue river and when you

387
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:58,100
get it in the mail I'll tell you one

388
00:15:54,948 --> 00:16:02,448
time Tony sent me some it was a 4 point

389
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:05,509
5 ml vial which is a large bottle I

390
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:09,798
don't have one just to show you but well

391
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:12,428
actually yeah no no there we go so it

392
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:14,989
was one of these full of terpenes and

393
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:18,409
it's luckily we use these pouches that

394
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:21,470
we use because they're sealed inside ok

395
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:23,418
and so one of them came broken smashed

396
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,970
into a million pieces so the terpenes

397
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:28,338
were just liquid in the package so I I

398
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,899
opened the package I poured the terpenes

399
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:33,559
out into the fresh thing and I lost

400
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:35,600
maybe three drops so that was pretty

401
00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:38,778
pretty incredible cannabis specialist

402
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,239
yes month I don't think I will be

403
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:42,798
bringing any bubble man brand Mike Quinn

404
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:44,269
but I will be bringing blue river

405
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:46,759
terpenes so if you want to get your

406
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,828
terpenes on I should by then have the

407
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,379
new Jamaican cultivars that are coming

408
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:53,748
we've produced 400 MLS if you can

409
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:57,350
imagine that's a lot of terpenes like a

410
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:59,239
big friggin jar and we're going to be

411
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,759
releasing those in the near future on

412
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:03,259
blue river Canada's website so all you

413
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,990
Canadians that want to try out the

414
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:07,909
Jamaican terpenes they're coming your

415
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,288
way soon I've pretty much sold out of

416
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:12,500
the other Jamaican terpenes I have a

417
00:17:09,288 --> 00:17:13,669
little bit left but I'm down for a rip

418
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,888
for those of you that are gonna buy

419
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:18,679
Europeans use the code Blue River all

420
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:22,219
lowercase two zero one seven Blue River

421
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:26,240
2017 that's gonna give you 30% off of

422
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:30,839
your order and trust me it will be

423
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,599
appreciated because Eastern cheap

424
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,470
and the Karma cup actually seeing is

425
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,319
that we're speaking it

426
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,150
they have till the 28th that's 11 more

427
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:42,089
days if you're entering if you are

428
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:45,419
entering the karma cup please get them

429
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:48,389
the entries to them on time before the

430
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:50,610
28th of this month and if you're

431
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,640
entering a solvent list product add rice

432
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:55,949
after a bubble hash or even a rosin I

433
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,340
will look forward to smoking your

434
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:01,740
product because I'm pretty sure I get to

435
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:04,139
be like a celebrity judge or a special

436
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,730
guest judge so I don't know what they

437
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,230
call it maybe it's just a judge maybe

438
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,750
I'm putting myself higher than I really

439
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,519
belong I get to be a judge so what I'm

440
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,009
asking you is for any of you out there

441
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,808
that want to take I would love to see

442
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,669

444
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:22,020

445
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,359

446
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,460
solvent list and if you don't enter come

447

448
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:33,929
the ship as I get back a pot in the

449
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:37,048
sorry Jeff I free getting phone calls

450
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:39,990
getting my mothership whip caught in the

451
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:41,609
drawer I'll have to call I free back

452
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,169
that's a good brother for mine that I

453
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:45,449
met in Jamaica he's actually my friend

454
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:49,799
that introduced me to Kidd his I so mad

455
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:52,830
props this this rip is for Jeff I posted

456
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:54,778
recently a post on Facebook about how

457
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:56,819
the energy of Rastafari has brought the

458
00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:58,859
most incredible amazing people and I

459
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:01,019
felt bad that I didn't have a good photo

460
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:02,819
of Jeff to post because he's definitely

461
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:05,308
one of the influences in my life meeting

462
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:07,710
me in Kingston introducing me to kidís

463
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:10,109
and while I'll tell you

464
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,298
yeah and Mark is kind of correct and and

465
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:14,129
um I - sure in a sense except that once

466
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:16,230
you get the terpenes extracted the way

467
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,730
we do it there's zero footprint left and

468
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,259
there's no way of actually proving that

469
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,808
it comes from cannabis it's just a

470
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:23,730
profile that has zero cannabinoids it's

471
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:26,369
only legal product so we've had ours

472
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:30,120
tested at a few different borders by a

473
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:32,158
few different law enforcement facilities

474
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,869
and they don't come up with any

475
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:36,330
cannabinoids there's is literally no

476
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:37,979
footprint sharing that this is a

477
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:41,158
cannabis product other than the fact

478
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,870
that and in the gray area is that we're

479
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:44,350
allowed to do the extraction because we

480
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:46,359
have licensing and permits to

481
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:49,418
do that so we create a product that's

482
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:51,909
almost like this leftover product that

483
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:54,009
is no longer illegal because there's no

484
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,250
way on proving that it came from

485
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:58,808
cannabis so that's it good sir here in

486
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,819
Canada it's a little different federally

487
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:04,899

reciprocal countries want to get my

503
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,889
permit in Jamaica as a patient I should

504

be able to go back and forth from

505
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,059
Jamaica with product but these are these

506
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:07,779
are things that are happening here in

507
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:12,178
the near future reciprocity is not going

508
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:12,178
to happen overnight right now no boat

509
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,769
I'm still working on it mine's inclined

510
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,928
been talking to a few different

511
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:24,668
companies been talking to Brian from

512
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:27,429
Vitol been talking forever flower in

513
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:31,990
greenhouses even had a conversation with

514
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:34,919
reefer man who apparently has quite a

515
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,919
bit of greenhouse knowledge

516
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:45,849
well those Japanese pieces are

517
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:48,280
next-level dude I mean come on they are

518
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:48,879
completely next level nobody's doing

519
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:51,399
[ __ ] like that

520
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,890
those guys are literally from another

521
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,950
planet and if you really look at what

522
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:59,200
they're doing they're deep they're

523
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,058
they're using detail like the same thing

524
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,549
that I became well-known for which was

525
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:05,619
becoming OCD about hash isolation and

526
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:07,808
isolating it to the absolute cleanest

527
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:09,639
that you could photographing skunk man

528
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:11,529
sans isolations and showing them to

529
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,780
people and having them be like jaw on

530
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:15,460
the floor I really feel like these

531
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:17,710
Japanese guys have done the same thing

532
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,329
with glass they've just taken this thing

533
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,670
that's existed for a while but people

534
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:23,439
have been doing incredible work but then

535
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,259
they purified it they got it so

536
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,039
concentrated and so small and so macro

537
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:30,759
that it's just you can't [ __ ] believe

538
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:34,240
it

539
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:36,579
oh I didn't scoop that piece Samuel that

540
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,529
piece will be like $100,000 I am a

541
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:40,808
photographer who gets to shoot a lot of

542
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:43,470
glass if I scoop that piece I'd be

543
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:45,789
puffing it all day long now this piece I

544
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,279
absolutely scooped give thanks to Corey

545
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:50,920
for the custom mug for bubble man

546
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:52,359
[ __ ] love this thing I can't show you

547
00:22:50,920 --> 00:23:00,160
too much of the bottom otherwise I'll

548
00:22:52,359 --> 00:23:04,379
spill my water all over the place that's

549
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:07,630
good yes I do shots I'm gonna have both

550
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,520
occasions are true artisans well I mean

551
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,530
I don't like sure that's a pretty huge

552
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,990
generalization that's a large group of

553
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:16,779
people that's a big chunk of the world

554
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:19,720
but some Asian people are absolutely

555
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:22,049
incredible artisans those Japanese guys

556
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,750
from Team Japan Yoshi

557
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:27,879
genichi and they suck those guys are

558
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,700
absolutely incredible

559
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,080
artists I was and dosa to [ __ ] humbled

560
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:38,019
to be in their presence while they're

561
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:43,439
doing their technology humbled they

562
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:47,019
crushed it absolutely yes Smash Brothers

563
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,230
Asians there's all sorts of Asians in

564
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:50,809
the world there is Caucasians of which a

565
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,700
pair

566
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:54,710
they I am a part of I don't know why

567
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:59,059
we're [ __ ] Asians it's kind of a weird

568
00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:00,920
thing but it is what it is all more ways

569
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:03,649
to divide people that are all just

570
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,570
people definitely you have a Gabba dough

571
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,430
it's not always accurate although I will

572
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:09,439
say at one point in time in my life I

573
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,360
was potentiating my stereotype to the

574
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,430
most accurate [ __ ] potential you

575
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,139
could possibly do big dre D hair

576
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,600
listening to fish and the Grateful Dead

577
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:20,240
dry on the orange Volkswagen van smoking

578
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:23,469
reefer eating mushrooms just literally

579
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:28,309
you know playing frisbee golf I was so

580
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:29,930
like an absolute [ __ ] stereotype to

581
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:33,559
the stereotype we're in [ __ ]

582
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:37,340
Guatemala printed pants I mean the whole

583
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:40,039
nine yards right so it's kind of fun

584
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:44,750
kind of fun today I'm a little more

585
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:48,500
chill we're all humans we're all humans

586
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,130
how about that one specie the human

587
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
specie

588
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:53,120
yeah frisbee golf Jeffro he's the love

589
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,920
frisbee golf I mean my God how wonderful

590
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:59,569
was that if he were someone that loves

591
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:01,160
to smell joints and see parks oh you

592
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:03,349
know what I'm never the only white guy I

593
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,590
have been in a few places in my life

594
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:08,839
where there's only been a few of us but

595
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:10,879
I'm good with that too I don't really

596
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:12,769
care although I do feel like a weird

597
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,780
insecurity and this is a kind of a funny

598
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:16,910
white person insecurity first of all

599
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:19,160
when I'm in a hot country I already know

600
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,990
that I have the wrong skin if I had the

601
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,370
ability especially because I'm very

602
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,680
sensitive to the Sun if I had the

603
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:27,099
ability to change the level of melon

604
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,930
whatever it is in my skin not melanin

605
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:32,209
whatever the the the protein is in your

606
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,370
skin that controls the lightness and the

607
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:36,590
color if I had the ability to turn my

608
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:38,449
skin very dark while I was in hot

609
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:41,209
countries I would do it every time

610
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:43,880
because my skin is [ __ ] when I'm in

611
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:47,059
Jamaica I gotta hide I gotta stay out of

612
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,840
the out of the Sun I turn red I don't go

613
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:50,720
Brown

614
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,069
I go red pigment well pigment then I'm

615
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,980
telling you if I could [ __ ] turn

616
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:57,169
myself like black like darkness black

617
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,970
when I was in like the tropics so I

618
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,310
could go out and field and photograph

619
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,179
for hours my my Jamaican farmer friends

620
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:05,338
are out in that field for ow

621
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:08,129
I can honestly tell you if I did that I

622
00:26:05,338 --> 00:26:10,950
would be in the hospital no [ __ ] joke

623
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:14,338
I just can't I I got the wrong skin and

624
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:17,219
so now if I went up to you know the the

625
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:19,079
the up north and now you're in cold

626
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:20,820
environments well the skin works great

627
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:24,808
no problem I like it

628
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:26,218
but dude Daniel I am a redhead I swear

629
00:26:24,808 --> 00:26:28,469
to God without having red hair

630
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:32,989
I'm basically a redhead that's how I

631
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:36,450
burn in the tropics it's really a bummer

632
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:38,519
yeah I do SunGard I've had them down

633
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:41,519
there I've spent six to eight weeks at a

634
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,888
time down there or so I know yeah I

635
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,509
don't know why I said well I didn't say

636
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:47,488
melatonin I thought I said I thought I

637
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:49,528
said melon melon in the melted

638
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:50,940
anyway I misplaced I'll have to go in

639
00:26:49,528 --> 00:26:54,538
it'll probably be close to that though

640
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,859
if I go and look at that I just turn red

641
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:57,388
it's brutal especially because I want to

642
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:59,308
spend a lot of time in the fields I want

643
00:26:57,388 --> 00:27:01,588
to spend time flying my drone I want to

644
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:02,788
do macro photography I want to take real

645
00:27:01,588 --> 00:27:05,700
photos and then I want to just spend

646
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:08,190
time being in the field and these fields

647
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,580
are out there out and open there's not

648
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:15,239
so much melanin yeah okay there we go

649
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:17,838
perfect melatonin make you take that so

650

651
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:23,729

654
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:30,239
looking forward to going down to Jamaica

655
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:33,450
and filming some footage of the growth

656
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:36,479
of the processing facility of the

657
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,830
bottling and packaging plant of like all

658
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:41,308
the different sort of things that are

659
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:42,838
now fitting together as we as we come

660
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:43,678
together on this project it's pretty

661
00:27:42,838 --> 00:27:49,259
[ __ ] incredible

662
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,909
five years man if I could sail a boat

663
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:52,950
down there and live that would be dope

664
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:54,629
well you probably could son girl you

665
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,159
know I met some people down there in the

666
00:27:54,628 --> 00:27:58,829
90s that were doing just that

667
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,580
my buddy Terry who had the boat he had a

668
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:05,269
catamaran called the Lion of Judah and

669
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:11,428
he lived off the coast of Negril there

670
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:13,200
it's a 580 right now Oh excellent

671
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:15,509
Ivan Martos you should have her watch

672
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,059
the story of Hilary telling the story of

673
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:17,950
her

674
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:19,990
one year old grandma gettin turned on to

675
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,509
cannabis I don't know if any of you guys

676
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:28,660
saw that story I've known her grandma

677
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:30,519
probably since she was like 82 or 83 so

678
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:34,870
a fairly long time maybe even longer

679
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:36,369
almost 20 years anyway what criteria do

680
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:37,869
you use when looking for property well

681
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:40,750
earthling I'm not too worried about

682
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:42,309
property myself I'm not the farmer so

683
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,259
usually the farmer and a few other

684
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:47,649
people I'm a processor so my processing

685
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:50,049
office my lab wherever our lab I should

686
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,550
sake is Tony processes with me it can

687
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:53,379
kind of go anywhere we don't really care

688
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:55,869
as long as we have some power as long as

689
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,430
we have access to water you know these

690
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:59,229
are the things that are most important

691
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:02,200
for us otherwise it really doesn't

692
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:04,529
matter where the field itself is now if

693
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,809
you asked that question to our grower

694
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:10,259
well he would answer things like access

695
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:10,259
to water

696
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:16,029
vicinity proximity to the road you know

697
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:17,589
is it a stupid like hike into the bush

698
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,269
40 minutes we can't do that that's

699
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,490
old-school prohibition we need to pull

700
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:25,210
trucks up right next to the field and

701
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:28,660
have it like right there so these these

702
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:30,039
are these are the ones that are going to

703
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,000
be the future of cannabis growing you

704
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,740
don't have to climb into the mountains

705
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,869
in Jamaica anymore that's the

706
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,819
prohibition mentality you don't have to

707
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:38,319
plant five acres of peanuts so that if

708
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:39,730
the police catch you in the forest near

709
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,929
you're going to field you can walk them

710
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,940
to the peanuts and say that you're a

711
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:45,549
peanut farmer you don't have to do that

712
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,140
anymore in Jamaica either so really

713
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:49,629
looking forward to make just got that

714
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:51,220
son they got that water the some in the

715
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,050
water are the two things that they can

716
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,079
really everyone can afford in Jamaica

717
00:29:53,049 --> 00:30:00,609
it's available to everyone so shout out

718
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:02,379

722
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:37,280
say wrote that song for me I think he

723
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:40,579
writes songs for everybody but I'm the

724
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:43,279
character in his life and he wanted to

725
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:47,480
share through song and so he wrote a

726
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:50,420
song not about me but about dabbing I

727
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,870
turned him onto dabbing so I mentioned

728
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,870
in the song

729
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:59,470

what to tell ya yeah you know those

738
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:42,079
songs that cannabis specialist John

739
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:46,279
Mason Luton Fire all doing the full

740
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:49,549
mount rhythm that was pretty awesome too

741
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:51,730
bubbleman with the food myth bubbling

742
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:56,119
it's one of my favorite lines from

743
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:57,410
original I think the word dabbing

744
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:59,359
started out with a bad reputation

745
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,640
especially when I came out and started

746
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,169
dabbing hash and people were like what's

747
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:07,280
that I'm like it's dabs and they're like

748
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:09,830
dabs dabs was BHO people thought dabs

749
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,629
were vho so I think what we did since

750
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:14,169
then is we opened it up to the fact that

751
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:19,000
dabs are much more than just the pho

752
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:21,550
they are you know isolated

753
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,759
cannabinoids and terpenoids from the

754
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:26,710
plant and they're [ __ ] awesome how

755
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:29,289
can you not love dads now if your dabs

756
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:32,019
are soaked in chemical solvents and my

757
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:33,940
capital oil soluble contaminants that

758
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:36,910
are present in the particular solvent

759
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:40,059
you use well that's not awesome at all

760
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:41,350
but do I have to open the tinychat I

761
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:45,909
thought you could just go there and it's

762
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:51,969
always there we're did what term

763
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:56,200
originated but rich where did what term

764
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:58,089
originated dabbing I have no idea I'm

765
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,220
not sure if we first said it I know that

766
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:04,839
my friends were dabbing back in the 90s

767
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:06,160
with oil when they created the mayor you

768
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:07,779
know most of the thumbnails on the

769
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,730
videos are picked automatically they

770
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:11,799
just choose them in red and randomly

771
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,329
generate three thumbnails and choose one

772
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,700
sometimes I'll go in and I'll pick a

773
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:17,799
different of the three and the odd time

774
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,200
I'll go in and I'll create a custom

775
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:22,059
thumbnail and make that the thumbnail

776
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,920
now if I don't choose a thumbnail and I

777
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:26,859
go make say a live video that hasn't

778
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:30,100
gone live yet it'll show my avatar from

779
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:32,169
the top page of the YouTube channel so

780
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:33,730
yeah it was pretty neat for a long time

781
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,830
a new person would come on hash Church

782
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:38,140
and it would be them who was the avatar

783
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:42,669
and I wasn't doing it I was like holy

784
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:44,259
[ __ ] this is amazing I'm not sure I'll

785
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:47,259
have to find out from Sara I sure hope

786
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:54,069
so I don't think we're releasing any

787
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:55,930
pumpkin spice flavor no hot and I had

788
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:57,939
two original dabs from the 80s yeah

789
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,529
exactly well waters my friends even was

790
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,820
hooking up a step higher because they

791
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:03,389
created this thing called the mayor

792
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:06,849
these were the guys from the Kootenays

793
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:09,730
known as the holy smokes voice my old

794
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:11,679
friends dustin sunflower paul de filiz

795
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:14,889
and allen Middlemiss these guys were

796
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,960
constantly they held down Nelson BC

797
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:18,878
which is like a fairly large like a

798
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,889
small little town right

799
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:22,659
like on near the border and if you can

800
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,730
imagine throughout the 90s a lot of

801
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:26,530
people would just take weed because they

802
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,840
grew a beautiful weed it was kind of

803
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:30,910
like our Humboldt or our northern

804
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,960
for Nia for British Columbia the

805
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:34,420
Kootenays is known for growing

806
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,130
exceptional cannabis and people would

807
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:38,349
walk that cannabis across the border

808
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:40,390
because it was so easy they had known

809
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:41,920
these trails for a long long time

810
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:43,779
whether you wanted to go on a quad or

811
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,400
whether you wanted to just walk you can

812
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,980
take a backpack with you and walk across

813
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,660
and you could turn your $1500 pounds

814
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,760
into like thirty five hundred dollars or

815
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:53,319
three thousand or whatever and so a lot

816
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,870
of people were doing that the holy

817
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,670
smokes guys they were not Smuggler's but

818
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:59,529
they were the cannabis activists of

819
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,849
Nelson so they were constantly in court

820
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,160
they were constantly defending

821
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:05,500
themselves and they created this thing

822
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:08,049
years ago called the mayor like the

823
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:11,170
mayor of the city and it was like a

824
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:13,870
propane torch and bent over the propane

825
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:17,200
torch was a spoon like a stainless steel

826
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:18,940
spoon that was like like clamped to the

827
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,199
neck of the torch and so when you turn

828
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,269
the torch on it would just be hitting

829
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:24,849
this spoon and then over top of the

830
00:35:22,269 --> 00:35:26,619
spoon they had a glass bell that fit

831
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:29,170
over top of the spoon and went down into

832
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:30,699
a tube that went into a pipe a glass

833
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,680
pipe and it was called the mayor and

834
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:34,509

835

837
00:35:36,429 --> 00:35:40,659
