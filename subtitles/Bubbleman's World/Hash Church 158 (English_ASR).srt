characters that sits in chat waiting for

102
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:52,560
church every week and I tell you Marcus

103
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,050
I was like in that group of people who

104
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,689
were really worried about your safety

105
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,468
because when we didn't see an episode go

106
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:03,840
up for there to have a chat last Sunday

107
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,870
everyone started wondering you know is

108
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,818
there gonna be an episode and I

109
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,090
immediately is like oh I hope Marcus is

110
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:14,278
okay I hope he didn't like you know

111
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:16,109
drive off of some you know ravine

112
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:18,449
somewhere you know he's in stuck

113
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:22,560
somewhere incommunicado because it's

114
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:25,228
very unlike you to have the episode

115
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,968
already up there and then as soon as the

116
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:31,079
episodes up there people start gathering

117
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:33,899
and started having chat dialogue and

118
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:37,560
that that is that's where bingo is like

119
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:39,689
one of the you know one of the cast of

120
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,519
characters that's in that chat every

121
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:43,709
week with all kinds of interesting stuff

122
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,959
to add and say so ya know it was kind of

123
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:49,739
crazy dude I mean I I ended up camping I

124
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,149
ended up out away from anything and i DM

125
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,009
was like I'm not gonna be there for the

126
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:54,598
next two weeks dr. Natasha it was like

127
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,430
I'm gonna be in Europe and I was like I

128
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:58,079
don't really have anyone that I can get

129
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,000
to even run this show and I woke up

130
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,668
Sunday morning and I was camping with no

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,680
Wi-Fi and I was like I don't know how to

132
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:07,709
pull this off I just I don't know how to

133
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,598
pull this off so here's a bong rip for

134
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:11,519
hash Church for Miss and Hastert sorry

135
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:13,500
for everyone that thought I was dead I

136
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,728
guess when you're consistent in this

137
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,379
world and you miss something

138
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:22,680
people are really thrown off by that

139
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:27,838
[ __ ] absurd am and she was partying with

140
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:30,569
me and she didn't even remember you ho

141
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:34,110
ho how soon were forgotten how soon we

142
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:36,960
are forgotten in the Catholic Church if

143
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:40,470
you miss a week you miss

144
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:43,879
a session it's urge I think it falls

145
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:46,169
into that bucket of venial sins I don't

146
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:50,189
really know what mortal says I think you

147
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:51,810
have to go to a confession booth to get

148
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:56,418
down on your knees and pray that you

149
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,418
missed an episode so maybe we should all

150
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:06,870
it's taken me I'd any pray for

151
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:09,360
forgiveness I guess during the American

152
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,759
anthem you know I even tried to come

153
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,470
home that night I tried to set up an

154
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,020
evening sermon I thought would be a

155
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,270
great idea but my wife had been dealing

156
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:21,180
with our kids for four days straight by

157
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:24,359
herself and it was just not the right

158
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,829
thing to do to come home and ignore her

159
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,598
and the kids and go right into another

160
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:29,699
show when really I needed to pay

161
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,319
attention to my children and I needed to

162
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,930
pay attention to my wife so I chose my

163
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,339

of precipitation down there we had a

236
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,180
light sprinkling of rain that's what

237
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:25,649
we've had weeks ago but that's about it

238
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:28,639
yes wait I saw in the news that the

239
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:32,669
grape growers up in Northern California

240
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:35,750
it's been so hot and dry recently that

241
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:38,370
the grapes are all withering up and

242
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,590
getting you know they're having a real

243
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,539
problem with it

244
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:46,470
yeah we I don't know about the vineyards

245
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:47,969
but we have some wine grapes here we

246
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,899
don't really make wine with them but

247
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:57,210
they're turning into raisins on the vine

248
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:58,740
Wow yeah I saw they were harvested in it

249
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,660
and they were they had machines that

250
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:06,000
were trying to set the real grapes from

251
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:08,219
the raisins it's been a hot dry summer

252
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,870
in Northern California after all that

253
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,870
beautiful rain we had this last winter

254
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,070
yeah it's been great for BC I mean all

255
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:18,419
the people I know that have plants in

256
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,100
the ground still I mean lots of people

257
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:22,349
have harvested already it's just been

258
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,759
months of beating hot Sun and of course

259
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,330
anyone that grows in the Pacific

260
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:29,700
Northwest knows well that it's kind of a

261
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:32,370
throw of the dice whether or not the the

262
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,950
incredible rain you know like basically

263
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:39,480
powdery mildew just is like what's up

264
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:41,910
what's up BC here we are boom and just

265
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,889
like people that have beautiful plants

266
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:45,449
are they just get decimated so quickly

267
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:48,689
so I know a lot of people are happy

268
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:51,150
right now just with this endless endless

269
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:56,339

270
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:59,850

272
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,009

273
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,290
camping last weekend it was like perfect

274
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:09,509
you know went camping the whole weekend

275
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:11,909
and it never rained which really liked

276
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:13,559
it's not like I'm hate the rain but it's

277
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:15,689
just like fall in the Pacific Northwest

278
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,599
when it starts raining it gets cold

279
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:26,000
and kind of miserable quick can really

280
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:28,879
come in and destroy things quickly I

281
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,139
want to share a funny story about myself

282
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:37,529
this past week on Tuesday morning about

283
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:39,110
4:30 one of my dogs was making all kinds

284
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:43,679
of noise in the middle of night and

285
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:44,850
there was extra noises involved and put

286
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,370
on some clothes grabbed a flashlight

287
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,670
went out to see what was going on and a

288
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:53,580
fairly good-sized raccoon had taken one

289
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:57,120
of my dogs into the pond

290
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:59,580
oh yeah and I had seen earlier in my

291
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,060
life I saw a dog get drowned by a

292
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,100
raccoon

293
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:04,739
it wasn't my dog but I saw it and it was

294
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,950
horrific and this raccoon was climbing

295
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,870
up on the head of one of my dogs and I'm

296
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,390
here to testify to a couple of things

297
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,000
one it's a really terrible idea to go

298
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:17,730
into a pond to try and separate dogs and

299
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,600
raccoon oh man because you can get tore

300
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:25,920
up Jesus but the second thing I'm here

301
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,830
to testify about is cannabis creams tink

302
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:32,009
creams that are formulated for pain

303
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:35,340
relief really have remarkable antibiotic

304
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:37,610
and antifungal properties my the wounds

305
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,080
on my hands are healing up beautifully

306
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,779
and I did a little experiment a couple

307
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,680
of days ago where one of my hands I

308
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:49,350
slathered in a cream that we make and

309
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:53,669
the other hand I left it alone because

310
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:55,769
there was so many bandages but and then

311
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:57,659
I showed it to my doctor and I and I

312
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,129
told him he knows what I do and we've

313
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:01,889
talked a lot about it but he can't

314
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:04,200
recommend anything of course but I asked

315
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:06,960
him can you tell which hand I've treated

316
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,670
with cannabis since this happened and he

317
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,730
took one look and he said oh yeah that

318
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:13,649
one and I said you're right because all

319
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:16,139
of the wounds all the inflammation and

320
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:18,059
redness around all these bite marks had

321
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:20,460
disappeared on the hand that I was using

322
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:22,349
cannabis on and we're still pretty angry

323
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,190
and inflamed on the hand that I hadn't

324
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:27,899
used it on just a little testimony

325
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,250
compare your body I love your positivity

326
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,720
you come in to tell us

327
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,850
you got attacked by a raccoon and

328
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,800
instead of being like man like who I had

329
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,440
a rough couple of days you like the

330
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:48,089
wounds the wounds on my hands are

331

healing beautifully this look man well I

332
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,269

333
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:54,779
gonna wrestle raccoons have some

334

shovel like something or a couple of

336
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:07,439
[ __ ] dogs yeah raccoons raccoons have

337
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,899
opposable thumbs so they don't really

338
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,370
[ __ ] around you grab a hell I grabbed

339

ahold of him and he grabbed ahold of me

340
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,580
and that's what scary

341
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,570
went back and forth and they got those

342
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:22,050
claws yes laws that go down it's like

343

345
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:29,039
them jumped my dog in the backyard and

346
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,500

fifteen times he had fifteen little

348
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,480
holes as trachea and so he survived it

349
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,829
he survived that he survived getting run

350
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,440
over by a car I survived getting

351
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,440
attacked by coyotes my dog stuff is [ __ ]

352
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:49,319

353
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:51,000
hasn't it Wow only once by a car but he

354
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,460
got run over by a little boy when he was

355
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,320
a puppy on a bicycle that's how it all

356
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,600
started it all started with him getting

357
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,610
run over by this bike and then he

358
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,560
started hating things on wheels and it

359
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,180
we you know he'd be attracted to them no

360
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,818
matter how hard I tried to keep him away

361
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:08,519
like break free and then go you know

362
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:10,289
[ __ ] with cars go barked at cars so now

363
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:11,970
I have the invisible fence and he can't

364
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:14,609
go anywhere and he's alive and healthy

365
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,318
and happy so take care of your pets out

366
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:18,568
there man especially living in nature

367
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,159
like that's not even bears imagine if

368
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:22,859
the bear just came down and just like

369
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,810
gobbled my dog but like raccoons and

370
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:29,699
people and coyotes like it's an endless

371
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:33,450
they are no joke john vidal they are no

372
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:35,690
joke we are in their land we've only

373
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:38,549
been here a short time they've been it

374
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:41,519
yeah not to mention where we're just

375
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:44,190
like they can live in the land

376
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,289
and survive and unless we have a lot of

377
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:51,090
things to take care of us we tend to

378
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:53,809
perish like we need to store food and

379
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:56,819
have fire and like have a place that

380
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:58,789
connection and don't forget Wi-Fi

381
00:17:56,819 --> 00:18:01,439
internet connections so we can Skype

382
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:04,559
late-night bong rips with my good friend

383
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,210
skunk man Sam oh my god

384
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,980
what a funny episode of hashed Church

385
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,480
today I feel good about it myself I

386
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,019
think it's because I've eaten a pack of

387
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,420
these gummy bears from from the Kennedys

388
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:19,470
I'm just gobbling down a little bit of

389
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:24,000
their stuff and puffin on some MKULTRA

390
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:28,019
that I pressed last night nice did you

391
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:34,859
uh announce that this was a farewell

392
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:36,599
episode or well I just you know I I

393
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:38,279
didn't necessarily announce that it was

394
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,809
a farewell episode I just kind of felt

395
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,569
like I felt a couple of times with

396
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:44,490
Church you know as much as I love the

397
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:46,439
gatherings it's sometimes overwhelming

398
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,029
last week was overwhelming I don't know

399
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,580
if anyone can understand what I went

400
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:52,619
through to miss the first episode in

401
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:55,139
three years I was like I was literally

402
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:57,000
having like nervous breakdown stress and

403
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,700
my wife was just kind of like you know

404
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,200
like is it supposed to be about stresses

405
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,960
because it seems like it's kind of

406
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,880
turned into a stressful thing that

407
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,500
you're responsible for these people that

408
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,150
you don't even know but you want to give

409
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,069
them this information that you're not

410
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,740
sure that they even already don't know

411
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:16,019
like just like what's the deal and I so

412
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,940
I've been thinking about it I I wouldn't

413
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:20,970
say necessarily that it's the end of

414
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:24,870
hash but it's definitely like sort of a

415
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:27,360
a change in a sense maybe some some form

416
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:29,129
of uh well when you got when you got

417
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,099
meat when you wouldn't I asked you about

418
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:35,130
it it was um it was interesting because

419
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:39,629
I miss I kept missing a lot more this

420
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:42,210
year and you know I'm I wanted to do a

421
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,800
reflection today if you know it's not

422
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,340
like a farewell maybe there'll be more

423
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:51,809
but like I think that we should we

424
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:54,789
should reflect today because we don't

425
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:59,889
have to worry well

426
00:19:54,789 --> 00:20:01,480
Cathedral I am now the Pope well it

427
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,190
definitely I think that I think what

428
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,380
he's saying is that you know there's a

429
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,090
lot of responsibility that falls upon an

430
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,750
individual at 9:00 in the morning on

431
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:13,089
Sunday I myself am surprised it went 16

432
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,670
plus episodes because if I had a wife

433
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:17,740
and kids and it was Sunday morning and

434
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:21,420
it was 9 o'clock in the morning oh I

435
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:23,799
would never hear the end of it like so I

436
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:27,370
commend you the fact that you pioneered

437
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:31,029
through the wife and kids for how many

438
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:35,399
episodes a hundred and fifty-eight you

439
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:40,869
gave up a hundred and fifty eight Sunday

440
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,620
mornings to spend information in a row

441
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:43,509
bro

442
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:46,769
this morning what my two kids were

443
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:50,890
opening presents in yeah yeah a hundred

444
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:52,690
and fifty-eight in a row or all the rest

445
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,490
of the panelists and the rest of us so I

446
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,549
will chime in we'll come in we'll come

447
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:00,730
and go but like my hats off to you you

448
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:02,710
know like you went it's a strong run man

449
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:06,430
I mean another man and a tremendous

450
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:08,620
amount of information that has gotten

451
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,910
out to the community the industry the

452
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:12,279
panelists that are here and the

453
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:16,570
panelists that have come through I mean

454
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:19,210
it's a wealth of of information over a

455
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:23,159
hundred and fifty eight episodes I mean

456
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:26,019
I think there's there's there's been

457
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,490
there's been some pivotal points in some

458
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:29,740
of the conversations and how it

459
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,839
popularized different movements and and

460
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,089
also for all the patients that have come

461
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:37,720
on and told their stories some of the

462
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:39,759
things we've raised attention to when

463
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,460
this thing first started I remember we

464
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:45,490
were talking about like the whole BHO

465
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:48,670
craze because it wasn't a huge solvent

466
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:51,150
list movement and that's how kinda we

467
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:55,360
started talking with Johnny B and

468
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:57,430
Horatio and and the core of us we were

469
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,709
saying man you know this whole you know

470
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:01,180
be a chose taken off live residents take

471
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,840
it off there was like this whole

472
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:07,090
movement and there was a fear that full

473
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:08,049
melt or sift was just gonna vanish into

474
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:11,259
thin air

475
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:13,269
and there was a little light there you

476
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:16,319
know like well there's got to be there's

477
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:19,509
got to be another way to create a

478
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:22,029
solvent let's extract that that can be

479
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:25,210
popularized and thus flower rosin -

480
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:34,569
rosin and everything that followed it

481
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:37,150
episode 25 episode 25 and 30 were

482
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:39,460
powerful later I think yeah we can hear

483
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:43,570
you Johnny be awesome morning guys sir

484
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:46,240
I think also 30 was a very powerful

485
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:48,549
episode I believe it was 30 where

486
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,309
Jessica Hawkins came on and told us

487
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:52,750
about her daughter Naya is that does

488

on the she's starting now to look after

565
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:29,658

568
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,080

like everybody else which is not shaky

572

it gives me that that balance that I

576
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:51,680
need every day and I think that's reason

577
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,990
why a lot of us use it is it's because

578
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,049
it balances it makes us normal thumbs up

it's all stuffed animals that you have

650
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:49,220
over there yeah because we know you have

651
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:51,680
thousands Sam we know you have put it

652
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,730
this way my granddaughter has thousands

653
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:57,529
that's true

654
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:59,990
oh yes anyone that has kids knows the

655
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:12,049
deal on stuffed animals I'll bet she

656
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:13,490
does never will be so remember we also

657
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:15,769
did all right what are what are the

658
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:18,380
other top ten so we had that one you can

659
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:20,960
you quickly search that and view the top

660
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:25,490
hits of the top ten or is that hard to

661
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:28,100
do what about how many hours in the

662
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:32,809
hundred and fifty someone would have to

663
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:35,089
count all the hours it's a lot it's not

664
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:36,799
too bad 158 constellations

665
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:38,569
it just doesn't break it down very well

666
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,629
the way it shows but I would say our

667
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:42,859
wise oh it's been good so for I would

668
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:47,330
say why do you think three and a half

669
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:49,309
hours average weird something just like

670
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:49,759
deleted from YouTube that's kind of

671
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:51,859
scary

672
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:56,329
a hashed Church video I hope didn't get

673
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:59,389
removed 553 hours on average of

674
00:30:56,329 --> 00:31:01,099
information scowled owns probably laid a

675
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:04,370
master course out

676
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:06,918
over the 553 hours so yeah and there's a

677
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:09,079
lot of information that has gone on in

678
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:10,820
those in those hours because thinking

679
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:12,798
about a course think about how long you

680
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:15,439
spend in a curriculum course you only

681
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:18,079
get an hour with the teacher you could

682
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,690
go three times a week for you know a

683
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:24,230
couple months you know what I just

684
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:26,298
noticed was episode 37 where Lester

685
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:29,808
Grinspoon shows up is almost a five-hour

686
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:31,849
episode yeah I was one of my favorite

687
00:31:29,808 --> 00:31:35,480
episodes by the way then he shows up

688
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:38,689
again in episode 43 and it's also almost

689
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:41,149
a five-hour episode how about the wrong

690
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:44,389

694
00:31:50,148 --> 00:31:56,508

bubble hash and the showing people

724
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:13,428
bubble hash in the in the late 90s was

725
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,870
was very much up there with showing

726
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:17,540
people rosin

727
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:19,789
you know being it go ahead Sam Marcus

728
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:24,109
what was the name of the guy who showed

729
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:26,539
how to mash it with the big spoon dry

730
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:28,429
sipped on the side of a silver ball

731
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:31,069
that's heated that's beautiful

732
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:33,980
that was Chadwick and Chadwick did that

733
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:36,740
under the name compassion with a pH

734
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:39,289
that's right yeah and I tried it it

735
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:41,870
worked but couldn't make it pure and

736
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:44,808
clean because you know I wasn't put it

737
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:47,359
in any kind of a little bag I just don't

738
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:50,149
think it was the the you know I tried it

739
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:52,849
also there was just not like his photos

740
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:54,980
were impeccable but the method just

741
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:57,349
wasn't easy enough for it to catch on

742
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:01,279
the way and especially because straight

743
00:33:57,349 --> 00:34:04,129
up the whole that whole pressing you

744
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:06,589
know buds I think it really really

745
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:08,360
happened based on how solgryn told the

746
00:34:06,589 --> 00:34:11,269
story was like you know he was doing

747
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,280
this with with hash pressing Ashley

748
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:16,070
happened because of the way that he did

749
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,490
that but I'm just saying somebody had

750
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:22,519
tried to do it earlier that's all oh

751
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:26,359
gosh especially to resin but the actual

752
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:27,550
flower part I think I think I think he

753
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,139
might have been first yeah because

754
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:32,780
compassion didn't do it with flowers he

755
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:34,878
only did it with either dry cept or

756
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,830
water hash ah yeah and that and that

757
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,539
ball things been around awhile because I

758
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:42,168
mean when I started growing in the 90s

759
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:44,300
and it was like early 2000 I remember

760
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:47,239
having I remember having a pot with a

761
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,639
little water turned it on put a silver

762
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,439
bowl on it just put lots of Keefe in it

763
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,169
with a spoon pressed it and it was like

764
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,860
this sweating like yellow hard yolk

765
00:34:54,168 --> 00:35:00,799
because he posted it in like 99 mm yeah

766
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:02,750
exactly and then I tried it the problem

767
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,510
was which was like very difficult was

768
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:09,079
once you have it on the bowl was using a

769
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,400
razor on a conk on a curved surface yeah

770
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:13,309
you were like trying to get all this

771
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,530
like what barely was there out well that

772
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:18,650
was the problem and the other problem

773
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:24,040
was you kept getting rezoned rice it

774
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:26,510
into the stem stuff yeah you would so

775
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,820
yeah so I was like not only was it like

776
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:31,370
probably a 30%

777
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,200
yield it's basically like it was

778
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:34,609
basically like if we were talking about

779
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,379
grapes like we always do

780
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,480
I was like throwing grapes in a bowl and

781
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:41,030
you're smashing them once and then just

782
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,590
taking like 80% of the guts and all the

783
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,450
stuff out just a little bit of the juice

784
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,660
was there and you're trying to like

785
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:52,009
capture that you know it was like very

786
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:54,049
hard but it was the next step after what

787
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:56,570
we called like quizzo or whatever quick

788
00:35:54,050 --> 00:36:00,170
wash where you take the remember that

789
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:02,870
stuff in the 90s you like quick wash

790
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:06,700
with ISO and out of like a grate and a

791
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:06,699
glass tray and let that stuff sit out

792
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:13,010
but really really cold

793
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:16,209
ethanol with sonicator for 30 seconds

794
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:20,120
and it came out beautiful yellow color

795
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:23,090
oil yeah well you remember quiz remember

796
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:26,769
quick wash however yes I remember but I

797
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:29,320
never used it yeah I was I remember like

798
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:31,699
97 or 98 when I went home for Christmas

799
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,500
I'd made some of that stuff and I've

800
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:36,319
just I can't remember exactly what it

801
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,500
was but it was like somehow used alcohol

802
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,120
I can't remember exactly what I did was

803
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:44,300
alcohol and something and it was like I

804
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,400
put it into a glass tray and it was like

805
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,890
evaporated the the alcohol off and then

806
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,460
you collected it with a razor and it was

807
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:53,809
like a green kind of hash but there was

808
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,639
like it was like this little tech that

809
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:57,320
people were doing back in the day but I

810
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:59,989
remember I mean if you smoked it it

811
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,370
really it really really really [ __ ]

812
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:03,879
you up but I remember that was the first

813
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:05,980
time I was like any kind of concentrate

814
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,690
at Christmas time

815
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:11,150
dude I'll tell you 99 the first time

816
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:12,950
while it was 98 actually but 99 when I

817
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:14,660
was able to start selling the bags and

818
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:16,819
showing people this hash that looked

819
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:19,429
like stained glass windows from a church

820
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,140
was always just like the most people

821
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:22,129
nobody had it like nobody had it

822
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:24,739
everyone

823
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:26,840
just it was an unbelievable time to be

824
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:30,889
the bubble man because I'll tell you

825
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:32,090
every person I showed everyone was just

826
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:34,460
like [ __ ]

827
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:36,470
that's some [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] right

828
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,070
there when I pulled out that 73 bag

829
00:37:36,469 --> 00:37:41,250
every time the eyebrows

830
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:43,650
like from this to up here it was just

831
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,880
the full eyebrow rot rays it was like oh

832
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,849
yeah you just saw something that you've

833
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,630
never seen before holy [ __ ] I can't

834
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:52,650
believe it

835
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:55,110
just wait dude just wait and it was just

836
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:57,420
something really I'll never forget it it

837
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:59,250
was reminiscent a little bit of the

838
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,260
rosin thing you know being at spannabis

839
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,929
and at the booth there with Xavier at

840
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:06,090
medical seeds and showing like urban the

841
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:09,089
urban grow or Matt the great gardener

842
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:11,039
DNA like I'll Crockett like all of these

843
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,539
guys had never seen this process before

844
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,429
and we were showing them with a little

845
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:16,949
hair straightener right at the booth

846
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:19,440
that [ __ ] was pretty [ __ ] cool Jeff

847
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:19,969
Church was there doing demos you called

848
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,950
me

849
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:27,750
yeah from that experience you're like

850
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:29,339
bro take that take the 73 or the 95 Star

851
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,369
Plus and press it I'm like why would you

852
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,900
do that you're like just do it

853
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:35,460
25 and do it and we're doing it with

854
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,139
like other stuff I'm like yeah I don't

855
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,929
know and they're like I remember running

856
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:41,309
to the lab and and in Denver and doing

857
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:43,589
it and when I pressed it was like this

858
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:49,110
it came out like clear and then it dried

859
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:52,350
white I was like whoa micron drawing

860
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:54,570
screams I still press what those pieces

861
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:59,309
that I cut there at the beginning like

862
00:38:54,570 --> 00:39:01,019
yesterday you know I would say one of

863
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:04,019
the most important things I think that

864
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:06,900
helped us in this discovery was like we

865
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:10,469
got became fascinated with with terpenes

866
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,930
in the in those episodes but it's really

867
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:15,659
interesting to look at them when you're

868
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:19,529
making a hash rosin or a flat flour

869
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:22,409
rosin because of you know the nucleation

870
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:24,030
or like oh why does it go from an oil to

871
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:26,429
a butter and like your mind just

872
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:29,610
automatically wonders you know what's

873
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:32,099
going on there and I think that of

874
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:35,070
recently like it finally reached kind of

875
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:37,769
that that the final understanding if you

876
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:41,220
will where we all kind of we get it you

877
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:44,070
know we're we're you know there's a

878
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:46,409
breakout that's happening in that

879
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:49,559
process to where you know at some point

880
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:51,629
THC a can be broken out and separated

881
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:55,860
from its oils and lipids and

882
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:58,920
and all of its things and so you know

883
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,570
whether you're repressing rosin

884
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,000
a second time like we talked about to

885
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:05,430
separate the THC and all the oil or if

886
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,119
you let it naturally separate in high

887
00:40:05,429 --> 00:40:11,369
concentration of terpenes that whole

888
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,409
thing was discovered during hash search

889
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:15,569
like during these these episodes where

890
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:18,629
we were turning distillate into

891
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:22,830
crystalline and like conceptually what

892
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:27,300
terpenes actually do in in the process

893
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:29,489
so and now there was that recent study I

894
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,740
don't know if you guys talked about it

895
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:33,179
before when I sent you

896
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:35,809
yeah what'd you think of that one scale

897
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:38,399
down that was through proton NMR I

898
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:40,259
wanted to ask you that there were two

899
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,539
there was a recent study that talked

900
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:45,180
about using NMR to characterize strains

901
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:48,150
which I think you know I talked about

902
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:51,750
doing a few years ago but there's this

903
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:55,280
other study that looked at the

904
00:40:51,750 --> 00:41:00,360
high-temperature decadence yes of

905
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:02,310
terpenes is that the one yeah yeah I

906
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,900
tell what before I go there let me go

907
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:05,909
back to something I just wanted to share

908
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:09,210
before I forget it which is that I think

909
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:11,429
whether you know this is like life

910
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,470
imitating church or church imitating

911
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:15,869
life I don't know which one it was but I

912
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:20,489
think one of the most important things

913
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:25,440
that the rosin thing did was it enabled

914
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:27,629
people to make oil anywhere regardless

915
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,539
of whether or not they have access to it

916
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:32,400
so like here in Pennsylvania in the

917
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:34,849
state's out east and everything people

918
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,930
were sweating because again there is no

919
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:39,989
regulated industry at least there wasn't

920
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:43,710
until recently that made you know closed

921
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:45,389
loop butane extracted oil so all the

922
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,920
kids were sweating now how do you get

923
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:50,309
going on how to get oil and they didn't

924
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,530
realize it and then basically a way that

925
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:55,259
with their girlfriends hair straightener

926
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:58,380
and some really good not they could make

927
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:03,660
oil and that was extremely and abling

928
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:05,490
for will make boil make oil safely

929
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:07,618
because people have been making oil for

930
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:09,329
years prior but we've had an increase in

931
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:12,840
people blowing up and burning themselves

932
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:16,880
very badly exactly and I think that like

933
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:19,920
a lot of people didn't believe it until

934
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,960
the hash Church or other things on

935
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,300
Instagram I mean everyone started

936
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,579
posting you know squishing nugs and

937
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,990
squishing hash and now you look at again

938
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:31,019
I think what tony was alluding to before

939
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:34,529
which is sophistication of this method

940
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:40,409
which can actually be used to purify THC

941
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:42,810
a itself from extract which is again the

942
00:42:40,409 --> 00:42:45,179
star of the Shiva or a THC a that's what

943
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:46,889
everyone wants to be I think when it

944
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:49,379
goes back to like you're saying these

945
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:51,809
methods on bowls and all these things

946
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:54,690
were just sort of like ideas on how to

947
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:58,980
get the oil out what rosin did is it

948
00:42:54,690 --> 00:43:00,389
made it impractical method that anybody

949
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:04,110
can do you know and you didn't need to

950
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:06,659
have you know access to good butane or

951
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:09,150
ya have to worry about residual solvent

952
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:11,129
because there's no solving issues so it

953
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:14,369
was just an easy way to make safe oil

954
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:16,829
and again like kids in the dorm who were

955
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:18,720
smoking weed those kids got caught and

956
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:20,849
they got thrown out of the dorms the

957
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,889
kids who were taking that same nut press

958
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:24,480
in the oil and doing dabs there in the

959
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:26,339
dorm fine because they weren't there

960
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,519
there's no stink in their room so I

961
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:32,519
think kids and the whole generation of

962
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:35,579
people acclimated to doing concentrates

963
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:38,219
and they needed to have a way and rosin

964
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:40,858
was that was that way that they can you

965
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:42,689
know that they can you know and I think

966
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:44,730
you know whether Church had something to

967
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:47,820
do that we were part of that wave of

968
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:49,289
getting the information out and you know

969
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,030
I mean now you there's a hundred

970
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:53,789
different presses that you can get and

971
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:56,519
yeah it's still a just a straightener

972
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:58,500

the first thing I did that much yeah but

988
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:42,750
it was it was Nick who did it with a

989
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:45,180
Dewalt first so I'm giving props to Nick

990
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:47,338
Bradley on chromecast Church yeah cuz he

991
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:49,079
was I don't know one guy got to give him

992
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:51,570
the others a thing we got another guy

993
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,539
who put it on vices that led to t-shirt

994
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:55,740
presses that led to the Sasquatch that

995
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:57,570
led to all different things we got

996
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:59,159
hammock clamps now there's all kinds of

997
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,440
great claps out there squishes rather

998
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:03,509
than in company well I think also it

999
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,450
brought a lot of attention to the

1000
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:08,640
growers and and the method of growing

1001
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:10,439
because you know some of the you know

1002
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,079
benefits that we talked about when

1003
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,519
you're using a solvent and you're going

1004
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,809
through that process it's a refinement

1005
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:20,789
and you're trying to decontaminate and

1006
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:24,029
centralize your result like if your goal

1007
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:28,289
is to get all THCA or all THC I mean

1008
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:31,859
that's why you solvents and if you know

1009
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:33,300
what you're doing you can you can have a

1010
00:45:31,858 --> 00:45:36,659
little bit more I guess you'd say

1011
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:38,880
forgiveness whereas going through like a

1012
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:41,969
rosin you're smoking everything that was

1013
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,019
on that plant so I think what it did

1014
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:44,579
because it remember there's that big

1015
00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:46,320
explosion of rosin and then there was

1016
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:48,269
that realization of wait a minute wait a

1017
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,000
minute we're pressing all of the

1018
00:45:48,269 --> 00:45:53,608
possible oils and everything on that

1019
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,039
plant through a little tiny screen and

1020
00:45:53,608 --> 00:45:58,289
out comes oil so what about the bug

1021
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:59,730
juice what about this we started joking

1022
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:01,108
about but then it became a real thing

1023
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:02,699
because you're gonna press p.m. you're

1024
00:46:01,108 --> 00:46:04,889
gonna press pesticides you're gonna do

1025
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:06,809
you're gonna concentrate everything else

1026
00:46:04,889 --> 00:46:09,118
so now put a microscope back on the

1027
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:12,980
growers okay there is this organic

1028
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:16,500
at-home way to to make oil but then

1029
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:19,409
what's the flower ants have to be clean

1030
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,909
yeah so I think that Hastert's also

1031
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:24,539
helped there because we brought a lot of

1032
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:28,289
attention to organic growing clean

1033
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:30,000
medicine you know and we were we were

1034
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:32,639
kind of we were talking about that first

1035
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,380
we were saying oh well you're right

1036
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,028
a lot of BHO makers there's all memes

1037
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,220
and all kinds of crazy stuff going back

1038
00:46:36,028 --> 00:46:41,909
to forth like if you smoke cross in

1039
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:44,038
you're gay you know it are turns you gay

1040
00:46:41,909 --> 00:46:46,170
or something it was all these like back

1041
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:48,059
and forth but at the end of the day they

1042
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:51,150
are cut you know they it did bring a lot

1043
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:52,650
of attention to that so you know when

1044
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:54,900
something becomes easy like that that

1045
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:57,480
you could do at home you just got to be

1046
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,700
extremely aware and conscious of the

1047
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,318
actual starting material because you're

1048
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:04,230
concentrating whatever that grow or put

1049
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:06,538
on there that's why I still you know

1050
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:08,369
I've always liked just kind of like

1051
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:10,559
washing the plant first or trying to

1052
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:12,599
separate the resin even if you even if

1053
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,089
you may it's so like an outdoor even if

1054
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:17,970
you just did everything dry sift you

1055
00:47:15,088 --> 00:47:19,980
still could wash the dry sift and just

1056
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:23,608
wash off anything that would be on the

1057
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:26,039
resin so I just want to say that I feel

1058
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:28,440
extremely gay after smoking rosin oh

1059
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:31,829
yeah it just brings my levels up I feel

1060
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:35,789
happy I feel i reaiiy feel gay yeah I

1061
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:38,700
mean that's the point of it it's hard to

1062
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:41,039
feel bad when you feel great resin in

1063
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:44,879
Jamaica they make it with a bat and they

1064
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:47,278
call it batty boy hash oh my god that is

1065
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,240
not true that's not true raga Torrey

1066
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:53,518
term Sam has the lowbrow humor that's

1067
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:54,929
that well at least you know at least you

1068
00:47:53,518 --> 00:47:56,818
know it's like the ghost it's like in

1069
00:47:54,929 --> 00:47:59,250
the movie the Ghostbusters when they

1070
00:47:56,818 --> 00:48:02,099
spray you with the pink gel you know of

1071
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:04,079
the goodness and they're like and then

1072
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:05,818
that the guys get you know spray down

1073
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,400
and they're just like totally in love

1074
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:12,058
and hey man everything's great you know

1075
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,259
that's like the rosin experience you

1076
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:14,490
know that's I'm alright with that

1077
00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:16,199
experience at least you're not filled

1078
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:18,088
with hate you know what well that's just

1079
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:19,919
it could you imagine the rosin community

1080
00:48:18,088 --> 00:48:22,318
making memes that are like if you smoke

1081
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,358
BHO you're gay like think of like that's

1082
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,338
like like that's some twelve-year-old

1083
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:29,338
ignorant [ __ ] right there like that's

1084
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:31,558
like that's just very strange to bring

1085
00:48:29,338 --> 00:48:36,929
in someone's sexuality and to try and

1086
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:39,720
like wait a minute sell in a new kind of

1087
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:41,969
pot called sex pot for women it's

1088
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:44,788
supposed to make you have more and more

1089
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:46,259
frequent and longer orgasms so that's

1090
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:51,210
the same thing and it

1091
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:54,750
timeout women have orgasms well they do

1092
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:56,010
unless they're married to you I just was

1093
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:58,280
getting a laugh out a couple of the

1094
00:48:56,010 --> 00:49:02,180
married guys on the panel it's fine

1095
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:05,340
little laughing little having fun

1096
00:49:02,179 --> 00:49:10,980
all right King Justin Hudson that seems

1097
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:14,640
a little off but all right yeah because

1098
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:17,130
I did because I do think there's some

1099
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:18,750
valid information there then let's lead

1100
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:20,220
up to that paper because that paper

1101
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,599
there's a part of the discussion that we

1102
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:23,489
completely missed which was another

1103
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,529
conversation that hashed Church was very

1104
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:27,959
much involved in and helped propel and

1105
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:29,910
you yourself Tony was a huge part of

1106
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,220
which is blue river and the first

1107
00:49:29,909 --> 00:49:35,219
cannabis derived terpenes that are

1108
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:37,199
actually made available to people so

1109
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:39,618
they can smell them and try them and

1110
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:42,989
experience them and this was also a huge

1111
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:45,420
huge part of the conversation that I

1112
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:49,079
personally saw grow out of hash Church

1113
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:50,940
and spread like a wildfire so that's you

1114
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:53,579
know leading up to the paper that we're

1115
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:55,200
about to discuss is the conversation

1116
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:56,969
that was I mean keep in mind it's not

1117
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,739
like we started this conversation Sam

1118
00:49:56,969 --> 00:50:01,379
started this conversation almost twenty

1119
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:03,059
years ago but it goes to show you when

1120
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,039
the time is right the time is right

1121
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:07,469
because even K from trichome

1122
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:09,090
technologies was had been on it for I

1123
00:50:07,469 --> 00:50:11,459
don't know if it was two years or three

1124
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:14,130
years or if he wants to say 10 or 15

1125
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:16,320
years but the bottom line is nobody was

1126
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:19,349
doing [ __ ] about it until Tony and

1127
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:22,590
Horatio stepped into the ring until they

1128
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:24,750
both decided I'm gonna try my my hand at

1129
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:26,608
making some terpenes boom Tony had

1130
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,719
terpenes like [ __ ] two weeks later I

1131
00:50:26,608 --> 00:50:29,730
couldn't even believe it I was like what

1132
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:31,469
the [ __ ] dude that's crazy like what do

1133
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:33,710
you like what do you mean you just made

1134
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:36,209
terpenes and then I kind of shamed

1135
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:38,309
Horatio maybe a couple of months later I

1136
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:40,559
was like listen Tony had those Terps

1137
00:50:38,309 --> 00:50:43,079
like a week or two later you got to get

1138
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,920
on the ball and Horatio had terpenes

1139
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:48,539
like maybe a week or two after that and

1140
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,150
for me those were the first two

1141
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:53,789
available terpenes that's great that Sam

1142
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:55,440
was the first he showed me pure you know

1143
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:57,150
fruit based terpenes or plant based

1144
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,320
terpenes and the modulating effect that

1145
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:00,910
they can have on cannabinoids

1146
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,500
and Kay was one of the first people to

1147
00:51:00,909 --> 00:51:05,739
talk to me about cannabis derived

1148
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:09,130
terpenes and terpenoids but tony was the

1149
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:12,699
first person to put that [ __ ] in my hand

1150
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:13,630
to put it under my nose to put it in my

1151
00:51:12,699 --> 00:51:16,000
dad Brig

1152
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:17,920
and Horatio was the second so I got to

1153
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,570
give both of those guys mad props before

1154
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,119
we start this next part of the

1155
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:24,550
conversation because that was a huge

1156
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:27,039
that was as big as rosin in my opinion

1157
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:29,740
making these terpenes become available

1158
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:31,360
and not only that but lighting the you

1159
00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:33,099
know it's funny because I remember Kay

1160
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,809
being like oh I was a little worried

1161
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:36,250
about kind of wanting to put it out

1162
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:37,840
there I you know he was worried that

1163
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,800
people were gonna do it wrong this that

1164
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,450
the other thing and there's that's

1165
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,070
always the one side of things and then

1166
00:51:40,449 --> 00:51:44,349
you have the other side of things which

1167
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:45,880
is well you know why don't we just put

1168
00:51:44,349 --> 00:51:47,739
it out into the world and we can let the

1169
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,510
world decide and we can all kind

1170
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:52,059
bioassay and go through this together

1171
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:55,420
and that leads us up to where we are

1172
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:57,279
well and I would add to I would say this

1173
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,630
that in Johnny beat was there a lot of

1174
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,360
the times to when we were in Amsterdam

1175
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:02,950
and did this and there was even and a

1176
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:06,010
lot of people missed this that there was

1177
00:52:02,949 --> 00:52:07,839
like when we were doing the steam tech I

1178
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:10,300
was like oh yeah this is basically the

1179
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,670
fail tech and there was some the

1180
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:14,650
terpenes were different and and they as

1181
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:18,430
there's not as there wasn't a purity or

1182
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:21,820
stability factor to it or replication

1183
00:52:18,429 --> 00:52:23,710
and so Kay called those artifacts you

1184
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:26,620
know barely barely shadows of their

1185
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:29,650
former self right and and the other the

1186
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:32,469
other issues I mean people don't realize

1187
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:35,170
but we had this conversation for eight

1188
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:38,109
months maybe even a year before it

1189
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:39,369
actually got released oh yeah because we

1190
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:41,440
were the whole goal I was trying to

1191
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:43,630
create get these terpenes back into the

1192
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,450
t'car of inactivated versions of

1193
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:48,550
piranhas and stuff but these were these

1194
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:50,199
were just like little side texts or like

1195
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:52,600
oh maybe we could smoke this but I

1196
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:55,659
remember was a year of us talking about

1197
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:58,509
it and I had the same issue of releasing

1198
00:52:55,659 --> 00:53:00,849
it because there's good and bad that

1199
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:02,320
comes with that a it'll get out there

1200
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:05,139
people try to do it so I'm going to do

1201
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:09,340
it with the you know in a way that may

1202
00:53:05,139 --> 00:53:13,328
harm people and looking back I think

1203
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:19,220
that like releasing you know pure form

1204
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:21,440
terpenes without like you know the full

1205
00:53:19,219 --> 00:53:22,848
studies always irritated me so I just

1206
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,240
want you know want to put it out there I

1207
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:28,009
do feel that like we didn't know you

1208
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:29,508
know and we had these conversations on

1209
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:31,880
hash Church and said what do you think a

1210
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:34,730
safe range is you know how much is

1211
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,950
president a flower flowers can have up

1212
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:39,289
to eight nine you know I've seen 10

1213
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:41,778
percent terpene profiles on flowers very

1214
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:45,500
rarely but you know sometimes it's one

1215
00:53:41,778 --> 00:53:47,659
two three much higher on a concentrate

1216
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,699
made from that same yeah you could try

1217
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:50,179
sit in full mode have hit over ten

1218
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:52,879
percent

1219
00:53:50,179 --> 00:53:54,649
terpene profiles so you knew that it was

1220
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,630
there we were smoking it but once you

1221
00:53:54,650 --> 00:54:01,009
put it into pure forum people start

1222
00:53:56,630 --> 00:54:02,838
dipping it the whole dip dip in dabs and

1223
00:54:01,009 --> 00:54:07,940
all of that stuff like looking back how

1224
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:10,130
how far terpenes actually go and how and

1225
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:12,470
how far you what the use is now I can

1226
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:14,809
turn one milliliter into a thousand

1227
00:54:12,469 --> 00:54:16,368
beverages and yeah you know and like

1228
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:19,160
back then it was like one drop per

1229
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:22,970
beverage it was like when we were just

1230
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:25,068
pouring like those horrible it's like

1231
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:27,169
looking back it's just like a little

1232
00:54:25,068 --> 00:54:30,558
juvenile you know so I would admit to

1233
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:32,000
the the fact that like the going that

1234
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,740
intense but it's like anything else

1235
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,960
you're like you find something new and

1236
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:38,538
you want to see how far you can take it

1237
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,088
and at some point you have to know is

1238
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:43,309
just gonna be okay for me as an

1239
00:54:41,088 --> 00:54:45,078
individual and if it's not it's okay you

1240
00:54:43,309 --> 00:54:47,660
might still do it you just need to know

1241
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:49,430
what the safety the safety is you know

1242
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:53,268
there's just like a jumping off the side

1243
00:54:49,429 --> 00:54:55,788
of a building on a bungee cord may save

1244
00:54:53,268 --> 00:54:58,758
your mate may work it may not cool up

1245
00:54:55,789 --> 00:55:00,380
jumping you know I know everybody showed

1246
00:54:58,759 --> 00:55:02,210
you a lot of good stuff with regards to

1247
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,940
terpenes but I want to be the first guy

1248
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:08,358
to to show you a turkey and being

1249
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:11,798
created so so this is a strain of

1250
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:14,480
different bacteria actually creating

1251
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:19,750
terpene so that that bloom right there

1252
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:23,719
is is an actual picture of a mature p in

1253
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:26,619
process so I want to be the bacteria

1254
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:26,618
again that shows you that

1255
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:32,710
so explain that a little more so the red

1256
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:36,360
circle is that a cell that's a terpene

1257
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:40,150
that's an actual enduring metabolite

1258
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:43,000
from the the combination of bacteria

1259
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:45,760
creating a smell and actually producing

1260
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:52,420
an exudate essentially or secondary

1261
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:55,840
metabolite which is a 13 blue you know

1262
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:59,039
what that's just like right on par for

1263
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:01,570
the hash church bar that has been said

1264
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:05,909
I'm always glad when you show up Peter

1265
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:08,620
it's pretty cool on the cabbage you a

1266
00:56:05,909 --> 00:56:10,329
turkey meat so we'll go all the way back

1267
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:12,489
to the small the small right the

1268
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:16,179
molecular and you guys so much with it

1269
00:56:12,489 --> 00:56:20,709
and so so honored to be here with you

1270
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:24,669
guys talking Terps well it is a big a

1271
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:26,470
big part of the conversation as big as

1272
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:29,440
rosin as big as anything else that we've

1273
00:56:26,469 --> 00:56:31,209
talked about that's a big big one of the

1274
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,700
big conversations that came out of hash

1275
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:35,619
church for sure was just all of this

1276
00:56:33,699 --> 00:56:38,589
interesting terpene information and

1277
00:56:35,619 --> 00:56:40,900
we're still like it's why you know this

1278
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:43,180
this discussion that we're gonna have

1279
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:45,039
about heating up terpenes and heating up

1280
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:47,980
terpenes too hot the degradation and

1281
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:50,079
what happens it's why exactly when blue

1282
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:51,940
river was started that blue river wasn't

1283
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,400
saying this is what you should do you

1284
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:56,349
should take these and take huge giant

1285
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,240
dabs and inhale them what we were doing

1286
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:58,809
ourselves was bio a saying that very

1287
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:00,489
thing

1288
00:56:58,809 --> 00:57:02,730
I was hitting pure terpenes through the

1289
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:05,319
vapor exhale and to this day I'm

1290
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:08,590
convinced that it was good it was in no

1291
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:10,450
way shape or form did it feel bad but it

1292
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:12,670
was also a very delicate heat it was a

1293
00:57:10,449 --> 00:57:15,159
very small amount of terpenes and did we

1294
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:16,720
ever get too much did we ever dip too

1295
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:19,420
much where I was like that's not an

1296
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:22,809
enjoyable hit absolutely in the

1297
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:25,119
beginning Tony was the destroyer this

1298
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:29,469
person was first times in Amsterdam's

1299
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:33,880
word our temperatures remember used to

1300
00:57:29,469 --> 00:57:36,059
dab at 750 than 700 then 500 now I'm

1301
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:39,640
like anyone over 550 I'm like

1302
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:42,299
well honestly for me the vape exhale is

1303
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:45,429
one of the only units that does not

1304
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:47,860
degrade the rip in a way like I can hit

1305
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:50,889
pure Terps off the vape exhale in those

1306
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:54,550
little quartz cartridges that you slide

1307
00:57:50,889 --> 00:57:57,129
into the tube and it is super enjoyable

1308
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:59,140
you just at any temperature I have a

1309
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:01,720
hard time enjoying it off of any nail

1310
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:04,150
where it hits direct and and and

1311
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:07,029
evaporates it's just violent and now we

1312
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:09,910
have those really long we have those

1313
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:12,160
really long skinny I just put a drop in

1314
00:58:09,909 --> 00:58:13,719
it use no heat and you just have you

1315
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:15,969
just thought make it in you just breathe

1316
00:58:13,719 --> 00:58:18,279
in yeah well that's also all of these

1317
00:58:15,969 --> 00:58:20,139
little cool tops that have been designed

1318
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,970
that you can put terpenes into so you

1319
00:58:20,139 --> 00:58:24,789
have your little turf cap that you're

1320
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:26,439
hitting fresh terpenes that you're just

1321
00:58:24,789 --> 00:58:28,179
not heating up at all but it's going

1322
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,610
through the pipe and giving you that

1323
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:31,839
sort of you know it's definitely one of

1324
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,880
the things that have attracted us to

1325
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,950
canvas so it makes sense that in the

1326
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,289
near future that we will take it as far

1327
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:40,899
as it can be taken that much science

1328
00:58:38,289 --> 00:58:43,000
will be looked at and that you know we

1329
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:45,280
the the guinea pigs who are using these

1330
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:49,030
things in the next 20 or 30 or 40 years

1331
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:53,769
will be able to clearly show people the

1332
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:56,140
pros and cons yeah one thing to add on

1333
00:58:53,769 --> 00:58:58,210
that before Scout dawn goes into this we

1334
00:58:56,139 --> 00:59:00,099
once had a conversation about color and

1335
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:03,190
how I got in that argument where

1336
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:04,659
terpenes were seemed to give off some

1337
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:06,730
kind of color because of all this

1338
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:09,009
different stuff that out like if we had

1339
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:10,960
the same base of hash we used different

1340
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:13,300
terpenes we had different quote-unquote

1341
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:17,619
color hash remember that mark mm-hm and

1342
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:19,420
then scale down and then so there's some

1343
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:21,219
things that I would wanted to update on

1344
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:23,740
that because I've gone through a lot of

1345
00:59:21,219 --> 00:59:26,649
profiles now and a lot of different ways

1346
00:59:23,739 --> 00:59:32,309
of using terpenes whether it's in with

1347
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:35,289
like you know a raw full spectrum with

1348
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:38,889
ta-ta like from from a hash rosin or

1349
00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:43,360
live rosin or from flowers or activated

1350
00:59:38,889 --> 00:59:44,829
versions what I think it is is so like

1351
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:48,610
so let's look at trippy and allene

1352
00:59:44,829 --> 00:59:49,900
versus humulin right so things that are

1353
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:51,760
very high interpreting

1354
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:53,769
so you would get like we've got one

1355
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:57,520
that's like a Dutch treat

1356
00:59:53,769 --> 01:00:02,818
Jack Frost would be and they're always

1357
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:05,528
they always produce a oil that's like a

1358
01:00:02,818 --> 01:00:09,699
clip like this this particular color

1359
01:00:05,528 --> 01:00:11,769
it's never a butter it's never it's it's

1360
01:00:09,699 --> 01:00:13,808
it's never a butter it's always an oil

1361
01:00:11,769 --> 01:00:16,449
it's always this particular color that

1362
01:00:13,809 --> 01:00:18,369
comes out some people would think that

1363
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:20,679
oh yeah it's not a pure white color so

1364
01:00:18,369 --> 01:00:22,510
it's like this like it's not as

1365
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:25,239
desirable but it's always got that same

1366
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:28,059
time kind of taste and I think what it

1367
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:30,818
is and you know that what I see is a

1368
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:32,950
limonene data carefully and terpene

1369
01:00:30,818 --> 01:00:36,088
alene if those three combinations are

1370
01:00:32,949 --> 01:00:39,159
the highest peaks you get a certain

1371
01:00:36,088 --> 01:00:42,308
consistency of the oil which makes a

1372
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:45,608
certain reflection or color based on

1373
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:47,260
that that that profile influence and if

1374
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:50,348
you look at something that's very high

1375
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:53,589
in THC a meaning the plant itself and

1376
01:00:50,349 --> 01:00:55,390
the resin on the plant itself was was

1377
01:00:53,588 --> 01:00:57,219
fresh and didn't really activate much

1378
01:00:55,389 --> 01:01:01,690
and you were able to get like an 80%

1379
01:00:57,219 --> 01:01:04,868
rosin in THC a form and you didn't have

1380
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:08,108
any terpene allene and you had and you

1381
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:11,140
had more of a the humulin and the

1382
01:01:08,108 --> 01:01:14,199
beta-carotene and the pines you would

1383
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:16,118
start to see more of a butter and that

1384
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:17,469
has to do a little bit with the heads

1385
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:19,990
and things but i found that it really

1386
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:21,818
has to do with the profiles and then it

1387
01:01:19,989 --> 01:01:24,338
comes down to heat versus no heat and

1388
01:01:21,818 --> 01:01:25,690
different semi activation points and

1389
01:01:24,338 --> 01:01:27,788
different things so what I thought was

1390
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:31,210
the color wasn't necessarily the color

1391
01:01:27,789 --> 01:01:32,980
but was more of the top tier profiles of

1392
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:38,710
these terpenes that have the influence

1393
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:46,150
on the consistency of the actual extract

1394
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:48,130
that makes any sense somewhat makes a

1395
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:51,510
lot of sense to me Tony it seems like

1396
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:54,700
terpenes in some way would be a sort of

1397
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:57,130
lubricant or solvent if you will to help

1398
01:01:54,699 --> 01:01:59,588
my internet drop down a little bit these

1399
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:02,039
gotta catch all of what you said can you

1400
01:01:59,588 --> 01:02:03,880
go back just and just ask the question

1401
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:06,069
succinctly if

1402
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,838
yeah no problem so what I was just a

1403
01:02:06,068 --> 01:02:09,308
little bit of what you said yeah I was

1404
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:11,679
just saying back then I thought it was

1405
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:13,539
the color was the terpene thing and I'm

1406
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:14,889
saying later that I don't think it's it

1407
01:02:13,539 --> 01:02:17,440
wasn't that at all

1408
01:02:14,889 --> 01:02:18,788
in fact what it is is now when I've been

1409
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,818
it's like so what we've been doing with

1410
01:02:18,789 --> 01:02:24,220
our oil is taking like you know

1411
01:02:21,818 --> 01:02:26,228
extensive testing of the flour then the

1412
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:28,389
extract and our final like Trinity oil

1413
01:02:26,228 --> 01:02:31,139
you know and when you start to look at

1414
01:02:28,389 --> 01:02:33,699
all of the different terpene profiles

1415
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:35,318
because we're taking cannabis drippings

1416
01:02:33,699 --> 01:02:37,469
from the same variety and pairing them

1417
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:39,969
with the extracts and they're the same

1418
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:42,308
terpene profile but you get a different

1419
01:02:39,969 --> 01:02:44,018
percentage and consistency so as you go

1420
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:48,700
from five to ten fifteen to thirty

1421
01:02:44,018 --> 01:02:50,949
percent if the if the trio of those

1422
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:53,798
terpenes if the top one was terpene

1423
01:02:50,949 --> 01:02:57,098
alene almost every single time I've seen

1424
01:02:53,798 --> 01:03:00,728
the oil come out like this golden SAP

1425
01:02:57,099 --> 01:03:02,798
it's never butter and so when you look

1426
01:03:00,728 --> 01:03:05,768
at other ones like strawberry banana goo

1427
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:07,960
it's always a white butter no matter

1428
01:03:05,768 --> 01:03:09,308
what and so we talked about hydrophilic

1429
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:11,559
or hydrophobic and what they're doing

1430
01:03:09,309 --> 01:03:14,829
with the moisture but ultimately the

1431
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:16,960
terpene profile in the in the top three

1432
01:03:14,829 --> 01:03:20,440
in the way that it's setting will change

1433
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:23,920
this this consistency or this response

1434
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:26,469
which then appears to change the color

1435
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:29,430
but it's not a color thing it's it's how

1436
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:33,909
the oil is these are all high THC

1437
01:03:29,429 --> 01:03:36,429
extracts yeah and then if you take those

1438
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:38,558
butters and let's say try to act double

1439
01:03:36,429 --> 01:03:41,108
boil them down and act semi activator

1440
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:44,289
activate obviously the color then also

1441
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:46,838
changes as well but yes if we're

1442
01:03:44,289 --> 01:03:49,390
comparing just straight as raw as you

1443
01:03:46,838 --> 01:03:53,889
could go on on whether it was a flower

1444
01:03:49,389 --> 01:03:56,018
rosin or a hash rosin yeah so different

1445
01:03:53,889 --> 01:03:58,028
combinations of terpenes have different

1446
01:03:56,018 --> 01:04:00,879
solvating abilities in terms of their

1447
01:03:58,028 --> 01:04:03,248
abilities to keep thca in solution right

1448
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,588
so certain combinations of terpenes are

1449
01:04:03,248 --> 01:04:08,318
can be able to hold t8 ca and solution

1450
01:04:05,588 --> 01:04:09,728
as well as other combinations and so

1451
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:11,978
what you're seeing is just a

1452
01:04:09,728 --> 01:04:15,779
manifestation of that certainly like

1453
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:19,679
ones that are much more solvating and

1454
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:22,040
the higher-level terpenes that are found

1455
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:26,279
or this desk whatever fiends like

1456
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:29,969
cheerio Faline and which are less

1457
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:31,890
volatile um have different flavor

1458
01:04:29,969 --> 01:04:34,199
profiles and sort of seem to be

1459
01:04:31,889 --> 01:04:38,159
ubiquitous it's just kind of like your

1460
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:40,379
your trade off on gaining that turn

1461
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:42,809
being profile in in the flower from what

1462
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:44,880
I understand and then bringing that

1463
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:50,849
through and reincorporating that into

1464
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:53,910
some processed purified fraction of THC

1465
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:57,030
a is that that that's what you're doing

1466
01:04:53,909 --> 01:05:00,029
yeah what I'm doing what you know what

1467
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:01,910
do and I think I did the way to view

1468
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:04,440
your question again just going back and

1469
01:05:01,909 --> 01:05:07,108
viewing the whole terpene thing is I

1470
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,750
look like a musical ensemble like an

1471
01:05:07,108 --> 01:05:11,639
orchestra is that you have to set the

1472
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:13,199
volume of the orchestra correctly from

1473
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:15,239
where it was set in the plan right you

1474
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:17,449
can turn up the volume really loud but

1475
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:19,589
then yeah you're you're carrying

1476
01:05:17,449 --> 01:05:23,608
basically what you're trying to do is

1477
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:27,269
keep the relative in the chirpy he's the

1478
01:05:23,608 --> 01:05:30,630
same so the flavor in your in your

1479
01:05:27,269 --> 01:05:32,750
consumable remains what it was in the

1480
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:35,000
plan which is a delicate balance

1481
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:37,889
especially when you talk about

1482
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:41,070
thoroughly treating any of these most

1483
01:05:37,889 --> 01:05:43,710
sensitive of terpenes and monoterpenes

1484
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:45,480
and as Sam has talked about and we've

1485
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:51,358
talked about a bunch of times on Church

1486
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:53,789
the curing chemistry that happens post

1487
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:56,608
harvesting and curing me being separate

1488
01:05:53,789 --> 01:05:59,730
from drying so drying bulk removal of

1489
01:05:56,608 --> 01:06:02,338
water but then a process by which there

1490
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:05,460
is chemistry that's happening still on

1491
01:06:02,338 --> 01:06:07,500
the plant but the plants no longer alive

1492
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:09,599
but there's sort of terpenes that are

1493
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,880
coming to their thermodynamic dead end

1494
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,130
before they actually present themselves

1495
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,680
and what now is a very very different

1496
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:20,640
flavor than what you would get in a

1497
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:23,519
freshly frozen extract you know so what

1498
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:25,348
I was getting at god yeah what you just

1499
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:28,380
said earlier those really important so

1500
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:29,130
terpene alene is acting like something

1501
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:33,028
more

1502
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:35,910
of a salty solid that's correct right

1503
01:06:33,028 --> 01:06:37,980
and and so what you see I mean you know

1504
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:43,170
like the holy water is all those like

1505
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:45,150
high fractions which have a lot of use

1506
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:48,150
EODs are kind of like orange sort of

1507
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:50,639
like a bright orange more orange than a

1508
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:53,338
brownish those are typically high in

1509
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:55,318
Turpan alene Turpin Leah's got got one

1510
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:58,500
of these double bonds that could precess

1511
01:06:55,318 --> 01:07:00,690
around the ring and a variety of

1512
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:02,880
different geometric isomers and all of

1513
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:05,179
these are different peaks in the GC and

1514
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:07,829
they all have different you know further

1515
01:07:05,179 --> 01:07:09,230
oxidation manifold some of them oxidize

1516
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:11,548
into turkey noids

1517
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:13,349
and you know again some of these

1518
01:07:11,548 --> 01:07:18,000
degradation products that you're seeing

1519
01:07:13,349 --> 01:07:21,059
i I was really excited when I first saw

1520
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,009
this paper come out because from

1521
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:26,450
everything that we've been saying here

1522
01:07:23,009 --> 01:07:28,829
on hash Church Tony right that ya

1523
01:07:26,449 --> 01:07:30,899
terpenes at room temperature are

1524
01:07:28,829 --> 01:07:33,509
different than terpenes when you heat

1525
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:35,430
them up that may have been like one of

1526
01:07:33,509 --> 01:07:39,960
the first things I said on his church

1527
01:07:35,429 --> 01:07:41,518
right go back to like when Horatio first

1528
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:44,519
dragged me and say hey Mark we're

1529
01:07:41,518 --> 01:07:47,098
talking about chemistry we need we need

1530
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:48,538
we need you to help us understand that's

1531
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:51,000
how you gonna brought in it was a

1532
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:52,829
question around beam stability and

1533
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,909
whether or not and it was just before

1534
01:07:52,829 --> 01:08:00,089
the hash he sheen paper had come out and

1535
01:07:56,909 --> 01:08:02,129
I had said look these are reactive

1536
01:08:00,088 --> 01:08:04,768
species that we have reactive double

1537
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:06,329
bonds and a lot of these things if you

1538
01:08:04,768 --> 01:08:09,179
shine light on them in the presence of

1539
01:08:06,329 --> 01:08:11,130
air they form hydro peroxides and then

1540
01:08:09,179 --> 01:08:15,389
they start degrading into all kinds of

1541
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:17,279
different looks like methacrylate other

1542
01:08:15,389 --> 01:08:21,000
things that yeah you don't want to be

1543
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:22,920
deeply inhaling into your lungs and you

1544
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,960
know again when this paper first came

1545
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:28,350
out I was really excited because this

1546
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,448
study has to be done but as I read the

1547
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:32,850
paper and I became just a little

1548
01:08:30,448 --> 01:08:35,219
disappointed on level of science and

1549
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:36,690
what they did and I think the most

1550
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:39,088
important thing that comes out of a

1551
01:08:36,689 --> 01:08:41,219
study like this is not to critique the

1552
01:08:39,088 --> 01:08:42,789
level of science which to me I give

1553
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:44,588
about a c-minus tell you

1554
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:46,569
truth I would have had that graduate

1555
01:08:44,588 --> 01:08:48,789
student go back and repeat that thing

1556
01:08:46,569 --> 01:08:51,100
like 10 more times I would have had them

1557
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:52,479
do a different I would just I would have

1558
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:54,430
done the study differently let's just

1559
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:55,929
say it that way but the most important

1560
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:57,909
thing that comes out of science that's

1561
01:08:55,930 --> 01:09:00,520
published like this which is maybe not

1562
01:08:57,909 --> 01:09:02,829
the best is is this discussion that

1563
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:04,810
we're having right now on how important

1564
01:09:02,829 --> 01:09:06,939
it is to do this and to do this

1565
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:08,740
carefully and notice that they use that

1566
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:10,809
Ammar which I'm excited about

1567
01:09:08,739 --> 01:09:12,969
and notice that what they're doing is

1568
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:17,200
they're showing a temperature dependence

1569
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:20,289
and so if you pull data markets if you

1570
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:26,309
could share the that link in the in the

1571
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:26,310
in the chat room so our viewers can yes

1572
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:37,870
we got a chem church again okay so if

1573
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:43,239
you go to if you go to in that link go

1574
01:09:37,869 --> 01:09:45,130
to figure one which tells a lot okay and

1575
01:09:43,239 --> 01:09:49,048
and what you can see is the temperature

1576
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:51,940
dependence as a function of methacrylate

1577
01:09:49,048 --> 01:09:56,649
being measured at the nanogram level

1578
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:58,509
which an anagram is a 10 to minus 9 it's

1579
01:09:56,649 --> 01:10:03,339
a very very succeeding least small

1580
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:05,560
amount of material but clearly within

1581
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:07,329
the error bars of the measurement you

1582
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:09,490
can see a temperature dependence on

1583
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:10,720
methacholine being generated as a

1584
01:10:09,489 --> 01:10:14,739
function of temperature

1585
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:16,930
now 526 degrees C let's see that's about

1586
01:10:14,739 --> 01:10:19,989
that's almost a thousand degrees isn't

1587
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:24,640
it did someone do that conversion for me

1588
01:10:19,989 --> 01:10:27,219
it's like nothing hot hot hot it's hot

1589
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:29,110
right so again I think that that's an

1590
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:30,850
important finding from the study but

1591
01:10:29,109 --> 01:10:33,729
we've already talked about that before

1592
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:37,810
work so if you go to let's see what's

1593
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:41,519
there next table ok scheme 1 they talked

1594
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:44,230
about some of this the structures of a

1595
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:48,190
combination of merci limonene a little

1596
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:49,899
loool created low temps that's the

1597
01:10:48,189 --> 01:10:51,879
problem they are not taking low temp

1598
01:10:49,899 --> 01:10:54,819
tabs they're like the cleaning

1599
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,650
temperature they're taking glowy's right

1600
01:10:54,819 --> 01:10:58,259
is if that

1601
01:10:55,649 --> 01:11:00,269
no message that you know that the the

1602
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:04,409
chemistry the degradation chemistry is a

1603
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:07,530
fashion of of the temperature but if you

1604
01:11:04,408 --> 01:11:11,429
look now at table one down below where

1605
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:14,849
it says they're measuring both

1606
01:11:11,429 --> 01:11:17,460
methacrylate and benzene at the nanogram

1607
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:19,350
per milligram level let's see that's a

1608
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:24,179
that's a part per million so these

1609
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:28,890
numbers are in parts per million in 27

1610
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:31,279
coming out of fire oh gee with limonene

1611
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:34,289
I guess they're just doing this on neat

1612
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:35,880
this is also this is also I think they

1613
01:11:34,289 --> 01:11:38,010
clarified it wasn't like a triple

1614
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:43,010
molecular distilled oil it was just this

1615
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:45,119
this was like just BHO extraction yeah

1616
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:49,890
right but I mean I think that that's

1617
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:51,179
valid for the study this numbers yeah so

1618
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:52,829
if you don't have two product

1619
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:54,539
quantification I mean I think these

1620
01:11:52,829 --> 01:11:58,710
numbers are important here so it says

1621
01:11:54,539 --> 01:12:00,719
because dabbing topography it's talking

1622
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:02,489
about you know being able to assess the

1623
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:07,408
temperatures but what they're seeing is

1624
01:12:02,488 --> 01:12:09,779
that with method crowing 185 plus or

1625
01:12:07,408 --> 01:12:12,299
minus 11 parts per billion at a

1626
01:12:09,779 --> 01:12:15,509
temperature of again 526 which is up

1627
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:18,929
around 900 degrees well [ __ ] don't

1628
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:20,360
[ __ ] tab at 900 degrees and look what

1629
01:12:18,929 --> 01:12:25,710
happens when you drop your dad

1630
01:12:20,359 --> 01:12:28,289
temperature 22 there undetectable okay

1631
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:30,270
so I think that this does tell the story

1632
01:12:28,289 --> 01:12:33,448
of the temperature of the nail being

1633
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:35,790
very very important but I would have

1634
01:12:33,448 --> 01:12:36,869
done a more detailed more quantitative

1635
01:12:35,789 --> 01:12:39,149
study and again I don't want to be

1636
01:12:36,869 --> 01:12:41,369
critical too much I think it's important

1637
01:12:39,149 --> 01:12:43,710
how can we get that study happenin

1638
01:12:41,369 --> 01:12:46,500
Marcus also everything you said combined

1639
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:50,460
with also hitting it off of different

1640
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:52,979
surfaces hitting it off of time fire

1641
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:56,460
hitting it off of Commerce's conduction

1642
01:12:52,979 --> 01:12:57,750
hit it off is sick yeah yeah and also I

1643
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:59,460
mean I think what we've what we've

1644
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:01,079
talked about here on Church I mean this

1645
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:05,899
is obviously one thing that you can

1646
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:08,429
investigate which was that if you take

1647
01:13:05,899 --> 01:13:09,509
material and you put it inside a vial

1648
01:13:08,429 --> 01:13:11,250
and you put

1649
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:14,190
you know the nail material in there and

1650
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:18,659
now you heat that up well obviously it's

1651
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:20,669
got to be in a few sport silica you

1652
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:23,220
can't do this just a regular glass don't

1653
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:25,079
try this at home kids but if that can

1654
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:29,030
actually be taken up to temperature now

1655
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:31,859
you can actually study by headspace-gc

1656
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:34,710
the different profiles of what you're

1657
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:36,929
getting by examining different different

1658
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:39,449
nail materials and Jeff Raber did a

1659
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:42,900
study for hive nail again some time ago

1660
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:44,340
on this and I think Jeff's method which

1661
01:13:42,899 --> 01:13:47,279
I think was published I want to say two

1662
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:49,050
or three years ago was a little more

1663
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:50,489
sound and I think what I'm reading in

1664
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:52,710
this paper in terms of how they

1665
01:13:50,489 --> 01:13:54,829
collected their sample here I was

1666
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:58,230
excited about this until I found out

1667
01:13:54,829 --> 01:14:00,899
that you needed a cigarette smoking

1668
01:13:58,229 --> 01:14:03,629
machine which is how they conducted

1669
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:04,889
their studies and I was like ah [ __ ] how

1670
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:06,630
am I gonna repeat this they have a

1671
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:08,789
cigarette smoking miss you got you know

1672
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:10,380
but what am I gonna do my investors and

1673
01:14:08,789 --> 01:14:12,810
say oh I need to buy a cigarette smoking

1674
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:19,020
machine study this don't you have access

1675
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:21,360
to looks just pretty you know you'll

1676
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:24,270
have to admit but they were never

1677
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:24,899
finding this in herbal cannabis which is

1678
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:29,220
smoked it

1679
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:30,869
I believe 451 and if they would have

1680
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:34,050
found it it would have been reported a

1681
01:14:30,869 --> 01:14:38,609
long time ago right so I think that were

1682
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:40,770
the trend goes over that these materials

1683
01:14:38,609 --> 01:14:42,569
are in there the less likely they're

1684
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:45,870
gonna be pushed beyond the limit of

1685
01:14:42,569 --> 01:14:48,170
detection and again simply it totally

1686
01:14:45,869 --> 01:14:50,340
makes sense that at the higher

1687
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:53,279
temperatures you're seeing more

1688
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:54,569
degradation that's a that that almost

1689
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:56,460
looks like a first what we call

1690
01:14:54,569 --> 01:15:01,889
kinetically a first sort of relationship

1691
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:03,329
which is a typical in inari any a sense

1692
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:05,039
Arrhenius is a guy who figured out the

1693
01:15:03,329 --> 01:15:09,090
mathematics for this long time ago that

1694
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:11,519
there's a linear dependency they based

1695
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:15,960
on based on temperature and that's

1696
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:19,160
totally to be expected that's exactly

1697
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:22,828
what it comes down to is that is the

1698
01:15:19,159 --> 01:15:25,458
temperature and besides the surface is

1699
01:15:22,828 --> 01:15:28,128
but the temperatures is super key and

1700
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:32,398
what I also found was terpenes will

1701
01:15:28,128 --> 01:15:34,378
organically degra gate with a rosin and

1702
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:36,899
what I mean by that is if you start with

1703
01:15:34,378 --> 01:15:40,738
say a flower rosin that tests eighty

1704
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:43,469
percent it's seventy-six percent THC a

1705
01:15:40,738 --> 01:15:45,688
and four percent THC and you take that

1706
01:15:43,469 --> 01:15:50,038
and you use the same terpene profile

1707
01:15:45,689 --> 01:15:54,149
from that flower and saturate up to say

1708
01:15:50,038 --> 01:15:56,788
a 30% and let that sit six months it'll

1709
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:58,979
be fully activated work very close to

1710
01:15:56,788 --> 01:16:02,849
being activated which then tells you

1711
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:04,829
that terpenes have this other affective

1712
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:07,319
property that's going on - which is what

1713
01:16:04,828 --> 01:16:08,849
I thought was affecting color right

1714
01:16:07,319 --> 01:16:10,738
there's an aging mechanism that's

1715
01:16:08,849 --> 01:16:12,958
probably at work there and again that

1716
01:16:10,738 --> 01:16:15,208
you're right has a lot to do with not

1717
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:17,760
only taking something that starts out as

1718
01:16:15,208 --> 01:16:20,819
its life being clear and turning collar

1719
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:22,979
I've seen that color formation up and on

1720
01:16:20,819 --> 01:16:25,768
the road of that you're something down

1721
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:26,699
that's you know basically colorless by

1722
01:16:25,769 --> 01:16:28,889
the time you get it down it's like

1723
01:16:26,698 --> 01:16:31,138
yellowish and it starts to actually turn

1724
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:33,929
almost in front of your eyes because

1725
01:16:31,139 --> 01:16:36,719
it's being enclosed - now high

1726
01:16:33,929 --> 01:16:38,158
concentrations of oxygen in the plant a

1727
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:40,260
lot of these things are protected

1728
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:42,538
because they live within the waxy

1729
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:44,128
envelope of the plant itself and they're

1730
01:16:42,538 --> 01:16:46,018
not being exposed to the levels of

1731
01:16:44,128 --> 01:16:48,238
oxygen now that they're being sort of

1732
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:52,168
stripped from their their plant

1733
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:55,888
protective you know for me exposed and

1734
01:16:52,168 --> 01:17:00,389
they get off on that it does all almost

1735
01:16:55,889 --> 01:17:02,969
without exception have a shelf life in

1736
01:17:00,389 --> 01:17:06,779
that they'll either evaporate or they'll

1737
01:17:02,969 --> 01:17:09,179
degrade into a mostly yeah yellow darker

1738
01:17:06,779 --> 01:17:12,538
colored material than from which they

1739
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:16,248
came and and I said I kept flowers for a

1740
01:17:12,538 --> 01:17:20,128
year in the same condition in a vacuum

1741
01:17:16,248 --> 01:17:23,248
and even over a year the THC a on the

1742
01:17:20,128 --> 01:17:26,279
flowers will convert over to THC not all

1743
01:17:23,248 --> 01:17:30,358
the way but it could happen at 25 or 30

1744
01:17:26,279 --> 01:17:33,358
percent I kept them for two years

1745
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:34,910
not even in a vacuum just on the Shelf

1746
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:38,390
in the dark ever

1747
01:17:34,909 --> 01:17:47,479
temperatures and less than 10% converted

1748
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:50,570
from thca to THC if you have a jar Sam

1749
01:17:47,479 --> 01:17:53,269
like the stock down court in a jar they

1750
01:17:50,569 --> 01:17:55,969
were in a cardboard box

1751
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:59,270
oh but Eldon can hurt it only converted

1752
01:17:55,970 --> 01:18:01,880
10% in two years in two years that's

1753
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:03,890
interesting I was shocked and surprised

1754
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:06,710
yeah that's super interesting what kind

1755
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:11,660
of variety was that Scott

1756
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:13,039
oh well that's why it doesn't yeah I

1757
01:18:11,659 --> 01:18:16,699
mean maybe there was a protective

1758
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:20,050
envelope of terpenes stink containing

1759
01:18:16,699 --> 01:18:23,449
those buds keeping oxygen after years

1760
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:26,180
THC level was practically the same most

1761
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:29,590
of it was still in the form of THC a but

1762
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:35,060
most of the terpenes were gone Oh

1763
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:36,590
interesting so long story short with

1764
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:39,560
that article though it's so when we were

1765
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:41,180
talking about concentrations of ppm so

1766
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:45,260
think about this if something has like

1767
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:47,240
any kind of solvent left behind or

1768
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:49,100
residual and you hit it at a higher

1769
01:18:47,239 --> 01:18:51,500
temperature with a higher concentration

1770
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:57,350
of terpenes moral of the story is it's

1771
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:59,270
probably not so good for you I want to I

1772
01:18:57,350 --> 01:19:02,420
want to change the subject for a second

1773
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:04,310
not very far away but something Peter

1774
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:09,039
was shared with us when he first came on

1775
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:13,640
that picture of metabolites that are

1776
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:17,210
terpenes one of the things I've been

1777
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:19,820
exploring is how soil biology changes

1778
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:22,100
what terpenes and how much of them

1779
01:19:19,819 --> 01:19:23,840
express in the plants and we were

1780
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:25,880
talking earlier about how purity of the

1781
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,710
plant is really important for the purity

1782
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:33,199
of the end product that we're producing

1783
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:36,920
and what I my question is how much

1784
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:39,559
effect really does soil biology or the

1785
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:43,340
biology in the soil and on the plants

1786
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:45,500
have to do with the terpenes that are

1787
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:47,239
going to be expressed by the genetics of

1788
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,859
the plant I mean there's going to be a

1789
01:19:47,239 --> 01:19:51,859
sort of terpene profile

1790
01:19:48,859 --> 01:19:53,750
they're just based on the genetics but I

1791
01:19:51,859 --> 01:19:55,969
have a feeling or it's been my

1792
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:58,250
experience I'll say it like that that as

1793
01:19:55,969 --> 01:20:00,319
the soil biology has improved in my

1794
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:03,500
garden and in other gardens I've seen

1795
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:06,229
and worked with the terpenes not only

1796
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:07,880
increase in quantity in the plant

1797
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:11,209
material and of course the plants are

1798
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:14,889
more vital but it it occurs to me that

1799
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:18,319
perhaps different species of biology

1800
01:20:14,889 --> 01:20:21,230
enhance a plant's ability to produce

1801
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:24,289
more terpenes is that what that picture

1802
01:20:21,229 --> 01:20:26,209
was suggestive of yeah and actually if

1803
01:20:24,289 --> 01:20:27,979
you like what I can do is actually

1804
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:30,560
quantify exactly what you're talking

1805
01:20:27,979 --> 01:20:33,319
about and give you a a pretty

1806
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:35,840
comprehensive overview of exactly what

1807
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:37,189
that does on a biological level so let

1808
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,260
me let me share my screen with you

1809
01:20:37,189 --> 01:20:45,979
actually I yeah I think that's an

1810
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:48,130
important story yeah okay so this is

1811
01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:51,468
this is different strains of bacteria

1812
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:54,829
creating a terpene so what we did with

1813
01:20:51,469 --> 01:20:57,198
one of our hemp cultivators is we

1814
01:20:54,829 --> 01:20:59,359
quantified the amount of bacteria that

1815
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:02,569
was in a treated and non treated soil to

1816
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:06,170
increase the oil production so so right

1817
01:21:02,569 --> 01:21:09,198
here what you'll see is the microbes

1818
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:12,590
that we calculated in one gram of soil

1819
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:15,439
so in in the treated we had 83 billion

1820
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:19,819
colony forming units per gram of soil

1821
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:22,519
tested in the non treated we had 72,000

1822
01:21:19,819 --> 01:21:27,219
different microbes and so what ended up

1823
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:27,219
happening was we saw a nitrogen boost

1824
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:34,250
within the leaf tissue analysis of

1825
01:21:31,569 --> 01:21:35,899
treated plants so this this study was

1826
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:39,340
conducted by North Carolina Department

1827
01:21:35,899 --> 01:21:44,629
of Agriculture so we saw 30% increase in

1828
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:48,020
leaf nitrogen content then we looked at

1829
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:51,889
phosphorus phosphorus is a big one for

1830
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:54,739
biomass and so with an increased amount

1831
01:21:51,889 --> 01:21:57,368
of biology the plant is actually getting

1832
01:21:54,738 --> 01:22:01,319
the physics that it needs to create

1833
01:21:57,368 --> 01:22:04,389
terpenes and so your your

1834
01:22:01,319 --> 01:22:06,889
[Music]

1835
01:22:04,389 --> 01:22:08,929
micronutrients I'm sorry your

1836
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:11,690
macronutrients are going up here's

1837
01:22:08,929 --> 01:22:14,569
potassium so again this isn't a highly

1838
01:22:11,689 --> 01:22:16,759
biologically active soil now all these

1839
01:22:14,569 --> 01:22:18,768
nutrients are essential for the plant to

1840
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:20,958
have the physics it needs to create the

1841
01:22:18,769 --> 01:22:24,409
different types of terpenes to protect

1842
01:22:20,958 --> 01:22:29,019
itself in that soil and what we saw at

1843
01:22:24,408 --> 01:22:32,268
the end so this was 500 we took 250

1844
01:22:29,019 --> 01:22:34,969
treated and then 250 non treated plants

1845
01:22:32,269 --> 01:22:37,159
with a highly biologically active soil

1846
01:22:34,969 --> 01:22:40,279
you know why people say organic or

1847
01:22:37,158 --> 01:22:43,638
growing with bacteria is good and we

1848
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:47,448
found a 42 point 85 percent increase in

1849
01:22:43,639 --> 01:22:51,828
the amount of oil that the hemp plant

1850
01:22:47,448 --> 01:22:53,719
produced when when you say oil

1851
01:22:51,828 --> 01:22:56,708
what do you are you referring to

1852
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:59,328
cannabinoids other things or just

1853
01:22:56,708 --> 01:23:02,510
essential oil terpenes yeah this was

1854
01:22:59,328 --> 01:23:07,849
just the CBD analysis that the that the

1855
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:12,139
that the laboratory did oil which could

1856
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:14,479
be head size or just oil content in

1857
01:23:12,139 --> 01:23:17,359
general of the of the plant that's still

1858
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:22,340
significantly it's not like it was like

1859
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:24,348
a 4% it's 42 percent just be interesting

1860
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:27,949
if the same thing was done to plants

1861
01:23:24,349 --> 01:23:30,590
that are producing seeds and if the the

1862
01:23:27,948 --> 01:23:33,558
embryo oil the essential amino acid rich

1863
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:35,538
oil the hemp oil was also increased I

1864
01:23:33,559 --> 01:23:38,920
would almost have to guarantee it you

1865
01:23:35,538 --> 01:23:45,198
would think I guarantee you that growing

1866
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:48,340
living soil rich that's making plants

1867
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:53,359
grow millions of tiny tiny white roots

1868
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:57,550
absolutely does increase smells terpenes

1869
01:23:53,359 --> 01:24:00,439
and cannabinoids and resin in general

1870
01:23:57,550 --> 01:24:03,889
absolutely that's true but whether or

1871
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:05,958
not it can actually make other terpenes

1872
01:24:03,889 --> 01:24:11,389
present i've never seen any proof of

1873
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:13,248
that but i could boot but you feel it

1874
01:24:11,389 --> 01:24:15,949
would I mean obviously I've in my

1875
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:18,679
experience I was going to say that

1876
01:24:15,948 --> 01:24:22,219
I had this conversation with Brian from

1877
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:24,319
vital a couple days ago when he was like

1878
01:24:22,219 --> 01:24:27,529
just kind of checking in on me and I was

1879
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:31,998
just just catching up and I was talking

1880
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:34,488
about Peter and your your product is

1881
01:24:31,998 --> 01:24:37,279
like talking about kind of like you know

1882
01:24:34,488 --> 01:24:40,848
as a the the probiotic and an essential

1883
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:43,550
in the grow system and keeping it as a

1884
01:24:40,849 --> 01:24:46,038
as a key thing moving forward and and

1885
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:50,719
like what he's doing with his soil and

1886
01:24:46,038 --> 01:24:55,090
and and and vital system and then I've

1887
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:58,118
seen the guys from pharmacy bras that

1888
01:24:55,090 --> 01:25:00,889
have a seven-year soil they have those

1889
01:24:58,118 --> 01:25:04,069
what they call pop Paco's and they do

1890
01:25:00,889 --> 01:25:07,458
600 gallons and they save the soil and

1891
01:25:04,069 --> 01:25:10,819
the 600 gallons and and you know spend

1892
01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:15,618
years with the same soil from these type

1893
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:17,658
of growers versus say even not just

1894
01:25:15,618 --> 01:25:20,359
indoor but other types of growers that

1895
01:25:17,658 --> 01:25:24,078
grow in the same competitive environment

1896
01:25:20,359 --> 01:25:28,848
if you will that don't spend a lot of

1897
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:32,299
time or have a lot of education on it

1898
01:25:28,849 --> 01:25:33,708
like even you know like wage doing it as

1899
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,630
well you know it's like if I take

1900
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:38,300
something from somebody that understands

1901
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:41,748
the soil and understands how to grow

1902
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:44,630
organically every single time the

1903
01:25:41,748 --> 01:25:45,920
terpene percentage overall percentage if

1904
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:49,819
you will

1905
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:53,748
aroma flavor oil content is always

1906
01:25:49,819 --> 01:25:57,170
boosted cannabinoids and turpentine

1907
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:58,908
don't you know if it's the head size if

1908
01:25:57,170 --> 01:26:01,880
you will or there's more heads being

1909
01:25:58,908 --> 01:26:05,569
developed or more oil being secreted but

1910
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:11,150
I see it I see it like night and day

1911
01:26:05,569 --> 01:26:13,248
between the growers and I'll ever get to

1912
01:26:11,149 --> 01:26:16,279
the point where people will take a

1913
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:18,948
vegetative plant grow it as big as they

1914
01:26:16,279 --> 01:26:24,618
can so it's just about ready to flower

1915
01:26:18,948 --> 01:26:27,708
and then you whack it back halfway like

1916
01:26:24,618 --> 01:26:29,479
they do with grapes to produce fewer but

1917
01:26:27,708 --> 01:26:31,760
superior grapes are

1918
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:34,639
that'll ever be done with cannabis to

1919
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:39,520
produce fewer heads of cannabis but more

1920
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:39,520
superior or if it would be I'm not sure

1921
01:26:39,579 --> 01:26:44,930
yeah I don't know I tend to think that

1922
01:26:42,289 --> 01:26:47,750
and it's strange because I find with the

1923
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:49,640
or and this is I mean it's not it's I

1924
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:51,289
don't want to generalize too much but

1925
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:53,239
all of the varieties that I see that are

1926
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:56,930
grown outdoor that are grown correctly

1927
01:26:53,238 --> 01:27:00,349
produce a interesting type of resin to

1928
01:26:56,930 --> 01:27:02,030
where it's maybe it's not like covered

1929
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:03,710
in trichomes like you see an indoor

1930
01:27:02,029 --> 01:27:05,449
where this seems to be like just a lot

1931
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:07,220
more coverage and generally like every

1932
01:27:05,449 --> 01:27:11,029
time you see like even organic indoors

1933
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:14,030
just flooded with trichomes just but the

1934
01:27:11,029 --> 01:27:16,579
outdoor they get these like juicier

1935
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:18,409
bigger buds you know like it but it's

1936
01:27:16,579 --> 01:27:19,699
not like it's not covered in trichomes

1937
01:27:18,409 --> 01:27:21,889
you still see it but something

1938
01:27:19,699 --> 01:27:23,599
inherently I think that's why that's why

1939
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:25,970
I always said and thought we had this

1940
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,620
argument before and I think you were not

1941
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:29,780
sure what side of it you were on at that

1942
01:27:27,619 --> 01:27:32,750
time but I always felt like we were

1943
01:27:29,779 --> 01:27:34,039
growing really big grapes outdoors like

1944
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:36,619
things were just bigger and there was

1945
01:27:34,039 --> 01:27:39,229
just bigger oil and maybe it wasn't so

1946
01:27:36,619 --> 01:27:41,390
much on the outside as was as it is

1947
01:27:39,229 --> 01:27:44,089
closer to the the surface of the leaf

1948
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:45,500
but the oil content and the terpene

1949
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:50,270
content we're talking like you know

1950
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:52,939
everything's you know a good two percent

1951
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:55,190
plus when people are got a new variety

1952
01:27:52,939 --> 01:27:57,889
that I collected from Chernobyl

1953
01:27:55,189 --> 01:28:04,219
it grows resin heads the sides of small

1954
01:27:57,890 --> 01:28:05,869
size of small melons melons in the dark

1955
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:13,130
so they're really easy to find if you

1956
01:28:05,869 --> 01:28:14,599
drop on melons or melanomas and I was

1957
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:16,190
gonna say so to add to you what you're

1958
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:18,920
talking about the soil and things is

1959
01:28:16,189 --> 01:28:22,279
that I see that there's a boost in the

1960
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:25,130
heads but then there's this other oil

1961
01:28:22,279 --> 01:28:26,899
and it's boosting terpenes within

1962
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:29,480
inherently in the plant and on the

1963
01:28:26,899 --> 01:28:31,039
surface of the leaf but it's not just in

1964
01:28:29,479 --> 01:28:34,129
the head so I think what happens with

1965
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:36,409
the plant is maybe it expresses and

1966
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:39,289
exceeds its head count and then it if

1967
01:28:36,409 --> 01:28:41,449
it's really healthy and really strong it

1968
01:28:39,289 --> 01:28:42,500
starts to produce these oils in a

1969
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:44,479
different way

1970
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:46,069
that come out very well in rosin and

1971
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:48,379
they come out very well interpreting

1972
01:28:46,069 --> 01:28:50,599
extractions and I see the numbers are

1973
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:53,630
always boosted I mean you know I just

1974
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:56,829
got a variety from verdant that was like

1975
01:28:53,630 --> 01:29:02,239
overall 24% cannabinoids there's like

1976
01:28:56,829 --> 01:29:05,479
20% CBD and 5% THC and he's all organic

1977
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:08,179
vital you know yes sir one of the things

1978
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:10,699
Tony that we're also seeing is you know

1979
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:13,340
the plant can only hit a certain genetic

1980
01:29:10,699 --> 01:29:16,729
expression right it can only produce so

1981
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:18,260
many terpenes so in growers that aren't

1982
01:29:16,729 --> 01:29:19,879
getting a lot of terpenes we're seeing

1983
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:22,220
that our bacteria will help them achieve

1984
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:25,130
maybe a level where you guys are already

1985
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:27,680
at but when you guys get to your level

1986
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:30,050
when the plant can only produce so many

1987
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:33,170
terpenes what we're finding is a

1988
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:34,820
diversity of biology will increase more

1989
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:37,090
of the types so instead of seeing like

1990
01:29:34,819 --> 01:29:40,609
maybe seven or eight major terpene types

1991
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:43,090
you'll see ten or twelve and so the

1992
01:29:40,609 --> 01:29:46,579
flavor and the aroma and the the

1993
01:29:43,090 --> 01:29:48,260
comprehensiveness of the Turpan alene

1994
01:29:46,579 --> 01:29:49,970
efficacy is just a lot more

1995
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:52,100
comprehensive and where do you think

1996
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:53,900
those oils are being developed either

1997
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:58,010
that's what I don't know I don't know

1998
01:29:53,899 --> 01:30:01,549
yet I'm seeing that different type to be

1999
01:29:58,010 --> 01:30:04,810
honest if you don't see them in a

2000
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:07,579
regular plant that's not grown that way

2001
01:30:04,810 --> 01:30:13,910
and they're not expressed at all even

2002
01:30:07,579 --> 01:30:15,920
you know in tiny tiny amounts then do do

2003
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:18,619
they have a synthase to produce that

2004
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:21,380
compound they are being used in macro

2005
01:30:18,619 --> 01:30:23,210
doses you know so you'll have your

2006
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:25,069
majors but then you'll see micro doses

2007
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:27,050
of the other terpenes but when you add

2008
01:30:25,069 --> 01:30:29,239
our bacteria and those micro doses are

2009
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:31,579
okay that that I could absolutely

2010
01:30:29,239 --> 01:30:34,699
believe that that you're making a really

2011
01:30:31,579 --> 01:30:36,649
tiny peak grow to a bigger size that's

2012
01:30:34,699 --> 01:30:40,010
easy to believe that's that's what's

2013
01:30:36,649 --> 01:30:41,839
going so it's a tiny peek and and now

2014
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:46,010
with the introduction of more bacteria

2015
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:48,650
those Peaks are higher you know that

2016
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:51,130
could certainly be I've seen healthier

2017
01:30:48,649 --> 01:30:54,559
soil healthier plants healthier roots

2018
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:55,760
definitely creates healthier resin which

2019
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,619
is more terpenes

2020
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:00,110
appetites he's working with nature man

2021
01:30:57,618 --> 01:31:02,000
that's it Sam well well the key there is

2022
01:31:00,109 --> 01:31:04,009
not a gene fixation because the plant

2023
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,380
doesn't fix nitrogen but the bacteria

2024
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:11,739
does and so they're able to fix nitrogen

2025
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:14,630
and phases are proteins which are

2026
01:31:11,738 --> 01:31:18,138
negative amino acids and amino acids

2027
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:22,578
require nitrogen and so it's those

2028
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:24,800
machines that make their beans beans

2029
01:31:22,578 --> 01:31:26,599
just aren't made they're made by like we

2030
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:30,469
said before synthesis and those

2031
01:31:26,599 --> 01:31:32,989
synthesis are basically large proteins

2032
01:31:30,469 --> 01:31:39,618
that have to be made before you can make

2033
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:42,589
the the those all require nitrogen

2034
01:31:39,618 --> 01:31:45,018
nitrogen fixation also they require what

2035
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:47,000
is it your G GPRS

2036
01:31:45,019 --> 01:31:49,610
at the time course of evolution to

2037
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,158
figure out how to fix nitrogen from the

2038
01:31:49,609 --> 01:31:53,268
air so let's just let the bacteria do

2039
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:55,279
yeah

2040
01:31:53,269 --> 01:31:57,980
yeah and I'll tell you what you know you

2041
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:59,960
guys over over the years have done such

2042
01:31:57,979 --> 01:32:02,868
a good job educating the industry

2043
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:06,050
getting people aware of how important

2044
01:32:02,868 --> 01:32:09,618
routines are and so I'm so humbled and

2045
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:11,300
grateful to be a part of you know maybe

2046
01:32:09,618 --> 01:32:15,948
helping disclose how terpenes are made

2047
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:17,750
which is from bacteria so on one thing

2048
01:32:15,948 --> 01:32:20,178
that we hadn't covered yet which kind of

2049
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:23,420
dawned upon me maybe you guys could

2050
01:32:20,179 --> 01:32:26,118
answer this you know the plants going as

2051
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:28,359
as female plant you know sense Amelia

2052
01:32:26,118 --> 01:32:31,130
it's going through its ovulation period

2053
01:32:28,359 --> 01:32:33,738
and we're talking about the nitrogen

2054
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:35,538
starting early with you know most

2055
01:32:33,738 --> 01:32:40,250
growers have this consciousness of hey

2056
01:32:35,538 --> 01:32:42,170
we're gonna either foliar feed or just

2057
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:44,300
use low levels of phosphorus and higher

2058
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:45,679
nitrogen when it's vegging and then it's

2059
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:48,559
flipped and we're using higher

2060
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:52,130
phosphorus and much less nitrogen during

2061
01:32:48,559 --> 01:32:53,989
the flowering cycle is there and there

2062
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:56,359
but there is an ovulation period of

2063
01:32:53,988 --> 01:32:59,658
which it changes like from like day 24

2064
01:32:56,359 --> 01:33:02,149
and and day like 36 or something depends

2065
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:05,658
on a variety but there's that ovulation

2066
01:33:02,149 --> 01:33:09,769
period is there what is is the change in

2067
01:33:05,658 --> 01:33:13,339
the hormone of the plant something else

2068
01:33:09,770 --> 01:33:16,340
it's indicative of how the uptake or how

2069
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:18,980
this is working yeah there is so so

2070
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:20,690
that's a great question one of the

2071
01:33:18,979 --> 01:33:23,209
things that we have found with

2072
01:33:20,689 --> 01:33:24,799
comprehensive biology attached to the

2073
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:26,989
rhizosphere is that the plant is

2074
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:30,230
actually Auto regulating its uptake and

2075
01:33:26,989 --> 01:33:32,569
so there's there's a sacred kind of

2076
01:33:30,229 --> 01:33:36,079
communication that the root will have

2077
01:33:32,569 --> 01:33:38,960
with its its digestive system that that

2078
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:42,199
says hey at this stage of my growth of

2079
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:43,399
my involvement I'm gonna need some some

2080
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:45,590
nitrogen or I'm gonna need some

2081
01:33:43,399 --> 01:33:48,349
phosphorus so so what will happen is is

2082
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:51,610
it will enzymatically communicate with

2083
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:54,050
the biodiversity in the rhizosphere to

2084
01:33:51,609 --> 01:33:56,869
allow them to act as almost like a

2085
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:58,850
chelating agent for particles such as

2086
01:33:56,869 --> 01:34:01,069
phosphorus so for instance if you take

2087
01:33:58,850 --> 01:34:03,020
the root and you've got a particle this

2088
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:06,649
size when you put your fertilizer of

2089
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:08,740
phosphorus the plant will enzymatically

2090
01:34:06,649 --> 01:34:12,319
communicate with the biofilm of

2091
01:34:08,739 --> 01:34:15,079
organisms that are creating assets to to

2092
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:18,649
break down that phosphorus so that as it

2093
01:34:15,079 --> 01:34:21,409
hits the root it just kind of it's like

2094
01:34:18,649 --> 01:34:23,929
juicing it you know and so the the

2095
01:34:21,409 --> 01:34:27,319
higher awareness or communication that

2096
01:34:23,930 --> 01:34:31,579
the that the plant will have with its

2097
01:34:27,319 --> 01:34:33,500
biology to process nitrogen fixation

2098
01:34:31,579 --> 01:34:34,729
phosphorus solubalization all the things

2099
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:37,189
that are so important to have the

2100
01:34:34,729 --> 01:34:39,939
physics to create the terpenes is beyond

2101
01:34:37,189 --> 01:34:42,369
you know it's it's a naturally occurring

2102
01:34:39,939 --> 01:34:45,619
thing that just happens when you have a

2103
01:34:42,369 --> 01:34:47,720
biologically active soil well i'm

2104
01:34:45,619 --> 01:34:50,539
phosphorus the key is the key element

2105
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:53,060
that holds DNA together right DNA is

2106
01:34:50,539 --> 01:34:56,359
basically a polymer that's derived from

2107
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:59,510
a poly phosphate backbone and so the

2108
01:34:56,359 --> 01:35:03,170
actual element of DNA itself requires

2109
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:05,090
nitrogen requires phosphorous and so

2110
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:07,159
without phosphorus and nitrogen you're

2111
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:12,560
starving a living system from being able

2112
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:14,659
to proliferate then with a what I'm

2113
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:17,720
saying is that you know and to answer

2114
01:35:14,659 --> 01:35:20,329
your question Tony is that once you do

2115
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:21,659
have a comprehensive biologically active

2116
01:35:20,329 --> 01:35:23,309
system you

2117
01:35:21,658 --> 01:35:27,359
it's gonna kind of take the guesswork

2118
01:35:23,309 --> 01:35:29,179
out of your you're fertilizing variances

2119
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:31,259
because it's such a dynamic

2120
01:35:29,179 --> 01:35:32,699
comprehensive thing to actually feed

2121
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:35,489
your plants are given the right energy

2122
01:35:32,698 --> 01:35:38,509
to grow that there can be so many

2123
01:35:35,488 --> 01:35:41,359
methodologies and approaches to properly

2124
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:44,039
fertilizing and so again in

2125
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:45,478
incorporating a healthy digestive system

2126
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:47,578
to your plants is going to kind of take

2127
01:35:45,479 --> 01:35:49,579
the guesswork out of that and make your

2128
01:35:47,578 --> 01:35:52,498
investment and fertilizer that much more

2129
01:35:49,578 --> 01:35:55,708
that much better all right so all right

2130
01:35:52,498 --> 01:36:02,868
so these put that these products are and

2131
01:35:55,708 --> 01:36:07,260
once again let's see if I'm still yeah

2132
01:36:02,868 --> 01:36:09,779
okay so alright so let's say we close my

2133
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:11,880
eyes and I imagine we've got the right

2134
01:36:09,779 --> 01:36:14,728
bacteria in the right organic soil and

2135
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:16,498
we've got millions of little tiny hairs

2136
01:36:14,729 --> 01:36:18,809
that are coming out of these roots and

2137
01:36:16,498 --> 01:36:23,630
now we've got more of these vessels and

2138
01:36:18,809 --> 01:36:25,650
way to communicate and uptake that

2139
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:29,309
information through the system in which

2140
01:36:25,649 --> 01:36:30,808
you explained and so and knowing what we

2141
01:36:29,309 --> 01:36:34,139
know about the plant now with the

2142
01:36:30,809 --> 01:36:36,829
nitrogen and phosphorus if there's ways

2143
01:36:34,139 --> 01:36:39,389
to take certain types of genetics

2144
01:36:36,828 --> 01:36:42,828
maximize their expressions and maybe

2145
01:36:39,389 --> 01:36:45,239
target certain types of boosting of

2146
01:36:42,828 --> 01:36:48,328
terpene profiles like maybe adding a

2147
01:36:45,238 --> 01:36:50,129
certain mineral in that period with that

2148
01:36:48,328 --> 01:36:52,558
particular type of genetic instead of

2149
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:53,819
you know is there a way you know do you

2150
01:36:52,559 --> 01:36:55,739
think that it's that's what it's going

2151
01:36:53,819 --> 01:36:57,779
to come to is that we find this

2152
01:36:55,738 --> 01:36:59,879
particular type of genetic we create

2153
01:36:57,779 --> 01:37:01,679
this living type of soil that can

2154
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:05,849
maximize and boost the properties in

2155
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:09,418
which we want so that's probably a Sam

2156
01:37:05,849 --> 01:37:12,748
question but as far as you know Mike

2157
01:37:09,418 --> 01:37:15,779
might just what I feel about that is

2158
01:37:12,748 --> 01:37:18,840
absolutely so crossbreeding and it goes

2159
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:21,359
back to biodynamic agriculture for me so

2160
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:23,038
so we're taking a plant that shouldn't

2161
01:37:21,359 --> 01:37:26,488
necessarily be cultivated in the

2162
01:37:23,038 --> 01:37:29,009
warehouse or even a soil we're deciding

2163
01:37:26,488 --> 01:37:31,168
to put it there and so what you guys are

2164
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:33,329
doing with you know crossbreeding and

2165
01:37:31,168 --> 01:37:34,840
things like that to express various

2166
01:37:33,328 --> 01:37:37,840
genetic

2167
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:39,310
potentiality of the plant in combination

2168
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,770
with something that's just been lacking

2169
01:37:39,310 --> 01:37:45,099
for so long in this industry which is

2170
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:47,619
the the biology that that these plants

2171
01:37:45,099 --> 01:37:49,779
naturally co-evolved with in nature that

2172
01:37:47,618 --> 01:37:51,219
they're lacking in the warehouse or in

2173
01:37:49,779 --> 01:37:52,868
the soil that they never should have

2174
01:37:51,219 --> 01:37:57,069
been planted in in the first place

2175
01:37:52,868 --> 01:38:01,479
and so I go in I wonder if I wanted to

2176
01:37:57,069 --> 01:38:06,009
jump I'm echoing let me let me mute

2177
01:38:01,479 --> 01:38:08,948
myself thank you Peter I think something

2178
01:38:06,010 --> 01:38:13,949
you said is really important that if by

2179
01:38:08,948 --> 01:38:18,309
having healthy soil a full to use a term

2180
01:38:13,948 --> 01:38:19,839
the soil food web if you will and I

2181
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:23,139
think that's some of what you're doing

2182
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:27,159
not to mix labels or anything but the

2183
01:38:23,139 --> 01:38:32,590
idea of having healthy soil just to make

2184
01:38:27,158 --> 01:38:35,019
it short freeing me from having to make

2185
01:38:32,590 --> 01:38:38,190
choices about what I'm going to feed my

2186
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:40,780
plants when so that they can flourish

2187
01:38:38,189 --> 01:38:43,089
giving them the opportunity to go

2188
01:38:40,779 --> 01:38:45,849
looking for what they want need and

2189
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:48,520
being able to find it in abundance where

2190
01:38:45,849 --> 01:38:50,560
they are frees me from the

2191
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:54,909
responsibility of sorting it out for

2192
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:57,810
them it's what I've realized is that the

2193
01:38:54,908 --> 01:39:01,479
different genetics they have different

2194
01:38:57,810 --> 01:39:03,340
moments in their their growth process

2195
01:39:01,479 --> 01:39:05,079
that thing you were talking about where

2196
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:08,619
they go through the hormonal changes of

2197
01:39:05,079 --> 01:39:12,189
ovulation and whatnot there's an

2198
01:39:08,618 --> 01:39:14,769
awareness if you if I when I was working

2199
01:39:12,189 --> 01:39:16,868
indoors I spent a lot of time trying to

2200
01:39:14,770 --> 01:39:19,060
understand what my plants needed when

2201
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:21,279
and how to feed them to get them to

2202
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:25,690
express optimally what they were capable

2203
01:39:21,279 --> 01:39:29,590
of and working outdoors in healthy soil

2204
01:39:25,689 --> 01:39:32,469
what I found is that they take care of

2205
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:35,920
themselves I really all I'm trying to do

2206
01:39:32,469 --> 01:39:40,210
is help them have available everything

2207
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:42,819
they need and your product I've not ever

2208
01:39:40,210 --> 01:39:45,579
used it but I've read up on what you're

2209
01:39:42,819 --> 01:39:47,229
doing and I understand the concept it's

2210
01:39:45,579 --> 01:39:48,460
it's evocative of things I've read

2211
01:39:47,229 --> 01:39:50,649
before

2212
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:54,219
and I really think you're onto something

2213
01:39:50,649 --> 01:39:57,339
where folks are not able to generate

2214
01:39:54,219 --> 01:39:59,079
their own inputs but want to invest in

2215
01:39:57,340 --> 01:40:02,529
something that will help their soil be

2216
01:39:59,079 --> 01:40:04,329
more alive if you will I think it's

2217
01:40:02,529 --> 01:40:06,550
important important to educate people

2218
01:40:04,329 --> 01:40:09,189
about how to help the colonies that

2219
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:12,190
you're giving them continue to flourish

2220
01:40:09,189 --> 01:40:14,049
in their gardens but some of the best

2221
01:40:12,189 --> 01:40:16,449
gardens I've been in are far better than

2222
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:18,520
what I've been able to do here and in

2223
01:40:16,449 --> 01:40:21,309
every one of them those people have

2224
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:22,989
spent years more than seven usually a

2225
01:40:21,310 --> 01:40:26,350
number that someone else mentioned

2226
01:40:22,988 --> 01:40:29,199
earlier where over the years they've

2227
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:32,500
just added to the soil added to the soil

2228
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:34,840
added to the soil nutrients and inputs

2229
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:36,488
from their farm or from their neighbors

2230
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:39,069
where they know exactly what they're

2231
01:40:36,488 --> 01:40:42,459
doing doing in terms of adding to the

2232
01:40:39,069 --> 01:40:44,979
soil to see benefit Indra was speaking

2233
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:48,189
about rabbit manures one of the most

2234
01:40:44,979 --> 01:40:53,109
beautiful gardens I've seen this year is

2235
01:40:48,189 --> 01:40:57,339
using goat sheep rabbit and chicken

2236
01:40:53,109 --> 01:41:03,189
manures over a period of years and his

2237
01:40:57,340 --> 01:41:05,800
trees their trees are literally oh my

2238
01:41:03,189 --> 01:41:09,099
goodness I don't know I don't want to

2239
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:11,949
exaggerate every but they're really huge

2240
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:13,989
anyway I've gone on a rant but the point

2241
01:41:11,949 --> 01:41:18,550
that I'm trying to make to make is that

2242
01:41:13,988 --> 01:41:21,339
you that point about you not having me

2243
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:23,350
not having to choose what to feed these

2244
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:26,770
plants like their course of their life

2245
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:28,329
cycle cycle all I do is get water it

2246
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:30,130
kind of takes the guesswork out of it

2247
01:41:28,329 --> 01:41:33,729
wait and I'll tell you what I'll send

2248
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:35,650
you a bag of the soil balanced so that

2249
01:41:33,729 --> 01:41:37,809
you can try it and if it's okay with

2250
01:41:35,649 --> 01:41:40,539
Marcus I loved it since it's you know a

2251
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:42,820
good show I'd love to give away 50 bags

2252
01:41:40,539 --> 01:41:45,460
of our of our soil balance to his

2253
01:41:42,819 --> 01:41:48,340
audience we can we can put a link to

2254
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:50,319
Nathan's email and then the first maybe

2255
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:52,300
50 people that email Nathan will give

2256
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:55,809
them a free bag of the soil balance so

2257
01:41:52,300 --> 01:42:00,640
they so that everybody can see how

2258
01:41:55,810 --> 01:42:02,320
important biology is and and how easy it

2259
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:03,520
can it can make call

2260
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:05,559
Automation and that's that's what we're

2261
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:08,310
all about is trying to help cultivators

2262
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:12,639
become more sustainable and utilize

2263
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:15,699
their budgets more effectively and

2264
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:18,578
increase quality so yeah so it actually

2265
01:42:15,698 --> 01:42:22,000
if anybody wants to email Nate at soil

2266
01:42:18,578 --> 01:42:23,319
balance procom will give 50 bags if

2267
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,969
that's cool Marcus like we didn't talk

2268
01:42:23,319 --> 01:42:32,049
about it before the show but no you

2269
01:42:24,969 --> 01:42:33,250
can't it's great man it's amazing are

2270
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:34,810
you kidding me I think people are

2271
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:39,210
writing that email down right now and

2272
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:43,989
trying to well describe what a bag does

2273
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:47,439
yeah so so 10 grams is what we're gonna

2274
01:42:43,988 --> 01:42:49,809
give away we're gonna give away 10 10 10

2275
01:42:47,439 --> 01:42:53,009
gram bags so there's 50 bags that we're

2276
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:58,179
gonna give out and 10 grams will create

2277
01:42:53,010 --> 01:43:02,820
100 gallons of microbial tea and so each

2278
01:42:58,179 --> 01:43:04,810
gallon will will contain six trillion

2279
01:43:02,819 --> 01:43:08,229
microorganisms all beneficial

2280
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:11,619
microorganisms and and and and each

2281
01:43:08,229 --> 01:43:14,888
gallon will have 62 strains so a 10 gram

2282
01:43:11,618 --> 01:43:16,960
bag costs about $29 I think I don't know

2283
01:43:14,889 --> 01:43:20,349
what the Canadian but we've set up to

2284
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:22,270
send our product into Canada so so that

2285
01:43:20,349 --> 01:43:25,630
will create a hundred gallons of microbe

2286
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:33,610
tea yeah that's a lot that's a lot huge

2287
01:43:25,630 --> 01:43:35,078
that's huge actually got really really

2288
01:43:33,609 --> 01:43:36,759

board of that right away for it in my

2292
01:43:39,729 --> 01:43:44,888
bag it's in a Canada's about 60 bucks so

2293
01:43:42,279 --> 01:43:47,399
ya know it's I'm looking forward to

thank you yeah no but thank you John

2296
01:43:50,979 --> 01:43:55,569
we're so grateful man and we really put

2297
01:43:53,859 --> 01:43:57,519
a lot of work we put about ten years

2298
01:43:55,569 --> 01:43:59,618
into going around the world and

2299
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:02,650
isolating strains from different

2300
01:43:59,618 --> 01:44:04,689
ecosystems like a rainforest in a desert

2301
01:44:02,649 --> 01:44:08,769
so we have some strains from deserts

2302
01:44:04,689 --> 01:44:11,408
that were specifically to enhance them

2303
01:44:08,770 --> 01:44:14,440
and all they need is water to

2304
01:44:11,408 --> 01:44:16,689
proliferate through binary fission no

2305
01:44:14,439 --> 01:44:19,919
well I have an announcement that I'd

2306

2319

2322
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:40,149
cannabis I like the name Savannah

2323
01:45:27,189 --> 01:45:43,359
cannabis it's proper hey Marcus Forrest

2324
01:45:40,149 --> 01:45:46,960
stopped by my place the other day

2325
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:50,589
and he brought with him a little silver

2326
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:56,529
pen that said bubbleman on it had some

2327
01:45:50,590 --> 01:46:00,310
really beautiful I don't really like

2328
01:45:56,529 --> 01:46:01,840
vape pens I don't really use them I've

2329
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:07,120
had I've tried a bunch of them over the

2330
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:11,730
years and that one I liked you know how

2331
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:15,130
you yeah it it tasted like something

2332
01:46:11,729 --> 01:46:19,929
there was actual flavor there I don't

2333
01:46:15,130 --> 01:46:21,400
know what it was he said but I really

2334
01:46:19,930 --> 01:46:24,310
liked the pen I don't know who's doing

2335
01:46:21,399 --> 01:46:25,960
it is that Blue River or that is a

2336
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:28,199
collaboration that we're all doing

2337
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:31,408
together myself and Tony

2338
01:46:28,198 --> 01:46:34,618
and Gary from up tech so Gary's a lot of

2339
01:46:31,408 --> 01:46:36,929
the design and then Tony and I are kind

2340
01:46:34,618 --> 01:46:39,149
of R&amp;D with the terpenes on blue

2341
01:46:36,929 --> 01:46:40,920
Riverside with the bubbleman brand on my

2342
01:46:39,149 --> 01:46:42,299
side and we all kind of came up together

2343
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:44,880
and created this what we're now calling

2344
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:47,190
the Trinity which makes sense because

2345
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:50,300
there are three substantial brands

2346
01:46:47,189 --> 01:46:53,698
coming together to produce this one

2347
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:56,760
brand and yes it's been pretty cool dude

2348
01:46:53,698 --> 01:46:58,379
it's uh Tony's definitely been you know

2349
01:46:56,760 --> 01:47:01,498
got to give him a mad big shout out both

2350
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:04,498
him and Gary have put a ton of time and

2351
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:06,958
energy into this over the last like 14

2352
01:47:04,498 --> 01:47:12,300
months so it's pretty [ __ ] awesome

2353
01:47:06,958 --> 01:47:13,349
I'm glad you liking it did yeah it was

2354
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:16,409
pretty amazing

2355
01:47:13,349 --> 01:47:18,269
like I said never liked really big pens

2356
01:47:16,408 --> 01:47:20,788
but that changed my opinion quite a bit

2357
01:47:18,269 --> 01:47:23,699
so thank you Tony and thank you Marcus

2358
01:47:20,788 --> 01:47:25,349
and thanks to the other person who will

2359
01:47:23,698 --> 01:47:26,158
make sure we get you one if he didn't

2360
01:47:25,349 --> 01:47:33,510
leave it with you

2361
01:47:26,158 --> 01:47:37,408
I as you will yeah no he's loving it he

2362
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:39,208
got one for Forrest yeah and then I'll

2363
01:47:37,408 --> 01:47:42,238
get you one I'll make sure you get one

2364
01:47:39,208 --> 01:47:44,130
it's uh we learned a lot of what is

2365
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:46,948
wrong with you she wants to be a part of

2366
01:47:44,130 --> 01:47:55,288
hastert Wow

2367
01:47:46,948 --> 01:47:56,578
she's just having it she's like yeah

2368
01:47:55,288 --> 01:47:59,158
there's some things that we learned like

2369
01:47:56,578 --> 01:48:01,349
you know with these particular with the

2370
01:47:59,158 --> 01:48:03,448
tanks I was talking about with the oil

2371
01:48:01,349 --> 01:48:06,360
and THC and there's like a lot of people

2372
01:48:03,448 --> 01:48:08,518
trying to make them at home so with

2373
01:48:06,359 --> 01:48:11,458
anything new with new technology you try

2374
01:48:08,519 --> 01:48:14,458
to you know push through different

2375
01:48:11,458 --> 01:48:18,090
things and and you're trying to pioneer

2376
01:48:14,458 --> 01:48:21,479
a way to get our organic oils in a

2377
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:23,550
device that's healthy for you that you

2378
01:48:21,479 --> 01:48:26,190
can vaporize with that with knowing that

2379
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:28,440
you could reuse it you know and so thank

2380
01:48:26,189 --> 01:48:33,178
you one that I would put my name on ie

2381
01:48:28,439 --> 01:48:37,348
yeah as well as myself and so you know

2382
01:48:33,179 --> 01:48:41,130
it has this like it has a sick element

2383
01:48:37,349 --> 01:48:41,819
in it that's like a pumice stone if you

2384
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:46,800
will

2385
01:48:41,819 --> 01:48:48,929
and it basically under the under the

2386
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:52,440
tank if you take the tanks he is just

2387
01:48:48,930 --> 01:48:56,010
super upset jeez if you take like the

2388
01:48:52,439 --> 01:48:58,049
tank itself and if you just if you get

2389
01:48:56,010 --> 01:49:00,360
if you're doing fresh frozen material

2390
01:48:58,050 --> 01:49:02,670
making a bubble hash and then pressing

2391
01:49:00,359 --> 01:49:06,029
it you're keeping it in it's like almost

2392
01:49:02,670 --> 01:49:08,460
as raw THCA as you know it's it's rose

2393
01:49:06,029 --> 01:49:11,639
form and it's generally gonna have a

2394
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:14,520
high terpene content and so once you

2395
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:18,420
start getting past come on really once

2396
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:20,460
you start getting past ten or fifteen

2397
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:23,159
percent and especially as you get closer

2398
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:25,710
to thirty percent you're getting you're

2399
01:49:23,159 --> 01:49:28,949
getting you're getting this breakout and

2400
01:49:25,710 --> 01:49:30,869
so not every terpene grouping does a

2401
01:49:28,949 --> 01:49:35,309
breakout but say like strawberry banana

2402
01:49:30,869 --> 01:49:38,819
goo accelerates this breakout of THC a

2403
01:49:35,310 --> 01:49:40,380
and if you reap and when used to look at

2404
01:49:38,819 --> 01:49:42,119
any of the post that are taking like the

2405
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:44,279
rosin and the butter and there and

2406
01:49:42,119 --> 01:49:45,960
you're repressing it at a hundred and

2407
01:49:44,279 --> 01:49:47,550
thirty degrees and you're separating the

2408
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:52,920
oil from the THC a and you're getting

2409
01:49:47,550 --> 01:49:54,720
like 97 98 99 percent THC EA you can see

2410
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:58,220
the two separations done mechanically

2411
01:49:54,720 --> 01:50:01,619
well that happens inside the tank if

2412
01:49:58,220 --> 01:50:03,449
you're not careful and so this is things

2413
01:50:01,619 --> 01:50:05,010
that I've learned and next week we're

2414
01:50:03,449 --> 01:50:07,979
putting out like a whole comprehensive

2415
01:50:05,010 --> 01:50:10,199
video of how to you know use it from the

2416
01:50:07,979 --> 01:50:12,739
start to finish there's little tricks

2417
01:50:10,199 --> 01:50:16,470
and trades that have done it because

2418
01:50:12,739 --> 01:50:18,389
terpenes in a live rosin form and in a

2419
01:50:16,470 --> 01:50:21,119
hash and everything being organic and

2420
01:50:18,390 --> 01:50:24,630
alive it's what i call an active resin

2421
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:27,479
and it's it's not in its home anymore

2422
01:50:24,630 --> 01:50:29,130
and it's it want it's kind of volatile

2423
01:50:27,479 --> 01:50:31,979
in a sense where it's like I need to

2424
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:35,369
find a place and so if you mix up

2425
01:50:31,979 --> 01:50:38,129
terpenes and you mix of rosin and you

2426
01:50:35,369 --> 01:50:40,829
just mix it up right away it's it it

2427
01:50:38,130 --> 01:50:43,560
needs time to settle and to kind of

2428
01:50:40,829 --> 01:50:45,300
either like market mark scold own said

2429
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:47,760
if the tie-in terpene alene it's gonna

2430
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:49,260
want to eat away at that rosin and it's

2431
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,670
still it's going to take some time and

2432
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:53,310
as its doing that there's a little bit

2433
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:54,960
of organic chemistry happening there

2434
01:50:53,310 --> 01:50:55,739
that it says hey i need to find my way

2435
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:58,319
give me a minute

2436
01:50:55,738 --> 01:51:00,439
I'm showing the pen right now on screen

2437
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:03,029
share Tony where the oil is

2438
01:51:00,439 --> 01:51:04,828
crystallizing in the cartridge you can

2439
01:51:03,029 --> 01:51:07,948
see the little crystals that I've got on

2440
01:51:04,828 --> 01:51:11,038
the screen here so that's THC a yeah

2441
01:51:07,948 --> 01:51:13,379
I've got one I've got one that so these

2442
01:51:11,038 --> 01:51:15,809
are so this is an it's like you know

2443
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:17,909
it's a beautiful color it's creamy it's

2444
01:51:15,809 --> 01:51:19,920
nice and bright but when you look at

2445
01:51:17,908 --> 01:51:22,219
this oil guess which one's functioning

2446
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:25,469
better in the tank this one right here

2447
01:51:22,219 --> 01:51:28,670
okay and you start to look at we did a

2448
01:51:25,469 --> 01:51:31,769
lemon tree one and I did some different

2449
01:51:28,670 --> 01:51:34,260
different types of processes to dial

2450
01:51:31,769 --> 01:51:38,039
this in but ultimately if you're gonna

2451
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:41,610
use the freshest most raw you know live

2452
01:51:38,038 --> 01:51:44,578
rosin sauce if you will and you have a

2453
01:51:41,609 --> 01:51:46,018
tank then you put it in and you let it

2454
01:51:44,578 --> 01:51:48,868
settle down and you use it right away

2455
01:51:46,019 --> 01:51:50,880
but if you let it sit in there this

2456
01:51:48,868 --> 01:51:53,158
thing will separate the oil will come

2457
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,469
through the center pin like straight

2458
01:51:53,158 --> 01:51:57,268
through that center hole which is

2459
01:51:55,469 --> 01:51:58,710
different than anything else and I don't

2460
01:51:57,269 --> 01:51:59,969
mind talking about this because this is

2461
01:51:58,710 --> 01:52:02,340
like we're trying to get of a device

2462
01:51:59,969 --> 01:52:05,010
that people can use and understand but

2463
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:07,110
it's amazing because under pressure just

2464
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:08,190
pressure the terpenes are gonna want to

2465
01:52:07,109 --> 01:52:10,920
come out that hole

2466
01:52:08,189 --> 01:52:13,319
when I hit 15% in the first cards all of

2467
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:15,899
the terpenes came out of this Center us

2468
01:52:13,319 --> 01:52:18,058
- yeah a center device and left up here

2469
01:52:15,899 --> 01:52:20,219
was THC a there was like well that's a

2470
01:52:18,059 --> 01:52:22,800
creep nice magic trick but I just wanted

2471
01:52:20,219 --> 01:52:26,609
to smoke the oil that was inside it hi

2472
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:29,400
I'm with you and so what we found is if

2473
01:52:26,609 --> 01:52:31,498
you if you mix terpenes and rosin

2474
01:52:29,399 --> 01:52:33,748
together and you and i let it sit for

2475
01:52:31,498 --> 01:52:37,889
like weeks like I'll do like 20 I'll do

2476
01:52:33,748 --> 01:52:40,019
like 35 grams - like - like 3 or 4

2477
01:52:37,889 --> 01:52:42,090
milliliters so it's like now we found

2478
01:52:40,019 --> 01:52:44,969
the magic numbers about 3 drops and

2479
01:52:42,090 --> 01:52:47,190
every drop is 2.25 percent terpenes on

2480
01:52:44,969 --> 01:52:50,519
average you should be able to hit 10 11

2481
01:52:47,189 --> 01:52:53,879
% and I feel like with a 10 11 % terpene

2482
01:52:50,519 --> 01:52:57,030
content and a 77 to 75 percent overall

2483
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:58,980
cannabinoid profile it's the best you

2484
01:52:57,029 --> 01:53:03,328
know potency - terpene it's not too

2485
01:52:58,979 --> 01:53:06,029
crazy it's not yeah well what if you

2486
01:53:03,328 --> 01:53:08,728
took that weird starting to crystallize

2487
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:09,349
there and just heated it gently with

2488
01:53:08,729 --> 01:53:11,869
like

2489
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:14,300
was like a hairdryer would would did

2490
01:53:11,869 --> 01:53:19,819
with the I mean again when I say he to

2491
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:22,789
get gently left because that's a tip on

2492
01:53:19,819 --> 01:53:27,799
our blog on the public and website using

2493
01:53:22,789 --> 01:53:29,420
a hairdryer to gently heat it up well

2494
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:33,260
the reason why is he knee and gently

2495
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:35,600
because if it is THC a yeah now star

2496
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:37,640
decarboxylated and it's gonna build up a

2497
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:40,430
little bit of pressure right correct

2498
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:43,130
right correct but but what we don't want

2499
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:46,490
is we don't want our oil to separate

2500
01:53:43,130 --> 01:53:48,650
inside the tanks but we what we found is

2501
01:53:46,489 --> 01:53:50,539
yes we want to have this like experience

2502
01:53:48,649 --> 01:53:52,879
of having the freshest taste that you

2503
01:53:50,539 --> 01:53:55,819
can but you also need the function and

2504
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:57,650
so my there's a bunch of people on the

2505
01:53:55,819 --> 01:54:00,259
on Instagram I was going to talk about

2506
01:53:57,649 --> 01:54:03,799
this today's so if you're mixing

2507
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:05,360
distillate or you're mixing any kind of

2508
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:07,600
extract with terpenes you need to give

2509
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:10,549
it several days to kind of find its way

2510
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:13,820
mix it really well let it sit three to

2511
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:17,570
five days make sure that there's no off

2512
01:54:13,819 --> 01:54:19,699
gassing or bubbles or a volatile type of

2513
01:54:17,569 --> 01:54:22,460
oil then when you put it into the tank

2514
01:54:19,699 --> 01:54:25,039
or if you're mixing it right away and

2515
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:27,109
and you just want to be impatient and

2516
01:54:25,039 --> 01:54:29,199
you put it into the tank if you leave it

2517
01:54:27,109 --> 01:54:32,089
off if you leave it with the lid off I

2518
01:54:29,199 --> 01:54:35,210
have these little trays and if you leave

2519
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:37,130
it with the lid off for 24 hours with

2520
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:38,720
the lid off itself like that sauce you

2521
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:40,699
just saw me put in here I'm waiting for

2522
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:42,680
it to go down if you leave it with the

2523
01:54:40,699 --> 01:54:43,849
lid off not like this but if you put it

2524
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:46,550
in here and you leave with the lid off

2525
01:54:43,850 --> 01:54:49,990
and you wait 24 hours what happens is

2526
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:53,449
the the sick stone if you will in there

2527
01:54:49,989 --> 01:54:57,649
absorbs all of the oil in its in in its

2528
01:54:53,449 --> 01:55:00,470
entirety as one unit and and leaves a I

2529
01:54:57,649 --> 01:55:02,509
wouldn't say a harder level but it

2530
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:05,180
leaves a nice like kind of custard level

2531
01:55:02,510 --> 01:55:07,489
at the top you put your pen on and then

2532
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:09,530
they never leak and then they they hit

2533
01:55:07,489 --> 01:55:13,010
perfectly and consistently and they

2534
01:55:09,529 --> 01:55:15,529
never separate custard you say custard

2535
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:18,789
so it creates it creates this is like

2536
01:55:15,529 --> 01:55:22,340
weeks some custard and it creates a

2537
01:55:18,789 --> 01:55:22,979
consistent oil if not just a little bit

2538
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:25,890
of pressure

2539
01:55:22,979 --> 01:55:28,469
which led is gonna lead me to like kind

2540
01:55:25,890 --> 01:55:31,530
of another idea which is using a device

2541
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:33,030
that creates pressure from terpenes to

2542
01:55:31,529 --> 01:55:36,479
do the separations that have an actual

2543
01:55:33,029 --> 01:55:38,250
press but if you don't if you don't use

2544
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:41,669
it right away and you let that sit that

2545
01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:45,239
could separate on you and so what we

2546
01:55:41,670 --> 01:55:48,630
found was if you took what scale Dolan

2547
01:55:45,239 --> 01:55:52,109
was saying is if you take the the say if

2548
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:56,369
you you know took a lie Brosnan or you

2549
01:55:52,109 --> 01:56:01,229
took a flower rosin and there was a

2550
01:55:56,369 --> 01:56:06,630
gentle heat like 105 or 110 degrees to

2551
01:56:01,229 --> 01:56:12,149
just gently warm up the extract even if

2552
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:14,400
it was just 10% and a slightly activated

2553
01:56:12,149 --> 01:56:15,569
10 or 20% then you get in and then when

2554
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:19,049
you get back into it

2555
01:56:15,569 --> 01:56:21,509
you end up getting more of a gel which

2556
01:56:19,050 --> 01:56:24,150
kind of looks like maybe of the old co2

2557
01:56:21,510 --> 01:56:25,680
days but literally every single thing

2558
01:56:24,149 --> 01:56:28,529
will come off this pen this was just

2559
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:32,159
laying sideways but it literally works

2560
01:56:28,529 --> 01:56:34,109
perfectly so there's that trade-off this

2561
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:40,460
one was this one was almost halfway

2562
01:56:34,109 --> 01:56:43,829
activated but he really works perfectly

2563
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:47,130
so there's that trade-off this one was

2564
01:56:43,829 --> 01:56:49,019
this one was almost halfway out damn I

2565
01:56:47,130 --> 01:56:50,909
wondered what that was I was like okay

2566
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:53,040
that's weird Tony sounds different now

2567
01:56:50,909 --> 01:56:54,569
all of a sudden I was just like not

2568
01:56:53,039 --> 01:56:56,729
paying attention for half a second then

2569
01:56:54,569 --> 01:57:00,359
Indra came in hello and literally he was

2570
01:56:56,729 --> 01:57:06,859
literally in the trichomes I'm just like

2571
01:57:00,359 --> 01:57:11,880
what yeah so I long story short you know

2572
01:57:06,859 --> 01:57:13,739
terpenes helped break out THC a it helps

2573
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:16,140
break out CBD it helps break out

2574
01:57:13,739 --> 01:57:18,300
different elements it also helps me get

2575
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:20,579
high I find it's a very important

2576
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:23,029
component of feeling properly elevated

2577
01:57:20,579 --> 01:57:31,019
from the dead not to interrupt you go on

2578
01:57:23,029 --> 01:57:33,179
that's all I think it's important to be

2579
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:34,960
honest very much so let's say one thing

2580
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:38,409
about that pen here and right now

2581
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:40,739
and forever do not plug it in with with

2582
01:57:38,409 --> 01:57:44,949
with the cart attached to the battery

2583
01:57:40,738 --> 01:57:46,419
this is a no now yeah so if anything

2584
01:57:44,949 --> 01:57:49,510
with the audience that's listening don't

2585
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:52,539
ever plug it in like this always remove

2586
01:57:49,510 --> 01:57:54,909
the tank from the battery exactly it's

2587
01:57:52,539 --> 01:58:01,630
an it's a newer type of battery that's a

2588
01:57:54,909 --> 01:58:03,550
14 watts of ohm and it will it will heat

2589
01:58:01,630 --> 01:58:06,880
up your oil very quickly let's put it

2590
01:58:03,550 --> 01:58:09,180
that way and could potentially catch

2591
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:09,180
fire

2592
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:21,090
well that's safe what is the $5,000

2593
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:24,070
right now it's very conscious 60 bucks

2594
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:26,980
it's 62 dollars retail for an empty and

2595
01:58:24,069 --> 01:58:28,479
you we were sewn like Gary sellin the

2596
01:58:26,979 --> 01:58:30,159
little 10 drop vials with the whole

2597
01:58:28,479 --> 01:58:33,369
applicator and everything so people

2598
01:58:30,159 --> 01:58:35,500
could make them at home and you know

2599
01:58:33,369 --> 01:58:37,449
even for us where we're selling them

2600
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:38,979
with the oil and it and we were trying

2601
01:58:37,449 --> 01:58:43,149
to get everything down to like a live

2602
01:58:38,979 --> 01:58:45,549
rosin so it's but in that process we

2603
01:58:43,149 --> 01:58:47,649
learned you know filling the tanks up

2604
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:51,789
and not letting them kind of sit in

2605
01:58:47,649 --> 01:58:53,349
there for a 24 hour period would start

2606
01:58:51,789 --> 01:58:56,800
to have them the oils would want to

2607
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:58,600
separate and that's really just a tip

2608
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:00,550
you know if you're at home and you're

2609
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:03,070
gonna use it right away no problem but

2610
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:04,630
if you were gonna if you were going to

2611
01:59:03,069 --> 01:59:07,479
try to keep it for I don't know a week

2612
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:09,250
or two weeks you want to let it sit in

2613
01:59:07,479 --> 01:59:15,519
the pen before you put the top on for

2614
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:19,180
just a day I changed the subject real

2615
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:21,040
quick I know I'm kind of like a new

2616
01:59:19,180 --> 01:59:22,539
friend of the group but one of the

2617
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:26,890
things I was just kind of feeling right

2618
01:59:22,539 --> 01:59:29,350
now is you know every time Marcus says

2619
01:59:26,890 --> 01:59:31,770
something like I laugh my ass off and

2620
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:35,620
it's usually so well articulated and

2621
01:59:31,770 --> 01:59:38,290
insightful and just just joyous to me

2622
01:59:35,619 --> 01:59:40,659
man in my in my whole field so since

2623
01:59:38,289 --> 01:59:42,369
I've got this this this this a little

2624
01:59:40,659 --> 01:59:44,738
bit of space and since there's such a

2625
01:59:42,369 --> 01:59:46,979
collective of people I was just

2626
01:59:44,738 --> 01:59:49,859
wondering if we could all maybe used

2627
01:59:46,979 --> 01:59:53,839
I'm in a church like fashion to kind of

2628
01:59:49,859 --> 01:59:57,449
send Marcus some some deep gratitude

2629
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:59,670
some deep appreciation for all that he

2630
01:59:57,449 --> 02:00:01,649
has done and given of himself at his

2631
01:59:59,670 --> 02:00:04,800
time of his energy of his consciousness

2632
02:00:01,649 --> 02:00:07,349
to all of us and just really be so

2633

02:00:49,710 --> 02:00:54,060
of you that haven't sent your email I

2647

think it's Nate now Nate's in the chat

2648

2650
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:08,610
very very generous kick down 50 10 grand

2651
02:01:05,039 --> 02:01:11,430
bags of soil bounce Pro just trillions

2652
02:01:08,609 --> 02:01:13,439
of bacteria just kicking down the

2653
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:15,090
trillions that's generous when your

2654
02:01:13,439 --> 02:01:16,429
generosity gets into the trillions

2655
02:01:15,090 --> 02:01:21,020
whatever it is you're dealing with

2656
02:01:16,430 --> 02:01:23,039
that's uh I mean come on ridiculous

2657
02:01:21,020 --> 02:01:27,540
[Music]

2658
02:01:23,039 --> 02:01:31,199
so Marcus I did a little experiment this

2659
02:01:27,539 --> 02:01:33,239
weekend which I think may be an interest

2660
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:36,989
you got your head put on a glandular

2661
02:01:33,239 --> 02:01:39,750
trichomes body well I I decided to

2662
02:01:36,989 --> 02:01:42,869
become a trichrome was the only way I am

2663
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:45,060
so I just gave in and became a trichrome

2664
02:01:42,869 --> 02:01:52,170
myself I hang out with dry Chrome's now

2665
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:54,960
and that's it so anyway as far as the

2666
02:01:52,170 --> 02:01:58,980
treating of your oil to work in the Pens

2667
02:01:54,960 --> 02:02:01,079
a very good way to do it is to take it

2668
02:01:58,979 --> 02:02:05,769
in a vacuum oven

2669
02:02:01,079 --> 02:02:10,359
set the oven for 130 degrees and run it

2670
02:02:05,770 --> 02:02:13,030
for about 38 or 40 hours and your stuff

2671
02:02:10,359 --> 02:02:14,739
will run in the pen like water after

2672
02:02:13,029 --> 02:02:18,880
that it'll all drain it'll all work

2673
02:02:14,739 --> 02:02:19,599
really good we all end off here offering

2674
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:22,300
a pen pal

2675
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:24,990
where the terpenes go it don't go

2676
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:27,130
anywhere cuz you only run it 135 degrees

2677
02:02:24,989 --> 02:02:29,319
just stay right here

2678
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:34,150
Oh vacuum and they just stay right there

2679
02:02:29,319 --> 02:02:38,049
I was like Indra I just wanted to

2680
02:02:34,149 --> 02:02:39,609
mention that I have a patent on my face

2681
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:45,850
on resonance

2682
02:02:39,609 --> 02:02:49,149
oh you patented I did ten years ago so

2683
02:02:45,850 --> 02:02:53,500
what you're doing is you owe me exactly

2684
02:02:49,149 --> 02:02:54,699
twenty three cents at this moment I'll

2685
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:59,890
send it right away

2686
02:02:54,699 --> 02:03:04,179
but anyway what I think is a good piece

2687
02:02:59,890 --> 02:03:06,940
of notice I took four plants I cut them

2688
02:03:04,180 --> 02:03:10,770
down and within ten minutes I put him in

2689
02:03:06,939 --> 02:03:15,669
the extractor and I expected them and

2690
02:03:10,770 --> 02:03:18,250
the results are truly truly truly

2691
02:03:15,670 --> 02:03:21,760
amazing I have never smoked oil this

2692
02:03:18,250 --> 02:03:25,239
strong in my life this is the best stuff

2693
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:28,020
I've ever imbibed it's so strong it's

2694
02:03:25,239 --> 02:03:30,729
not good it smells like a fresh flower

2695
02:03:28,020 --> 02:03:33,060
it tastes like it when you smoke it it

2696
02:03:30,729 --> 02:03:39,639
tastes like a brand-new fresh flower

2697
02:03:33,060 --> 02:03:45,760
absolutely delicious and it's you can

2698
02:03:39,640 --> 02:03:48,180
pull out huge huge huge things with it

2699
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:53,199
it's just the most beautiful oil and I

2700
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:55,869
would say after trying this that maybe

2701
02:03:53,199 --> 02:03:57,369
this is a new product I think that

2702
02:03:55,869 --> 02:04:00,880
nobody's really making little market

2703
02:03:57,369 --> 02:04:04,029
it's absolutely fresh what's that the

2704
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:11,199
oil I BHO did 20 minutes after I cut the

2705
02:04:04,029 --> 02:04:12,759
plant down the lines by truly live and I

2706
02:04:11,199 --> 02:04:14,979
got some

2707
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:16,690
I've got a drop of it freezing on a drop

2708
02:04:14,979 --> 02:04:19,389
of water in the freezer I'm gonna try to

2709
02:04:16,689 --> 02:04:23,019
see if I can make a to see if it'll make

2710
02:04:19,390 --> 02:04:25,270
a picture or if it'll crystallize out on

2711
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:26,949
the in the thaw out grade I've mentioned

2712
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:30,160
that before with living oils that we

2713
02:04:26,948 --> 02:04:32,738
made in the past from many other plants

2714
02:04:30,159 --> 02:04:35,109
not hot I didn't try making it apart so

2715
02:04:32,738 --> 02:04:37,988
I'm gonna be trying that with it take a

2716
02:04:35,109 --> 02:04:40,119
look at this live resident but I have

2717
02:04:37,988 --> 02:04:42,609
everybody who's come over nobody has

2718
02:04:40,119 --> 02:04:46,988
been able to take more than one good hit

2719
02:04:42,609 --> 02:04:50,619
off of it one good hit this plastic like

2720
02:04:46,988 --> 02:04:53,619
I believe it it's a lot like my resin

2721
02:04:50,619 --> 02:04:55,448
but the terpene count I gotta have it

2722
02:04:53,619 --> 02:04:57,698
analyzed the terpenes are so powerful

2723
02:04:55,448 --> 02:05:03,579
and you can taste them in your mouth

2724
02:04:57,698 --> 02:05:05,409
when you dab it so I'm thinking this

2725
02:05:03,579 --> 02:05:08,170
stuff will also work really nicely in

2726
02:05:05,409 --> 02:05:10,599
the pan I've got one of those pens right

2727
02:05:08,170 --> 02:05:13,300
that's the beauty of the pen you can put

2728
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:16,150
your own [ __ ] in it we didn't want to

2729
02:05:13,300 --> 02:05:17,949
pull out a pen that was like locked to

2730
02:05:16,149 --> 02:05:19,719
our you know like oh it has to you know

2731
02:05:17,948 --> 02:05:21,279
you have to get the oil every time from

2732
02:05:19,719 --> 02:05:24,939
those guys it's like no you got to be

2733
02:05:21,279 --> 02:05:27,670
able to put your own yeah I'm definitely

2734
02:05:24,939 --> 02:05:29,159
with you on that I think being able to

2735
02:05:27,670 --> 02:05:31,869
put your own stuff in it that's why I

2736
02:05:29,159 --> 02:05:35,559
extracted a very fresh one I wanted to

2737
02:05:31,869 --> 02:05:37,510
see if I could get around the long heat

2738
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:39,940
treatment or the long low vacuum

2739
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:42,730
treatment to make it so many more in the

2740
02:05:39,939 --> 02:05:44,919
pen most of the oils work in the pen if

2741
02:05:42,729 --> 02:05:48,129
you do them in the vacuum of them for 48

2742
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:50,500
hours that are very low heat and not not

2743
02:05:48,130 --> 02:05:53,469
a full vacuum you know a gentle vacuum

2744
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:56,979
after that they'll pour no pour into a

2745
02:05:53,469 --> 02:06:00,340
pen but this fresh extraction was it's

2746
02:05:56,979 --> 02:06:03,639
truly amazing I wish you were across the

2750
02:06:09,279 --> 02:06:16,869

2819
02:09:34,689 --> 02:09:38,109
time we're just sitting around kind of

2820
02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:39,579
laughing and it's actually been a pretty

2821
02:09:38,109 --> 02:09:41,859
good conversation today but it has

2822
02:09:39,579 --> 02:09:42,960
indeed been three years and that is kind

2823
02:09:41,859 --> 02:09:47,969
of crazy

2824
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:50,409
yeah next meal went by awfully quick

2825
02:09:47,970 --> 02:09:52,980
that's the thing as you do get older

2826
02:09:50,409 --> 02:09:57,399
time goes by so much quicker

2827
02:09:52,979 --> 02:10:00,849
it's hardly unfair true it is but that's

2828
02:09:57,399 --> 02:10:02,349
okay you know we're we're alive and

2829
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:04,420
we're lucky that's the way I see it

2830
02:10:02,350 --> 02:10:07,690
that's that's the lesson I get in life

2831
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:10,890
every time from losing my father at a

2832
02:10:07,689 --> 02:10:13,599
young age she was 55 my stepmom was 49

2833
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:16,840
they were killed in an accident and a

2834
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:20,920
motorcycle accident and whatever kind of

2835
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:23,319
being like beats the alternative

2836
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:25,149
you know being dead they're kind of like

2837
02:10:23,319 --> 02:10:27,579
oh [ __ ] yeah you're right like it really

2838
02:10:25,149 --> 02:10:30,519
does beat the alternative being alive no

2839
02:10:27,579 --> 02:10:32,970
matter how old you are you're crushing

2840
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:36,240
it well if you believe in reincarnation

2841
02:10:32,970 --> 02:10:39,310
you'll get a nice fresh new young bod

2842
02:10:36,239 --> 02:10:40,840
yeah or you come back as a leper on the

2843
02:10:39,310 --> 02:10:43,900
streets of India I think that's a bit

2844
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:44,949
terrifying too if you better schmuck you

2845
02:10:43,899 --> 02:10:52,869
deserve it

2846
02:10:44,949 --> 02:10:53,408
yeah I absolutely do not but no there's

2847
02:10:52,869 --> 02:10:57,380
not

2848
02:10:53,408 --> 02:10:58,988
do believe deserving he believes in just

2849
02:10:57,380 --> 02:11:00,739
desserts

2850
02:10:58,988 --> 02:11:04,339
he doesn't have to believe in

2851
02:11:00,738 --> 02:11:05,808
reincarnation to believe in that you

2852
02:11:04,340 --> 02:11:09,918
know I like coming he's got it patented

2853
02:11:05,809 --> 02:11:13,550
he's got a patented absolutely he's got

2854
02:11:09,918 --> 02:11:16,849
a patented well I was gonna press up a

2855
02:11:13,550 --> 02:11:21,829
bunch of rosin today but I'm not sure if

2856
02:11:16,849 --> 02:11:24,168
I'm gonna continue that or not I've been

2857
02:11:21,828 --> 02:11:27,828
wanting to make a sh for like a month

2858
02:11:24,168 --> 02:11:30,109
and a half so I'm definitely gonna pull

2859
02:11:27,828 --> 02:11:33,259
on your bags dude and we're gonna wash

2860
02:11:30,109 --> 02:11:36,198
some resin today and we gonna search and

2861
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:39,079
thank you so much for your last 158 Sun

2862
02:11:36,198 --> 02:11:41,359
days of your life doing it with you

2863
02:11:39,078 --> 02:11:44,208
we've ran across airports to make sure

2864
02:11:41,359 --> 02:11:47,328
you've gone from this episode going sped

2865
02:11:44,208 --> 02:11:49,368
down rows gone through hotels screeched

2866
02:11:47,328 --> 02:11:51,139
and aside things I mean I'm being with

2867
02:11:49,368 --> 02:11:53,589
you a long way we hated internet

2868
02:11:51,139 --> 02:11:57,380
connections but we didn't have them I

2869
02:11:53,590 --> 02:12:01,399
think the best one by far was landing at

2870
02:11:57,380 --> 02:12:05,059
the airport Sunday morning Toronto and

2871
02:12:01,399 --> 02:12:07,189
then jumping into quads Parker with with

2872
02:12:05,059 --> 02:12:09,708
three other Rastafarians and it's a

2873
02:12:07,189 --> 02:12:12,409
blizzard and we're driving to Brampton

2874
02:12:09,708 --> 02:12:14,929
Ontario and I'm in the back seat and

2875
02:12:12,408 --> 02:12:16,759
this you know phobos driving straight

2876
02:12:14,929 --> 02:12:19,519
blizzard everywhere I'm like this is

2877
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:21,320
[ __ ] crazy like I've got like 18

2878
02:12:19,519 --> 02:12:23,349
minutes to make do they drive the same

2879

what and in Bobo's defense he absolutely

2891
02:12:53,328 --> 02:12:57,018
got me there it was the shortest hashed

2892
02:12:54,859 --> 02:12:59,359
church we ever did because the internet

2893
02:12:57,019 --> 02:13:01,418
ended up hacking out I think we got 17

2894
02:12:59,359 --> 02:13:03,589
minutes that episode of hashed Church

2895
02:13:01,418 --> 02:13:05,988
remember the one in the grill where we

2896
02:13:03,590 --> 02:13:07,219
could only find one spot on the corner

2897
02:13:05,988 --> 02:13:09,829
post the

2898
02:13:07,219 --> 02:13:12,469
and people had to share the spot there

2899
02:13:09,829 --> 02:13:14,000
was little chairs that were built out of

2900
02:13:12,469 --> 02:13:16,159
what is like oh what's this and you're

2901
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,270
like well we better sit here early like

2902
02:13:16,159 --> 02:13:19,309
what do you mean you're like well sit

2903
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:22,520
down we've got as we got a secure

2904
02:13:19,310 --> 02:13:24,560
internet position and we just hold it

2905
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:26,449
down right there in that one one foot by

2906
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:27,980
one foot I took that further I asked a

2907
02:13:26,448 --> 02:13:30,079
few people if they wouldn't mind not

2908
02:13:27,979 --> 02:13:31,639
going online while we were using the

2909
02:13:30,079 --> 02:13:35,779
internet because we were streaming

2910
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:37,869
everything oh yeah I'm trying to explain

2911
02:13:35,779 --> 02:13:40,429
hash search in two sentences is tough

2912
02:13:37,869 --> 02:13:42,319
yeah it's like what's it what's it for

2913
02:13:40,430 --> 02:13:43,730
mine and that one guy you were like well

2914
02:13:42,319 --> 02:13:46,869
it's for hashed churches like hashed

2915
02:13:43,729 --> 02:13:50,718
Church like a house church is like oh

2916
02:13:46,869 --> 02:13:52,789
and there's always that like moment

2917
02:13:50,719 --> 02:13:55,819
where they're like I don't they just

2918
02:13:52,789 --> 02:13:58,460
doesn't compute well it's two strange

2919
02:13:55,819 --> 02:14:01,340
words to put together right it's a once

2920
02:13:58,460 --> 02:14:03,230
again I always got a shout out Amir my

2921
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:05,090
good buddy Amir who had a still had a

2922
02:14:03,229 --> 02:14:06,799
restaurant across from me at the melting

2923
02:14:05,090 --> 02:14:09,770
point called rhyme and that's where we

2924
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:13,070
did the original Church you know and so

2925
02:14:09,770 --> 02:14:16,100
after 20 years Oh bye and it's much much

2926
02:14:13,069 --> 02:14:18,319
hash and things about hash the stream

2927
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:19,969
had to be making past church so that's

2928
02:14:18,319 --> 02:14:22,759
really kind of the birth of hash Church

2929
02:14:19,969 --> 02:14:24,829
YouTube letting me stream Amir and my

2930
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:26,659
friends gathering on Sundays for what we

2931
02:14:24,829 --> 02:14:28,279
just called Church back then it was

2932
02:14:26,659 --> 02:14:29,869
still the Prohibition land so we weren't

2933
02:14:28,279 --> 02:14:31,369
gonna call it cannabis Church or weed

2934
02:14:29,869 --> 02:14:33,500
Church or anything that made it stand

2935
02:14:31,369 --> 02:14:35,869
out that we could be talking about it

2936
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:37,819
and then get ourselves into trouble but

2937
02:14:35,869 --> 02:14:40,250
that quickly changed and here we are

2938
02:14:37,819 --> 02:14:43,250
hashed church every Sunday for the last

2939
02:14:40,250 --> 02:14:46,909
three years and a couple of weeks - one

2940
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:49,729
I was camping it happens you know

2941

different just a whole different

2968

experience because it's like I wasn't

2969

expecting an entire concert in campaign

2970

what I wanted to do was I wanted to stop

3038
02:19:04,308 --> 02:19:08,090
all this cannabis ridiculousness and

3039
02:19:06,110 --> 02:19:10,159
start booze church because let's be

3040
02:19:08,090 --> 02:19:13,250
honest booze is the real deal

3041
02:19:10,159 --> 02:19:16,069
it's medicinal it's recreational it's

3042
02:19:13,250 --> 02:19:19,398
good for the children nobody ever said

3043
02:19:16,069 --> 02:19:21,289
that takes my pain away right away takes

3044
02:19:19,398 --> 02:19:22,549
it you want if you want to have 10

3045
02:19:21,290 --> 02:19:26,120
million viewers to start booze and

3046
02:19:22,549 --> 02:19:28,188
football church yeah yeah just have

3047
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:30,290
Hastert and review flow we're gonna

3048
02:19:28,189 --> 02:19:31,909
change it to boob Church that will

3049
02:19:30,290 --> 02:19:33,439
actually give them some more viewers you

3050
02:19:31,909 --> 02:19:35,450
know what you might be right

3051
02:19:33,439 --> 02:19:37,489
you might be right but I don't think

3052
02:19:35,450 --> 02:19:39,920
that will have any of our respected

3053
02:19:37,489 --> 02:19:43,369
esteemed colleagues showing up anymore

3054
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:44,520
like Hillary black or dr. Natasha no

3055
02:19:43,370 --> 02:19:46,170
they wouldn't they

3056
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:48,840
do it at all we're gonna be out there

3057
02:19:46,170 --> 02:19:50,940
gonna be like sorry guys we just we lost

3058
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:53,220
all respect for everything you do and

3059
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:55,230
when you started blues church and by the

3060
02:19:53,220 --> 02:19:58,049
way I think God on that note we should

3061
02:19:55,229 --> 02:19:59,939
also pay some serious respect to the

3062
02:19:58,049 --> 02:20:03,600
ladies because I think one of the one of

3063
02:19:59,940 --> 02:20:06,000
the top 10 best episodes is when there

3064
02:20:03,601 --> 02:20:10,200
was an all-women's hash Church easy

3065
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:14,010
Thomas yeah Tom yeah it was pretty

3066
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:15,811
impressive because it was like CNN took

3067
02:20:14,010 --> 02:20:17,460
over hashed Church with all of these

3068
02:20:15,810 --> 02:20:20,549
like professional broadcasters

3069
02:20:17,459 --> 02:20:23,009
researchers doctors and really made us

3070
02:20:20,549 --> 02:20:24,659
all look a little just kind of like

3071
02:20:23,010 --> 02:20:29,250
we're barely holding it together guys

3072
02:20:24,659 --> 02:20:31,950
well even though every single one was

3073
02:20:29,250 --> 02:20:34,351
framed perfectly you know you didn't see

3074
02:20:31,950 --> 02:20:36,721
tons of [ __ ] they all had like these

3075
02:20:34,351 --> 02:20:41,790
perfect frames like they were like news

3076
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:43,949
anchors I was like holy [ __ ] ladies are

3077
02:20:41,790 --> 02:20:46,110
crushing it but and there was the but

3078
02:20:43,950 --> 02:20:48,420
not only that it was the amount of

3079
02:20:46,110 --> 02:20:51,090
information per square inch if you will

3080
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:54,510
like when we talk about lumens it was

3081
02:20:51,090 --> 02:20:56,729
there wasn't a slow draw or we had to

3082
02:20:54,510 --> 02:21:04,560
come to a conclusion together or like we

3083
02:20:56,729 --> 02:21:07,289
talked about it it was no interruptions

3084
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:09,539
no interruptions it just full-on machine

3085
02:21:07,290 --> 02:21:12,271
gun information like it was like we're

3086
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:14,010
live here down in down in Mexico after

3087
02:21:12,271 --> 02:21:16,260
the earthquake we're gonna go here it

3088
02:21:14,010 --> 02:21:18,739
was like it was like wow so the amount

3089
02:21:16,260 --> 02:21:20,700
of information that got pushed

3090
02:21:18,739 --> 02:21:23,069
incredible I thought it was like an

3091
02:21:20,700 --> 02:21:26,090
incredible unity and and people need to

3092
02:21:23,069 --> 02:21:29,520
need to understand that the future of

3093
02:21:26,090 --> 02:21:31,681
cannabis is gonna have a lot of women in

3094
02:21:29,521 --> 02:21:34,290
it and it should I think it brings a

3095
02:21:31,681 --> 02:21:37,260
good harmony between two approaches of

3096
02:21:34,290 --> 02:21:40,530
our industry but hats off to the women

3097
02:21:37,260 --> 02:21:43,800
that did that episode one of the best

3098
02:21:40,530 --> 02:21:46,920
hash searches it's already full I

3099
02:21:43,799 --> 02:21:49,289
thought for the best growers that I have

3100
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:52,379
met in the past two or three years have

3101
02:21:49,290 --> 02:21:54,710
been women some women have turned me

3102
02:21:52,379 --> 02:21:56,959
under some of the best buds

3103
02:21:54,709 --> 02:22:00,019
ever had my hands on including back in

3104
02:21:56,959 --> 02:22:02,599
Vietnam days and I wasn't even going to

3105
02:22:00,020 --> 02:22:06,110
grow anymore I gave up last year because

3106
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:08,270
I you know I'm getting old and it gets

3107
02:22:06,110 --> 02:22:12,530
hard to do but this year I grew a dozen

3108
02:22:08,270 --> 02:22:14,810
plants and way do you see the one it

3109
02:22:12,530 --> 02:22:20,530
looks like somebody spray-painted it

3110
02:22:14,809 --> 02:22:24,889
with glitter and I used my years long

3111
02:22:20,530 --> 02:22:26,840
scenario to do it with grab it - if you

3112
02:22:24,889 --> 02:22:30,829
have a pool and rabbit bootie with the

3113
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:33,799
only additives in it and I just we

3114
02:22:30,829 --> 02:22:35,840
smoked one last night it just puts you

3115
02:22:33,799 --> 02:22:40,549
in another headspace you smoked rabbit

3116
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:42,889
poo last night or what did you literally

3117
02:22:40,549 --> 02:22:46,219
I guess because the remand made the

3118
02:22:42,889 --> 02:22:48,109
terpenes and they made the track chrome

3119
02:22:46,219 --> 02:22:50,209
heads and that's what I was burning so I

3120
02:22:48,110 --> 02:22:56,420
guess I was saying I was having rabbit

3121
02:22:50,209 --> 02:22:57,919
poo red that's awesome so anyway there's

3122
02:22:56,420 --> 02:23:03,049
some of my stuff in the background there

3123
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:05,719
you like it yeah oh um when you're

3124
02:23:03,049 --> 02:23:07,069
putting your oil real quick I did want

3125
02:23:05,719 --> 02:23:09,260
to say this because this is really

3126
02:23:07,069 --> 02:23:11,600
important when you put the oil in the

3127
02:23:09,260 --> 02:23:13,909
pen John or anybody that's out there you

3128
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:18,170
know just like when you're hitting a

3129
02:23:13,909 --> 02:23:19,639
bong you would you would pull then you

3130
02:23:18,170 --> 02:23:21,319
would light your bowl then you would hit

3131
02:23:19,639 --> 02:23:23,719
your bong then you would clear it and

3132
02:23:21,319 --> 02:23:26,090
you would never leave like a stale bong

3133
02:23:23,719 --> 02:23:28,639
so like the same thing with this is you

3134
02:23:26,090 --> 02:23:32,690
want to pull press get whatever hit you

3135
02:23:28,639 --> 02:23:35,090
want let go clear it and when and when

3136
02:23:32,690 --> 02:23:37,880
you're if you use your finger it doesn't

3137
02:23:35,090 --> 02:23:39,620
really matter but it whatever size your

3138
02:23:37,879 --> 02:23:42,019
hit is but for oil especially when

3139
02:23:39,620 --> 02:23:45,079
you're using live resin like a BHO

3140
02:23:42,020 --> 02:23:47,540
something that's real runny you have to

3141
02:23:45,079 --> 02:23:49,069
be able to let the tank cool down and do

3142
02:23:47,540 --> 02:23:50,990
that by putting your finger here and if

3143
02:23:49,069 --> 02:23:51,529
it's still warm to the touch don't hit

3144
02:23:50,989 --> 02:23:54,559
it again

3145
02:23:51,530 --> 02:23:57,979
just pull cool air through it just over

3146
02:23:54,559 --> 02:23:59,869
and over until it's cool so there were

3147
02:23:57,978 --> 02:24:02,689
people that were using that these tanks

3148
02:23:59,870 --> 02:24:05,030
for the for like live resins and you

3149
02:24:02,690 --> 02:24:06,470
know 20 and 30% oils and things like

3150
02:24:05,030 --> 02:24:08,590
that but they're hitting it over and

3151
02:24:06,469 --> 02:24:11,198
over and over and the tank will run high

3152
02:24:08,590 --> 02:24:13,210
and it's not like a wick it's not a

3153
02:24:11,199 --> 02:24:16,350
wicking system so I just wanted to let

3154
02:24:13,209 --> 02:24:18,309
you know that before in case this was

3155
02:24:16,350 --> 02:24:20,520
there's a hole in the bottom you have to

3156
02:24:18,309 --> 02:24:23,109
be yeah just gotta be conscious of it

3157
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:27,689
it's like everything in nature this hole

3158
02:24:23,109 --> 02:24:27,689
in the bottom stuff drains out oh yeah

3159
02:24:29,609 --> 02:24:34,449
don't drain well miners always if you do

3160
02:24:32,859 --> 02:24:36,880
it exactly like that you'll always have

3161
02:24:34,449 --> 02:24:39,130
a clean bottom you know just like always

3162
02:24:36,879 --> 02:24:41,559
clean I always pull cool air through it

3163
02:24:39,129 --> 02:24:44,500
every time after every hit I thought mom

3164
02:24:41,559 --> 02:24:49,389
said teaching us about wiping about the

3165
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:51,760
clean bottom yep exactly the same thing

3166
02:24:49,389 --> 02:24:53,709
in life is a clean bottom but let me

3167
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:58,750
tell you Tony if you run it in the

3168
02:24:53,709 --> 02:25:01,528
vacuum of 4835 you won't be amazed

3169
02:24:58,750 --> 02:25:04,568
this one that's what that is right there

3170
02:25:01,529 --> 02:25:06,180
yeah it's a totally different oil it's

3171
02:25:04,568 --> 02:25:08,408
unbelievable

3172
02:25:06,180 --> 02:25:11,828
exactly what you said this is like a low

3173
02:25:08,408 --> 02:25:15,639
heat on you know yeah I know I've done

3174
02:25:11,828 --> 02:25:17,889
it quite a few times and I know it's a

3175
02:25:15,639 --> 02:25:20,318
very good method and if you've got a

3176
02:25:17,889 --> 02:25:22,689
specially resistant oil like sometimes

3177
02:25:20,318 --> 02:25:24,969
when you do BHO you get it come out and

3178
02:25:22,689 --> 02:25:27,359
it'll look like an iceberg or it'll just

3179
02:25:24,969 --> 02:25:31,510
be solid as a rock then you raise it to

3180
02:25:27,359 --> 02:25:36,908
149 degrees for the 48 hours and it'll

3181
02:25:31,510 --> 02:25:39,068
get motile again Deandra have you uh

3182
02:25:36,908 --> 02:25:41,318
checked out that new Ken Burns

3183
02:25:39,068 --> 02:25:43,420

3185
02:25:43,420 --> 02:25:47,228
Vietnam documentary I just started

3186
02:25:45,250 --> 02:25:48,100
watching it it seems amazing I don't

3187
02:25:47,228 --> 02:25:51,158
know if you've seen any of his other

3188
02:25:48,100 --> 02:25:56,559

3189
02:25:51,158 --> 02:25:58,689
18 hours yeah it's it's I mean if you

3190

was a combat field medic so I'm never in

3192
02:26:03,488 --> 02:26:09,488
a hurry to see pictures again

3193

02:26:11,350 --> 02:26:17,710
Vietnam with me over the and I've never

3196
02:26:14,590 --> 02:26:19,779
looked at them once about a match and I

3197
02:26:17,709 --> 02:26:20,379
gave them to my mom and she put them in

3198
02:26:19,779 --> 02:26:21,909
a box

3199
02:26:20,379 --> 02:26:24,609
don't ever

3200
02:26:21,909 --> 02:26:25,959
out like I wanted to see I didn't even

3201
02:26:24,610 --> 02:26:28,180
want to look at the pictures of my

3202
02:26:25,959 --> 02:26:31,659
friends because every single person I

3203
02:26:28,180 --> 02:26:35,440
was with there died there I was the one

3204
02:26:31,659 --> 02:26:38,829
person to wit in a company and got back

3205
02:26:35,440 --> 02:26:40,930
out and so I've never felt drawn when I

3206
02:26:38,829 --> 02:26:43,750
look at that stuff it's like something

3207
02:26:40,930 --> 02:26:46,360
gets stiff inside of me you know because

3208
02:26:43,750 --> 02:26:49,360
going through that experience I think

3209
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:51,101
what saved me and made me not crazy and

3210
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:54,340
not want to kill myself like so many

3211
02:26:51,101 --> 02:26:56,950
guys did because when he came back the

3212
02:26:54,340 --> 02:26:58,810
country didn't accept the responsibility

3213
02:26:56,950 --> 02:27:00,430
for it they left it on the shoulders of

3214
02:26:58,810 --> 02:27:02,920
the veterans and so a lot of them

3215
02:27:00,430 --> 02:27:04,870
started killing themselves but soon

3216
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:07,659
after I came back I picked up some

3217
02:27:04,870 --> 02:27:10,000
hippies hitchhiking and they took me to

3218
02:27:07,659 --> 02:27:13,090
a party where they were passing out LSD

3219
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:15,579
and I was there for about a week high on

3220
02:27:13,090 --> 02:27:18,010
LSD and afterwards I thought to myself

3221
02:27:15,579 --> 02:27:21,760
well Vietnam that's a memory now isn't

3222
02:27:18,010 --> 02:27:25,149
it so I don't really look I don't look

3223
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:28,000
to re-experience and again my sort of my

3224
02:27:25,149 --> 02:27:30,090
way of dealing with it was finding my

3225
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:33,909
Center in the universe that weekend

3226
02:27:30,090 --> 02:27:35,530
tripping on acid and I truly did find my

3227
02:27:33,909 --> 02:27:38,170
we were at a house in the Hollywood

3228
02:27:35,530 --> 02:27:41,351
Hills three-story house and they brought

3229
02:27:38,170 --> 02:27:43,500
me in on the bottom floor gave us acid I

3230
02:27:41,351 --> 02:27:46,601
started passing out Vietnam joints

3231
02:27:43,500 --> 02:27:48,219
everybody was really plastered and I

3232
02:27:46,601 --> 02:27:49,750
ended up on the third floor and

3233
02:27:48,219 --> 02:27:52,929
everybody was talking about the first

3234
02:27:49,750 --> 02:27:55,780
acid trips and I hadn't had one so they

3235
02:27:52,930 --> 02:27:57,819
made sure that I didn't have one and it

3236
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:59,820
was a dome on the roof up there and you

3237
02:27:57,819 --> 02:28:03,940
can see it at night it was quite amazing

3238
02:27:59,819 --> 02:28:08,500
never forget it and that memory sort of

3239
02:28:03,940 --> 02:28:11,200
superseded the Vietnam stuff you know I

3240
02:28:08,500 --> 02:28:16,000
can remember guys in Vietnam on guard

3241
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:18,370
duty taking acid which I didn't you know

3242
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:21,719
that wasn't something that I was

3243
02:28:18,370 --> 02:28:25,090
interested in doing there I did smoke

3244
02:28:21,719 --> 02:28:27,909
probably two bales of marijuana while I

3245
02:28:25,090 --> 02:28:31,930
was there a sized bales of marijuana at

3246
02:28:27,909 --> 02:28:35,560
least and I sent a lot back to my mom

3247
02:28:31,930 --> 02:28:38,050
and Panasonic and Sanyo refrigerators

3248
02:28:35,560 --> 02:28:39,550
because they didn't have customs in

3249
02:28:38,050 --> 02:28:41,859
those days and you could send anything

3250
02:28:39,550 --> 02:28:43,540
directly back if they didn't have

3251
02:28:41,860 --> 02:28:45,400
customs but if you were on a combat

3252
02:28:43,540 --> 02:28:48,010
soldier you didn't have to go through

3253
02:28:45,399 --> 02:28:49,899
customs your mail went direct so I

3254
02:28:48,011 --> 02:28:53,409
started sending my mom send you over for

3255
02:28:49,899 --> 02:28:55,421
greater specs with Bluetooth stick and a

3256
02:28:53,409 --> 02:28:57,341
lot of seeds and by the way one of the

3257
02:28:55,421 --> 02:28:59,739
seeds one of the plants that I grew this

3258
02:28:57,341 --> 02:29:02,291
year it's the one that has these amazing

3259
02:28:59,739 --> 02:29:04,540
Trek homes or even on the bottom of the

3260
02:29:02,290 --> 02:29:06,340
leaf as thick as they are on the top

3261
02:29:04,540 --> 02:29:08,380
I've you look at my Instagram account

3262
02:29:06,341 --> 02:29:12,011
I've been posting pictures of this

3263
02:29:08,380 --> 02:29:14,140
particular leaves and plants on this

3264
02:29:12,011 --> 02:29:16,271
it's a green one but it's comfortable

3265
02:29:14,140 --> 02:29:18,220
trichomes everywhere I've never seen the

3266
02:29:16,271 --> 02:29:20,501
trek home so thick on the bottom and the

3267
02:29:18,220 --> 02:29:23,229
top I wish bubbleman was here because

3268
02:29:20,501 --> 02:29:25,601
I'd like to take some buds out of this

3269
02:29:23,229 --> 02:29:28,540
particular stuff and make bubble hash

3270
02:29:25,601 --> 02:29:31,721
out of it is so beautiful the trichomes

3271
02:29:28,540 --> 02:29:32,290
are just thick as flies everywhere all

3272
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:33,970
over it

3273
02:29:32,290 --> 02:29:37,840
and that was one of the scenes that I

3274
02:29:33,970 --> 02:29:40,899
brought back and it was a random seed I

3275
02:29:37,841 --> 02:29:43,511
picked out I just stuck my hand in the

3276
02:29:40,899 --> 02:29:47,560
little jar that I've got pulled this one

3277
02:29:43,511 --> 02:29:48,761
speed up and there it is and I didn't

3278
02:29:47,560 --> 02:29:55,770
make any cuttings that were there

3279
02:29:48,761 --> 02:29:55,771
anything either sadly but such as life

3280
02:29:56,610 --> 02:30:00,700
such as life sometimes that's how it

3281
02:29:59,050 --> 02:30:06,279
goes sometimes you take cuts off

3282
02:30:00,700 --> 02:30:10,570
everything sometimes she gets lost so

3283
02:30:06,280 --> 02:30:14,801
desperate you bring her back yeah I put

3284
02:30:10,569 --> 02:30:17,199
some male teeth on one of the bottom

3285
02:30:14,800 --> 02:30:20,260
branches on it but even then it's gonna

3286
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:22,211
be a different kind of a plant that the

3287
02:30:20,261 --> 02:30:32,591
seed will be able to be this very same

3288
02:30:22,210 --> 02:30:35,050
clan but anyway maybe we'll see well

3289
02:30:32,591 --> 02:30:36,489
what what a heavy heart this last day

3290
02:30:35,050 --> 02:30:40,180
but I understand you know you've made a

3291
02:30:36,489 --> 02:30:44,501
long sacrifice in behalf of everyone

3292
02:30:40,181 --> 02:30:46,480
else's consciousness and one of the best

3293
02:30:44,501 --> 02:30:49,238
things I ever heard from a guru in my

3294
02:30:46,479 --> 02:30:52,898
life which would be a good thing

3295
02:30:49,238 --> 02:30:54,878
for you was I was struggling at the time

3296
02:30:52,898 --> 02:30:59,139
learning Anatomy

3297
02:30:54,879 --> 02:31:03,039
and my teacher said to me if you want to

3298
02:30:59,139 --> 02:31:04,930
learn a thing teach it and you'll be

3299
02:31:03,039 --> 02:31:06,939
here every question there it is and

3300
02:31:04,930 --> 02:31:09,279
you'll learn it more thoroughly than any

3301
02:31:06,939 --> 02:31:10,720
other person could have taught you and I

3302
02:31:09,279 --> 02:31:14,140
think that's all you've done bubbleman

3303
02:31:10,719 --> 02:31:17,019
you've you've taught and in that

3304
02:31:14,139 --> 02:31:21,368
teaching you've learned yourself a great

3305
02:31:17,020 --> 02:31:23,140
deal and so I couldn't deny that I've

3306
02:31:21,369 --> 02:31:25,060
definitely learned a lot sitting here

3307
02:31:23,139 --> 02:31:26,648
and listening to everyone talk and being

3308
02:31:25,059 --> 02:31:29,559
a part of the conversations for the last

3309
02:31:26,648 --> 02:31:32,228
three years I have definitely learned a

3310
02:31:29,559 --> 02:31:33,908
lot I can't I've come I'm coming out

3311
02:31:32,228 --> 02:31:40,139
this end with a lot more knowledge than

3312
02:31:33,908 --> 02:31:44,469
I went into it for sure everyone else

3313
02:31:40,139 --> 02:31:46,328
and everyone that's panel and although

3314
02:31:44,469 --> 02:31:48,099
all the viewers and all the people that

3315
02:31:46,328 --> 02:31:51,009
input everything from when we started

3316
02:31:48,100 --> 02:31:54,068
learning the static dry sifting when he

3317
02:31:51,009 --> 02:31:56,559
was doing carding and tribal sitting on

3318
02:31:54,068 --> 02:31:57,998
the back of the iTunes card and just how

3319
02:31:56,559 --> 02:31:59,859
everything is kind of there's all these

3320
02:31:57,998 --> 02:32:03,728
little steps and all these little things

3321
02:31:59,859 --> 02:32:05,970
that have happened over the years it's

3322

3325
02:32:12,609 --> 02:32:16,828
the best things that's happened for me

02:32:15,039 --> 02:32:19,418
over the last about three years for sure

3327

02:32:52,209 --> 02:32:56,120
my god is this the last hashtag ever I

3341
02:32:54,338 --> 02:32:58,129
never said that it was I just

3342
02:32:56,120 --> 02:33:00,920
that I might stop doing it but I'm just

3343
02:32:58,129 --> 02:33:03,409
you know if it's hard to try and

3344
02:33:00,920 --> 02:33:06,590
organize and get everyone excited about

3345
02:33:03,409 --> 02:33:08,420
a conversation each week it was you know

3346
02:33:06,590 --> 02:33:10,521
it was there's all there's been all

3347
02:33:08,420 --> 02:33:12,771
these little blows that have occurred

3348
02:33:10,521 --> 02:33:14,450
over the over the years and and hashed

3349
02:33:12,771 --> 02:33:16,040
Church doesn't get quite the views that

3350
02:33:14,450 --> 02:33:17,930
he used to get it's it's probably

3351
02:33:16,040 --> 02:33:19,940
getting half the amount of views that it

3352
02:33:17,930 --> 02:33:21,310
used to get so you know these were all

3353
02:33:19,940 --> 02:33:24,440
things that I took into consideration

3354
02:33:21,310 --> 02:33:26,360
and obviously we're not just doing it

3355
02:33:24,440 --> 02:33:29,030
for views but I like the idea of knowing

3356
02:33:26,360 --> 02:33:31,940
that like thousands tens of thousands of

3357
02:33:29,030 --> 02:33:36,920
people were seeing an episode and you

3358
02:33:31,940 --> 02:33:40,730
know now we might get five six thousand

3359
02:33:36,920 --> 02:33:44,120
reasons over the course of a couple of

3360
02:33:40,729 --> 02:33:46,579
weeks see what we'll see what happens I

3361
02:33:44,120 --> 02:33:48,410
haven't by any means it's a good idea

3362
02:33:46,579 --> 02:33:50,780
that Tony had so if we don't come back

3363
02:33:48,409 --> 02:33:52,399
we did a wrap-up episode we went through

3364
02:33:50,780 --> 02:33:55,090
some of the history and some of the

3365
02:33:52,399 --> 02:33:59,029
important intersections that we had and

3366
02:33:55,090 --> 02:34:01,610
that's a bit look this serves a lot of

3367
02:33:59,030 --> 02:34:04,130
different purposes there's a girl who

3368
02:34:01,610 --> 02:34:07,370
doesn't a channel called digging Brit

3369
02:34:04,129 --> 02:34:09,529
which she's got a super voluptuous body

3370
02:34:07,370 --> 02:34:11,090
and she barely wears anything she goes

3371
02:34:09,530 --> 02:34:13,601
around with a metal detector in this

3372
02:34:11,090 --> 02:34:19,219
book and she gets a million hits a week

3373
02:34:13,601 --> 02:34:23,120
but those great million people who hit

3374
02:34:19,219 --> 02:34:25,819
on that show are there for one reason to

3375
02:34:23,120 --> 02:34:29,450
see digging Brit bending over and

3376
02:34:25,819 --> 02:34:31,670
digging with the spoon here at five or

3377
02:34:29,450 --> 02:34:34,340
six thousand people just hit are people

3378
02:34:31,670 --> 02:34:37,250
that figure to him to our society and

3379
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:39,409
culture in a big way we're not just

3380
02:34:37,250 --> 02:34:40,489
getting people here who are goggling in

3381
02:34:39,409 --> 02:34:43,969
her DNA

3382
02:34:40,489 --> 02:34:45,771
you know so I would say if 5,000

3383
02:34:43,969 --> 02:34:47,899
builders are a lot more important in

3384
02:34:45,771 --> 02:34:49,700
this particular case than a million

3385
02:34:47,899 --> 02:34:52,909
vehicles who are there just watching

3386
02:34:49,700 --> 02:34:57,140
somebody's body I mean overall influence

3387
02:34:52,909 --> 02:34:58,969
influence to spread no I'm not gonna

3388
02:34:57,139 --> 02:35:00,799
take the old churches down someone's

3389
02:34:58,969 --> 02:35:03,170
like oh don't take the videos down no

3390
02:35:00,799 --> 02:35:05,000
the videos are up there there to stay

3391
02:35:03,170 --> 02:35:05,898
you know if YouTube ever decided to take

3392
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,819
them down

3393
02:35:05,898 --> 02:35:10,010
I'd put them up on the bubble man brand

3394
02:35:07,819 --> 02:35:11,449
calm website and people could go watch

3395
02:35:10,010 --> 02:35:14,180
them over there like they're there

3396
02:35:11,450 --> 02:35:16,430
they're secured they're good to go that

3397
02:35:14,180 --> 02:35:19,370
the past will never be lost in that

3398
02:35:16,430 --> 02:35:21,020
sense and the future is the future we'll

3399
02:35:19,370 --> 02:35:23,570
see what happens next Sunday we'll see

3400
02:35:21,020 --> 02:35:25,159
if people maybe new ideas and want to

3401
02:35:23,569 --> 02:35:28,069
talk about things you know otherwise

3402
02:35:25,159 --> 02:35:32,000
it's just I have an idea what if you

3403
02:35:28,069 --> 02:35:35,569
like go through and have some crazy dude

3404
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:37,939
edit like edit like go back and like

3405
02:35:35,569 --> 02:35:40,609
edit like a series and take out like all

3406
02:35:37,939 --> 02:35:41,930
of key important conversations and

3407
02:35:40,609 --> 02:35:44,180
discussions and check and do a

3408
02:35:41,930 --> 02:35:45,889
basketball game yeah exactly like the

3409
02:35:44,180 --> 02:35:52,010
whole basketball game in five minutes

3410
02:35:45,889 --> 02:35:53,510
this week came out swinging hard they

3411
02:35:52,010 --> 02:35:56,090
were puffing Terps awesome

3412
02:35:53,510 --> 02:35:58,159
nine minutes into the episode they just

3413
02:35:56,090 --> 02:36:00,978
yeah yeah it's like nine minutes nine

3414
02:35:58,159 --> 02:36:03,109
minutes and 32 wade goes off on you know

3415
02:36:00,978 --> 02:36:05,148
blah blah blah like pull all these key

3416
02:36:03,109 --> 02:36:06,470
moments and I mean because it's a lot of

3417
02:36:05,148 --> 02:36:09,500
footage it's like anything else this

3418
02:36:06,469 --> 02:36:11,599
challenge live and then like if you film

3419
02:36:09,500 --> 02:36:13,790
anything in life live you edit you know

3420
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:15,170
you get like you edit it down so maybe

3421
02:36:13,790 --> 02:36:17,359
somebody out there wants to start

3422
02:36:15,170 --> 02:36:19,430
editing the hash collection so you could

3423
02:36:17,359 --> 02:36:22,130
keep it you know I mean you know to edit

3424
02:36:19,430 --> 02:36:25,520
it all out yeah what's he did would you

3425
02:36:22,129 --> 02:36:28,398
suggest since we have such a plethora of

3426
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:30,649
crazy goods available to us it's gonna

3427
02:36:28,398 --> 02:36:34,129
take years so that way what can happen

3428
02:36:30,648 --> 02:36:36,648
is it's the the legacy edit edit

3429
02:36:34,129 --> 02:36:38,420
versions somebody would have to work on

3430
02:36:36,648 --> 02:36:40,039
that for years I'm surprised nobody's

3431
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:41,389
doing it already like this I got YouTube

3432
02:36:40,040 --> 02:36:42,830
so people are definitely downloading

3433
02:36:41,389 --> 02:36:44,569
them and stuff like that you know what

3434
02:36:42,829 --> 02:36:46,879
people would really notice is if this

3435
02:36:44,569 --> 02:36:49,010
conversation stopped they would notice

3436
02:36:46,879 --> 02:36:51,049
like Oh weird like where do you go to

3437
02:36:49,010 --> 02:36:54,260
find this [ __ ] out now like where do you

3438
02:36:51,049 --> 02:36:56,239
go to like kind of have this cutting

3439
02:36:54,260 --> 02:36:58,100
edge like what because trust me it's not

3440
02:36:56,239 --> 02:36:59,898
like the scenes gonna stop all this

3441
02:36:58,100 --> 02:37:02,120
stuff's still gonna keep happening it's

3442
02:36:59,898 --> 02:37:04,069
just been really neat that it's been

3443
02:37:02,120 --> 02:37:06,770
happening in this little circle of

3444
02:37:04,069 --> 02:37:08,659
people that have been really pushing and

3445
02:37:06,770 --> 02:37:10,390
promoting and pushing the envelope on a

3446
02:37:08,659 --> 02:37:13,789
lot of these different conversations

3447
02:37:10,389 --> 02:37:15,709
from soil grown with with rosin from you

3448
02:37:13,790 --> 02:37:18,350
know Tony and Horacio with the terpenes

3449
02:37:15,709 --> 02:37:19,219
and you know with all of us with all of

3450
02:37:18,350 --> 02:37:22,189
our different

3451
02:37:19,219 --> 02:37:23,738
areas of expertise it's been interesting

3452
02:37:22,189 --> 02:37:26,300
to say the least

3453
02:37:23,738 --> 02:37:30,079
well there'd be a lot less people making

3454
02:37:26,299 --> 02:37:31,849
good bubble hash listen there I've been

3455
02:37:30,079 --> 02:37:34,700
getting really good bubble heads from

3456
02:37:31,850 --> 02:37:38,120
Eureka for sixty to eighty dollars an

3457
02:37:34,700 --> 02:37:40,399
ounce really light beautiful really

3458
02:37:38,120 --> 02:37:43,880
crazy stuff and then I pressed it in my

3459
02:37:40,398 --> 02:37:47,659
dark ex a little tiny press to make

3460
02:37:43,879 --> 02:37:50,000
fresh frozen with it right and some of

3461
02:37:47,659 --> 02:37:51,829
the most beautiful boy some of it's like

3462
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:53,898
it's almost like a sponge you pick it up

3463
02:37:51,829 --> 02:37:57,529
the whole thing just soft wants to start

3464
02:37:53,898 --> 02:38:00,349
melting and melts in your bubbles not in

3465
02:37:57,529 --> 02:38:03,770
your hands yeah well melts in your mind

3466
02:38:00,350 --> 02:38:05,300

3471
02:38:13,478 --> 02:38:17,719

3474
02:38:20,719 --> 02:38:24,799

3499
02:39:40,158 --> 02:39:48,978
I've got two titanium cages in my back

3500
02:39:43,988 --> 02:39:51,109
being wounded in Vietnam and sometimes

3501
02:39:48,978 --> 02:39:53,358
they cost me a tremendous amount of pain

3502
02:39:51,109 --> 02:39:55,520
and limited my mobility and I've been

3503
02:39:53,359 --> 02:39:58,279
taking about an eighth of a teaspoon in

3504
02:39:55,520 --> 02:40:01,338
the morning and one at night of this CBD

3505
02:39:58,279 --> 02:40:04,399

3506
02:40:01,338 --> 02:40:07,998

particular CBD for the past month and a

3510
02:40:12,559 --> 02:40:18,680
half and it has it I can't describe it

3511
02:40:17,088 --> 02:40:23,119
but it's a tremendous feeling of

3512
02:40:18,680 --> 02:40:25,338
well-being that I get within just 10 or

3513
02:40:23,119 --> 02:40:27,199
15 minutes of I just get my plastic

3514
02:40:25,338 --> 02:40:29,600
split in it and I get an eighth of a

3515
02:40:27,199 --> 02:40:31,789
teaspoon out put it in my mouth on my

3516
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:35,748
tongue and swallow it and 15 minutes

3517
02:40:31,789 --> 02:40:37,760
later I feel I feel like I want to go do

3518
02:40:35,748 --> 02:40:39,350
something like I I'm not thinking well

3519
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:42,020
gee if I go out am I gonna run out of

3520
02:40:39,350 --> 02:40:44,059
energy or am I gonna be have to sit

3521
02:40:42,020 --> 02:40:46,158
somewhere and rest and recover from my

3522
02:40:44,059 --> 02:40:49,180
back I just go and do it

3523
02:40:46,158 --> 02:40:53,148
and I think this CBD oil for some reason

3524
02:40:49,180 --> 02:40:55,488
it's very potent and that's why I really

3525
02:40:53,148 --> 02:40:59,118
want to get it to forest you know I if

3526
02:40:55,488 --> 02:41:02,510
it can help me not feel the pain that I

3527
02:40:59,119 --> 02:41:06,199
live with daily I'm more you know I

3528
02:41:02,510 --> 02:41:09,228
think it must be good for those kids so

3529
02:41:06,199 --> 02:41:11,658
anyway I get it really cheap by the kilo

3530
02:41:09,228 --> 02:41:14,988
I winterize it and I got a pint of it

3531
02:41:11,658 --> 02:41:20,628
for you and that's just Thank You India

3532
02:41:14,988 --> 02:41:23,448
because it does the job and they pulled

3533
02:41:20,629 --> 02:41:26,510
bless many people's lives yeah we'll use

3534
02:41:23,449 --> 02:41:29,239
it for sure well I hope I don't last you

3535
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:32,779
for a while I'll get some more about

3536
02:41:29,238 --> 02:41:36,168
winterizing it it's a 90 percent of it

3537
02:41:32,779 --> 02:41:37,459
is is plant fat and stuff so you get it

3538
02:41:36,168 --> 02:41:37,879
to pretend you love it

3539
02:41:37,459 --> 02:41:41,300
it's

3540
02:41:37,879 --> 02:41:44,449
a lot of muck to handle to get down to

3541
02:41:41,299 --> 02:41:46,159
the ten point eight percent pure CBD but

3542
02:41:44,450 --> 02:41:49,790
I don't mind doing it for those kids

3543
02:41:46,159 --> 02:41:52,459
I mean I'll wait to a mile amok to helps

3544
02:41:49,790 --> 02:41:53,990
them feel better I understand the

3545
02:41:52,459 --> 02:41:55,639
feeling and I'm glad you're getting

3546
02:41:53,989 --> 02:41:59,689
benefit from it that's kind of the way I

3547
02:41:55,639 --> 02:42:02,119
experienced dosing with CBD is it's it's

3548
02:41:59,689 --> 02:42:07,309
not really about a buzz so much as just

3549
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:09,850
a sense of well-being yeah yeah I can't

3550
02:42:07,309 --> 02:42:12,889
believe the difference it makes in my

3551
02:42:09,850 --> 02:42:14,659
everything it makes my attitude makes

3552
02:42:12,889 --> 02:42:16,398
how I feel how I'm dealing with other

3553
02:42:14,659 --> 02:42:19,909
people if you're in pain Oh with them

3554
02:42:16,398 --> 02:42:23,840
you're always biting that back and I

3555
02:42:19,909 --> 02:42:25,879
believe me I was in pain since 1968 when

3556
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:28,489
I got wounded you know I've been in pain

3557
02:42:25,879 --> 02:42:29,839
ever since then until now maybe that's

3558
02:42:28,489 --> 02:42:31,789
one of the things that's kept me alive

3559
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:41,270
because I've never been comfortable

3560
02:42:31,790 --> 02:42:44,030
enough to die but this CBD oil has

3561
02:42:41,270 --> 02:42:47,750
brought me great comfort and solace I

3562
02:42:44,030 --> 02:42:52,010
I couldn't believe in the beginning I

3563
02:42:47,750 --> 02:42:53,629
was a bit you know like everybody was

3564
02:42:52,010 --> 02:42:57,170
like I was like well I haven't seen any

3565
02:42:53,629 --> 02:42:59,389
evidence of that yet but this the first

3566
02:42:57,170 --> 02:43:03,559
time I got a hold of any and computer in

3567
02:42:59,389 --> 02:43:06,709
a pure quality other than some that the

3568
02:43:03,559 --> 02:43:09,559
guys give me from guild extracts all the

3569
02:43:06,709 --> 02:43:12,199
time when I go by their booth and that

3570
02:43:09,559 --> 02:43:15,019
gave me a relief too but this stuff this

3571
02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:18,320
oil of quarter teaspoon of it and then

3572
02:43:15,020 --> 02:43:18,950
an hour later you feel like Mother

3573
02:43:18,319 --> 02:43:20,869
Teresa

3574
02:43:18,950 --> 02:43:23,840
on a good day you're just dispensing

3575
02:43:20,870 --> 02:43:26,899
love you feel so much better like he

3576
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:29,569
said it's not a it's not a high it's a

3577
02:43:26,898 --> 02:43:32,090
it's a high of state of mind because

3578
02:43:29,569 --> 02:43:34,549
you're endocannabinoid system is beaming

3579
02:43:32,090 --> 02:43:35,870
energy back to your brain because that's

3580
02:43:34,549 --> 02:43:44,209
what it's all connected to them it's

3581
02:43:35,870 --> 02:43:47,930
saying hey guess what we got stash yeah

3582
02:43:44,209 --> 02:43:51,259
I I think of tell you a funny little

3583
02:43:47,930 --> 02:43:53,720
thing about it I think of see

3584
02:43:51,260 --> 02:43:57,250
most most cultures have some sort of

3585
02:43:53,719 --> 02:43:59,539
psychoactive substance that they consume

3586
02:43:57,250 --> 02:44:01,340
sometimes it's alcohol sometimes it's

3587
02:43:59,540 --> 02:44:02,870
tobacco sometimes it's mushrooms

3588
02:44:01,340 --> 02:44:04,939
sometimes it's cactus

3589
02:44:02,870 --> 02:44:08,029
sometimes it's vines sometimes it's

3590
02:44:04,939 --> 02:44:09,859
roots but pretty much every culture has

3591
02:44:08,029 --> 02:44:12,770
some sort of psychoactive thing they get

3592
02:44:09,859 --> 02:44:14,210
up to and one of the things that's

3593
02:44:12,770 --> 02:44:17,229
interesting is that virtually all of

3594
02:44:14,209 --> 02:44:23,059
those cultures have shamans or guides

3595
02:44:17,228 --> 02:44:25,760
who take the initiative psychoactivity

3596
02:44:23,059 --> 02:44:27,559
and I think cannabis is one of the

3597
02:44:25,760 --> 02:44:30,978
plants that we use for its psycho

3598
02:44:27,559 --> 02:44:33,559
activity but part of what happened over

3599
02:44:30,978 --> 02:44:38,358
the years is that by breeding just for

3600
02:44:33,559 --> 02:44:42,318
psycho activity we bred out CBD and CBD

3601
02:44:38,359 --> 02:44:44,090
was kind of a built-in shaman that was

3602
02:44:42,318 --> 02:44:47,590
supposed to come along for the ride I

3603
02:44:44,090 --> 02:44:51,670
think back when I first smoked cannabis

3604
02:44:47,590 --> 02:44:57,130
it had CBD in it it was Jamaican

3605
02:44:51,670 --> 02:45:00,260
Jamaican yarders has CBD in it I know

3606
02:44:57,129 --> 02:45:04,099
DJs short was pretty convinced part of

3607
02:45:00,260 --> 02:45:07,100
what he was looking for in cannabis was

3608
02:45:04,100 --> 02:45:10,130
to replicate some Mexican cannabis that

3609
02:45:07,100 --> 02:45:12,880
he had had back in the 60s down and when

3610
02:45:10,129 --> 02:45:15,438
he was at the University down there and

3611
02:45:12,879 --> 02:45:21,039
he was pretty convinced that yeah it was

3612
02:45:15,439 --> 02:45:23,420
like equal amounts CBD and THC and so I

3613
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:26,479
don't know that it's an essential part

3614
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:30,859
of what cannabis can do for humans but I

3615
02:45:26,478 --> 02:45:34,010
think it's an important part and I what

3616
02:45:30,859 --> 02:45:38,170
I what I think is coming because of

3617
02:45:34,010 --> 02:45:40,279
comments like what you just made is that

3618
02:45:38,170 --> 02:45:43,809
increasingly people will start

3619
02:45:40,279 --> 02:45:47,300
recognizing cannabis not just for its

3620
02:45:43,809 --> 02:45:49,699
inspirational or recreational or even

3621
02:45:47,299 --> 02:45:52,068
medicinal but just for the sense of

3622
02:45:49,700 --> 02:45:55,659
well-being that can come from it what

3623
02:45:52,068 --> 02:45:55,659
you were saying earlier Marcus about

3624
02:45:56,049 --> 02:46:01,759
feel when you feel good it's hard it's

3625
02:45:58,700 --> 02:46:03,890
hard to feel bad when you feel good when

3626
02:46:01,760 --> 02:46:04,761
when the pain stops you don't feel like

3627
02:46:03,889 --> 02:46:08,560
biting back

3628
02:46:04,761 --> 02:46:10,851
at things that happen in your life pain

3629
02:46:08,560 --> 02:46:13,579
especially chronic pain that just goes

3630
02:46:10,851 --> 02:46:15,711
on and on and on never stops it's hard

3631
02:46:13,579 --> 02:46:19,610
you can't get away from it

3632
02:46:15,710 --> 02:46:22,789
so blessings thank you but they'll be

3633
02:46:19,610 --> 02:46:24,860
Turner de Durant CBE is definitely a bus

3634
02:46:22,790 --> 02:46:26,450
ticket away from pain there's no

3635
02:46:24,860 --> 02:46:30,101
question about that and by the way

3636
02:46:26,450 --> 02:46:33,471
Marcus we're taking it up this morning I

3637
02:46:30,101 --> 02:46:36,200
recently because of viewers listening to

3638
02:46:33,470 --> 02:46:40,460
have searched they sent me a giant box

3639
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:42,471
of roots yes we took all those roots

3640
02:46:40,460 --> 02:46:44,840
ground them up and we threw them in the

3641
02:46:42,470 --> 02:46:47,630
chamber and extracted them so we're

3642
02:46:44,841 --> 02:46:50,899
gonna have the great first marijuana

3643
02:46:47,630 --> 02:46:56,750
root oil and I want to make sure that

3644
02:46:50,899 --> 02:47:01,069
dr. Natasha it's a bit of it examine

3645
02:46:56,750 --> 02:47:03,921
and/or look at and if anybody wants to

3646
02:47:01,069 --> 02:47:07,039
do any research with it I want to make

3647
02:47:03,921 --> 02:47:09,591
all amounts of it available to people

3648
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:11,900
because I don't think there's anybody

3649
02:47:09,591 --> 02:47:14,079
that's done a full-on wound extract and

3650
02:47:11,899 --> 02:47:19,159
to make sure that we got it we left it

3651
02:47:14,079 --> 02:47:22,989
in the chamber like 24 hours to make

3652
02:47:19,159 --> 02:47:25,489
sure we got every single possible

3653
02:47:22,989 --> 02:47:27,591
volatile out of the roots and it was

3654
02:47:25,489 --> 02:47:31,940
quite a bundle of hurts let me tell you

3655
02:47:27,591 --> 02:47:38,899
you know it came in a two two and a foot

3656
02:47:31,940 --> 02:47:40,909
square box and I think well Natasha was

3657
02:47:38,899 --> 02:47:43,699
talking about allying up all the old

3658
02:47:40,909 --> 02:47:47,960
books it talks about the many uses for

3659
02:47:43,700 --> 02:47:52,221
marijuana roots all the different kinds

3660
02:47:47,960 --> 02:47:54,590
of medicines and focuses and whatever

3661
02:47:52,220 --> 02:47:57,560
that they made with it back when before

3662
02:47:54,591 --> 02:48:00,890
people have opinion about the east part

3663
02:47:57,560 --> 02:48:02,960
of it so I was talking about that a few

3664
02:48:00,890 --> 02:48:05,511
pens and somebody contacted me and asked

3665
02:48:02,960 --> 02:48:09,170
me if I wanted some and I said yes so

3666
02:48:05,511 --> 02:48:12,761
here they are and now I'm I suspect

3667
02:48:09,171 --> 02:48:12,761
it'll be high in Troy terpenoids

3668
02:48:13,720 --> 02:48:18,379
Sam I don't know I don't think I can

3669
02:48:16,460 --> 02:48:21,260
send it to you right send yourself

3670
02:48:18,379 --> 02:48:27,369
maybe if there's nope he's saying it if

3671
02:48:21,260 --> 02:48:31,159
you were even interested anyway

3672
02:48:27,370 --> 02:48:33,950
deal is last show I guess are sort of

3673
02:48:31,159 --> 02:48:36,680
the last show funny place to come up

3674
02:48:33,950 --> 02:48:38,510
with brand new information but you never

3675
02:48:36,680 --> 02:48:42,200
know you never know

3676
02:48:38,510 --> 02:48:44,840
could be it'll be interesting seeing

3677
02:48:42,200 --> 02:48:49,460
what's in it a good a lot of speculation

3678
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:52,270
about it so I did it find out I remember

3679
02:48:49,459 --> 02:48:56,719
years ago probably as early as like 99

3680
02:48:52,270 --> 02:49:00,260
2000 I made bubble hash from stems just

3681
02:48:56,719 --> 02:49:02,510
all the stems not stems cut from pods

3682
02:49:00,260 --> 02:49:04,610
either but like whole plant stems like

3683
02:49:02,510 --> 02:49:07,700
long branches I just cut them all up

3684
02:49:04,610 --> 02:49:09,739
into little quarter inch sections and I

3685
02:49:07,700 --> 02:49:13,579
ran the whole batch and I got this like

3686
02:49:09,739 --> 02:49:15,469
white bubble it was the lightest [ __ ]

3687
02:49:13,579 --> 02:49:19,489
color bubble ever that came off the

3688
02:49:15,469 --> 02:49:21,409
stems and it was pretty good it was

3689
02:49:19,489 --> 02:49:25,010
melty it was powerful

3690
02:49:21,409 --> 02:49:26,559
it had taste it was it was it was hard

3691
02:49:25,010 --> 02:49:29,180
to wrap my head around that there was

3692
02:49:26,559 --> 02:49:30,769
resin on stalks that could be that's

3693
02:49:29,180 --> 02:49:33,130
when I actually not too long after

3694
02:49:30,770 --> 02:49:35,510
probably within 5 years or so I started

3695
02:49:33,129 --> 02:49:37,339
trying to photograph stems and get

3696
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:38,898
closer to see what kind of a trichome

3697
02:49:37,340 --> 02:49:40,969
content they had on there and I've seen

3698
02:49:38,898 --> 02:49:44,269
them covered and I've seen them sparse

3699
02:49:40,969 --> 02:49:46,969
both both ways dude when you showed me

3700
02:49:44,270 --> 02:49:49,010
the picture of one the scene when when

3701
02:49:46,969 --> 02:49:50,629
we said that when the leaf just came out

3702
02:49:49,010 --> 02:49:52,670
of the seat and had a tripod I was just

3703
02:49:50,629 --> 02:49:54,409
amazed that was one of those pictures

3704
02:49:52,670 --> 02:49:56,780
that you showed I was right there but

3705
02:49:54,409 --> 02:49:58,879
that picture that was definitely what

3706
02:49:56,780 --> 02:50:00,590
most people did not know that the glands

3707
02:49:58,879 --> 02:50:02,359
are on the plants from the beginning

3708
02:50:00,590 --> 02:50:05,120
because they're all like oh I just I

3709
02:50:02,360 --> 02:50:07,550
only spray in veg and it's like really

3710
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:09,530
cuz it's like you're still spraying

3711
02:50:07,549 --> 02:50:11,688
trichomes you understand that right

3712
02:50:09,530 --> 02:50:13,489
while those trichomes won't even they're

3713
02:50:11,689 --> 02:50:15,700
gonna fall off those leaves will long

3714
02:50:13,489 --> 02:50:20,090
have fallen off it's like alright well

3715
02:50:15,700 --> 02:50:21,800
whatever you say well that's why the in

3716
02:50:20,090 --> 02:50:24,350
the center of your bud right because

3717
02:50:21,799 --> 02:50:26,449
they fall off my guys it's like of

3718
02:50:24,350 --> 02:50:29,880

3719
02:50:26,450 --> 02:50:32,159
though man I'm really really cool to see

3720
02:50:29,879 --> 02:50:34,019
