that was Jack Frost Turing with

147
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:01,158
some is Barbara from Nashville

148
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,399
Tennesseee from 70s m

149
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:04,399
i t it up with the Jack

150
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,439
Frost Jack

151
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,318
FR it's just

152
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:26,158
straight try it again it's just keep it

153
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,158
keeps tasting good all the way through

154
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,000
the

155
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,039
Turin they they are the flavor and they

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,080
are the taste but what we're learning is

157
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:42,038
is that they modulate the effects of

158
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,839
canids meaning that when you extract

159
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:48,799
canabo in pure form like THC C CBN and

160
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,959
cpg you take them they're boring and

161
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,479
onedimensional and when you add just a

162
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,399
single turine to it it uplifts and

163
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,759
creates different highs produces

164
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,839
appetite and some it stimulates uh the

165
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:04,919
release of ocular pressure others it can

166
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:08,560
reduce Tremors Ms patients it can uh

167
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:11,439
induce sleep for insomnia so it does all

168
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,399
of these different things it does it by

169
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,320
imagine there like

170
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:20,000
doz plus it canile how much complexities

171
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,040
are happening in that and we learn that

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,440
just the Simplicity of taking pure can

173
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:27,360
avonoid and adding one tur changes it

174
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,320
multi-dimensionally what if we added 11

175
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,600
Tes and three other conoids specifically

176
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,079
ratio and when we learn how it affects

177
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,480
the brain the CB1 receptors and the CB2

178
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:41,078
in the peral organs we'll be able to

179
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,959
hone in on specific ails for specific

180
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:47,599
profiles and I'm sure one

181
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:49,359
day life hack so imagine this is a box

182
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,639
and these little turpine vials upside

183
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,320
down fit into the box and you can fit

184
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,799
like maybe 16 or 20 of these in here and

185
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,720
maybe on the other half of the Box you

186
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:02,039
have another 15 to 20 different canab

187
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,160
specific ratios imagine if they were

188
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:07,838
able to be pulled out in just specific

189
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:10,759
amounts to create profiles by dialing it

190
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,519
in and then vaporizing through your p

191
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,919
and that to me is like a potential

192
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:18,078
future where you could do the breeding

193
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:20,000
and you could do all the STS that will

194
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:24,039
exist as well love the idea of being

195
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,039
able to produce our own

196
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:30,919
profiles specific exactly exactly all

197
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:34,839
the all these other things present in

198
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,838

able to turn Bud into dabs so bud is

235

and blue which definitely doesn't get

237

you high and definitely Alters the

238
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,240
effect of the high you're get it's not a

239
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,078
good way to get medicine and so the dab

240
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,759
for making that pure product that is so

241
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,919
pure that if you light it it melts into

242
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:56,240
a liquid that just becomes what you know

243

474
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,120

move my

503
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:35,319
eyeball all right so here we go I'm

504
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:37,000
folding up the hash in the screen I

505
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:38,599
would put way more hash in the screen

506
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,319
but it shows that you could use one this

507
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:45,798
small as long as you sort of fold it up

508
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,798
get it nicely folded up this is

509
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:54,319
32 s sour what's going on dude just

510
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:56,960
chill with he was uh gave you props wish

511
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:58,398
you were here man what are you doing be

512
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,159
here

513
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,518
all right so that should be small enough

514
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,080
for Tony to press out some dabs I

515
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:05,880
suspect cuz it's finger rub and the

516
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,720
heads have all been breached they've

517
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,039
been oxidized by the lights the oxygen

518
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,880
they they've gotten very dark so we'll

519
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:16,720
most likely see a very dark oil come out

520
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,960
of this but uh I'm excited to see the

521
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,319
local rub Which Jamaican I don't produce

522
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,240
o Jamaican hash always has been like

523
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:25,038
when it's the real deal not like cut

524
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,359
with bread fruit Beach Hustler type

525
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:30,679
dudes but real actual from the farm from

526
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:32,158
the scissors or the knife or even back

527
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:33,559
in the day I remember in the '90s you

528
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,799
could get some pretty good stuff off of

529
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:39,079
the sledgehammers they were using to

530
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:41,398
pound herb into like like tire wheel

531
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:42,638
wells they would squeeze these little

532
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:45,479
they'd hammer it down into little

533
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:47,839
pockets and smuggle it off the island so

534
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,240
good on you Jamaica for for keeping

535
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:53,000
people in all those years all right so

536
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,000
let's get this in the

537
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:56,548
[Music]

538
00:32:56,638 --> 00:32:59,839
parchment right

539
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,519
the I'll hold the table so we can take

540
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,798
the

541
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:10,240
pressure good so we're using heat and

542
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:11,720
pressure to mkk the hash of the oil so

543
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,839
if you have a hash that is not a

544
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,240
dabbable product a hash that's not as

545
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,599
strong as you might not you might like

546
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,200
maybe you have a certain pain that

547
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,319
really involves using a more

548
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:26,038
concentrated form this is how you do it

549
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:29,038
and you get boom oil this is ital oil no

550
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:31,599
alcohol used no solvent used all we used

551
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:34,798
was heat and Tony will clean it up in a

552
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:39,558
second when it cools off might have to

553
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:43,079
uh I usually use like a little uh uh a

554
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:44,918
square piece of stone like marble and uh

555
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:46,918
I cool it in my fridge and freezer and

556
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:49,519
when I pull it out and you put this on

557
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,720
top of it the rosin cools right away and

558
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,159
it shatters and comes off quite nicely

559
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,159
so that's kind of cool almost a reddish

560
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,159
color

561
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,879
a little bit how's the

562
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:04,200
[Music]

563
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,519
tackiness sometimes it's very tacky and

564
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,960
very hard to get off if you've

565
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,320
overheated it this is just warm it will

566
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:14,760
often come off uh very slow this is just

567
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,760
warm we'll be

568
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:19,949

a second abely he's got a sweet

611
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,000
spot with these is like the Diamond

612
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,880
Brand he got the

613
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,559
little

614
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,640
the got keep it like this yeah you can

615
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,440
do whatever you want all right so just I

616
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,199
like to go right across right there

617
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,318
right in the middle of the plate that's

618
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:20,318
where it's the hottest exactly that's

619
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:22,480
where you're going to the most

620
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:25,480
consistent yeah that's where I place the

621
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,318
ash so if you but if you go if you put

622
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,079
the laser like down through here look

623
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:32,400
one 160 180 170 that's where the heat

624
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:37,000
started and I think the heat will

625
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,000
actually interfere with the you know the

626
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:49,239
[Music]

627
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:52,920
microwave I think we can do it again

628
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:52,919
it be won be

629
00:37:54,559 --> 00:38:01,400

Turpin and the bubble has so big respect

744
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,000
to him obviously Peter Tosh was the

745
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:51,559
militant man he was the uh the powerful

746
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,599
voice of anti-prohibition and Peter Tosh

747
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:55,800
got his head smacked open more times

748
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,280
than you can count and he was harassed

749
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,039
and he was uh you know press so it's one

750
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,000
of the things that if you listen to Bob

752
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,838
Whalers make sure you pull Peter Tosh

753
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,480
out of there and get as many albums as

754
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:08,920

763
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,559
long time pass on the next time 20

764
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,400
seconds of pure hitting this hit we get

765
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:37,839
three four people especially because

766
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:42,240
we're adding the Turpin so it's not like

767
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,239
uh you'll be feeling like you didn't get

768
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:50,239
enough play with

769
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:53,440
this now bubble man who made these TPS

770
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:55,879
these TPS were made by Tony and so Tony

771
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,880
does the Blue River the turine isolation

through ukan and so and we'll be doing

774
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:05,959

776
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,400
locations you'll be able to get my

hashes then you'll also be able to get

778
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,160

00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,838
the quiver I talk about it all the time

780

probably smoked uh smoked a lot of my

817
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:53,240
time but then one day I realized what a

818
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:56,159
waste it was for me to be between my

819
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:58,879
Purity my specialness and the plant

820
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:03,558
matter you know what I

821
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:06,119
mean you got got watch yeah sh no you

822
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:09,480
keep asking about sh and it's kind of a

823
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:11,599
dirty word so we don't do dirty

824
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,159
play it's true we stay away from the

825
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,318
chemical solvents we're hitting all

826
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:18,159
solventless stuff so we isolate gland

827
00:48:15,318 --> 00:48:20,960
heads to 99% using mechanical dry

828
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:24,039
sifting techniques we use water and ice

829
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,280
processes to isolate glands to 99% we

830
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:30,039
