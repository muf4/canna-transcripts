little bit of bowls out here on the deck

46

60
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,318
stuff man i' got that green crack God I

61
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:34,400
got got the PK 90 first 90 from you guys

62
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,039
I ever got I went and had breakfast with

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,360
Adam the other day and he was like have

64
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,318

you guys had a 90 bag they're coming

66
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,560
dude I love to hear that let's start

67
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,719
with the pk9 for that very

68
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,280
reason yeah we understand that those

69
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:48,878
heads are a little bit more desirable so

70
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,560
I started running them and it's

71
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,239
phenomenal oh wow isn't that beautiful

72
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,479
definely going to have to uh photograph

73
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,000
this but after we hit it cuz uh this is

74
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:59,238
not one of those situations where uh

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,318
where we're not going to be hitting it

76
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,759
first yeah you hit it on the next 90

77
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,679
batch there no problem exactly get it on

78
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:10,519
the next it's actually quite just in the

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,200
middle of greasing up now from uh being

80
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,360
uh beautiful and uh powdery so you want

81
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,639
to start us off Brett I can do that get

82
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,159
that out of your

83
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,039
way

84
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:23,639
yeah nice move with the slide I thought

85
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,000
he was going to pick it up I was really

86
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:29,238
definitely impressed with the slide give

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,280
that a little twist off the top there

88
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,438
boom

89
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,479
you got a hole right

90
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:37,759
here this piece hits really deep and

91
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,158
thick when I dry hit it it was just like

92
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,878
glug glug glug glug glug you don't

93
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:42,798
realize it but the two tubes on either

94
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,158
side are the recycler Chambers where the

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,360
water's filtering through it's pretty

96
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:50,598
damn cool it definitely delivers a

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,640
pretty heavy hit deep deep yeah deep J

98
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,158
yeah it's definitely one of those pieces

99
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,119
that you can feel I haven't even

100
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:59,280
actually hit it ever dry hit it now

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,239
twice a year ago when Stratus brought it

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,280
to the hotel and I photographed it in

103
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,959
Vancouver I have beautiful pictures of

104
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,640
this pipe actually I'll pass your way

105
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,920
cuz uh well cuz you're the keeper of the

106
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:13,399
pipe these days much yeah absolutely you

107
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,519
sticking dirty [ __ ] in there I didn't

108
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,199
all right I didn't on you if you noticed

109
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,560
I scraped it and managed to get it off

110
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,680
without really digging and creating a I

111
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,399
dug a little bit but it's all right oh

112
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,800
yeah the hashm diligence here I'm

113
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,959
learning it's the photography it's

114
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,960
nothing else it's the anal photographer

115
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,839
it makes no sense in any other way that

116
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,599
people out in the world would be like oh

117
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,239
yeah bubble man says you should scrape

118
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,439
no no it's totally only for photos

119
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,319
otherwise I do exactly what Brett just

120
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,038
did so all right here you go I feel kind

121
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:45,279

130

something too when you run a strain

131
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:10,198
through water you're just hoping that it

132
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:12,399

166
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,519
the waterfall comes off of and it's a

167
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,639
lot of big rocks and you get a Mist you

168
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,439
get actually quite a mist from the water

169
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,879
it's really pumping which I suspect it

170
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,879
is uh as we got so much rain and snow

171
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:37,879
all season long have you been up there

172

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,960
you put it in front of the lens right

215
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,360
yeah it's almost seeing what you're

216
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,239
trying to describe in taste and flavor

217
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,639
and in star rating right you know this

218
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,598
for thank

219
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,560
you oh yeah dude it really is a way to

220
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:30,399
unveil there is there's no getting small

221
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,038
dabs of this there's just big DBS that's

222
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,199
what I was trying to tell you that's

223
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,199
okay it just kind of comes out of the

224
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,080
jar because we're sitting in hot weather

225
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,959
just comes out as clumps versus and it

226
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,120
looks nice and and grandular and Sandy

227
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,879
but as soon as you put a Dabber into it

228
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,399
whatever's touching that Dabber comes

229
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:48,838
out with it and whatever's touching that

230
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,559
comes out comes out with it as well

231
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,640
exactly so is that due to uh bursting

232
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:55,439
the triome head like on

233
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,720

Shannon Falls man I got to say me too

260
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,958
I've never been super nature and

261
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,838
beautiful and although I know people are

262
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,559
like oh you're

263
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,120
your deck is beautiful in nature it's

264
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,439
just it's still nice to get out of your

265
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,639
home and into other zones and this

266
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,320
waterfall is definitely one of the most

267
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:16,240
impressive waterfalls oh wow that resin

268
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,800
incredible you guys heavy

269
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,360
right I think the gcg is definitely

270
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,240
heavy in turps and heavy in the in that

271
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,240
head slapper oh yeah no no question

272
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,000
great rip off yeah me too R too big one

273
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,120
bigger than I would normally have taken

274
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,759
because and you took one right before

275
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,639
cuz we mucked it up and had to edit it

276
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,439
out we didn't even have to tell anybody

277
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:37,360
that but I did and I might even edit

278
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,639
that out so you may still not know we'll

279
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,440
see we'll see we let you

280
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,839
know all right are we doing this yeah I

281
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,040
guess we're going to hit this last piece

282
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,959
here we got the torch where we can kind

283
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:56,039
of maybe get this guy more out of the

284
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:59,518
place move this over and uh yeah we got

285
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:01,319
this which is good to keep separately

286
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,078
there is that how you like it see you

287
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,040
had it that's your carb capab right so

288
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,638
have that accessible and then uh oh yeah

289
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,399
we were going to hit uh well this will

290
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,519
be the ultimate test really to Skillet

291
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,839
out the strawberry banana let's do it

292
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,240
and do you want to torch it for me cuz

293
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:17,519
you know the Banger a little bit better

294
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,639
absolutely

295
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,799
absolutely I'm not too good with Banger

296
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:22,919
temps just cuz I'm super on the eail all

297
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,679
you know what I'm I'm going to have to

298
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:27,078
apologize too I usually use the little

299
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,399
tiny baby torch so uh if I we try it my

300
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:33,319
lungs will be the guinea pig all right

301
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,320
right lighter the better

302
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:44,439
usually there you go there we go these

303
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,360
torches that's why we have the D Nails

304
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,360
yeah it's definitely why we have the d

305
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,600
nails and once you get torching outside

306
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,440
in the bright Sun with the wind a little

307
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,639
bit blowing with a little bit of Cool

308
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,320
Wind yeah you just kind of like the cool

309
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,879
down ratees way quicker certainly a

310
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,920
guessing game but it's a fun one to play

311
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,480
when you've got got great resin yeah

312
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:04,479
exactly this looks pretty

313
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:10,879
good I

314
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:13,319
appr dry sift or bubble dry sift nice

315
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,958
that should be plenty hot perfect should

316
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,040
I wait or should I go in i' give it

317
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:23,399
maybe 10 seconds okay 10 seconds it

318
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:24,599
is and this is the curve yes it is all

319
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,600
right and you use that to direct the

320
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,680
flow of your resin on the inside you let

321
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,159
me know when you want me to drop it go

322
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:31,159
ahead

323
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,879
boom perhaps a little warm it's

324
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:43,160
all crazy a little warm but you need you

325
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,159
need warmer for sift and bubble

326
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:55,039
oil so you tell us 10 seconds not enough

327
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:55,039
15 20 I would go 50 you

328
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:01,879
yes beautiful

329
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:03,278
yeah the the uh prototypes are are a

330
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:05,799
little bit cumbersome compared to the

331
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:05,799
more modern

332
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:12,039
tricycler right I think he scaled them

333
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,759
down to around uh 10 in now got to talk

334
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:15,759
pretty loud when you have the torch on

335
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,439
just sorry yeah uh I think Stratosphere

336
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,519
has scaled these pieces down to around

337
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,240
10 in now versus about 13 where it's at

338
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,879
right

339
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,560
now it's definitely a big boy but it's

340
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,159
it chug is nice the 4 second rip I did

341
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:34,759
hit out of it because it was so quick

342
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:37,360
quick um was very nice a tri cycler I'd

343
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:40,039
give it give it like

344
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,519
10 I'll give it 10 you give it give it

345
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:44,919
like 15 then give it 15 why not I I

346
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,240
personally like smoking resin out of

347
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:49,958
lower temp than higher a lot of people

348
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,600
tell me oh if you use a Q-tip it's waste

349
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,439
I'm like I don't know about that waste

350
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,560
to taste yeah I just like taste that's

351
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,800
why I smoke I like the effect too there

352
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:00,799

353
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,759

Falls not too far this is my first time

363
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,160
trying the uh strawberry banana from

364
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,560
concentrated deck I'm really excited

365
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,559
about that it's

366
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:42,638
nice shout out to DNA for the for this

367
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:50,639
flavor giv on the bubble too the double

368
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,159
the double the double bubble and sift

369
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,240
thank you you tell me when you want

370
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:59,759
it at 10 seconds

371
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,320
yeah a good test too find if you put the

372
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,639
resin on top of the Banger you'll see

373
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,480
how the resin reacts that that's a good

374
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,039
way to see how hot it is oh yeah

375
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,720
especially if you've like pressed bubble

376
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,919
already when it's powder it's a little

377
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,079
bit harder cuz it takes longer to melt

378
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:16,240
you ready I'm ready oh it Happ you got

379
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:21,078

384
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,600

385
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:35,318
especially if I'm dealing with a little

386

00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:12,520
Gondola that's

430
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,080

432
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,080
you want recorded just me talking a

433
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,119
little bit all right so we finally uh we

434
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,079
finally got here to Shannon Falls we

435
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:32,599
actually got here twice we got here

436
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,918
we hiked up almost ruined Brett's nice

437
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:37,000
shoes and realized uh I didn't bring

438
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:38,960
this cable that connects the phone to

439
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
the controller which basically connects

440
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,480
the whole thing and so uh I guess the

441
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,038
point of the the thing is is that we're

442
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,480

yeah all right so uh we thought we had

564
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,600
it all set up but unfortunately I forgot

565
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,599
one cable for the denail or the

566
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:30,719
dabinator and uh because of it we're

567
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:33,798
going to go Banger torch torch Banger

568
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,798
style this time around and uh why don't

569
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:38,918
we start with that green crack God 73

570
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,278
let's do it mighty fine idea is that not

571
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:44,120
a good idea you hit some of that

572
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:47,519
beautiful rosin you got there that's

573
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:48,959
good you like start a Markus oh sure if

574
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,399
you want to torch me

575
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,200
out I was thinking of just using the jar

576
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:55,719
for the carb cap on that to be honest

577
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,840
that's perfect

578
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,839
yeah GRE up the hatch a little it carb

579
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:03,240
it perfect yeah it's pretty greasy now

580
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,839
so that's kind of what gave me the idea

581
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,240
the idea of just being like just go for

582
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:09,439
it so that was pretty [ __ ] awesome

583

heating it up to that point where

everything's just clean and baked right

off some people are probably cringing

00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:13,038
that we're not q-tipping it but uh some

nug jar that you now put Q-tips in so

00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,879
it's the he Q-tip jar

659
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:29,599
yeah I definitely don't want to smell or

660
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,200
taste Burn smoke from the end of the

661
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:34,278
head on that g so how you clean that

662
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,440
perfect I'll give it a good 45 seconds

663
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:37,880
yeah I would for sure it's quite an easy

664
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,159
thing to feel with the back of your hand

665
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,960
and even the palm of your hand it's just

666
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,278
too hot is too hot that's how I Accord

667
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,519
the hit we don't want to uh be wasting

668
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,919
all the efforts that the grower the

669
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,480
processor has put in making this

670
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,639
wonderful resin and isolating it for us

671
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,639
by putting it into a PO

672
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,519
taking a sweet time you think the cool

673
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:07,038
air would uh cools down even faster

674
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:10,838
being towards big it is it's thick this

675
