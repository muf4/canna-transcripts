1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,750
hey what's going on everybody bubble man

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:09,509
Here I am at the trial golf resorts

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,629
cruising around this cool little golf

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:14,789
cart and I tried to go live I wanted to

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,920
do a live video but it wasn't letting me

6
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:20,669
and I thought you know what I'm going to

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,720
at least still do an actual video so

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,580
that we can you know have a little fun

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:27,989
show you this cool little area gonna

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,778
have to turn my phone around because of

11
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:33,089
the way I'm doing the video it doesn't

12
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:33,600
allow me to switch my cameras from angle

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,490
to angle

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,140
front to back

15
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:41,210
just in this really cool little

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,210
neighborhood up top called Barnes Hill

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,140
and I'm actually heading down to the

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,770
beach right now and we're gonna go

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:55,439
through a little tunnel go underneath

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:57,510
the main highway should be pretty cool

21
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,030
yeah

22
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:02,218
all right so yeah beautiful places up

23
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,659
here fairly exclusive I suspect this is

24
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,399
a neighborhood of very wealthy people

25
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:10,649
because the homes are definitely the

26
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:12,450
nicest I've ever seen in Jamaica you

27
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:17,539
know there's the driveway to one right

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,710
there really really sweet looking spots

29
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:21,509
some on the beach some up on the hill I

30
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,519
wish it was alive I really do

31
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,590
I really wish this was a live video and

32
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,840
we'd just be showing everything live but

33
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,560
this one's just gonna be a short little

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,560
get uploaded

35
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:06,938
head straight down

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,090
the magic spot

37
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:25,349
and you just like that we're on the

38
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,650
other side of the highway in the beach

39
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,650
side

40
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:36,400
[Music]

41
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,079

[Applause]

43
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:17,350
all right we are parched let's turn that

44
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:20,228
off grab this and continue on the

45
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:23,470
adventure this is basically where the

46
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:26,038
golf club is and the main restaurant I

47
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:29,229
don't even know what it's called but I

48
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:32,228
was here yesterday I can kind of see the

49
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:33,399
walk up is quite beautiful I did some

50
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:35,019
footage of this that you'll end up

51
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:36,459
seeing on the channel later but I like

52
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:37,889
to be able to share a little snippets

53
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:42,698
and clips

54
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:46,050
what better way see how long this video

55
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,050
is in total to get us

56
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:49,710
right just over five minutes and right

57
00:05:45,209 --> 00:06:00,029
