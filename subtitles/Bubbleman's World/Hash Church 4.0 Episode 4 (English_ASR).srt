00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,680
bit um I'm not sure how this came about

38
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,280
I think I think Marcus contacted me and

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,240
then had some ideas and then we all kind

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,799

44
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,920
the idea about the

45
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:58,599
harvesting um for solventless and that's

46
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,840

brother man I met him through rure

67
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:55,119
listen before we get started the idea

68
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:58,280
for this really was inspired by my team

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,759
over at Whistler Technologies uh Daniel

70
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,360
and uh Andrew did a little podcast

71
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:04,639
recently where they did a little just

72
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,879
the two of them talking about harvesting

73
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,279
and preparing for solventless and it

74
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,280
kind of gave me the idea like I was like

75
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,280
man I know a ton of awesome farmers and

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,280
cool hash makers like why don't we kind

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,439
of do that idea that they did but kind

78
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,158
of pump it up a little bit get more

79
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:22,840
people involved more people that are

80
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,878
actively uh farming but also the people

81
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,400
who are actively um making hash and just

82
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:29,959
kind of have a little discussion I mean

83

91
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,479
events like this were a thing of the

92
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,439
past I thought that this was done and we

93
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,759
were just moving into this future where

94
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,959
everyone was upset and getting crushed

95
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:06,359
Red by the uh new world of cannabis this

96
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,680
is old school this was an absolutely

97
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,280
spectacular event made even better by

incredible job chay's Mom owned this

forest surrounding it it was spectacular

119
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,560
uh I really just can't say enough uh

120
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:17,319
about it so um yeah welcome everybody

121
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,600
I'm super stoked to get some dabs in and

122
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,879
uh talk to everyone in regards to really

123
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,840
you know solvent list and prepare

124
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,399
preparation of the material and Flash

125
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,478
freezing and all of these things can be

126
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:29,799
our topics but at the same time I'd love

127
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:31,399
to hear about where you guys are at

128
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,520
where you've been coming from where

129
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:37,799
you're going where you're at currently

130
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:39,639
in this sort of chaotic cannabis uh

131
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,879
experience that we're that we're all

132
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,280
sort of uh I don't want to say trapped

133
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,800
in because I think a lot of us are

134
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:48,478
lifers and it's something that we choose

135
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,520
but it's definitely been um it's been a

136
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,800
challenge to say the least and a lot of

137
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,959
people have uh have been taken out so I

138
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,079
sort of uh I you know I think of them

139
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,000
all the time people that have been

140
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:02,839
involved in this plant for so so long

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,720
that have just been unable to maintain

142
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:08,959
with the with the legality and the taxes

143
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,400
and the sort of getting squeezed uh out

144
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,598
so we can of course discuss that as well

145
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:16,359
and and of course I would very much like

146
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:19,000
to hear uh any and all stories from

147
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,680
skunkman fam I haven't heard his voice

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,478

on the Unicorn cup experience and how

171
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,878
sweet that was I I mean Rose Bud lake is

172
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,759
filled with turtles little painted box

173
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,520
turtles which is like you don't find a

174
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,319
lot of turtles in the lakes around here

175
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,439
in the cies they exist but it's like

176
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,000
amazing and so you have this Lake and

177
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,959
you're camping out and it's sort of like

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,478
just Trails through the trees and stuff

179
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,839
so it definitely has that like OG flavor

180
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,839
to it and stuff look at all the samples

181
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:57,959
and and it's fun to meet up with a bunch

182
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,158
of people you don't see a lot so this BC

183

it's cool to have an event up here the

187
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,120

going back and forth and for other

189

those things change and you know it it'

192
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,279
be sweet but yeah it's only going to

193
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,680
grow and get more powerful so and it's

194
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:27,799
nice to have like the big dance party

195
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,000
kind of aspect to it which they had this

196

hard to get even light depth stuff out

204
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,519

in Brazil so they did w in Brazil and it

234
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,120
was the first main hash event that has

235
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:18,239
ever happened here we did a super hidden

236
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,078
uh it happened yesterday it it was

237
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,159

quality I've seen from their

242
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,240
Brazilians uh multiple hash samples

243
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,920
barely no rosin little little solvents

244
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,759
but everyone was crushing with the hash

245
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,639
and with the temple balls and it was

246
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,200
very very very beautiful to see and to

247
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,560

278
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,439

279
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,559
went uh stealth you said like you guys

280
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,560
didn't have any

281
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:19,039
issues um the biggest issue was that we

282
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:20,799
developed an app to run the the votes

283
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,439
and then because of the internet a lot

284
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,958
of people logged in and the C kept

285
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,920
logging out so it took longer because we

286
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,319
had to do it man manually so till this

287
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:31,000
part was amazing the the end of it was a

288
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,760
little like counting the votes was

289
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,679
stressful but the rest was all good like

290
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,799
it was beautiful they played there was a

291

293
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:45,838
place that it's uh people do iwaska so

294
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:50,120

00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,919
of them and the first one I picked out

330
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:13,879
was yours that's what's

331
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:17,559
up um Al I have a quick question oh

332
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:19,360
Johnny playing ahead his camera's off he

333
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,719
might be he might be busy Ask Alice

334
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,919
question then we'll welcome Johnny

335
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,560
[ __ ] be and it's beautiful to see Sim

336
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,120
but I was going to ask Alis a quick

337
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,958
question with the

338
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,519
iasa family you know often with plant

339
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:35,039
medicine and iasa ceremonies there's a

340
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,120
thing about oh we don't do ganja you

341
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,120
know it's like a tobacco and plant

342
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,000
medicine thing and they're like you know

343
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,720
but then there's different tribes that

344
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,720
you know allow cannabis use and and and

345
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,959
and did you find in this area that there

346
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,440
was obviously an acceptance towards

347
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,799
cannabis and I just wonder what your

348
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,279
thoughts were about that AIT so

349
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:58,039
different churches and different groups

350
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:01,360
they definitely have different practices

351
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:04,240
so definitely some con consecrate

352
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,959
cannabis as a part and it's um it's

353
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,919
Santa Maria that they call it like so

354
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,919
the spirit of the Cannabis is Santa

355
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:19,519
Maria church and it's also a doine so

356
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,199
some people follow it like a religion so

357
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,078
there are rules and things like this

358
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:26,078
here was very open the people from the

359
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:29,318
like the people that have the the

360
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:32,799
property it's a 52 acre uh eological

361
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:35,000
property here and they do reforestation

362
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:38,399
and they they hold some iasa rituals and

363
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,440
some EV um they were very open about it

364
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,078
and um it's not like they do not want

365
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,800
the plan it's just that sometimes it's

366
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:47,359
not part of the ritual for them it

367
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,958
doesn't not belong uh in the in the

368
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,919
ritual like the way that people use it

369
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,719
and what I've seen is a lot of people

370
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:57,679
that do go to the iasa ritual and

371
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,680
realize they have a tough

372
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,360
use as like a tool therapeutical tool

373
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,360
and then it helps you out a lot and some

374
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,560
people also have different intentions

375
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,919
and actually the use that it's not

376
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:13,719
necessarily healthy for them so in

377
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,759
iwaska trips that's something that

378
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,560
sometimes pops up so I heard bunch of

379
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,919
this tobacco use and whatever and they

380
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,399
also consecrate tobacco in the ha form

381
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:25,879
so it's like a powdered tobacco with

382
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,480
other herbs and then they culate that

383
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:29,480
and that's very connected with the roots

384
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,000
and the Earth it's more to

385
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,639
help out bring the people um that are

386
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,879
actually flying on their ritual a little

387
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:42,240

388

through while he sits there if you've

425
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,960
never seen the power of cannabis as a

426
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,279
medicine this guy doesn't take anything

427
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,880
else other than cannabis and his amino

428
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,200
acids and sort of all these sort of

429
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,799

particular last accident that some guy

445
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,558
was I know just driving down a country

446
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,279
road you know just hanging out things

00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,678
you know just kind of doing my audio

449
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,240
books and out of nowhere some guy

450
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,679
thought that um being on his cell phone

451
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,759
while driving put his foot on the gas

452
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,600
and blew a stop sign of about 80k and

453
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,359
hammered me

454
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,519
flipp me three times the back end of the

455
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,079
car hit the telephone pole rolled and

456
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,440
landed in a ditch upside down broke my

457
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,918
ribs towards some this cartilage off my

458
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,558
sternum and four days later I was doing

459
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,159
push-ups I was like and ice like well

460
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,038
that's impossible I know while I already

461
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,000
live in chronic pain I do a lot of bong

462
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,679
rips I smoke hash and I said that

463
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,519
blatantly straight out that's what I use

464
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:57,679
in my pain control and that's about

465
00:19:54,519 --> 00:20:00,639
it and yeah and I just kept going away

466
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,400
movement is how we heal you cannot just

467
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,640
sit there and do nothing about it so I

468
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,038
started walking right away took me four

469
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,840
days off I started walking started doing

470
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,359
my push-ups you know using creams and

471
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:16,000
stuff like that and just being dedicated

472
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:18,759
to oneself getting up at 5:00

473
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,558
a.m. it's got to heal you got to move

474
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,679

garden was just growing so just like in

476
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:29,400
the midst of putting that in and you

477
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,919

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,320
Johnny B got rear side swiped or T-boned

482
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:44,158
and flipped into the ditch he literally

483
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:46,079
went live on his like social media like

484
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,480
five minutes later that's how I found

485
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:52,879
out I saw him upside down in his car on

486
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,159
his social media I'm like oh my God John

487

what now this is also like the third or

488
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:59,480
fourth accident since it's got to be

489
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:02,079
like two or three since just your back

490
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,240

problem 80% of the solution was growing

529
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,640
from that and that's what I did I Grew

530
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,199
From My accidents and I grew by using

531
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,400
cannabis by helping it get me through

532
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,200

Landry Michael green and Amy case King

561
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,839
we're all just uh veterans and we went

562
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:12,720
up on the hill talk the talk walk the

563
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:15,199
walk made a whole bunch of meetings made

564
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,759
a whole bunch of friends uh but uh yeah

565
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,319
we had an agenda on a whole bunch of

566
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:22,480
work but uh tired I just literally

567
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:25,439
walked 12 miles in two days walking

568
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,599
around Capitol Hill so I just got home

569
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,798
yesterday so I'm a little tired and sore

570
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:33,798
but uh need to get back there because we

571
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:37,200
got a lot more work to do still

572
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:39,398
so no doubt it's amazing um from the

573
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,919
Canadian perspective I just have that

574
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:46,759
because I'm here and that's who I am but

575
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:50,278
it just uh it's so strange the um like

576
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:52,519
Valor and that pride in country and flag

577
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:55,278
and the way they send you off with such

578
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:58,960
pride and love and bragging rights

579
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,839
almost like these are good men and women

580
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,399
uh but then you guys come back and

581
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:05,639
things are like shaky and holy [ __ ] I

582
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:07,519
got poisoned by gas and I I [ __ ] did

583
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,799
some things that that my brain can't let

584
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,679
go of and I I would like to be able to

585
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:14,440
use cannabis and I would like and they

586
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,880
just they just [ __ ] they're they're

587
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,320
completely against everything you want

588
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,240
like they don't want to take care of you

589
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,759
guys is this an accurate description of

590
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,159
what's actually going

591
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,359
on yes but actually we're using you

592
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,840
Canadians as an example right now

593
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,639
actually we're trying to one of the main

594
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:34,879
reasons we met is to put uh the Canadian

595
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,120
VHA and American Veteran Health

596
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,600
Administration in the us together

597
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:42,759
because currently your system thank you

598
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:45,000
to Aaron Victory and other uh Canadian

599
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:47,480
Veterans for educating on what's

600
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,200
Happening Canadian veterans can actually

601
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,599
go on their National Canada app right

602
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,120
now if you are at 100% disability rating

603
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:59,398
such as you you're given 100% disability

604
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:02,839
rating by your VA the Canadian VA gives

605
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:05,038
you up to three Gams per day free of

606
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:08,119
charge depending on whatever your

607
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:11,599
modality so if I want pill I want a

608
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:14,158
joint I want an a lollipop I want a

609
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:18,119
sublingual I want a patch as long as it

610
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:20,240
equals up to three grams in the end the

611
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:24,199
Canadian BHA will mail that to you

612
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,880
within 48 hours so um yeah we're trying

613
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,159
to we were talking to them about

614
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,120
reopening the compassionate

615
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:31,320
investigative new drug program which was

616
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:34,158
shut down where currently only Iran

617
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:37,158
Rosenfeld receives it so we want them to

618
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,120
reopen it h staff it with veterans and

619
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:41,520
grow quality of the Cannabis of

620
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:44,199
everybody here and what I sell in

621
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,119
California not of that crappy Mexican

622
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,519
varietals that they've been pumping out

623
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:52,558
for 50 years so we're actually the main

624
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,359
talk is is to facilitate and get various

625
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:57,000
PE various senators and representatives

626
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:58,759
to put the Canadian and US vas together

627
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,960
so that we can get something similar

628
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,599
here in the US in the sense of sorry to

629
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,840
bore you uh we just want to uh have a

630
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,959
voucher system so we can actually the

631
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:10,199
same way you receive free cannabis well

632
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,079
all of our veterans are on disability

633
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,319
with very small limited incomes and the

634
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,038
cost of cannabis is very expensive so if

635
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:17,918
we could get a voucher system within our

636
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:20,158
10th Amendment reality so that we could

637
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,640
supplement and help our veterans

638
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,399
actually get the medicine they need

639
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,840
today as opposed to taking it out of

640
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:28,519
pocket well that'd be helpful so that's

641
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:29,918
just one of the the things that we're

642
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,879
working we're trying to get our medical

643
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,640
card designation on our VA cards so that

644
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,360
if we're no matter where we're traveling

645
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,200
through all 50 States territories or

646
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,719
federal property we won't get arrested

647
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,480
you know simple things that are logical

648
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,278
but apparently you know is illogical to

649
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,880
you know the system itself so um thank

650
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,240
you to our veterans for coming out

651
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,600
strong this week and making uh the stand

652
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,440
and thank you to the National cannabis

653
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:58,000
industry Association for uh allowing us

654
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,278
that ability cuz we basically went out

655
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,640
of 12 veterans and hit 26 different um

656
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:07,640
senators and Republicans um directly and

657
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,320
they were very responsive some ignored

658
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,960
us but yeah bubble man you're exactly

659
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,759
right we we're treated like [ __ ] we're

660
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,640
treated like second class citizens and

661
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,960
we have to fight for everything we have

662
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,519
so uh we have banded together uh and

663
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,759
again we're all volunteers we don't get

664
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:25,278
paid for this so we're out trying to do

665
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:27,200
this for the better of everyone so we'll

666
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:30,159
continue we we got to get back again

667
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,399
there soon uh that seven days wasn't

668
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,559
enough we

669
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:37,558
got it's great

670
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:40,759
work go ahead I have a question at Chen

671
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:45,720
uh who pays for the three grams that you

672
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:48,158
can get for free as a veteran in uh

673
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,798
Canada the Canadian government pays for

674
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,760
it it's a subsidized program last year

675
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:55,599
they pulled out 15 million or so

676
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,440
unfortunately there's a scandal I read

677
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,719
that just came out this week apparently

678
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,360
a whole bunch of money disappeared and

679
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,640
there's a whole bunch of Scandal around

680
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:06,199
it but right now the the Canadian

681
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,480
government is funding about $150 million

682
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,679
per year to uh give free cannabis to

683
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,440
Veterans who meet those qualifications

684
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:18,360
does that mean the Canadian government

685
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:21,278
is buying it from private producers

686
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:23,278
yes I I just want to understand how the

687
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:25,119
system works I mean they're buying it

688
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,000
from the system and the system itself so

689
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,959
they're buying it directly from the lpas

690
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,720
they're packaging like I said through

691
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,319
the national app and mailing it within

692
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,399
48 hours so we can't keep in mind we

693
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:38,079
have over a billion GRS sitting like

694
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,079
there's there's there's billions of

695
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:43,000
grams in Canada that aren't selling

696
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:46,079
either donate them we'll take them we

697
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,240
take donations of every

698
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,839
kind so I'm sure the Canadian

699
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,880
government's getting that for a very

700
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:54,319
good price if they have a deal with like

701
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,320
one of these big auroras or canopies or

702
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:57,319

703
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,879

00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,000
international group we had an Israeli

731
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:16,240
veteran we had gentleman from we had uh

732
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,880
Amy came from Mexico uh so we're not

733
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,679
just United States veterans we're

734
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,679
fighting for Access worldwide uh one of

735
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:25,840
our gentlemen changed the international

736
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,000
law Michael krowitz in December of 2020

737
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:30,918
getting uh medical cannabis removed from

738
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,839
schedule 4 So currently medical cannabis

739
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,679
is legal around the world and one of the

740
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:37,199
things we were there in DC doing is

741
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,440
reminding the US Attorney General's

742
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,519
office uh that currently the United

743
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,120
States is out of international treaty

744
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,120
favor which we used to follow uh because

745
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:48,038
if we were actually following the treaty

746
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:51,038
medical cannabis is legal in the United

747
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:52,440
States in all 50 in all territories uh

748
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:54,119
including around the world which is why

749
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,080
you're seeing other countries coming on

750
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,000
board and pushing medical cannabis so

751
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:01,319
that's why we were in the United States

752
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,679
capital using Canada and Israel and

753
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,319
others as examples to say Hey you know

754
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,639
currently we were telling the guys in

755
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:09,519
the in the VA and the da uh in the

756
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:11,759
defense department there that currently

757
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,399
there is an Israeli nasal spray right

758
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,558
now so if you received a TBI a traumatic

759
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:19,278
brain injury from an explosion or a hit

760
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:21,440
or a concussion or an accident that they

761
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:24,200
actually administer this spray right now

762
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,200
and it stops a TBI in its tracks because

763
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,960
as we know cannabis is a natural

764
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,759
neuroprotectant right so if somebody

765
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,558
gets blown up okay in a vehicle or

766
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,480
something like that they're usually down

767
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:38,519
two weeks being concussed okay so if you

768
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,960
could stop the brain swelling and stop

769
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,558
the permanent damage that happens that

770
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,558
the Israelis are doing then that's

771
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:47,440
something we need so we were there

772
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:49,558
trying to embarrass the American

773
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,200
politicians by saying hey look here's

774
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:54,558
Israel and Canada way ahead of us where

775
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,120
are we why are we not catching up why do

776
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:59,200
we have to wait another 10 to 15 years

777
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:02,239
before that nasal spray is available in

778
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,759
our medic packs that's a that's people

779
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,038
could use that today okay so these are

780
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:08,519
the things that we're trying to point

781
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:10,000
out the hypocrisies so that we can make

782
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,480
advancements for our brothers and

783
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,720
sisters so that they don't have to

784
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,200
continue to suffer you know we got off

785
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,278
the sidelines we're tired of sitting on

786
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,880
our couches and sitting on and

787
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,038

798
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:45,759

00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,398
financially involved

806
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:03,199
we're our our lives are involved and by

807
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:05,798

812
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,838
we're trying to do is to lead by example

813
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,040
it sounds like it sounds like if you're

814
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,759
not a person who's able to go speak to a

815
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:24,239
representative and go out and talk to

816

817
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,199
if you're a grower if you're a seed

818
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,599
breeder if you're a hash maker atan it

820
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:35,159
you guys so that it does get out there

821
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,440
or donate funds that then can be used in

822
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:39,878
that way so you know Ju Just because

823
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,519
you're not able to to talk to

824
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,480

825
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:47,159

able to and we do donate to to some of

828
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,838
the different organizations that are

829
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,319
doing that stuff that are or or even you

830
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,920

831
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,519
weed and give it to etn so it can get

832
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,159
some uh to some of these guys that's

833
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,280
even [ __ ] cooler I think that's no no

834
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:06,118
no no don't give it to me find a local

835
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,200
veteran where you are and adopt veterans

836
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,760
adop a veteran give them their your free

837
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:12,159
cannabis that's what guys did for me

838
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,680
when I was doing this back in 93 Dennis

839
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:17,399
peron's grower actually grew an eth and

840
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:19,719
had a free eth for me every three days

841
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,320
so make sure that you adopt a veteran

842
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:23,679
take care of those who can't take care

843
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,760
of themselves so that they have access

844
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:27,919
so that they can be strong and be

845
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,119
medicated so that they can actually

846
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,838
contribute and help and use their voice

847
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,720
as well so you know help locally and

848
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:38,358
regionally it helps everybody nationally

849
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:40,000
dab a vet bro yeah so get off your I

850
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:42,838
like it we were gonna talk about

851
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,639
harvesting for processing but how about

852
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,559
harvesting for vets make sure when you

853
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:50,400
harvest tiny little bit of that is

854
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:52,078
heading over to your vets there you go

855
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,559
someone's got to take why not the

856
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,800
Cannabis Community that's a great

857
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,159
campaign you know it's uh I I've I've I

858
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,280
was talking I've got some friends that

859
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:02,519
are vets and they're they're pretty

860
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,280
interesting guys they're like Special

861
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:07,679
Forces guys and I love I got I dug real

862
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,640
deep into like living in a very

863
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:12,719
undisciplined life my whole entire life

864
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:15,679
having no supervision from birth to to

865
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:17,279
up until now um I I I never looked at

866
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,919
any discipline or any of that stuff like

867
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,160
it mattered I was always just kind of

868
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,760
wild and free so growing up and then

869
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:25,000
getting really interested in it and

870
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,119
talking to some of these friends what I

871
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,039
learned is that they commit and give

872
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:33,160
their life to not the government but to

873
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:35,440
the group of men that they serve with

874
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:38,000
they become a team and that team is just

875
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,800
like [ __ ] this no matter what us against

876
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,760
the world I got my team and I was

877
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,680
telling them I'm like that reminds me a

878
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,800
lot of like me and my buddies when we

879
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,519
were we were like stealth and we were

880
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,920
just a small group of dudes that all

881
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,559
stuck together that had our grow houses

882
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,880
we'd hang out together after we tended

883
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,519
our Gardens and like we were a team you

884
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,720
know and and and it was like I see a lot

885
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:00,719
of similarities you know and then I I

886
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,199
talked to them too about afterwards you

887
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,199
know they're out of of you know military

888
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,000
service at this point retired and

889
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:09,679
they're doing other things but I'm like

890
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,280
you know do you feel like your

891
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,318
government served you well and how did

892
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,519
it end and if you listen to a lot of the

893
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:17,679
stories that typically they're tapping

894
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,119
out and they're leaving that because

895
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:20,639
they're either you know a lot of them

896
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,519
get accused of things that they didn't

897
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:26,358
do because of um you know the the

898
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:28,119
conditions of like you know engagement

899
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:30,078
and Rules of Engagement different things

900
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:31,640
there's all these different stories but

901
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,318
a lot of them in the end aren't really

902
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:35,639
happy with the government and how the

903
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:37,719
government you know ends up doing them

904
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:40,838
in the end whether it's through veteran

905
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:43,480
services or other ways um so there's a

906
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:45,239
lot of odd when I talk with those guys

907
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,679
I'm like well you know I'm a veteran of

908
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:51,679
the drug war and you know we served in a

909
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:54,399
different way but we facilitated the the

910
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,559
the production distribution transport

911
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,280
for consumption of medical cannabis like

912
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,119
that's what the [ __ ] we did we made

913
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,880
great livings doing it and then we got

914
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,838
into science and we got into all this

915
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,838
other [ __ ] and they're Blown Away by it

916
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,279
and they all love weed every one of them

917
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:10,039
that I know they really value the

918
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,960
compounds the other compounds that we

919
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:13,719
value they also value the

920
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,199
neuroprotectant that cannabis is so

921
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:18,199
that's why it's so crazy at the end to

922
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:21,279
hear about uh there being a medicine

923
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:24,399
that's a a spray that works as a

924
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,160
neuroprotectant that's [ __ ] crazy so

925
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,880
that's nuts when when is is that product

926
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:31,440
available is that like a

927
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,280
drug it's currently available in a medic

928
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,960
pack right now in Israel so why is it

929
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,160
not available at a medic pack right here

930
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,960
in the United States why is it not in a

931
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:41,159
medic pack for the Mexico why is it not

932
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,480
a because they never wanted us to

933
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:45,679
succeed with weed it's too powerful and

934
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,199
it empowers us to live our own life and

935
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:49,199
not give a [ __ ] what the government

936
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:52,799
thinks that's just but doesn't doesn't

937
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:55,480
the money go us don't tell Israel they

938
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,000
said [ __ ] all that and did it anyway

939
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,838
don't you guys give them billions of

940
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,599
dollars though didn't you buy that for

941
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:03,960
them yeah yeah we paid for it we paid

942
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,000
for it the money doesn't go Israel

943
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,119
America you've already paid for this can

944
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,960
we uh talk it out and so they're gonna

945
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,079
try and put us together and have those

946
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,358
conversations if you can get illegal

947
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,880
oxycodon and and all these other drugs

948
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:18,159
on the street you we should probably be

949
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,119
able to find this I'll call a guy see if

950
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:23,598
we can get some because this is this is

951
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,480
I guess call Hash church I'm not happy

952
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,838
with the

953
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,760
government or like you know sports

954
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:32,880
medicine for that spray too you know you

955
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,880
think about all these athletes too you

956
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,480
know like my we were just setting a park

957
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,160
and my little boy was seeing a football

958
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,199
practice and he's like football I'm like

959
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:42,440
oh I don't I don't know if you want to

960
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:45,279
play that

961
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,200
but yeah I mean you need it in the

962
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,800
Cannabis

963
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:52,519
CRA so we're talking about ctiv but

964
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,760
seriously when whenever they go into

965
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:56,318
that blue tent for a CTE they should be

966
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,280
shooting them up with that nasal spray

967
00:39:56,318 --> 00:40:00,880
because it's the same traumatic brain

968
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,880
injury that's going to continue to swell

969
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,400
which is going to continue to disable

970
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,240
that person cause nerve separations Etc

971
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,519
so between cannabis and then if you use

972
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,719
mushrooms to reconnect those nerve

973
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:14,559
endings that have separated you're

974
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,439
actually healing and and and and

975
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:19,559
actually bringing yourself back into

976
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,960
your know homeostasis preferably using

977
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:24,920
using the endoc canabo system to bring

978
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,079
the body into homostasis which is

979
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,680
[ __ ]

980
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:34,079
badass also using a very specific

981
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:37,239
nanoscopic vehicle to deliver those

982
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:40,359
drugs to break the that that brain blood

983
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:42,239
barrier and that's one directly absorbed

984
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:44,598
into the mucal membrane right it goes

985
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,519
straight to the brain right there so so

986
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:48,720
hopefully in the very near future I'll

987
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:50,759
be able to talk about what that vehicle

988
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,358
is because I know what that vehicle is

989
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,880
and I have a company right now that

990
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:58,639
we're looking into that particular

991
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,720
vehicle and uh maybe in the next couple

992
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:03,759
of months I can I can talk about that

993
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:06,078
because it really does finish the circle

994
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,319
uh when you're talking about uh you know

995
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,318
delivering the payload and getting it to

996
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:13,279
where it needs to go and making it um

997
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:16,639
still effective because the the blood

998
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,200
brain barrier is um it's super [ __ ]

999
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,799
heavy man it keeps out like almost

1000
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:22,838
everything but we were educating that

1001
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,280
specifically on what even the endoc

1002
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:27,440
canabo system was okay because the

1003
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,760
majority of them don't even know because

1004
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,079
again recent discovery so I mean you

1005
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,440
could literally start to see their eyes

1006
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,960
just glaze over when you started to have

1007
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,519
that discussion those were that were

1008
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,559
doctors or science and scientists

1009
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,318
because some of them are they got it you

1010
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:45,480
know some of these no they don't get it

1011
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:48,318
so much we talked to a lot of defensive

1012
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,079
fellows and the thing that got to them

1013
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:53,800
which are basically their officers who

1014
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:57,440
are basically assistance to uh senators

1015
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:59,359
and uh representatives for a year and so

1016
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,000
they basically work in their office so

1017
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:03,880
they're basically they're being bred

1018
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,599
into perfect little generals however by

1019
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,440
using the TBI information specifically

1020
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,880
uh that was a way to get through to them

1021
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,519
because again we're looking at ways to

1022
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,559
connect with these people to get what we

1023
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:17,880
want right and we can talk all the

1024
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:21,318
legalization and medical this talking

1025
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,599
that t TBI spray was the arrow through

1026
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:25,719
all the [ __ ] all of them pretty much

1027
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,760
for the most part were like oh [ __ ] oh

1028
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:28,759
that makes sense oh that's l iCal oh

1029
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,440
that's not a bunch of people sitting

1030
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,720
around and smoking pot etc etc so again

1031
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,440
it's also about finding how we connect

1032
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:39,239
with these people using language so that

1033
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,400
we can get through all the prohibition

1034
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:45,118
lies that we've had for 70 plus years

1035
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,920
and make a human connection so that they

1036
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,079
understood that this could be you

1037
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,880
because we also used Alzheimer's as an

1038
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:54,920
example in using the um the uh uh the

1039
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,720
the patent that the US has as a

1040
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,358
neuroprotectant and showing these

1041
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:02,439
senator and representatives specifically

1042
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:05,558
your governments has had had this patent

1043
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,440
okay so why is Israel and can of being

1044
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:09,800
able to benefit from us and we're being

1045
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,119
laughed at and our guys and brothers and

1046
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,760
sisters are suffering oh we know why we

1047
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:18,079
we know why yeah for sure yes we know

1048
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,480
why but I'm trying to make it I'm trying

1049
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,680
to hit them in their third eye and this

1050
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,240
is how we got through so these are

1051
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:26,639
skills we're learning and we want to

1052
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,558
teach you so that you can be better at

1053
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:31,598
talking to to these Liars so that they

1054
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:31,599
can see through the

1055
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:39,480
truth politican which is the Psychedelic

1056
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:41,480
aspect of life too which in Canada you

1057
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,960
know it's not just weed that you can get

1058
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,440
for three you know three grams you can

1059
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:50,559
now starting in January

1060
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:53,119
get well every every drug is GNA up to

1061
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:56,760
two 2.5 grams I think I think it's two

1062
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:59,039
and a half grams just in BC just in BC

1063
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,040
oh yeah

1064
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:16,760
yeah you get to like

1065
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:19,519
help affect reality which is which is

1066
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,680
super powerful and then we don't also

1067
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:25,079
really kind of need to dance to all

1068
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:26,838
those that those songs you know we have

1069
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:30,000
other songs and other rhythms that we

1070
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:32,838
dance too and stuff so it's it's a time

1071
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,559
where we can kind of choose our own

1072
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:37,719
adventure and uh you know sometimes you

1073
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:39,040
feel like you're banging your head

1074
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:40,799
against the wall and then you see a

1075
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,480
little glimmer of light down the hallway

1076
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,680
and you're like oh maybe I'll try out

1077
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,838
this other this other realm stuff so I

1078
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:51,159
like it that that everything's happening

1079
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:53,759
at once and uh I'm thankful for it being

1080
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:55,358
fall you know we get to talk about all

1081
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,599
the good things that happened in the

1082
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:01,358
summer the the ACT acist stuff that

1083
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:03,039
we're doing and then watch the ganja

1084
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:06,679
develop in front of us knowing that

1085
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:08,880
these compounds are listening to us talk

1086
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:10,879
and the plants are listening to us

1087
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,680
they're helping communicate with us

1088
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,039
because we're breathing in their air and

1089
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:17,679
they're breathing in ours and now that

1090
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:20,159
cannabis is going to help Propel all

1091
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:22,399
these thoughts forward it's crystals

1092
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:25,199
they're Tricom they're crystals they get

1093
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,838
affected by thoughts and they're water

1094
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:31,239
we water so I just really appreciate the

1095
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:35,318
intention you know and everyone coming

1096
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:36,799
together and in a slight shift I wonder

1097
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:39,199
how everyone's dealing with their

1098
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,280
crystals right now in in their Harvest

1099
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:46,399
and like is it raining in your

1100
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:49,720
world did it rain in August did you feel

1101
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,400
a warm to cold night shift because we

1102
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:53,439
get sometimes rains when it's warm out

1103
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,160
and it's terrible for the buds but if we

1104
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,838
get rains with cold nights we really

1105
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:01,000
don't get the

1106
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,599
because they have this inner plant shift

1107
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,838
that happens that they're oh you know

1108
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:07,200
it's the wrong environment so I'd love

1109
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:10,440
to hear what some of the people are

1110
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:12,318
feeling in their Harvest yeah yeah like

1111
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,679
what's being what's being done right now

1112
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:17,400
to prep for resin

1113
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:19,799
harvesting like like

1114
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,880
Rost what what are you uh what are you

1115
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,160
guys doing right

1116
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,760
now I saw you cleaning up the plants a

1117
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,759
bunch the other day

1118
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,960
yeah we we have uh mostly been pulling

1119
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,838
in light depths and in the end of August

1120
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:40,318
here right after the Unicorn cup about

1121
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:44,119
August 25th we got heavy

1122
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:45,880
humidity and um we have in a mountain

1123
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:47,720
valley so the mount the whole valley

1124
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,318
fills up and then sometimes you get

1125
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:51,318
these just clouds going through the

1126
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:55,558
valley and we just call them death death

1127
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:58,639
clouds and stuff but luckily this we

1128
00:46:55,559 --> 00:47:00,800
have we what we'll do push-ups too oh

1129
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:06,358
you're doing push-ups okay

1130
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,359
good it's 10 o' man

1131
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:18,559
just 49 push-ups in

1132
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:20,960
a he's on the schedule looks like we had

1133
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,680
glitch nice one those are

1134
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:27,000
gooder nice and C but but we're really

1135
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:29,519
thankful this year uh for the Harvest

1136
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,519
and it was really amazing and we haven't

1137
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:34,599
watered our green houses for like a

1138
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:36,838
month and a half now you know just zero

1139
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:39,680
water just keeping it dry in there and

1140
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:43,159
then if we do get rains instead of

1141
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:44,919
dropping the walls we pull the walls out

1142
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:48,639
you know so the water's kind of going

1143
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:50,680
away from the the house and in some

1144
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:53,199
cases leave the end walls just totally

1145
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:55,558
open um and that just allows enough a

1146
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:57,279
little flow through but there's no like

1147
00:47:55,559 --> 00:48:00,079
blowing

1148
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:03,359
yeah you know Mist coming coming on the

1149
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,920
plants and I'm so stoked about the one

1150
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:07,880
Greenhouse left right now there's zero

1151
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,880
mold in there and now we have these cold

1152
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:13,599
nights and you can literally see like

1153
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:18,240
whole layers of new crystals come on

1154
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:20,599
like overnight when it gets down to 35

1155
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:22,639
39 you know degrees which is what close

1156
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:25,480
to what we're close to freezing at this

1157
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:28,039
Mo you know in these times and stuff so

1158
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:30,960
big time cool years zero power powdery

1159
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:34,960
mildew around even on you know the

1160
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:38,240
ground and stuff we're using way less

1161
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:40,679
tea and way more just in the soil

1162
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:42,759
building and way more into the the

1163
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:44,279
layering and the mulching and all that

1164
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,400
and I feel like it's really helping our

1165
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,319
plants because the plants just go into

1166
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:52,798
the soil and they're just like oh this

1167
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:56,279
is what I have to work with and it's not

1168
00:48:52,798 --> 00:48:57,519
necessarily over pushed you know with

1169
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,359
nutrient

1170
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:02,838
to where it kind of becomes vulnerable

1171
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:04,880
it becomes they become huge and

1172
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:07,920
sometimes it's fine but when they they

1173
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,798
have a the cells and the way the plants

1174
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,798
grow and they have just their soil going

1175
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:16,000
on um they tend to be healthier and they

1176
00:49:13,798 --> 00:49:18,318
hold themselves better and we don't

1177
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,199
trellis so much you know but we're not

1178
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,599
dealing with 20 pound giant plants

1179
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:25,039
either and obviously you you TR us a

1180
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:27,440
plant like that but um so it's been it's

1181
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,880
been good for us this year and I'm so it

1182
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,838
sounds like there's a lot of things that

1183
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,200
you've got to take care of in regards to

1184
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:36,440
the the flower itself right in regards

1185
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:39,358
to molding and not kind of rotting out

1186
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:41,079
but are there anything other than I mean

1187
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,838
obviously each year you're going to make

1188
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:45,960
cash out of your varieties and press

1189
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:48,279
some raw and then smoke those ones I'm

1190
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:51,760
I'm sure you you're keeping the guava

1191
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:55,040
lines going I mean those came out so

1192
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,359
beautiful uh in hash and rosin that uh

1193
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,318
are there anything else that you're

1194
00:49:56,358 --> 00:50:01,759
doing at this time that's really

1195
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:01,759
specific for the

1196
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,679
resin

1197
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:10,558
um there is a thing about too dry in the

1198
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:12,159
greenhouse and then sometimes that there

1199
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,400
some of the weeds will start dying and

1200
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:15,039
stuff so you kind of have to keep a

1201
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,798
little light make sure there's life

1202
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:19,679
going on so that when plants die they

1203
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:22,440
tend to get you know more pathogens on

1204
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:25,519
them to help them die but really it's

1205
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:27,440
not we're not doing any sprays no foler

1206
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:30,199
sprays um

1207
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:33,159
and minimal minimal watering towards the

1208
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:35,279
end and really is just walking through

1209
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:38,639
uh keeping a really good flow through

1210
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,040
environment for uh you know to to manage

1211
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:43,838
the the pest so there's we're having

1212
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:46,440
zero pest issues because we have so many

1213
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:50,078
flowers every Greenhouse is surrounded

1214
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,798
by food um and uh so you know that

1215
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,318
another thing we've just had deer and

1216
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:56,119
bears you know rolling through our green

1217
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:57,599
houses this year more than ever like I

1218
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:59,119
mean it's like oh it's cool to see a

1219
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,119
bear but really like when it's in your

1220
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,960
house like every day all summer it's

1221
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:05,880
just interesting and then you have like

1222
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,599
deer in the middle of the day like

1223
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,838
hanging out like f you walk into a

1224
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,318
greenhouse you're like she has a [ __ ]

1225
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:12,960
deer in here what's going on you know so

1226
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,558
the the animals are coming in quite a

1227
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,280
bit more but like I don't know I just

1228
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,680
think it's keeping uh walking through

1229
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,200
every single you know day two or three

1230
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:24,759
times a day making sure everything is

1231
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:27,399
cool making sure nothing's fall falling

1232
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:30,000
over keeping the weeds lower so there's

1233
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,119
flow through and really like just

1234
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,838
praying you know just playing music you

1235
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:36,119
know and then also keeping like the

1236
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:38,239
prayer Vibes going and and the

1237
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:41,079
ceremonial sort of aspect you know I

1238
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:43,078
think that helps a lot you know and so

1239
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:45,400
that's what we've been doing and we're

1240
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:47,359
thankful someone ask what the guava

1241
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:50,358
lines that you're working with are top

1242
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:52,318
dog or Oni and then also I will also add

1243
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:54,358
that we've also had the Bears it was a

1244
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:56,599
late winter we were still skiing at the

1245
00:51:54,358 --> 00:52:00,159
end of May my friends were still

1246
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:01,960
flooding in June um and so the snow was

1247
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:03,440
really when they came out of hibernation

1248
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,599
the snow was all around them and they

1249
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,280
got pushed down lower to find food and

1250
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:10,760
when that happens generally they just

1251
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,599
stay low you know and and so we saw like

1252
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:16,040
an 800 my kid was on his trampoline the

1253
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:17,720
other day he like Mom there's a bear and

1254
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:19,279
we're just like oh like which which

1255
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:21,199
direction is it running our trampoline

1256
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,079
is like down on the road so he's down

1257
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,279
there with his little friends right he's

1258
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:27,079
just so chill he's like oh it's it's

1259
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,200
walking up the up the hill it's going

1260
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:31,480
into the mountain okay well if it turns

1261
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:33,078
around just come up to the house you

1262
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,559
know and my buddies were visiting in

1263
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:37,000
from Vancouver and they're like look is

1264
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:38,200
this normal dude you just have like

1265
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,559
giant bears walking around your

1266
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:41,879
neighborhood it's like well if you did

1267
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:44,240
notice we live in a forest and there's

1268
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,599
only two options leave the Bears alone

1269
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,078
and then they'll be around or kill all

1270
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:50,920
the Bears and you won't have them

1271
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,640
anymore and so we went for the the the

1272
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:55,960
first one there just leave the Bears

1273
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:58,000
Alone um when they when they call those

1274
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,559
conserv officers the only thing those

1275
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
guys conserve are their jobs because

1276
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,880
they they're the ones that kill the

1277
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,039
Bears they don't conserve them

1278
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,838
so we have a lot of logging and stuff as

1279
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:11,960
well but I would just say uh there's

1280
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:14,759
there just a lot around it's called bare

1281
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:17,559
medicine how powerful and strong they're

1282
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,680
almost like a dragon they're like and

1283
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:22,519
they chop their teeth together but

1284
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:24,639
they're so doile and if you watch them

1285
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:26,480
walk through a garden they in some cases

1286
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,318
they'll just bear their way through like

1287
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,880
squash you can't really but like in some

1288
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:33,639
way they just tiptoe through we've even

1289
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,079
had them open our car door with just a

1290
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:38,639
nail whatever and grab like chicken food

1291
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,640
out of the car and walk away and there's

1292
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:42,318
zero scratches on the car which sucks

1293
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:44,318
that're in the car but and we have to

1294
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:47,679
keep the food out but it's kind of like

1295
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:50,119
wow situation um the guava punch lines

1296
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:53,480

that he's been coming out with um really

1317
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:47,480
blessed uh to be trying those out this

1318
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,558
year we we didn't necessarily do them in

1319
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,039
numbers this year but we wanted to see

1320
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:54,440
kind of what the the finishing time

1321
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:58,318
would be like up here and and a lot of

1322
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,318
them all worked out like super well

1323
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:05,920
um BL beautiful the blue Thunders uh the

1324
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:08,039
lemon head chem is uh just starting to

1325
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:12,960
to come on the the blue

1326
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:15,599
diesel um and uh oh God what was the

1327
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,199
last one that we just harvested uh but

1328
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,160
anyway you know just thank you for those

1329
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:23,679
and and and a lot of people up here in

1330
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:25,838
Canada and and BC are really feeling you

1331
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:27,519
know are have actually have bought your

1332
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:28,920
seeds over the last few years and are

1333
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:31,519
continuing to work with them so it's

1334
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:35,639
really cool to see that uh and I think

1335
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:35,639
it's good for us to it was fun to see

1336
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:41,440
them oh I was saying I think it's good

1337
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:45,000
for us to readdress know like we've been

1338
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:47,720
pulling tarps for a whole lot of years

1339
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,639
and now to be seeing varietals that are

1340
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:52,879
catching up so we don't have to do that

1341
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:55,199
that we can put our energy elsewhere

1342
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,358
more into internal work and into family

1343
00:55:55,199 --> 00:56:00,000
and community places where we really

1344
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:02,798
want to be rather than pulling tarps so

1345
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,400
there's a really beautiful free up I

1346
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:07,798
think for the whole you know cannabis

1347
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,960
community and you know putting our

1348
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:12,119
energy where we where we want to put it

1349
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:15,039
and and having good varietals that allow

1350
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:18,200
that so thank

1351
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,200
you are

1352
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:25,720
we it was fun to see those grow up there

1353
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,838
uh they're really pretty and if you guys

1354
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:29,480
do have good to submit to the Autoflower

1355
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:31,880
cup the injuries are due at the end of

1356
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,960
October we we have one I think that's in

1357
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,920
mid November in Northern California this

1358
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:39,559
year and I'll be there as a guest

1359
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,798
speaker in vending and I had a super

1360
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:44,200
successful Autoflower breeding program

1361
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:46,639
this summer where I probably made over a

1362
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:48,558
hundred hybrid combinations where it was

1363
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:51,879
like part of my goal for these past few

1364
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:55,480
years to just breed the lionclaw in with

1365
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,400
full terms and then make them Autos but

1366
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:00,159
make them poly hybrid so that I could

1367
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,639
start with an a a poly hybrid that's

1368
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:04,639
fully auto to kind of try to bring some

1369
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:08,038
strength and vigor and some and then go

1370
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:08,038
from there and work down the

1371
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:17,558
IBS and by ful AO does that mean it has

1372
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:20,679
two sets of Auto jees male and female no

1373
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:23,280
no um so the autoflowering is it's a

1374
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:25,000
recessing trait and uh so it doesn't

1375
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,519
show up till the second generation of

1376
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,960
EMB breeding but takes three generations

1377
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:34,239
to make it auto you know sticks to make

1378
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:37,720
it like stable but it it um you can

1379
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:39,838
cross an auto in with a photo period and

1380
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:41,919
and just inbreed them or outbreed them

1381
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:45,159
so if I did like you know a blue dream

1382
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:48,480
Auto with a cookies and then a cookie

1383
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:49,838
Auto th those are those f1s would would

1384
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,519
not be auto flowering but you could

1385
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:53,199
cross those two together and then the

1386
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:56,280
next Generation which would also be an

1387
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:58,519
F1 would show up with a 25% or less

1388
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,559
autoflowering so I kind of been working

1389
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:02,519
on

1390
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,039
that the

1391
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:08,679
25% that are auto flowering they are

1392
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:12,000
they've got Autoflower jeans from both

1393
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:15,480
the mother and the father correct um

1394
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,838
well not if you cross an auto in with a

1395
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:20,798
photosensitive that that but that 25%

1396
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:22,798
would have both parents jeans but it

1397
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:25,159
would be expressing that recessive train

1398
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:28,119
it would be dominant and that was 25%

1399
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:29,399
and then you would select two of those

1400
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:31,240
and then if you really wanted to make

1401
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,240
like the auto Blue Dream you would go

1402
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:35,879
three generations down to make an

1403
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:38,239
Autoflower but then you would back cross

1404
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,200
and and that makes a lot of sense from

1405
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:41,919
what just what I've noticed from

1406
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:45,679
breeding that you you know to really

1407
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:48,400
stabilize the um trait of

1408
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:50,358
that you'd want to go back cross to the

1409
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,639
F1 or back to the Blue Dream because

1410
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:54,078
that would really then bring the

1411
00:58:51,639 --> 00:58:57,558
structure and the effects of the Blue

1412
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:59,160
Dream Out further in that uh in that

1413
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:02,240
line and then you'd go a couple more

1414
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:04,920
Generations down to six and then you'd

1415
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:08,199
have a fully auto you know whatever the

1416
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,200
photo period you were starting

1417
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,599
with I love

1418
00:59:14,838 --> 00:59:22,119
it sounds like something Canada

1419
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:24,760
needs so we will send some

1420
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:27,318
down bubble man how are your flowers

1421
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:29,359
looking this year

1422
00:59:27,318 --> 00:59:31,480
that's not too bad I uh you know I went

1423
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:33,239
and I thank you for asking that because

1424
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,920
really what it allows me to do is shout

1425
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:38,798
out one of my longest time friends and

1426
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:42,760
mentors Ron hickey who I got to see

1427
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:45,400
while I was out in Proctor BC in the Cy

1428
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,799
I hadn't seen him for a very long time

1429
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,440
uh so for those of you that have watched

1430
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,358
the channel for a while you'll have seen

1431
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,280
a couple of videos with me and Ron on

1432
00:59:50,358 --> 00:59:54,798

bubble and just he's a super character

1434
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:58,519
he's just one of the greatest people

1435
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,519
that I know and uh so I got to spend

1436
00:59:58,519 --> 01:00:02,759
time with him unfortunately before I

1437
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:06,159
arrived he was like rushed to the

1438
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:08,000
hospital with uh with covid he ended up

1439
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:10,159
yeah like I'm on the way I'm like seven

1440
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,440
hours into my eight hour drive and I get

1441
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:14,719
a call from his like roommate guy that

1442
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:17,039
helped with the plant Will shout out to

1443

will uh and Ron's on his way to the

1444
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:20,480
hospital he's having problems breathing

1445
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:22,199
and I'm just like oh my God I'm super

1446
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:25,000
worried about him now I'm just like

1447
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:26,318
crazy like I'm at his house by myself

1448
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,679
hanging out with sort of the people that

1449
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:30,318
take care of his plants uh and luckily

1450
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:31,759
he came home the next day he did have

1451
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:34,519
covid I still hung out with him for a

1452
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,319
couple of days uh he kept at a distance

1453
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:38,400
and and wore a mask while he was in the

1454
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:39,920
house and whatnot and we just uh I still

1455
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,960
got to hang out with him a little bit

1456
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,760
and Vibe with him of course you know if

1457
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,760
you know Ron he's got plants all over

1458
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,799
his property he's got his greenhouse and

1459
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:50,839
he's got uh he moves the plants all day

1460
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:52,719
like nonstop as the he's like oh the

1461
01:00:50,838 --> 01:00:55,558
plants got to have the best son so he's

1462
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:58,798
just moving all these [ __ ] plants all

1463
01:00:55,559 --> 01:01:00,760
around his property in the most insane

1464
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:02,559
of ways that only really Ron could

1465
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,760
possibly do like it irks him for the

1466
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:08,599
plant to not be in the best son and so

1467
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:11,640
he had a lot of plants uh six or seven

1468
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:13,559
or eight varieties and so he gave me

1469
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:15,038
seven or eight of these different unique

1470
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:16,280
plants I've got them out on my deck

1471
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:18,359
right now they're probably like three

1472
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,920
weeks uh maybe four weeks into flowering

1473
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:21,920
so they've got like another month and

1474
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,720
and a bit there's a Congo out there that

1475
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,000
will probably do another you know six

1476
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:27,480
weeks or whatever I might have to bring

1477
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,159
it in and put it under a um LED light if

1478
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:32,199
it starts raining here soon but uh it

1479
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:34,358
was nice to have plants at the Unicorn

1480
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:36,038
cup I was I think the only ones who had

1481
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:38,000
living plants because Ron was like you

1482
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:39,720
got to take these plants and I'm like

1483
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,559
okay so I had these plants around my

1484
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:44,838
tent I was lucky enough to be sitting

1485
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,680
with these dudes uh what the hell was

1486
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:49,519
their brand called melts or something

1487
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:52,000
they had a melt something melts uh the

1488
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:53,599
two oh they both have the same name too

1489
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,318
I it's terrible that I can't remember

1490
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:57,480
really nice young guys that are working

1491
01:01:55,318 --> 01:02:00,239
in the industry making beautiful melty

1492
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,760
hash uh and you know he's like he bubble

1493
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:04,078
man you know I listen to you and Kevin

1494
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,760
talk and I want to find I want to find a

1495
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,240
haze I want to get into one of these you

1496
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,440
know

1497
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:11,598
sativas and so the guy next to me Tyler

1498
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,559
was like listen if you're trying to get

1499
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,599
into a sativa what you need to find is

1500
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:17,720
that damn Congo plant because if you can

1501
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,640
find that and as he's saying that I just

1502
01:02:17,719 --> 01:02:21,318
get up and walk away because I'm

1503
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:24,118
thinking I'm going to give these guys

1504
01:02:21,318 --> 01:02:25,920
the Congo that Ron gave me to bring here

1505
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:27,358
and I did while we were sitting there I

1506
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,680
came back and I put it in his lap and he

1507
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:30,400
looked all confused he's like what's

1508
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:32,639
this I'm like that's the the plant that

1509
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,960
Tyler was telling you you need to get

1510
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,480
and he was just like mind blown his

1511
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:40,440
buddy still didn't know what was going

1512
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:42,079
on until he just turned around and gave

1513
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,519
him the plant and his buddy was like

1514
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:46,640
what is this he's like it's the Congo

1515
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:49,239
the the plant we were talking about so

1516
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:51,038
shout out to Ron for for just being so

1517
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:52,838
awesome I can't even remember the name

1518
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:55,240
of all the cultivars there's a Congo out

1519
01:02:52,838 --> 01:02:59,239
there there's a Black Domina out there

1520
01:02:55,239 --> 01:03:02,078
there is a a white wrecker I think he

1521
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:04,679
called it and one that was

1522
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:08,839
called what plant did you see that made

1523
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:12,038
you go wow this one that he called Ezra

1524
01:03:08,838 --> 01:03:14,239
was just like covered in resin it was so

1525
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:16,400
covered in resin outdoors and the Cy it

1526
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:18,598
just reminded me every time I go to the

1527
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,920
cotney I see at least one plant like

1528
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:22,278
that and it was that EZ so it's not the

1529
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,200
name of the cultivar it's the name of

1530
01:03:22,278 --> 01:03:26,760
the kid who was living at his house and

1531
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:28,759
brought this cultivar I'm not sure what

1532
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,440
it is uh it's out there right now it's

1533
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:33,160
the first one that's turning like the

1534
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,400
hairs are turning pink uh in the cold

1535
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:37,239
night but uh it looks my these plants

1536
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,680
are very little they're like a couple of

1537
01:03:37,239 --> 01:03:41,358
feet tall just just some ornamentals

1538
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:43,519
really I didn't even you know take them

1539
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:46,239
out of their pots I'm really not a big

1540
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:48,920
grower so when I when I wanted to have

1541

cool woman from Portland and they've all

1553
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,880
changed the game in the face of pizza by

1554
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:23,399
becoming obsessed with getting their

1555
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:26,278
hands into the dough creating their own

1556
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:29,358
dough visiting the flower field the the

1557
01:04:26,278 --> 01:04:31,440
wheat Fields visiting the the fig trees

1558
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:33,960
and all the different ingredients that

1559
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,960
they end up really changing the face of

1560
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:39,159
pizza it's totally [ __ ] inspirational

1561
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:42,159
each one in it in their own rights you

1562
01:04:39,159 --> 01:04:45,239
can tell are just absolutely

1563
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:47,038
legendary uh and it's so it's so you

1564
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:49,159
know they're out forging mushrooms and

1565
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:51,039
they're out forging berries and flowers

1566
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:53,879
and they're talking about the biome of

1567
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,480
the and the farming and the regenerative

1568
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,960
they're just talking about everything

1569
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,880
that we're talking about and it's neat

1570
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,920
that we're going to end up there and

1571
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:04,318
even the the the Italian pizza chef

1572
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,798
saying you know back in the day Italian

1573
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:08,838
or the Pizza Chef was the lowly Chef we

1574
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:10,920
were looked down upon because we were

1575
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:13,199
just making pizza and now they've

1576
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:17,079
elevated this pizza to what I would call

1577
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:19,838
full melt pizza and it's just

1578
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:21,720
reminiscent of our community especially

1579
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:24,558
you know people like best friends and

1580
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:26,199
ganja Gill and you know the dragonfly

1581
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:28,440
Earth medicine just like

1582
01:05:26,199 --> 01:05:31,679
really getting your hands into the soil

1583
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:34,798
and understanding that the magic happens

1584
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:37,919
in the Simplicity it doesn't have to be

1585
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:39,759
overly complex and um I mean obviously

1586
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,680
the volatile organic compounds are going

1587
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:45,319
to be very complex and and profound and

1588
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:47,038
have depth but how we can get there

1589
01:05:45,318 --> 01:05:50,199
doesn't it it can be very simple it

1590
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:53,000
doesn't look flashy and it's not uh you

1591
01:05:50,199 --> 01:05:55,000
know like uh what's the word I'm looking

1592
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,400
for it's just it's very simple you know

1593
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,880
it's it's a guy just walking in his farm

1594
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,559
with his rubber boots on and he's he's

1595
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,318
he's now he's walking into the forest

1596
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:07,000
and he's picking mushrooms like our our

1597
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:10,239
community has that aspect of that sort

1598
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,480
of farm totable aspect of like you know

1599
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:14,358
when we the one Italian guy says at one

1600
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,240
point you know the reason my pizza is so

1601
01:06:14,358 --> 01:06:18,679
special is because I make all my dough I

1602
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:20,519
don't let machines make my dough if

1603
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:24,000
everyone makes pizza and machines

1604
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:26,159
everyone's Pizza will taste the same and

1605
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,679
so that was like a profound state to me

1606
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:31,038
that really made me realize like yeah we

1607
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:32,759
This Is Us the Cannabis some of us in

1608
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:35,240
the Cannabis industry that are really

1609
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:37,200
passionate about this and love the

1610
01:06:35,239 --> 01:06:39,199
understanding of the botony of the plant

1611
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:40,679
and the biology and all of the things

1612
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:43,239
that are happening in regards to the

1613
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:45,598
field and the environment in the Terre

1614
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:47,719
and then the person who takes it those

1615
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:49,880
hash makers we are always so quirky

1616
01:06:47,719 --> 01:06:52,118
we're always so obsessed we're always

1617
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,559
we're just a different breed of people

1618
01:06:52,119 --> 01:06:56,039
and we want to get right in there and we

1619
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:58,839
want to show much like these people to

1620
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:01,000
Makers what they all wanted to do was

1621
01:06:58,838 --> 01:07:03,558
they wanted to honor the ingredients

1622
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,679
they were given from The Growers and the

1623
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:08,039
genetics and they wanted to create

1624
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:10,598
something that honored that and that as

1625
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:13,640
a hash maker sums up what I want to do

1626
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:16,680
in a nutshell and it really made clear

1627
01:07:13,639 --> 01:07:19,078
why you guys are so so so important to

1628
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:21,639
me and the work that I do because I'm

1629
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:23,960
not a grower I'm not growing plants I'm

1630
01:07:21,639 --> 01:07:26,759
not getting in the mud I can I can grow

1631
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:29,639
plants but I'm not that's my my focus is

1632
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,920
is honoring what you guys have done and

1633
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:34,558
creating something of value and creating

1634
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,798
something that can be a little you know

1635
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:38,680
wind in your ear a little just a little

1636
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:41,639
moment of Happiness while you're hitting

1637
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:42,399
that bowl or or twisting up that that

1638
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:45,199
that

1639
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:48,760
joint that's I feel like that really go

1640
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:51,239
forth and be Saucy he

1641
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:54,880
says I feel like that describes the

1642
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:57,278
exploration of just uh fermenting and F

1643
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,960
and generative farming and building your

1644
01:07:57,278 --> 01:08:01,880
soil and hug culture and making all

1645
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,519
these layered beds and all that we just

1646
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:06,000
are like wow look at all these

1647
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:08,079
ingredients we can make soil out of and

1648
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:13,719
holy [ __ ] look at the flavor coming off

1649
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:17,000
this this is not Pete perlite and worm

1650
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:19,238
castings this is wow this is the whole

1651
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,679
environment so I mean I think that's the

1652
01:08:19,238 --> 01:08:23,879
exploration of the flavors and the turps

1653
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:26,560
and do it for the turps and you know do

1654
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:29,239
it for the soil let the your soil not

1655
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,400
the plants that whole exploration is

1656
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:34,238
kind of that pizza exploration you just

1657
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:36,119
described um hey Gil I was wondering now

1658
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:39,838
that you want pizza because Marcus just

1659
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:42,158
said all that um how did you survive the

1660
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:44,039
fire and how are you doing this year and

1661
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:47,318
everything I know you got like sweated

1662
01:08:44,039 --> 01:08:48,960
on really hard in Trinity County and how

1663
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:50,798
did it affect your Harvest and how you

1664
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,759
feeling right now you're looks like

1665
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:56,439
you're at the coast which is

1666
01:08:52,759 --> 01:09:00,158
nice yeah um I

1667
01:08:56,439 --> 01:09:02,000
escape the fire unscathed yet again um

1668
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:04,399
I've been at the same place for 10 years

1669
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,198
and I feel like I've dealt with fire

1670
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:08,278
more than half the years there but the

1671
01:09:06,198 --> 01:09:11,399
last three have been pretty brutal so

1672
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:14,880
it's definitely getting old but uh yeah

1673
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:17,119
doing fine Place made it fire I think is

1674
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,960
still burning as of yesterday but we got

1675
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:21,920
some rain this morning so like I'm

1676
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,679
hoping it kind of put it out but uh just

1677
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,440
part of life in California now

1678
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,679
especially Trinity County that was

1679
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:29,358
lightning

1680
01:09:26,679 --> 01:09:32,279
complexes yeah man it was crazy there

1681
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:34,120
was like you know that night it was like

1682
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:36,679
hundreds of lightning strikes all in

1683
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:39,479
like a really small isolated area like

1684
01:09:36,679 --> 01:09:42,399
really really small and it like lit 15

1685
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:45,318
fires right outside Willow Creek and uh

1686
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:47,079
it it was crazy I was like every year it

1687
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:49,239
gets worse it's like you know it's like

1688
01:09:47,079 --> 01:09:52,600
oh it's close then it gets closer and

1689
01:09:49,238 --> 01:09:54,678
then these fires now become 150,000

1690
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:57,360
Acres or now they're like really close

1691
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:59,600
to town or there's all multiple it's

1692
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:01,799
just like over and over again that that

1693
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,840
immediate area the Willow Creek area has

1694
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,640
had it really rough these past two years

1695
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,119
so definitely feeling for all the

1696
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,920
farmers there really bad just because

1697
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:12,039
the nature of the market isn't super

1698
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,199
great and then to have Mother Nature

1699
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:16,279
kind of like throw you curve balls is

1700
01:10:14,198 --> 01:10:18,439
just like literally the death blow I

1701
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:20,639
feel like for a lot of people where we

1702
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:23,000
had a really late spring it was really

1703
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,079
cold and it kind of [ __ ] up people's

1704
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,760
depths pretty bad a lot of the structure

1705
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:30,559
was was off like small flowers Twiggy

1706
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:33,560
stuff you know so that was tough and

1707
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:36,199
then the fires came in and it's like you

1708
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,960
know it costs a lot of money a it's like

1709
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:40,198
your livelihood being threatened every

1710
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:42,800
day which the stress is just

1711
01:10:40,198 --> 01:10:45,000
unbelievable but like it costs money to

1712
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,199
deal with Wildfire I don't know you know

1713
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,840
I'm sure people do realize but there's

1714
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:50,439
just all this extra stuff you have to

1715
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:53,039
deal with you know that like you don't

1716
01:10:50,439 --> 01:10:54,678
really anticipate so it's like it's

1717
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:56,479
definitely a hard year for farmers in

1718
01:10:54,679 --> 01:10:59,319
that area really feeling for him you

1719
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:01,079
know potent ponic has a question for you

1720
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:02,759
he says given all the fires how much

1721
01:11:01,079 --> 01:11:05,158
longer do you think the Emerald Triangle

1722
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:07,400
is really viable for long-term cannabis

1723
01:11:05,158 --> 01:11:09,119
production the climate is only going to

1724
01:11:07,399 --> 01:11:11,679
get worse do you think it will shift

1725
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:14,439
growing to the

1726
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:18,039
north you know it's just real question

1727
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:21,238
you know like uh uh it's hard to say you

1728
01:11:18,039 --> 01:11:25,039
know um I I I can't predict the future I

1729
01:11:21,238 --> 01:11:29,479
will say it doesn't like wildfires going

1730
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:33,399
away way anytime soon um you know I tell

1731
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:36,119
myself strike the same place twice

1732
01:11:33,399 --> 01:11:38,238
but actually did in that sense so like

1733
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:40,238
we had fire just to the south of us last

1734
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:42,439
year now it's just to the north of us

1735
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:44,919
and even with all that

1736
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:46,960
burn it's like there's still lots more

1737
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:49,840
to burn

1738
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:52,079
so it's hard you know do I think it's

1739
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,800
financially viable for big business to

1740
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:55,479
be in Humble County I don't even know if

1741
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:57,760
that makes sense to be honest like I

1742
01:11:55,479 --> 01:12:00,399
don't think big business belongs in

1743
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:03,960
Humble County in my eyes it's A Place

1744
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:05,559
for Mom and Pops like farmers who live

1745
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:08,319
here and they're so rooted in the

1746
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:12,120
community that like even with all this

1747
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:15,238
stuff leaving so it's like yeah I think

1748
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:17,198
cannabis will continue to go on

1749
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:21,399
personally because it's just part of our

1750
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:23,279
culture personally and tell can you tell

1751
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:24,759
us about some of your hype strains or

1752
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:27,960
something that did kind of turn out

1753
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,960
sweet this year and all

1754
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:32,920
that you guys are in Canada you're all

1755
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:35,079
talking like I like harvested weed and

1756
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:38,158
stuff already like it's only like

1757
01:12:35,079 --> 01:12:40,960
September like 18th over here I haven't

1758
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:42,960
chopped a single Branch like I had some

1759
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,639
people hitting me about the rain like oh

1760
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:48,079
I'm G to harvest it all like a lot of my

1761
01:12:45,639 --> 01:12:51,159
stuff like triggered later this year for

1762
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:53,519
whatever reason and I'm looking at like

1763
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:56,079
Halloween like you know November

1764
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,000
harvests and like luckily you can

1765
01:12:56,079 --> 01:13:00,198
usually get away with that in Trinity

1766
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,319
County um especially these last few

1767
01:13:00,198 --> 01:13:05,198
years last year was wet kind of went to

1768
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:07,079
[ __ ] quick but uh this year is looking

1769
01:13:05,198 --> 01:13:08,319
pretty good we got a storm going on

1770
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:10,119
right now that's calling for like a

1771
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:12,479
couple inches but I'm hoping it then

1772
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:15,760
kind of turns around and is nice for the

1773
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:17,919
rest of the season but uh again my my

1774
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,800
Farm's small I don't have a farm like as

1775
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,960
I always I have a garden so like I don't

1776
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,279
really have the stresses that like all

1777
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:25,880
my friends have like you know living in

1778
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:27,719
the heart of the triangle and balancing

1779
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:31,359
between humble and Trinity County you

1780
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:33,520
know uh everyone I know is a farmer um

1781
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:35,960
it's cool to get to walk their farms and

1782
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,840
see what they're up to and hear about

1783
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,198
their their struggles but like I'm going

1784
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,319
to be honest a lot of their struggles

1785
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:43,359
aren't my struggles like my thing just

1786
01:13:41,319 --> 01:13:45,639
not really of that magnitude that it

1787
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:49,079
really calls for that amount of stress

1788
01:13:45,639 --> 01:13:51,119
so um yeah that could be a teaching and

1789
01:13:49,079 --> 01:13:52,920
itself though you know what I mean just

1790
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:54,439
just hearing that you know you're going

1791
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,600
to be around doing the same thing in

1792
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:59,439
five years you know check yourself and

1793
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:01,000
what you're involved in so um that's

1794
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:03,158
cool though cuz sometimes it takes

1795
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,800
getting you know steps and everything to

1796
01:14:03,158 --> 01:14:07,000
get where you're going and everything

1797
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,320
but and I feel like that last question

1798
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:12,600
about you know is cannabis still going

1799
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:15,679
to be grown in the Triangle I just it

1800
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:19,480
it's the big question that Humanity has

1801
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:23,000
dealt with in migratory

1802
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:25,638
patterns of crops you know we've we know

1803
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,679
that corn has traveled all all over the

1804
01:14:25,639 --> 01:14:29,880
place and was it because corn was so

1805
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:32,399
popular or is it because you know

1806
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:36,319
different climates changed and soils got

1807
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:39,198
blown out or got flooded you know so

1808
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:42,039
it's an Ever Changing Earth it's it's

1809
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:44,079
part of the flow and I think that as

1810
01:14:42,039 --> 01:14:46,039
humans we're just seeing a really

1811
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:47,840
another big change in the earth who

1812
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:49,279
knows if it always happens or if it's

1813
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:52,760
something that's just happening right

1814
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:54,359
now but either you know hum humans are

1815
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:57,800
just always going to be chasing the good

1816
01:14:54,359 --> 01:15:00,639
soil and the good sun because we get our

1817
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:02,639
food from the earth and a lot of people

1818
01:15:00,639 --> 01:15:04,679
don't necessarily recognize that and now

1819
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:07,359
all of us recognize the importance of

1820
01:15:04,679 --> 01:15:09,520
medicine from the earth and I think

1821
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:12,039
Steve is right I mean there's a

1822
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:14,159
desertification yes sort of happening in

1823
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:17,238
Califoria it's crazy like it's amazing

1824
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:19,158
how how dry it can be down there but

1825
01:15:17,238 --> 01:15:22,000
I'll just say from a fire perspective

1826
01:15:19,158 --> 01:15:23,839
like British Columbia can get Gnarly

1827
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,600
with fires and we had one really close

1828
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:31,560
to our community re so you know it's it

1829
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,960
the fire thing is like a trees and okay

1830
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:36,199
so I think we should do less fire

1831
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,960
smarting but I don't know um hey Josh

1832
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:40,799
are you are can you hear Josh if you to

1833
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,719
say something Daniel go for it yeah I

1834
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,920
mean they're talking about the

1835
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:47,480
desertification in the west I mean we

1836
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,319
the logging of the planet you know here

1837
01:15:47,479 --> 01:15:52,000
in California there was an old growth

1838
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:53,519
rainforest and in the Western United

1839
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,960
States used to have eight times more

1840
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,120
surface water because of beavers

1841
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,520
and there and even where there are

1842
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,880
beavers there's not apex predators

1843
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,080
anymore but like so many beavers have

1844
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,679
been hunted for pelts or like the

1845
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:04,079
farmers in California like and some of

1846
01:16:02,679 --> 01:16:05,279
like the Central Valley area they took

1847
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:09,079
the Beavers out because they would mess

1848
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:12,238
with their um irrigation and

1849
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:14,399
stuff so yeah I mean it's it's wild what

1850
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:16,638
we have to deal with and FL and fire is

1851
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:18,479
one of the the roots of it but I look in

1852
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:20,880
the forest here you can walk I was

1853
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:22,359
showing my son bod and like I was like

1854
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,600
look at you know he was like how can we

1855
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:25,839
get the Creeks to flow more because the

1856
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:28,079
Creeks are dry except for the headwaters

1857
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,719
and I was showing him the the old growth

1858
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:31,679
stumps that were taken and they're so

1859
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:33,880
well spaced out and then we have this

1860
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:38,480
like thick

1861
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:39,800
forest um yeah and then I I gotta go

1862
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:43,399
definitely help my brother-in-law I just

1863
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,400
wanted to say that you know the the

1864
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:50,920
yo the guy I study from yoga nandas is

1865
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,400
the goal of yoga is to be unshakable

1866
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:55,480
amidst the crash of breaking worlds

1867
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:57,439
because it happens sometimes

1868
01:16:55,479 --> 01:16:58,599
and I would say amongst all the turmoil

1869
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:02,039
like I'm having one of the greatest

1870
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:04,639
heart openings of My Life um not not a

1871
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:08,279
Kundalini Awakening but a Kaa Awakening

1872
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:11,079
from the crown to the root and you know

1873
01:17:08,279 --> 01:17:13,479
this is a beautiful planet and we have a

1874
01:17:11,079 --> 01:17:14,559
way to go and I don't know when we're

1875
01:17:13,479 --> 01:17:16,959
going to get there I don't know if I'll

1876
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:19,000
be telling my grandchildren Grim fairy

1877
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,399
tales of the world that we grew up in

1878
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,039
but hopefully they'll be telling their

1879
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:25,638
grandchildren or somewhere down the line

1880
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:25,639
of the Seven Generations

1881
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:33,479
um yeah it's it is interesting in the

1882
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,719
change I mean

1883
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:38,039
now cannabis was like the last outpost

1884
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:40,560
and it's been we're all in the belly of

1885
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:44,439
the Beast now

1886
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:46,639
and oh it didn't oh no and then I'm I'm

1887
01:17:44,439 --> 01:17:47,919
not going out the back end we're gonna

1888
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:50,319
we're gonna all find a way to cut our

1889
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:52,199
way out of this and and and death is the

1890
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:54,119
soil that Roots life that's what I when

1891
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:55,638
I see the the the chaos in the world I

1892
01:17:54,119 --> 01:17:58,279

01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:48,158
time and then like when I seen him this

1932
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:51,079
spring and I was getting all his Puck

1933
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:56,158
crosses that I'm really excited about

1934
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:58,880
um go on sorry oh no I was saying yeah I

1935
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:00,559
was talking about this yeah I'm excited

1936
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,679
about those pucks um there's some really

1937
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,239
cool stuff in there that stuff's really

1938
01:20:02,679 --> 01:20:06,920
granular where um I really think there's

1939
01:20:05,238 --> 01:20:09,959
some like cash potential in a lot of

1940
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:11,920
those but uh so yeah he gave me another

1941
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:13,880
pack of that Citrus 25 it's like a

1942
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:16,279
Northern Lights cross that he thinks is

1943
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:18,319
hashy um I'm excited about those it's

1944
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:20,800
like orange TPS but they seem like

1945
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:22,439
they'll hash and the thing that I'm

1946
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,840
probably most pumped about is all this

1947
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:29,039
tally man stuff that a friend up in

1948
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:32,960
Oregon made um friends with archive but

1949
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:39,238
uh it's basically ton to Rainbow bels

1950
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:42,158
ton to uh that Asus that chmd gb6 tricks

1951
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:43,678
Ton's a dumper too yeah man they said

1952
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:46,799
there's is like an eight percenter

1953
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:49,440
supposedly man so uh I'm excited about

1954
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:53,560
those and uh they crossed it to the

1955
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:55,359
honey bananas and the jungle cake um

1956
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:58,679
there's some there's some cool crosses

1957
01:20:55,359 --> 01:21:00,000
there for sure it's you know I have them

1958
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:01,520
chucked out there I kind of just put

1959
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,238
them in this one patch they don't get

1960
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,920
really big or anything it's just like an

1961
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:06,718
opportunity for me to kind of like walk

1962
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:08,440
around and smell them and check them out

1963
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:10,079
hopefully find something cool in them

1964
01:21:08,439 --> 01:21:12,599
but yeah I'm really excited about the

1965
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:14,960
tan the tan honey bananas I'm sure

1966
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:17,199
that'll be fire I'm excited they smell

1967
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:18,920
good but yeah like I said they're

1968
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:21,158
looking like they're going to go forever

1969
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:24,600
man definitely going to be a long time

1970
01:21:21,158 --> 01:21:27,359
but I'm excited yeah no it sounds like a

1971
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:30,360
pretty tasty menu thank you [ __ ] I'm

1972
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:34,238
excited and I'm not even in the same

1973
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:35,359
country are you are you going to be uh

1974
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:36,759
because I remember last year I think we

1975
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:38,479
reached out to you last year about

1976
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:44,800
Legends and I don't think you were able

1977
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:44,799
to to come down um um

1978
01:21:56,679 --> 01:22:02,920
look it's hard to get out of the forest

1979
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:05,319
yeah well last year it was in November

1980
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:06,840
right by Thanksgiving and then now we've

1981
01:22:05,319 --> 01:22:08,960
for that reason we've kind of pushed it

1982
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:10,560
into the first the first weekend of

1983
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:14,239
December now so it gives people a little

1984
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:18,120
more time so yeah I'd love to I'll I'll

1985
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:20,439
DM you if and see uh please do please do

1986
01:22:18,119 --> 01:22:22,639
make the

1987
01:22:20,439 --> 01:22:24,759
pilgrimage hey Josh what kind of herb

1988
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:26,359
Are you standing standing in front of

1989
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,239
and welcome Craig we love you looking

1990
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:29,519
forward to hearing from you and coling

1991
01:22:28,238 --> 01:22:31,678
everyone we haven't heard from yet we'll

1992
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:35,000
try and just hit each up each

1993
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:37,480
person hey hey how you guys doing so so

1994
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,198
good to be here with y'all um I got some

1995
01:22:37,479 --> 01:22:43,079
actually some coffee right here I don't

1996
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:45,599
know if K is on the on the call but

1997
01:22:43,079 --> 01:22:47,238
uh G let them go a little bit longer but

1998
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,960
we're just getting dumped on right now

1999
01:22:47,238 --> 01:22:51,519
and they're just in the window a lot of

2000
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,760
our crops like perfectly in the window

2001
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,480
right now and you know I was going to

2002
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:59,000
freeze of it but that's what's cool

2003
01:22:56,479 --> 01:23:00,959
about just kind of the nice thing about

2004
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,639
hash for us is that we can kind of

2005
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:06,359
diversify our crop you know it's nice to

2006
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:09,159
do a little bit of Frozen and a little

2007
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:11,920
bit of a little bit of you know cured

2008
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:13,599
and just kind of play around with it we

2009
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,560
like to do a lot of our own genetics

2010
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,920
here and seems like people are really

2011
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:21,800
into like small

2012
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:23,119
batch rosin you know a lot of our stuff

2013
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:26,320
I mean I'm interested in things that

2014
01:23:23,119 --> 01:23:28,079
dump of course but a lot of times I'm

2015
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:30,719
kind of more into like what kind of

2016
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:35,039
flavors we can find that that's not out

2017
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:36,560
there that's you know small batch or or

2018
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:39,079
I guess niche as you could say because

2019
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:40,880
we've sort of been discovering with the

2020
01:23:39,079 --> 01:23:43,920
legal Mark with the new market and all

2021
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:46,560
this craziness you know if everyone's

2022
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,920
growing push mins you know the

2023
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,400
dispensary can't have like like five

2024
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:53,239
kushans from five different Farms but

2025
01:23:51,399 --> 01:23:55,119
you know if we have like a papaya Valley

2026
01:23:53,238 --> 01:23:57,238
goo nobody has

2027
01:23:55,119 --> 01:23:58,960
that um because a lot of times yeah a

2028
01:23:57,238 --> 01:24:01,079
lot oftimes people just want

2029
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,639
variety I mean I can tell you what's my

2030
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:06,479
favorite strain right now but it could

2031
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:08,319
change tomorrow or even if there's a

2032
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:10,359
strain I don't think I like maybe the

2033
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:12,238
next day it it works with my body

2034
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:14,000
chemistry in a different

2035
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:17,039
way

2036
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,679
um so we're just kind of playing around

2037
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:22,319
having fun just super Greatful to be in

2038
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:23,920
this position that H you know and have

2039
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:26,079
some recognition of being like in the

2040
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:28,760
Dem pure Community people always reach

2041
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:30,960
out to us and they like hey love what

2042
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:33,679
you do like love to support the demm

2043
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:36,198
community and it's always such a

2044
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:38,239
beautiful thing to hear that and we're

2045
01:24:36,198 --> 01:24:41,879
just putting one foot in front of the

2046
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:43,678
other just just keep going and I love

2047
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:45,560
this plant like Marcus was saying about

2048
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:48,359
the pizza man that resonates with me big

2049
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:50,159
time it's pouring out here but there's

2050
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:52,880
nowhere else I'd rather be than in the

2051
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:55,960
garden you know it's like it's fun and

2052
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:58,199
like wine it's like this is this is

2053
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,198
putting

2054
01:25:10,279 --> 01:25:16,079
a our genetics can hold up we might have

2055
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:18,359
like a little bit of mold here and there

2056
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:20,760
um but you know for the most part like

2057
01:25:18,359 --> 01:25:24,639
Josh you were saying healthy soil like

2058
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:26,800
regenerative ecology practices

2059
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:28,440
um you know for the most part I feel

2060
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:32,800
like the plant can really feel our

2061
01:25:28,439 --> 01:25:33,960
intentions and we get good yields even

2062
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,320
this year we were kind of wanted to

2063
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:39,359
scale down a bit and do most of the work

2064
01:25:36,319 --> 01:25:42,000
ourselves and keep it real real boutique

2065
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:44,118
style and it seems to be working out

2066
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,840
pretty nicely our kids are a little

2067
01:25:44,118 --> 01:25:51,439
older now so we're able to do like you

2068
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:51,440
know 95% of the work on our

2069
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:58,600
own and you are you uh Craig Craig is

2070
01:25:56,679 --> 01:26:01,679
are you working with Nasha and are both

2071
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:04,719
you working with Nasha or uh I couldn't

2072
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:06,719
remember if that was true nasha's

2073
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:08,760
nasha's been doing some uh I think they

2074
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:12,000
kind of stick to Humble we're in

2075
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:13,880
Mendo okay I've spoken with them they

2076
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,639
sound interested but it seems like we're

2077
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:19,679
not really in their in their uh

2078
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:21,079
radius but uh we yeah we do fresh frozen

2079
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:23,960
we've been doing fresh Frozen with a

2080
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:25,639
couple with surprise surprise we have a

2081
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:28,279
couple rosin

2082
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:31,199
out um and we might be working with a

2083
01:26:28,279 --> 01:26:32,238
couple other uh you know rosin companies

2084
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:35,599
this

2085
01:26:32,238 --> 01:26:38,238
year that's cool yeah it's it's it's

2086
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:40,920
cool to see uh a lot of the farmers up

2087
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:42,879
in the Triangle right now it's a really

2088
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:44,359
exciting time as a hash maker I'll say

2089
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,800
that just simply

2090
01:26:44,359 --> 01:26:50,238
because the nature of the market has

2091
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:53,719
people looking other avenues basically

2092
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:55,799
for you know more revenue and more than

2093
01:26:53,719 --> 01:26:58,118
ever people are diversifying like Josh

2094
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:59,920
was saying and freezing stuff work

2095
01:26:58,118 --> 01:27:01,839
looking to work with hash makers you

2096
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:03,880
know doing whatever they can kind of at

2097
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:06,159
this point so it's cool to see all the

2098
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:08,840
different people um now prepping

2099
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:10,118
material for it and it's just nice to

2100
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,159
see

2101
01:27:10,118 --> 01:27:15,639
um all the different hash genetics being

2102
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:17,679
made and there's a like exciting things

2103
01:27:15,639 --> 01:27:20,880
as Bleak as it is at times it's also

2104
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:24,679
exciting to me like I said currently to

2105
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:26,520
see all that's going on and uh it the

2106
01:27:24,679 --> 01:27:28,279
rain kind of makes things a little

2107
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:30,239
interesting as well because a lot of

2108
01:27:28,279 --> 01:27:32,198
people do do the fresh frozen where I

2109
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:34,718
feel like last year was like the first

2110
01:27:32,198 --> 01:27:36,879
year that we really experienced tons of

2111
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:38,719
rain during the Harvest and a lot of

2112
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:41,000
people were trying to freeze their their

2113
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:43,480
material and you know the material is

2114
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,118
sold by the fresh frozen pound and

2115
01:27:43,479 --> 01:27:49,039
water's heavy so that's got to be a

2116
01:27:46,118 --> 01:27:50,880
factor when you're buying material or

2117
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:53,359
you know working out some kind of split

2118
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:55,279
or whatever you're doing so uh it's

2119
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:58,118
always fun to see the challenges that

2120
01:27:55,279 --> 01:28:01,039
the rain adds last year it rained so

2121
01:27:58,118 --> 01:28:03,679
hard I feel like it kind of reduced some

2122
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:06,039
of my my yields overall when I was like

2123
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:08,039
scoping live plants the apex of the

2124
01:28:06,039 --> 01:28:09,719
plants had like less heads on them than

2125
01:28:08,039 --> 01:28:11,960
as you move down towards like you know

2126
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:14,399
the lower stuff but it was literally

2127
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:16,399
days on days of torrential downpour and

2128
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:19,000
the Sun never came back out and it was

2129
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:21,118
just a wrap so you know hopefully the

2130
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,198
storm passes and the weather gets nice

2131
01:28:21,118 --> 01:28:26,238
again but as Josh said it's just like

2132
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:27,919
parts of it it's parts of being a farmer

2133
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:30,000
where you'll just remember oh yeah that

2134
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:32,840
one year that rain came in the middle of

2135
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,679
September and there's always challenges

2136
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:36,800
they just always going to be something

2137
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:39,000
you know whether it's pests or weather

2138
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:44,279
it's just part of it and kind of keeps

2139
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:47,279
it exciting and nerve-wracking and all

2140
01:28:44,279 --> 01:28:47,279
that

2141
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:53,399
totally I uh I think I want to show a a

2142
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:57,000
real quick clip um because we're talking

2143
01:28:53,399 --> 01:29:01,238
about preparing ing material for

2144
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:02,600
um for the um for solventless extraction

2145
01:29:01,238 --> 01:29:03,919
and I'm I'm trying to figure out how I

2146
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:06,360
can do this

2147
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:08,960
without it it wants me to make it full

2148
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:12,039
screen but that's just way too big and

2149
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:13,960
then I can't uh see if I can make this a

2150
01:29:12,039 --> 01:29:16,719
little

2151
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:18,079
smaller no I cannot all right I'm G to

2152
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:22,880
try and share this anyway it's a very

2153
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:25,039
short clip this is McIntyre Farm in um

2154
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:27,480
British Columbia in the in in the

2155
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:29,960
Okanagan and this is them flash freezing

2156
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:31,519
their material on the field let me know

2157
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,880
if you guys can you probably won't be

2158
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,239
able to hear it but you should be able

2159
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,239
to see

2160
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:56,039
it he's talking about freeze drying the

2161
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:56,039
Cannabis as it comes off the field

2162
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,279
yeah those are like those cryo freezers

2163
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:03,920
I've seen some of those for sale from

2164
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:05,238
like the B days where people are kind of

2165
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,600
like trying to just get rid of them

2166
01:30:05,238 --> 01:30:10,238
where you can kind of come up on them

2167
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:10,239
for like a quarter of the price they

2168
01:30:10,359 --> 01:30:17,880
were leaves are the plants manicured at

2169
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:20,479
all I was gonna ask the same thing sub

2170
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:23,118
um to a degree I mean these guys still

2171
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:27,000
have a lot to learn let me just find

2172
01:30:23,118 --> 01:30:29,920
where we are here oh here we go stop

2173
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,600
sharing um you can check that out at

2174
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:34,480
McIntyre creek.com I just like the

2175
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:36,920
footage of the you know those those

2176
01:30:34,479 --> 01:30:38,559
little cryo uh conveyor belts of the

2177
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:40,800
plants going in yes they definitely

2178
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:44,360
could have uh

2179
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:46,119
um uh secured Trimm those leaves a lot

2180
01:30:44,359 --> 01:30:48,559
better but just the idea that there's at

2181
01:30:46,118 --> 01:30:50,039
least some companies already in the

2182
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,239
knowledge of understanding that

2183
01:30:50,039 --> 01:30:55,079
preserving volatile organic organic

2184
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:57,479
compounds is important you know and

2185
01:30:55,079 --> 01:30:59,920
we're we're a lot of people they ship

2186
01:30:57,479 --> 01:31:01,638
this stuff at room temperature they're

2187
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,719
they have no interest in making it cold

2188
01:31:01,639 --> 01:31:06,118
and this is one of the things we've had

2189
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:09,198
difficulty in Canada when the chain of

2190
01:31:06,118 --> 01:31:11,519
custody is with me my hash is at-20 to

2191
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:13,439
minus 40 degrees all the time like once

2192
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,239
I've made it it's in a freezer and it's

2193
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:17,079
just staying very cold and I'm

2194
01:31:15,238 --> 01:31:19,118
preserving those volatile organic

2195
01:31:17,079 --> 01:31:20,880
compounds the second it leaves my

2196
01:31:19,118 --> 01:31:22,519
facility unless I pay a ton of money

2197
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,520
sure I could probably get it shipped in

2198
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:26,760
a in a in a Reaper that that's that's

2199
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:29,119
cold um but what's going to happen is

2200
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:31,239
it's going to get to where it's going to

2201
01:31:29,118 --> 01:31:33,799
one of the provinces and then they're

2202
01:31:31,238 --> 01:31:36,238
just going to put in a warehouse and so

2203
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:38,159
there's been problems with that where

2204
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:40,479
people are growing decent cannabis

2205
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:42,079
people are making nice products with it

2206
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:45,559
and then it's sitting like going right

2207
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:48,039
from a freezer to like a you know 100

2208
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:50,280
degree Fahrenheit Warehouse because it's

2209
01:31:48,039 --> 01:31:52,600
the middle of summer uh and oh there's

2210
01:31:50,279 --> 01:31:54,158
been a problem with the barcode this is

2211
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:57,320
something that happened in my own house

2212
01:31:54,158 --> 01:31:59,479
the hash was like white gold colored

2213
01:31:57,319 --> 01:32:02,158
when I shipped it out and when people

2214
01:31:59,479 --> 01:32:03,839
were buying it it was like completely

2215
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:06,839
dark it literally cooked in this

2216
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:08,400
warehouse for three days um and then

2217
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:10,600
you've got to you've got to kind of deal

2218
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:13,238
with that lack of control in the chain

2219
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:14,920
of custody and it's it's kind of a big

2220
01:32:13,238 --> 01:32:19,118
deal like when you're talking about

2221
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:20,679
preparing your material for for Harvest

2222
01:32:19,118 --> 01:32:22,359
uh you know preparing it for the hash

2223
01:32:20,679 --> 01:32:24,279
makers versus the guys that are putting

2224
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:25,759
it into eights or pre-rolling joints

2225
01:32:24,279 --> 01:32:28,519
those are all different

2226
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:31,039
preparations but now you know we do what

2227
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:32,960
we do and there's no more of that CH

2228
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:36,439
like from the farmer to the hash maker

2229
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:38,480
we can really control the environment

2230
01:32:36,439 --> 01:32:40,559
that of which the Cannabis and the resin

2231
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:42,839
sits in but the minute we get it to

2232
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:46,119
Market you know I go into these stores

2233
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:48,440
in Canada and they all have their drinks

2234
01:32:46,118 --> 01:32:52,118
in coolers and these drinks have like 2

2235
01:32:48,439 --> 01:32:53,559
milligrams 5 milligrams 10 milligrams

2236
01:32:52,118 --> 01:32:55,799
and that's what they're choosing to use

2237
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:58,000
their cold space for to make these

2238
01:32:55,800 --> 01:33:01,039
drinks cold while the hashes and the

2239
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,880
flowers are all sitting at room

2240
01:33:01,039 --> 01:33:04,439
temperature and maybe they're sitting

2241
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,279
there for a while who knows it could be

2242
01:33:04,439 --> 01:33:08,399
weeks I don't know but by the time

2243
01:33:06,279 --> 01:33:10,079
someone buys it you know combined with

2244
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:12,198
the fact that for a very long time in

2245
01:33:10,079 --> 01:33:15,158
Canada people were buying very you know

2246
01:33:12,198 --> 01:33:17,279
we were regulated so you have to buy

2247
01:33:15,158 --> 01:33:19,279
packaging that is regulated you don't

2248
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:21,559
just get to pick what you like it has to

2249
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:23,439
be agreed by the government and the

2250
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:25,760
things they were allowing and regulating

2251
01:33:23,439 --> 01:33:27,919
were very poor packaging one one of them

2252
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:30,840
in particular was you know it was the

2253
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:32,440
seal on top of right here there'd be a

2254
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:35,039
little seal that go over it and that's

2255
01:33:32,439 --> 01:33:36,599
supposed to be sealing your jar of nugs

2256
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,479
and what would actually happen is the

2257
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:41,600
volatile organic compounds would

2258
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:44,638
pressurize inside the container and they

2259
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:47,920
would eventually consume the glue that

2260
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:51,000
was holding the the seal on just consume

2261
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:53,319
microscopic fissures that allow now this

2262
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:56,439
pressure to escape and these volatile

2263
01:33:53,319 --> 01:34:00,399
organic compounds to leave the container

2264
01:33:56,439 --> 01:34:06,079
while being replaced he's

2265
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:08,960
back froze yeah you got a Starly CER

2266
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:11,399
link where where where did I freeze off

2267
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:14,039
like you were like said the seal you're

2268
01:34:11,399 --> 01:34:16,000
talking about the seal the seal so that

2269
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:18,079
seal was getting consumed by the

2270
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,359
volatile organic compounds and pushing

2271
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,960
out you know the pressure of the jar I'm

2272
01:34:20,359 --> 01:34:24,079
sure you've seen it where it lifts up

2273
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:26,000
and Bubbles up those those compact those

2274
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:27,519
volatile organic compounds they're

2275
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,600
they're

2276
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:33,000
volatier and colder and so they they

2277
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:34,679
they would consume the the the glue or

2278
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,439
whatever material they were using to

2279
01:34:34,679 --> 01:34:39,279
stick that to the top little microscopic

2280
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:41,439
fissures would be blowing out the

2281
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:44,118
volatile organic compounds replacing it

2282
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:46,479
with oxygen and it was all giving a

2283
01:34:44,118 --> 01:34:48,479
really bad name to the to the people who

2284
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:50,319
were producing these products some of

2285
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:52,118
these people like from the black market

2286
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:54,118
that came to grow cannabis they just

2287
01:34:52,118 --> 01:34:55,839
wanted to get legal and immediately

2288
01:34:54,118 --> 01:34:58,759
started getting attacked like they were

2289
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:00,880
big licensed producers and there's very

2290
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:05,159
much a narrative in Canada that legal

2291
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:07,600
weed is shitty weed that there's no way

2292
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:09,079
that you'll ever make it good legally

2293
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,679
even though these people literally

2294
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:14,319
support every other industry in the

2295
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:16,199
world like where they buy their t-shirts

2296
01:35:14,319 --> 01:35:19,439
and where they get their food and where

2297
01:35:16,198 --> 01:35:21,519
they get everything happens the same way

2298
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:24,158
but for some reason we're very we're

2299
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:25,800
very you know and I get it very

2300
01:35:24,158 --> 01:35:27,759
sensitive when it comes to the cannabis

2301
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:31,400
plant that we've been stewarding for all

2302
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:33,920
of these years uh and so I still believe

2303
01:35:31,399 --> 01:35:36,039
that legal cannabis federally legal

2304
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:38,359
cannabis here in Canada can be good

2305
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:40,679
cannabis I've met enough cool craft

2306
01:35:38,359 --> 01:35:43,000
Growers at that unicorn cup I saw some

2307
01:35:40,679 --> 01:35:45,239
beautiful products uh but there does

2308
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:48,279
seem to be powers that be the same way

2309
01:35:45,238 --> 01:35:50,599
they're in California just trying to

2310
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:52,319
drive the industry into the ground

2311
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:54,480
trying desperately like they didn't

2312
01:35:52,319 --> 01:35:56,599
realize that like by jailing us for

2313
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:58,879
decades at a time and you know shooting

2314
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:01,840
our dogs and taking our children away

2315
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:04,239
and really going back to even in Cairo

2316
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:07,239
the the from the hash Church Legends of

2317
01:36:04,238 --> 01:36:10,479
carfour there wrenching out the sufi's

2318
01:36:07,238 --> 01:36:12,319
teeth with pliers if they had cannabis

2319
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:15,599
or hashish in their belly the hash

2320
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:18,359
eaters like none of these things work we

2321
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:20,719
never sto like those are the most like

2322
01:36:18,359 --> 01:36:22,679
what can you do to someone that is more

2323
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:24,319
personal than taking their children and

2324
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:26,719
wrenching out their teeth and putting

2325
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:30,079
them in a cage for a decade at a time

2326
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:32,039
none of that stopped us um I don't know

2327
01:36:30,079 --> 01:36:34,880
why they think trying to tank these

2328
01:36:32,039 --> 01:36:37,439
industries are going to stop us either I

2329
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:41,199
also like Daniel look at uh the you know

2330
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:43,638
the chaos as like compost we are seeds

2331
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:46,158
the more they try to bury us uh the more

2332
01:36:43,639 --> 01:36:49,480
we grow up through through the chaos and

2333
01:36:46,158 --> 01:36:51,599
uh and produce tasty loud things that

2334
01:36:49,479 --> 01:36:54,319
that attract people's attention they're

2335
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:56,920
not getting rid of us anytime soon so

2336
01:36:54,319 --> 01:37:00,158
that's my opinion we were born in the

2337
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:02,840
darkness amen that's right did anybody

2338
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:06,039
else find it ironic that you froze while

2339
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:08,319
talking about fresh frozen that was

2340
01:37:06,039 --> 01:37:11,800
awesome I did like that

2341
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:14,158
[Laughter]

2342
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:15,960
actually Harvest down there what's going

2343
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:18,719
on in Humble are you getting the same

2344
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:20,920
Raina how's the Coyote Blue looking

2345
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:23,319
what's your favorite hash for Idol this

2346
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:26,600
year and is naasha working out good

2347
01:37:23,319 --> 01:37:29,158
what's up love to your family always

2348
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:31,920
yeah yeah yeah good morning everybody

2349
01:37:29,158 --> 01:37:33,759
sorry I was late uh it was a good swell

2350
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:36,399
coming in so my daughter and I went and

2351
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:38,159
got some waves this morning um actually

2352
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:41,879
thought I'd see Gil out there and looks

2353
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:43,920
like he uh was here instead um but yeah

2354
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:48,239
Harvest has been going really really

2355
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:51,719
well um we run seven different cultivars

2356
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:55,158
so that gives us timing and that also

2357
01:37:51,719 --> 01:37:56,880
lets us over the we've learned that you

2358
01:37:55,158 --> 01:38:00,439
know what's it saying you can only pound

2359
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:03,800
so many pounds of crap into a 5B bag

2360
01:38:00,439 --> 01:38:05,759
well so many farms don't scale according

2361
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:10,239
to their drying space or their curing

2362
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:12,520
space so we have a limited space there

2363
01:38:10,238 --> 01:38:14,279
so we go with a different cultiv ours so

2364
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:15,440
they come off at different times so we

2365
01:38:14,279 --> 01:38:18,039
can really

2366
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:21,519
maximize um the full potential of our

2367
01:38:18,039 --> 01:38:24,439
farm so the Coyote Blue yeah we're done

2368
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:26,679
uh we took the second round yesterday

2369
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:28,799
and she's in I left like two plants out

2370
01:38:26,679 --> 01:38:30,560
there I always like to test a couple

2371
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:33,000
varieties that I see out there so I left

2372
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:35,400
two full plants see how they push on

2373
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,639
through the rain um but for the most

2374
01:38:35,399 --> 01:38:42,039
part yeah the barn is full and that's

2375
01:38:37,639 --> 01:38:45,239
ready um and Coyote Blue is not a hash

2376
01:38:42,039 --> 01:38:48,079
uh not a hash cultivar at all but we

2377
01:38:45,238 --> 01:38:50,000
have a really good flower market for it

2378
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:52,238
and um we're actually going to be doing

2379
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,800
some Coyote Blue gummies strain specific

2380
01:38:52,238 --> 01:38:57,879
gummies through soulful so super excited

2381
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:01,039
about that um and other things we're

2382
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:05,520
running is uh guava gift um through

2383
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:08,039
green source and um uh Kush Kirk so

2384
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:10,119
we've that's second year for that uh

2385
01:39:08,039 --> 01:39:11,760
Baron did really really well with our

2386
01:39:10,118 --> 01:39:15,039
rosin it was kind of like one of those

2387
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:17,840
outliers like it was like oh barely

2388
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:19,719
produced enough but oh my God after

2389
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:23,000
after it sat for a minute the turps were

2390
01:39:19,719 --> 01:39:25,359
just super super nice and after running

2391
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,639
through the whole season um through

2392
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:28,639
sales and everything

2393
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:47,880
that our flow market and dumps um uh

2394
01:39:45,599 --> 01:39:50,400
what else did we run of strawberry banan

2395
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:52,199
become a staple on our farm like first

2396
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:55,079
run we always we always run the

2397
01:39:52,198 --> 01:39:57,598
strawberry banana you know for our dep

2398
01:39:55,079 --> 01:40:01,479
run it's we're just running Cold Frame

2399
01:39:57,599 --> 01:40:03,520
hoop with uh pretty much nothing nothing

2400
01:40:01,479 --> 01:40:06,319
but uh infrastructure just to pull the

2401
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:08,520
cover so we pull off that run in like

2402
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:10,079
you know mid to late July and that

2403
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:13,199
strawberry banana you know that was

2404
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:15,319
breed for a hot house so um it comes off

2405
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:18,919
really good we'll we'll throw a shade

2406
01:40:15,319 --> 01:40:21,920
canopy over it to even uh keep those TPS

2407
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:24,480
a little more uh you know I have all

2408
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:27,079
these little things I do that in my mind

2409
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:29,000
I think they work right so I'll throw

2410
01:40:27,079 --> 01:40:33,238
some shade over that like two weeks

2411
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:36,000
before Harvest um and pull that one off

2412
01:40:33,238 --> 01:40:39,879
um what else did we run the first round

2413
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,279
um man my mind oh uh gush mint we had to

2414
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:43,760
do a little fill in because we couldn't

2415
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:45,960
get all the cultivars we wanted so we

2416
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:49,239
ran a little bit gush mins man that was

2417
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:51,399
phenomenal really really happy with it

2418
01:40:49,238 --> 01:40:54,079
um and then we ran a little double OG

2419
01:40:51,399 --> 01:40:56,799
cam just for our Flower Market

2420
01:40:54,079 --> 01:40:58,599
um and then this round the replant and

2421
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:00,440
we do our second round is a set it and

2422
01:40:58,599 --> 01:41:03,159
forget it we call it where we're not

2423
01:41:00,439 --> 01:41:05,319
doing any sort of deprivation um and the

2424
01:41:03,158 --> 01:41:08,479
set it and forget it round is papaya

2425
01:41:05,319 --> 01:41:11,279
bomb and rainbow belts so we're working

2426
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:13,479
closely now directly with um purple City

2427
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:16,960
genetics and those guys just put out

2428
01:41:13,479 --> 01:41:19,919
fire right so anything that's in our in

2429
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:24,719
our light up situation which is about

2430
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:27,079
2500 square ft is from clone and that's

2431
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:29,639
part of that program and then the other

2432
01:41:27,079 --> 01:41:33,840
7500 Square F feet of the farm is all

2433
01:41:29,639 --> 01:41:35,480
full season from seed um and it just

2434
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:38,679
this program has really worked well for

2435
01:41:35,479 --> 01:41:41,559
us we've been honing it and making sure

2436
01:41:38,679 --> 01:41:43,560
that if we run something um we can send

2437
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:46,119
some to our flower market and then the

2438
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:48,159
rest goes to Baron at Nasha and then

2439
01:41:46,118 --> 01:41:51,719
this is the first year we did just a

2440
01:41:48,158 --> 01:41:54,238
little personal wash last year with uh

2441
01:41:51,719 --> 01:41:55,840
simply Adam and that was phenomenal

2442
01:41:54,238 --> 01:41:57,238
really happy with that so that was our

2443
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:01,880
little taste of fresh

2444
01:41:57,238 --> 01:42:04,118
frozen and um Baron has us signed up for

2445
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:06,719
two larges and a small or two larges and

2446
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:08,399
a medium for freezers and everything we

2447
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:12,000
have we're going to do just a micro

2448
01:42:08,399 --> 01:42:14,638
batch that's fresh frozen and that's

2449
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,760
that's about as big as we can go and you

2450
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:18,880
know we know scarcity drives a market so

2451
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:21,400
our skew are flying off the shelf which

2452
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,880
is really good in this day and age but

2453
01:42:21,399 --> 01:42:25,198
that I say that's a big as we can go

2454
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:27,079
because Off the Grid right and we don't

2455
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:30,198
want to fire up a bunch of generators to

2456
01:42:27,079 --> 01:42:32,760
do this whole process where if we bring

2457
01:42:30,198 --> 01:42:35,039
those freezers onto the farm uh like a

2458
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:37,679
week before we need them we'll fill them

2459
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:41,760
with water jugs and get them get some

2460
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:44,158
bace in there and that way um we're not

2461
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:46,199
pulling a lot of power all at once and

2462
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:47,559
if we have a little hiccup in the night

2463
01:42:46,198 --> 01:42:49,759
where power cuts out because our

2464
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:51,920
batteries gave up it's not going to be a

2465
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:53,920
big deal and we're running the two bigs

2466
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:56,079
and the smalls so we can go in and out

2467
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:58,639
while we're harvesting into the small

2468
01:42:56,079 --> 01:43:00,599
move into the larges and the larges can

2469
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:02,159
even be loaded in the van and taken

2470
01:43:00,599 --> 01:43:05,000
straight and take out some of these

2471
01:43:02,158 --> 01:43:07,359
nuances of supply chain like Marcus is

2472
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,319
talking about but we're also feeling

2473
01:43:07,359 --> 01:43:13,519
what you're talking about Marcus like

2474
01:43:09,319 --> 01:43:17,158
the supply chain from from manufacturing

2475
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:18,639
from from the lab to the market you know

2476
01:43:17,158 --> 01:43:20,118
I don't know if Baron was on already he

2477
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:23,279
mentioned he was going to be jumping on

2478
01:43:20,118 --> 01:43:25,158
but man there's challenges like some of

2479
01:43:23,279 --> 01:43:26,759
the big Dro companies are like cutting

2480
01:43:25,158 --> 01:43:28,198
corners or doing the best they can and

2481
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:30,800
they send just a box truck and you're

2482
01:43:28,198 --> 01:43:34,559
like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

2483
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:37,480
back up man we can't do that so I think

2484
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:39,080
it's really what we've always felt

2485
01:43:37,479 --> 01:43:41,799
strongly about is working with our

2486
01:43:39,079 --> 01:43:43,719
retail partner that understands what

2487
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:47,159
we're trying to do and run these small

2488
01:43:43,719 --> 01:43:49,560
batches with the small Vans and really

2489
01:43:47,158 --> 01:43:51,839
nurture that market and we're finding

2490
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:54,639
that consumers are willing to drive past

2491
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:57,920
other shops to come to the shops that

2492
01:43:54,639 --> 01:44:00,199
care um so we're still the only place

2493
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:02,960
you can get our flow still only at

2494
01:44:00,198 --> 01:44:04,238
Soulful but our resin and pre-rolls you

2495
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:07,079
can get anywhere where're Baron's

2496
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:09,839
working you know Nasha extracts and

2497
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:13,840
we're keeping it in that Loop and and so

2498
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:15,639
far uh you know knock on wood but we're

2499
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:19,119
still grinding and we're still doing it

2500
01:44:15,639 --> 01:44:21,279
and we still got a smile on our face um

2501
01:44:19,118 --> 01:44:23,519
and that's you know pretty much the

2502
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:25,158
story we got going right now and you

2503
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:26,800
know a lot of the other guys I heard

2504
01:44:25,158 --> 01:44:28,439
talking this morning talking about the

2505
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:31,159
rain and the nuances you know that

2506
01:44:28,439 --> 01:44:35,839
identifies the Vintage right so when you

2507
01:44:31,158 --> 01:44:39,559
go you know 2021 that vintage was

2508
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:42,279
this right and and and and with resin

2509
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:45,280
and hash you know this is where hble

2510
01:44:42,279 --> 01:44:47,479
County mesino county is going to shine

2511
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:49,479
finally like we've been we've been

2512
01:44:47,479 --> 01:44:53,118
producing for resin

2513
01:44:49,479 --> 01:44:56,079
specifically um for five six years now

2514
01:44:53,118 --> 01:44:59,238
now and and we're just honing in our

2515
01:44:56,079 --> 01:45:02,519
skills even more and we just feel that

2516
01:44:59,238 --> 01:45:05,678
those plants that can have full season

2517
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:08,719
interacting with our toar and our living

2518
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:10,599
soils those are just a joy to work with

2519
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:12,599
and and baren seeing better and better

2520
01:45:10,599 --> 01:45:14,800
results than something that's like being

2521
01:45:12,599 --> 01:45:17,199
snapped out in two and a half months

2522
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:19,159
like like it's not the same it really

2523
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:22,319
isn't when you have that full

2524
01:45:19,158 --> 01:45:25,399
season uh potential of the all those

2525
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:28,479
turps and the plant and and that that's

2526
01:45:25,399 --> 01:45:31,638
it's working for us at least and um the

2527
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:31,638
other thing that that

2528
01:45:40,279 --> 01:45:46,158
Baron a lot of that is really important

2529
01:45:44,679 --> 01:45:49,000
like Baron kind of feels like Bell's

2530
01:45:46,158 --> 01:45:52,039
down in Mendo at Heritage you know

2531
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:54,800
they're handling meno Farms right and

2532
01:45:52,039 --> 01:45:56,319
and let those local

2533
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:59,920
ecosystems

2534
01:45:56,319 --> 01:46:02,519
evolve and let's not drive product way

2535
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:05,158
back up to Humble to wash it to send it

2536
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:07,040
back south right let's really work

2537
01:46:05,158 --> 01:46:08,960
within these ecosystems and support the

2538
01:46:07,039 --> 01:46:10,479
farmers that are you know within a

2539
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:11,880
shotguns blast of each of these

2540
01:46:10,479 --> 01:46:15,799
manufacturing

2541
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:17,000
facilities macrobiotic cash making yeah

2542
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:18,719
well it makes the product more

2543
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,679
affordable too like if you're not

2544
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:21,719
because if you look at it on the

2545
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:23,440
manufacturing side if the product's

2546
01:46:21,719 --> 01:46:26,760
getting transported all the way across

2547
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:29,279
state you've added like $1,700 to that

2548
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:30,880
load of material that's going to get ran

2549
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:32,238
that's all going to come out in the in

2550
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:34,039
the cost you know and what that's going

2551
01:46:32,238 --> 01:46:36,359
to be sold for so you're right I I love

2552
01:46:34,039 --> 01:46:37,679
that idea I've always like I support the

2553
01:46:36,359 --> 01:46:40,039
[ __ ] out of that because it makes so

2554
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:41,840
much more sense and and product grows

2555
01:46:40,039 --> 01:46:44,158
well in that area there's no shortage of

2556
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:45,760
manufacturers in the area no shortage of

2557
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:48,238
Distributors that can get it down to the

2558
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:50,560
shops from there so it really should

2559
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:52,319
work that way too you know yeah and one

2560
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:55,880
thing we've always done is we've we've

2561
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:57,759
always tried to look ahead as to when

2562
01:46:55,880 --> 01:47:00,239
we're going to need transport and we've

2563
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:02,960
never just worked with one company right

2564
01:47:00,238 --> 01:47:06,238
we always think of it is FedEx UPS who's

2565
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:08,319
going where when and when can we jump on

2566
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:10,399
when they're already doing something so

2567
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:12,479
we have Redwood Roots literally at the

2568
01:47:10,399 --> 01:47:14,799
bottom of our road and they've got air

2569
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:17,000
conditioned Vans ready to rock and I

2570
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:18,199
literally just sent a load to soulful

2571
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,639
and it's like hey when are you going to

2572
01:47:18,198 --> 01:47:24,279
Santa Rosa oh we're going Tuesday half

2573
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:28,359
hour charge right to go from A to B and

2574
01:47:24,279 --> 01:47:31,359
we just needed like a minus right so

2575
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:33,799
that that all helps shave the costs and

2576
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:37,639
and and support these Vans and these

2577
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:40,880
little micro distros so you know well

2578
01:47:37,639 --> 01:47:43,719
that that transparency in the scheduling

2579
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:45,239
allows you to to do business with them

2580
01:47:43,719 --> 01:47:47,840
you know and if they don't have that it

2581
01:47:45,238 --> 01:47:50,519
makes it really tough because then you

2582
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:52,000
know it's it's it's a service so yeah no

2583
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:53,360
believe me I deal with that logistical

2584
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,319
stuff all day long

2585
01:47:53,359 --> 01:47:58,920
it's

2586
01:47:54,319 --> 01:48:01,359
insane yeah yeah and you know I I would

2587
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:03,440
love to get product down the LA you know

2588

2591
01:48:07,198 --> 01:48:12,319
logistics happening in this market we're

2592
01:48:09,079 --> 01:48:15,118
in at this moment right maybe someday in

2593
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:17,880
time but at the moment Soulful is about

2594
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:20,920
to open up across from Golden Gate Park

2595

2596
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:25,800
scarcity drives our market and We're Not

Maine

2638

feel like you're doing more than just

2639
01:50:24,599 --> 01:50:29,760

out fing do yeah yeah just I'm here

2641
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:35,320
alone on the farm today but was doing

2642
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:38,480
some uh last minute pollinations select

2643
01:50:35,319 --> 01:50:41,078
pollinations before the rain comes in

2644
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:43,678
and a little bit of spot leap you know

2645
01:50:41,078 --> 01:50:44,679
checking and pulling before things come

2646
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:47,319
in on the

2647
01:50:44,679 --> 01:50:50,319
farm but yeah just been hunker down

2648
01:50:47,319 --> 01:50:52,198
going at it kind of small team Focus

2649
01:50:50,319 --> 01:50:55,719
this year trying to keep everything

2650
01:50:52,198 --> 01:50:57,479
really efficient and streamlined really

2651
01:50:55,719 --> 01:51:00,078
paying attention to the soil and the

2652
01:50:57,479 --> 01:51:03,198
cost down on it coming from the farm

2653
01:51:00,078 --> 01:51:07,439
kind of like simple diet for the plants

2654
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:09,678
and it's worked really well this year so

2655
01:51:07,439 --> 01:51:12,000
have some cool stuff to share you know

2656
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:15,599
later on when I see more of the Finish

2657
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:18,439
but uh we we kind of focused in on on

2658
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:21,400
our te rhythm with it for the season

2659
01:51:18,439 --> 01:51:23,559
besides healthy top dressing and refurb

2660
01:51:21,399 --> 01:51:27,000
of the beds we have good living soil

2661
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:29,520
after you know the five years here so

2662
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,359
excuse me so we've kind of paid

2663
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:34,520
attention to keeping the bioactivity

2664
01:51:31,359 --> 01:51:36,319
alive feeding the soil on a Continuum

2665
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:38,560
for the cost down where we really

2666
01:51:36,319 --> 01:51:41,639
weren't paying for much for outside

2667
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:44,520
input but local liquid fish inputs that

2668
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:47,960
we've kind of gone back to a more whole

2669
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:51,440
food diet with fish meal meets compost

2670
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:53,639
with a slurry checked in every week and

2671
01:51:51,439 --> 01:51:55,519
anyway kind of simple for cost down and

2672
01:51:53,639 --> 01:51:58,000
I'm seeing really good results from like

2673
01:51:55,520 --> 01:52:01,000
a well I call it surf and turf because

2674
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:04,039
just very simple once a week hit

2675
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,880
and yeah results are we carried great

2676
01:52:04,039 --> 01:52:09,599
health with the soil at the point that

2677
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:11,560
it was at through the year and uh so far

2678
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:13,760
for just a really minimal cost down and

2679
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:16,960
I'm happy with the health and we paid a

2680
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:20,360
lot of attention this year to the uh

2681
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:22,000
early onset plant cleanup with like uh

2682
01:52:20,359 --> 01:52:24,238
cleaning the bottom third of the plant

2683
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,238
really well early on three stages of

2684
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:29,158
cleaning

2685
01:52:26,238 --> 01:52:32,118
and yeah so a lot of stuff going on a

2686
01:52:29,158 --> 01:52:36,039
lot of new strains for hat and a lot of

2687
01:52:32,118 --> 01:52:38,319
new F1 spread actually already and uh

2688
01:52:36,039 --> 01:52:41,719
I'm kind of like paying attention to

2689
01:52:38,319 --> 01:52:44,439
some stuff when it comes to the well the

2690
01:52:41,719 --> 01:52:46,480
prime the really really loud tpin that

2691
01:52:44,439 --> 01:52:48,678
come up front noticing that they don't

2692
01:52:46,479 --> 01:52:50,559
necessarily always wash the greatest for

2693
01:52:48,679 --> 01:52:52,960
plants with the energy divided into the

2694
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:55,360
Tarpin up front really

2695
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:57,279
primary so I'm paying more attention to

2696
01:52:55,359 --> 01:53:00,279
some of the what maybe like a subtle

2697
01:52:57,279 --> 01:53:02,118
Nuance secondary turps that show up

2698
01:53:00,279 --> 01:53:04,880
where they're not as loud even up in the

2699
01:53:02,118 --> 01:53:07,118
mid flower but they seem to come in but

2700
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:07,960
not overpowering into the late session

2701
01:53:07,118 --> 01:53:10,238
of

2702
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:12,198
flower and I've kind of seen some other

2703
01:53:10,238 --> 01:53:14,439
cultivars that people are having success

2704
01:53:12,198 --> 01:53:18,359
with at a couple other

2705
01:53:14,439 --> 01:53:20,638
Gardens that uh seem to be that I like

2706
01:53:18,359 --> 01:53:23,000
that sticker just reading that

2707
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:24,760
Mark and uh

2708
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,639
that's going on at least when I did like

2709
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:27,840
the midflower check on some types that

2710
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:29,480
are fairly

2711
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:32,480
common

2712
01:53:29,479 --> 01:53:32,479
so

2713
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:36,880
yeah tasty treats what about when we're

2714
01:53:35,238 --> 01:53:39,479
always we still always talking about

2715
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:42,440
Tarpin but we know that some of those

2716
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:45,718
more funky intense smells are actually

2717
01:53:42,439 --> 01:53:48,000
thols and thoits are we are we getting

2718
01:53:45,719 --> 01:53:50,279
close to moving into volatile organic

2719
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,679
compounds are we still going to use tpin

2720
01:53:50,279 --> 01:53:54,439
as the lingo because I hear everyone

2721
01:53:52,679 --> 01:53:56,520
talking and I'm not against it I just

2722
01:53:54,439 --> 01:53:58,559
feel like after Nick dropped all that

2723
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:01,079
knowledge a year ago on hash church

2724
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:03,480
about thil and thoits and Esters and

2725
01:54:01,078 --> 01:54:05,279
esterfication of terpenoids and like

2726
01:54:03,479 --> 01:54:07,479
there's other things going on there and

2727
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:10,399
I get that there's this big percentage

2728
01:54:07,479 --> 01:54:12,479
that we're assuming is all tpin but I

2729
01:54:10,399 --> 01:54:15,000
wonder you know how important are those

2730
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:17,519
Styles and those styes and the volatile

2731
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:19,719
organic compound profile I know in the

2732
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:21,960
world of hops they're extremely

2733
01:54:19,719 --> 01:54:24,560
important um I wonder how important they

2734
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:27,198
are I mean skunk right skunk is a is is

2735
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:29,360
a is a couple of different sty that

2736
01:54:27,198 --> 01:54:32,319
create that that very strong smell I

2737
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:35,279
wonder how much of what we think are

2738
01:54:32,319 --> 01:54:39,319
tpin are actually different volatile

2739
01:54:35,279 --> 01:54:39,319
organic compounds just a

2740
01:54:39,639 --> 01:54:45,840
thought I have

2741
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:48,679
some I have some pure THS right now and

2742
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:52,760
I was thinking of repeating some of my

2743
01:54:48,679 --> 01:54:56,319
earlier work where I tested uh each of

2744
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:58,199
the individual tpin with a pure 25

2745
01:54:56,319 --> 01:55:06,238
milligrams of pure

2746
01:54:58,198 --> 01:55:09,479
THC and uh I suspect that the uh the

2747
01:55:06,238 --> 01:55:11,879
files I think there's a small chance

2748
01:55:09,479 --> 01:55:17,598
that they may contribute to the Synergy

2749
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:20,840
the way tpes do in in uh being able to

2750
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:23,119
affect the strength or possibly the

2751
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:25,639
modulate the effects

2752
01:55:23,118 --> 01:55:29,039
the type of subjective

2753
01:55:25,639 --> 01:55:31,880
effects I have some pure thigh alls now

2754
01:55:29,039 --> 01:55:36,238
skunkman Sam Quil who the [ __ ] else in

2755
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:38,760
this room would have said that that

2756
01:55:36,238 --> 01:55:40,678
sentence it's so ridiculous thank you

2757
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:42,920
for being you and you should Rec

2758
01:55:40,679 --> 01:55:46,440
recreate those do you realize that was

2759
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:48,639
like 22 plus years ago that you that you

2760
01:55:46,439 --> 01:55:54,598
did those experiments in your apartment

2761
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:59,599
it it it was it's hard to remember world

2762
01:55:54,599 --> 01:56:03,440
before uh the turine knowledge explosion

2763
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:06,199
because uh we we all had you we knew

2764
01:56:03,439 --> 01:56:07,919
some cannabis was better and we also

2765
01:56:06,198 --> 01:56:11,678
knew that a lot of the better stuff

2766
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:15,199
smelled better but nobody really really

2767
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:18,440
was able back in those days to show

2768
01:56:15,198 --> 01:56:20,678
scientifically that the uh the Tes in

2769
01:56:18,439 --> 01:56:22,919
fact can both modulate and some

2770
01:56:20,679 --> 01:56:26,679
potentiate uh

2771
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:27,480
THC and also AC Synergy with the other

2772
01:56:26,679 --> 01:56:29,760
can

2773
01:56:27,479 --> 01:56:32,359
avonoids well I feel blessed that I got

2774
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:34,400
to do that experiment with you almost 20

2775
01:56:32,359 --> 01:56:36,519
years ago in your apartments when you

2776
01:56:34,399 --> 01:56:39,598
pulled out all those pure can avonoids

2777
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:42,079
and all those tpes I just was like holy

2778
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:44,679
[ __ ] I am in the right place at the

2779
01:56:42,078 --> 01:56:46,279
right time I knew it was historical

2780
01:56:44,679 --> 01:56:49,039
while I was doing it the fact that it

2781
01:56:46,279 --> 01:56:51,800
was 20 years ago actually makes me feel

2782
01:56:49,039 --> 01:56:53,840
old um but it's awesome thank you for

2783
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:55,960
that and please do do that with the

2784
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:58,199
files and invite cool wonderful people

2785
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:00,599
from the community as you always do

2786
01:56:58,198 --> 01:57:03,039
because 20 years from now we'll be

2787
01:57:00,599 --> 01:57:07,480
talking about

2788
01:57:03,039 --> 01:57:10,158
that well they definitely are incredibly

2789
01:57:07,479 --> 01:57:14,319
more potent when it comes to

2790
01:57:10,158 --> 01:57:17,118
volatized and filling the room with a

2791
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:20,198
run over Dead Skunk type

2792
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:23,960
smell so skunkman if you could take one

2793
01:57:20,198 --> 01:57:28,158
thol with 25 milligrams of THC which one

2794
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:31,158
is it currently uh I I'd have to look at

2795
01:57:28,158 --> 01:57:35,759
my list together because pretty spaced

2796
01:57:31,158 --> 01:57:39,279
out and uh but uh the there is one which

2797
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:42,280
uh strongly uh I supect is and that's

2798
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:42,279
the one I have

2799
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:49,039
so dunk one is n butane one thol nane

2800
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:53,719
one file is one of the three that make

2801
01:57:49,039 --> 01:57:53,719
up skunk this is from Nick zegler

2802
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:58,320
yeah you say that to all the girls I'd

2803
01:57:56,479 --> 01:58:00,799
have to look on the bottle because I

2804
01:57:58,319 --> 01:58:05,000
don't remember off the top of my head

2805
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:05,000
and the sulfur compounds that you

2806
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:12,238
know warned over and over and over do

2807
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:12,239
not open this in my

2808
01:58:12,679 --> 01:58:17,480
house know I think so s so someone in

2809
01:58:15,719 --> 01:58:20,880
the in the audience who's really

2810
01:58:17,479 --> 01:58:23,439
knowledgeable sharf um is amazing human

2811
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:26,000
being who does a ton of research in tpes

2812
01:58:23,439 --> 01:58:30,238
um he's he's calling out a

2813
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:34,599
GC uh times GC Master spectrometer to

2814
01:58:30,238 --> 01:58:35,879
see everything and I think you know he's

2815
01:58:34,599 --> 01:58:37,840
calling out it right you know we just

2816
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:41,078
don't have the ability to see all these

2817
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:44,480
compounds and and quantify

2818
01:58:41,078 --> 01:58:47,198
them that's where Nick

2819
01:58:44,479 --> 01:58:49,158
zler yeah no it's it's we're on we're on

2820
01:58:47,198 --> 01:58:50,759
the right track right but I think what

2821
01:58:49,158 --> 01:58:53,198
shrief is calling out there's just not

2822
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:54,760
there's not an assay that's easily we

2823
01:58:53,198 --> 01:58:57,839
can't just like plug it in like we can

2824
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:59,960
right now with the other tping classes

2825
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:02,520
wish was here because he he spent a

2826
01:58:59,960 --> 01:59:04,599
decade doing this with hops and he he

2827
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:06,719
put multiple machines together he spoke

2828
01:59:04,599 --> 01:59:09,039
about it here in hash church it was like

2829
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:10,480
it was like to the trillion it was

2830
01:59:09,039 --> 01:59:13,679
beyond

2831
01:59:10,479 --> 01:59:16,519
the you can easily test for the for

2832
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:19,440
Theos it's no problem at

2833
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:23,119
all much less what happens once it's

2834
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:25,879
ignited those combinations or those new

2835
01:59:23,118 --> 01:59:28,238
volatiles that are created that aren't

2836
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:31,159
we aren't aware of yet but becomes

2837
01:59:28,238 --> 01:59:35,158
binders between the lung brain barrier

2838
01:59:31,158 --> 01:59:35,158
that creates a chemical reaction in the

2839
01:59:35,479 --> 01:59:42,118
body yeah I mean it's I yeah I'd love to

2840
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:43,880
have Z Nick on and then have also Sharif

2841
01:59:42,118 --> 01:59:45,559
as well chiming because he you know it'd

2842
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:48,679
be great to have this this conversation

2843
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:51,079
broader but um yeah well we can do it

2844
01:59:48,679 --> 01:59:53,520
maybe next week if you if uh if Shar

2845
01:59:51,078 --> 01:59:56,319
wants to get me his contact info I'm BC

2846
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:59,800
bubbleman icloud.com and I can reach out

2847
01:59:56,319 --> 02:00:02,039
to Nick uh and we can get into more of a

2848
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:03,719
of this volatile organic compound

2849
02:00:02,039 --> 02:00:06,039
conversation or at least let them get

2850
02:00:03,719 --> 02:00:07,158
into it and the rest of us can uh can

2851
02:00:06,039 --> 02:00:10,279
listen and

2852
02:00:07,158 --> 02:00:14,118
learn yeah no

2853
02:00:10,279 --> 02:00:16,359
doubt there is always down for that

2854
02:00:14,118 --> 02:00:19,559
there is no doubt that the files

2855
02:00:16,359 --> 02:00:22,519
contribute to the smell in uh when

2856
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:28,119
they're present but whether or not they

2857
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:31,119
contribute to the uh the medical and or

2858
02:00:28,118 --> 02:00:34,078
recreational value of canabus that's

2859
02:00:31,118 --> 02:00:38,078
that has yet to be shown are the are the

2860
02:00:34,078 --> 02:00:40,439
are they volatile um when air drying or

2861
02:00:38,078 --> 02:00:43,559
are preserved and freezing like like

2862
02:00:40,439 --> 02:00:46,719
everything else yes

2863
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:50,639
absolutely okay yes they

2864
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:53,920
are but not as well as tpin they're very

2865
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:53,920
very very vol

2866
02:00:54,800 --> 02:01:00,119
okay that's

2867
02:00:57,238 --> 02:01:03,759
interesting and Colin are you in New

2868
02:01:00,118 --> 02:01:07,559
York right now I'm uh in Massachusetts

2869
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:11,760
and I'll be in New York um on

2870
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:15,199
Wednesday so nice yeah yes and uh we

2871
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:19,599
were we are going to be speaking up by

2872
02:01:15,198 --> 02:01:21,919
Zoom at the organic Cup in New York okay

2873
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:24,639
because we're not gonna be able to go

2874
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:27,239
across the border um the way that they

2875
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:31,239
are right now and that's just the way we

2876
02:01:27,238 --> 02:01:33,598
we we felt like we had you know

2877
02:01:31,238 --> 02:01:35,158
um that it was open in a way that we

2878
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:37,199
were going to be able to do it but we

2879
02:01:35,158 --> 02:01:40,839
just don't feel like it is so that's

2880
02:01:37,198 --> 02:01:43,759
that's going to be um unfortunate um but

2881
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:46,360
but I we're also really excited about it

2882
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:49,440
though to support you know that movement

2883
02:01:46,359 --> 02:01:52,439
in New York and on the east coast and

2884
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:55,719
there's so many amazing people involved

2885
02:01:52,439 --> 02:01:57,839
and uh uh all the you know the Farms

2886
02:01:55,719 --> 02:02:00,800
that are coming down and the genetics

2887
02:01:57,840 --> 02:02:03,279
swaps and just the whole like focus in

2888
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:06,000
New York as it's blossoming you know for

2889
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:07,719
an organic cup is really really sweet so

2890
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,279

02:02:07,719 --> 02:02:13,239
out there yeah that's yeah it's gonna be

2892
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:15,960
great I've been waiting TW as you know

2893
02:02:13,238 --> 02:02:18,879
over 25 years for this to happen

2894
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:20,520
and uh you know it's it's going to be

2895
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:23,679
really cool because you know there's a

2896
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:25,679
lot of a lot of H Talent um that just

2897
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:28,679
wants to to come out and they want to

2898
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:30,840
talk just the same way that um I was

2899
02:02:28,679 --> 02:02:33,000
once scared to to share the things that

2900
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:35,000
I loved about all of it you know and the

2901
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:37,238
things that I was passionate about so I

2902
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:41,479
think we're going to see a lot of really

2903
02:02:37,238 --> 02:02:44,078
cool um just fresh ignited energy in

2904
02:02:41,479 --> 02:02:47,759
into the into the scene I'm excited for

2905
02:02:44,078 --> 02:02:50,599
that so you know and do you feel

2906
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:53,360
there'll be a mixture of indoor and

2907
02:02:50,599 --> 02:02:55,560
outdoor farming because of Northern New

2908
02:02:53,359 --> 02:02:59,279
York and and Central and all that what's

2909
02:02:55,560 --> 02:03:01,199
your thought on that yeah I mean um you

2910
02:02:59,279 --> 02:03:03,439
know you know and you guys were talking

2911
02:03:01,198 --> 02:03:04,919
about the the chir and and the the

2912
02:03:03,439 --> 02:03:06,839
Appalachia you know New York has

2913
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:09,000
microclimates as well there's really

2914
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:12,360
great pockets of of areas to grow

2915
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,960
cannabis and and other crops and um you

2916
02:03:12,359 --> 02:03:16,479
know it's been a really good season you

2917
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:18,279
know well it's not over yet but um you

2918
02:03:16,479 --> 02:03:20,039
we have to pay attention to the tropics

2919
02:03:18,279 --> 02:03:21,439
you know that this is the time to really

2920
02:03:20,039 --> 02:03:23,760
pay attention to Africa and what's going

2921
02:03:21,439 --> 02:03:25,839
to rip off of there and go through and

2922
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:28,360
up the coast and then that'll eventually

2923
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:30,400
hit us so I've you know over the years

2924
02:03:28,359 --> 02:03:33,319
been trained to kind of look at that but

2925
02:03:30,399 --> 02:03:34,879
um it's you know the next week we have a

2926
02:03:33,319 --> 02:03:36,639
hurricane that's kind of forming right

2927
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:39,480
now and we'll see what happens with that

2928
02:03:36,639 --> 02:03:41,239
but you know now until October 10th is

2929
02:03:39,479 --> 02:03:43,799
kind of the the time that makes the

2930
02:03:41,238 --> 02:03:45,118
breaks you know a good season so you

2931
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:47,199
know there's a lot to be seen But thus

2932
02:03:45,118 --> 02:03:51,319
far it's been a really good season not a

2933
02:03:47,198 --> 02:03:53,519
lot of rain um it's been really good so

2934
02:03:51,319 --> 02:03:56,840
this is kind of like a a picturesque

2935
02:03:53,520 --> 02:04:00,199
season for for the East Coast outdoor um

2936
02:03:56,840 --> 02:04:01,800
and in terms of just uh what type of

2937
02:04:00,198 --> 02:04:03,439
growing Styles we're GNA see I think

2938
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:06,320
we're going to see a bunch it's it's New

2939
02:04:03,439 --> 02:04:08,039
York New York is going to be imagine you

2940
02:04:06,319 --> 02:04:09,880
know the way I kind of look at at

2941
02:04:08,039 --> 02:04:11,599
cannabis in New York is like if I could

2942
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:14,039
imagine the streets in New York and all

2943
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:15,440
the different types of people that's the

2944
02:04:14,039 --> 02:04:18,559
kind of growing styles that we're going

2945
02:04:15,439 --> 02:04:19,879
to kind of emerge out of all this and um

2946
02:04:18,559 --> 02:04:21,760
you know we're going to see a lot of

2947
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:24,319
that personality come through and it'll

2948
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:27,199
have its own kind of you know its own

2949
02:04:24,319 --> 02:04:29,880
voice and each each kind of uh

2950
02:04:27,198 --> 02:04:31,919
style so it's it's cool I'm really

2951
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:34,400
excited man I'm

2952
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:37,239
I'm I'm really excited to see what what

2953
02:04:34,399 --> 02:04:38,558
people bring and people pay attention to

2954
02:04:37,238 --> 02:04:41,238
different things in different parts of

2955
02:04:38,559 --> 02:04:43,320
the world so you know I'm curious to see

2956
02:04:41,238 --> 02:04:46,678
what people are looking looking at right

2957
02:04:43,319 --> 02:04:49,479
now yeah definitely and and and just

2958
02:04:46,679 --> 02:04:51,319
with uh the way that smoking is in the

2959
02:04:49,479 --> 02:04:55,279
city right now I think it's like a lot

2960
02:04:51,319 --> 02:04:57,679
of fun for people to to go to the city

2961
02:04:55,279 --> 02:04:59,679
um and be able to just smoke anywhere

2962
02:04:57,679 --> 02:05:02,440
and and you know the smoking clubs I

2963
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:04,599
know the aster Club is a lot of fun Liz

2964
02:05:02,439 --> 02:05:06,719
has talked about going there a lot and

2965
02:05:04,599 --> 02:05:09,719
uh you know some of those smoking clubs

2966
02:05:06,719 --> 02:05:11,760
are you know a lot of fun and so it'll

2967
02:05:09,719 --> 02:05:14,279
be cool to see you know what that

2968
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:15,920
experience is like for people yeah

2969
02:05:14,279 --> 02:05:18,639
that's and there you know historically

2970
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:20,279
people have have gotten you know high

2971
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:22,679
quality cannabis in New York for a long

2972
02:05:20,279 --> 02:05:25,359
time for decades there's been always a

2973
02:05:22,679 --> 02:05:28,880
scene there I'm sure Sam can speak on

2974
02:05:25,359 --> 02:05:30,679
that but it's you know um I'm excited

2975
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:33,440
I'm excited to see the diversity you

2976
02:05:30,679 --> 02:05:35,158
know that's the exciting part for me

2977
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:37,960
it's just seeing all the people that are

2978
02:05:35,158 --> 02:05:40,078
like you know maybe I knew them you know

2979
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:44,760
and we just weren't talking about it

2980
02:05:40,078 --> 02:05:46,078
together you know so um that's uh I

2981
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:48,280
think that's the coolest part and then I

2982
02:05:46,078 --> 02:05:50,279
want to see you know just the what

2983
02:05:48,279 --> 02:05:52,279
people are doing in terms of cultivation

2984
02:05:50,279 --> 02:05:54,559
I know a lot of the Farms right now are

2985
02:05:52,279 --> 02:05:57,279
just doing Outdoors some people have had

2986
02:05:54,559 --> 02:05:59,000
the time and the infrastructure to build

2987
02:05:57,279 --> 02:06:03,000
green houses but not too many of them

2988
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:05,599
are actually doing that so um and how is

2989
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:07,840
that is there hash processors and people

2990
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:12,000
like starting to look for farms for

2991
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:14,159
resin or or uh what do you see there not

2992
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,439
yet I think it's really early and you

2993
02:06:14,158 --> 02:06:18,679
know we don't know what the testing's

2994
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:20,158
going to look like yet here um we don't

2995
02:06:18,679 --> 02:06:23,118
I know I'm sure people are putting

2996
02:06:20,158 --> 02:06:24,399
things aside for fresh Frozen but um we

2997
02:06:23,118 --> 02:06:26,118
don't know what the testing is looking

2998
02:06:24,399 --> 02:06:28,479
like so we've no there's just there's so

2999
02:06:26,118 --> 02:06:30,319
many unknowns a lot of the stuff the

3000
02:06:28,479 --> 02:06:33,198
guidance hasn't really been given out so

3001
02:06:30,319 --> 02:06:34,759
that's the scary part about where the I

3002
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:36,359
think the state's at right now is that

3003
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:38,159
there's a lot of people have invested a

3004
02:06:36,359 --> 02:06:41,960
lot of time and money into things and I

3005
02:06:38,158 --> 02:06:44,319
think it's fresh frozen for a new market

3006
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:46,719
like this unless you're you're

3007
02:06:44,319 --> 02:06:48,000
experienced I think it's a scary thing

3008
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:50,279
so it's not I don't know if it's going

3009
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:52,719
to be and plus if I really do the math

3010
02:06:50,279 --> 02:06:54,679
on how many AC are being grown versus

3011
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:58,039
how many people are in in population

3012
02:06:54,679 --> 02:07:00,840
there there's not nearly enough um you

3013
02:06:58,039 --> 02:07:02,840
know if you really break that down so

3014
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:05,239
I've spoken to a few groups in New York

3015
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:07,199
who are you know you're right it's

3016
02:07:05,238 --> 02:07:09,238
beyond early like they don't even really

3017
02:07:07,198 --> 02:07:11,118
have their licensing let alone like

3018
02:07:09,238 --> 02:07:12,718
funding or building but you know the

3019
02:07:11,118 --> 02:07:16,279
people that do have the infrastructure

3020
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:18,158
that kind of already grow even just hemp

3021
02:07:16,279 --> 02:07:20,000
they're they're definitely you know

3022
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:20,960
talking about getting equipment you know

3023
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,118
I've been talking to them through

3024
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:25,158
Whistler Tech technology and kind of

3025
02:07:23,118 --> 02:07:27,279
just getting them prepared for an

3026
02:07:25,158 --> 02:07:29,118
existence where you know someone said it

3027
02:07:27,279 --> 02:07:31,679
earlier on I think it was ganja Gill you

3028
02:07:29,118 --> 02:07:34,439
know you have to um you have to find

3029
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:36,599
these elusive pockets of

3030
02:07:34,439 --> 02:07:39,238
profitability um you have to be able to

3031
02:07:36,599 --> 02:07:41,639
figure out ways that are maybe it's not

3032
02:07:39,238 --> 02:07:44,078
quite as easy as it used to be it used

3033
02:07:41,639 --> 02:07:46,039
to be real easy which created a soft

3034
02:07:44,078 --> 02:07:47,639
environment now people are in this

3035
02:07:46,039 --> 02:07:50,519
harder environment and they're working

3036
02:07:47,639 --> 02:07:52,359
much harder for much less payoffs and

3037
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:53,960
it's just um

3038
02:07:52,359 --> 02:07:55,639
yeah I see them I see them gearing up

3039
02:07:53,960 --> 02:07:57,520
and getting ready but you're right it's

3040
02:07:55,639 --> 02:08:00,118
very early what does it happen after

3041
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:02,760
January the licensing will be

3042
02:08:00,118 --> 02:08:04,558
announced no that's further out that's

3043
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:07,239
that's the thing like you have to you

3044
02:08:04,559 --> 02:08:11,279
know it's it's hard to really explain

3045
02:08:07,238 --> 02:08:14,598
but um you know take everything that's

3046
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:16,198
been said and you know it's elongated so

3047
02:08:14,599 --> 02:08:18,800
we're looking at May of next year for

3048
02:08:16,198 --> 02:08:20,919
that real the real guidance for like the

3049
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:23,840
not just the conditional licenses that's

3050
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:27,440
next year like middle of next year maybe

3051
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:29,920
May um maybe May is the soonest that

3052
02:08:27,439 --> 02:08:31,919
it'll come for new guidance on like

3053
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:33,679
actual like cultivation licenses and

3054
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:34,480
micro businesses because right now I'm

3055
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:37,760
actually

3056
02:08:34,479 --> 02:08:39,839
giving um some you know comments on the

3057
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:42,360
micro business licensing right now and I

3058
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:44,400
think that you know that could be really

3059
02:08:42,359 --> 02:08:46,078
interesting you know there's some cool

3060
02:08:44,399 --> 02:08:49,000
paths that could be built through that

3061
02:08:46,078 --> 02:08:50,799
structure that they're allowing um but

3062
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:52,920
the the conditional we have to remind

3063
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:54,239
ourselves the these two years right now

3064
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:56,359
this 18 months or whatever you want to

3065
02:08:54,238 --> 02:08:58,638
call it this is just a conditional this

3066
02:08:56,359 --> 02:09:00,479
is not a guarantee this is just like

3067
02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:03,000
here's an opportunity to use your

3068
02:09:00,479 --> 02:09:05,238
acreage right now for a stop Gap and

3069
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:07,639
it'll help us and give you an

3070
02:09:05,238 --> 02:09:09,919
opportunity to try this try this out so

3071
02:09:07,639 --> 02:09:12,440
I don't know even know how many of these

3072
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:16,279
conditionals even actually poured over

3073
02:09:12,439 --> 02:09:17,919
into real licenses you know because that

3074
02:09:16,279 --> 02:09:20,078
you know the the

3075
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:21,679
license you know the whole structure of

3076
02:09:20,078 --> 02:09:24,920
all this is just still actually super

3077
02:09:21,679 --> 02:09:27,520
infant you know I hope a lot of them you

3078
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:30,440
know transfer over so we just don't know

3079
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:32,559
who will actually want to you know I was

3080
02:09:30,439 --> 02:09:35,000
going to share something that it's been

3081
02:09:32,559 --> 02:09:37,679
said a few different ways um but I'll

3082
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:39,359
share it in a way that somebody just

3083
02:09:37,679 --> 02:09:42,800
shared it with me a couple months ago

3084
02:09:39,359 --> 02:09:47,000
and that is good times make for soft

3085
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:49,920
humans soft humans make for Hard Times

3086
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:51,960
Hard Times make for strong humans and

3087
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:54,000
the cycle repeats itself

3088
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:55,880
yeah so we're in that time right now

3089
02:09:54,000 --> 02:10:00,800
right we just came off with some really

3090
02:09:55,880 --> 02:10:04,279
good times couple decades slay it um and

3091
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:05,719
now now now the the strong are going to

3092
02:10:04,279 --> 02:10:08,559
swim their way to the

3093
02:10:05,719 --> 02:10:10,239
surface and um hopefully help pull this

3094
02:10:08,559 --> 02:10:11,800
whole community Through you know this

3095
02:10:10,238 --> 02:10:16,000
community when I say not just here in

3096
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:17,760
Humble but like our Global Community um

3097
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,840
and it's moments like this where we can

3098
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:21,320
all reach out and discuss our our

3099
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:22,960
triumphs and our wins and our success

3100
02:10:21,319 --> 02:10:25,359
successes and our fails really helps

3101
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:27,599
bring us all together and G gives us

3102
02:10:25,359 --> 02:10:30,238
allies right like I love it I love

3103
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:32,319
hearing you know little Whispers of

3104
02:10:30,238 --> 02:10:34,158
things that are happening you know with

3105
02:10:32,319 --> 02:10:35,960
someone I'm with or someone that someone

3106
02:10:34,158 --> 02:10:38,118
else is with and oh I know them and they

3107
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:40,158
know them and we're doing something or

3108
02:10:38,118 --> 02:10:44,399
they're doing something and that's all

3109
02:10:40,158 --> 02:10:46,960
exciting so I just appreciate all of you

3110
02:10:44,399 --> 02:10:49,279
and and Marcus I appreciate you bringing

3111
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:53,039
this show together for sure it's always

3112
02:10:49,279 --> 02:10:55,279
a pleasure yeah man super super stoked

3113
02:10:53,039 --> 02:10:57,000
uh potent po potent ponic says people in

3114
02:10:55,279 --> 02:10:58,000
New Markets unfortunately don't

3115
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,800
understand why the higher-end

3116
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,238
concentrates are worth more that's the

3117
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:03,199
biggest issue with the higher-end

3118
02:11:01,238 --> 02:11:05,959
product just educating consumers on

3119
02:11:03,198 --> 02:11:07,598
quality so I'll speak to this you know

3120
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:10,039
when you hear him say that he's not

3121
02:11:07,599 --> 02:11:13,000
talking about our inner community of

3122
02:11:10,039 --> 02:11:15,359
Hardcore hash heads he's talking about

3123
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:18,279
the people who are inevitably going to

3124
02:11:15,359 --> 02:11:19,920
be the future users of cannabis a lot of

3125
02:11:18,279 --> 02:11:22,039
them have never used cannabis or

3126
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:24,000
dabbling in it now you know here in

3127
02:11:22,039 --> 02:11:26,078
Canada it's the 60 plus percent of

3128
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:28,118
people who don't use cannabis who aren't

3129
02:11:26,078 --> 02:11:29,840
using cannabis that the Cannabis

3130
02:11:28,118 --> 02:11:31,519
industry is sort of trying to say hey

3131
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:33,199
check this out like it's a better option

3132
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:35,360
than alcohol it's not going to cause you

3133
02:11:33,198 --> 02:11:37,078
all these different Health ramifications

3134
02:11:35,359 --> 02:11:39,558
it's a preventative medicine even though

3135
02:11:37,078 --> 02:11:41,399
we're not allowed to say that right now

3136
02:11:39,559 --> 02:11:44,159
like all of these different things and

3137
02:11:41,399 --> 02:11:47,799
how how um yeah it's just it's it's a

3138
02:11:44,158 --> 02:11:50,679
unique situation um what he's saying is

3139
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:52,599
very true what I found is I can you know

3140
02:11:50,679 --> 02:11:54,480
try and release relase a five-star

3141
02:11:52,599 --> 02:11:56,599
bubble hash or a six-star bubble hash

3142
02:11:54,479 --> 02:11:58,598
out there but the people who would

3143
02:11:56,599 --> 02:12:00,840
rather criticize me for releasing

3144
02:11:58,599 --> 02:12:03,039
products that they have no interest in

3145
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:05,199
you know dry sifted products pure hash

3146
02:12:03,039 --> 02:12:06,840
joints or the hash hits that we're doing

3147
02:12:05,198 --> 02:12:09,439
which are built for convenience and more

3148
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:11,559
importantly buil to build a bridge to

3149
02:12:09,439 --> 02:12:13,319
that 60% of people who are going to buy

3150
02:12:11,559 --> 02:12:15,039
a pre-rolled joint they don't even have

3151
02:12:13,319 --> 02:12:18,399
rolling papers they literally have a

3152
02:12:15,039 --> 02:12:20,479
lighter as their only means of uh

3153
02:12:18,399 --> 02:12:22,158
paraphernalia we wanted to create a

3154
02:12:20,479 --> 02:12:24,039
product for them that could build a

3155
02:12:22,158 --> 02:12:26,679
little Bridge so they could kind of come

3156
02:12:24,039 --> 02:12:29,238
on over to the extract world and just

3157
02:12:26,679 --> 02:12:30,599
check it out and believe it or not if

3158
02:12:29,238 --> 02:12:33,678
you want to get their attention you

3159
02:12:30,599 --> 02:12:35,559
don't do it with six-star [ __ ] bubble

3160
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:37,679
that [ __ ] will terrify them that's like

3161
02:12:35,559 --> 02:12:39,239
being like hey straight person come try

3162
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:41,158
this IA waska for the first time it's

3163
02:12:39,238 --> 02:12:44,399
gonna be really fun here drink drink an

3164
02:12:41,158 --> 02:12:47,558
extra cup you got to take them in

3165
02:12:44,399 --> 02:12:49,558
slow and so just even like what we think

3166
02:12:47,559 --> 02:12:51,480
of as like you know a dry shifted hash

3167
02:12:49,559 --> 02:12:53,480
it's like a single screen hash my God

3168
02:12:51,479 --> 02:12:58,118
Sam would call that a farmer's grade

3169
02:12:53,479 --> 02:13:00,439
hash um it's not what we are looking for

3170
02:12:58,118 --> 02:13:02,598
but it is a great way to create a little

3171
02:13:00,439 --> 02:13:05,118
bridge where someone can you know smoke

3172
02:13:02,599 --> 02:13:08,239
a little bit of hash instead of that

3173
02:13:05,118 --> 02:13:09,558
paper and glue and and maybe flour

3174
02:13:08,238 --> 02:13:10,799
that's not even that good because they

3175
02:13:09,559 --> 02:13:12,719
don't know the industry and they're

3176
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:15,239
buying pre-rolls from the wrong company

3177
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:17,960
and it's Mill and it's dried out and it

3178
02:13:15,238 --> 02:13:20,158
lacks TPS and you know the I just want

3179
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:22,319
to make a better experience for people

3180
02:13:20,158 --> 02:13:25,960
who are coming into into this to get

3181
02:13:22,319 --> 02:13:28,158
turned on to something that's special uh

3182
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:31,078
and if that can lead them to that full

3183
02:13:28,158 --> 02:13:32,719
melt bubble and then they can understand

3184
02:13:31,078 --> 02:13:34,719
instead of have no understanding well

3185
02:13:32,719 --> 02:13:37,439
they're standing down here trying to get

3186
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:39,480
up here and we're not building the steps

3187
02:13:37,439 --> 02:13:41,919
for them to get up here we're expecting

3188
02:13:39,479 --> 02:13:44,078
them to do this giant jump and they're

3189
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:45,960
not going to do that regardless of how

3190
02:13:44,078 --> 02:13:47,519
we want it to be and in reality is that

3191
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:49,359
really how you want to turn people on to

3192
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:51,760
like the most beautiful like just

3193
02:13:49,359 --> 02:13:54,439
strongest most purest

3194
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:58,239
uh you know representation of the plants

3195
02:13:54,439 --> 02:14:01,118
the cold water and ice extracted you

3196
02:13:58,238 --> 02:14:03,198
know resin or dry sifted resin that's

3197
02:14:01,118 --> 02:14:06,558
clean to the same level those are like

3198
02:14:03,198 --> 02:14:09,198
up at the same Podium when people can't

3199
02:14:06,559 --> 02:14:12,079
just go there right away I'm very much

3200
02:14:09,198 --> 02:14:14,238
the the I'm very much into giving people

3201
02:14:12,078 --> 02:14:16,319
micro dabs I'm very much into trying to

3202
02:14:14,238 --> 02:14:18,839
give someone an experience where they

3203
02:14:16,319 --> 02:14:20,679
can still try but it's micro and I've

3204
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:22,719
done this for you know 80 plus year old

3205
02:14:20,679 --> 02:14:24,118
people it's like the smallest I'm like

3206
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:26,039
trust me you're going to barely blow

3207
02:14:24,118 --> 02:14:28,479
anything out but you'll have the taste

3208
02:14:26,039 --> 02:14:30,800
you'll experience and more importantly

3209
02:14:28,479 --> 02:14:32,959
they'll get over this real fear that

3210
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:36,400
isn't discussed or talked about that

3211
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:40,000
people have about getting too high off

3212
02:14:36,399 --> 02:14:42,719
of cannabis it's a powerful energy and

3213
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:44,679
some people it's just too much to take

3214
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:46,399
them to the moon on that rocket ship

3215
02:14:44,679 --> 02:14:48,840
ride like how about hold their hand and

3216
02:14:46,399 --> 02:14:51,238
walk them around the the coast of the

3217
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:53,400
ocean down the beach for the first time

3218
02:14:51,238 --> 02:14:55,638
and then maybe we'll dwell into the

3219
02:14:53,399 --> 02:14:57,960
forest and eventually you know climb

3220
02:14:55,639 --> 02:14:59,760
into the Alpine and Peak the mountain

3221
02:14:57,960 --> 02:15:02,319
but like holy [ __ ] don't take them up

3222
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:07,280
there for a flight your their first

3223
02:15:02,319 --> 02:15:10,558
their first time it Marcus it also helps

3224
02:15:07,279 --> 02:15:14,319
if because a lot of people that I knew

3225
02:15:10,559 --> 02:15:18,800
that had not ever smoked and I may or

3226
02:15:14,319 --> 02:15:21,279
may not have been introduce them was uh

3227
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:24,000
vaporization helps because they don't

3228
02:15:21,279 --> 02:15:28,960
like combustion most of them don't smoke

3229
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:31,279
cigarettes and uh yeah vaporization

3230
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:34,279
small little dab hits like you're

3231
02:15:31,279 --> 02:15:37,198
talking about vaporization really makes

3232
02:15:34,279 --> 02:15:40,840
it easy for them to try it without you

3233
02:15:37,198 --> 02:15:43,960
know flipping out or anything but let me

3234
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:46,920
add to this you're right if they if I

3235

02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:21,439
hash while you're waiting for your pizza

3365
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,439
to be uh

3366
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:28,000
these are my two love bring the tomato

3367
02:21:23,719 --> 02:21:29,760
sauce sign me up you know seeing all

3368
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:32,159
like seeing all this flour is amazing

3369
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:34,960
and like the consumers at the moment

3370
02:21:32,159 --> 02:21:38,478
have to buy all their herb through a

3371
02:21:34,959 --> 02:21:40,398
dashboard and like numbers from a lab

3372
02:21:38,478 --> 02:21:43,398
test where we're actually like touching

3373
02:21:40,398 --> 02:21:45,358
our plants and and seeing them and

3374
02:21:43,398 --> 02:21:47,959
breathing them and living with them it's

3375
02:21:45,359 --> 02:21:50,318
like important that experiential

3376
02:21:47,959 --> 02:21:53,159
cannabis needs to come into the scene at

3377
02:21:50,318 --> 02:21:56,119
some it'd be cool if people could come

3378
02:21:53,159 --> 02:22:00,318
out and like pick out like which plants

3379
02:21:56,120 --> 02:22:01,960
they like and um oh and do like a up

3380
02:22:00,318 --> 02:22:05,439
pick or something like that kind of

3381
02:22:01,959 --> 02:22:07,358
thing like what tpine speak out to you

3382
02:22:05,439 --> 02:22:10,720
that'd be something we could probably do

3383
02:22:07,359 --> 02:22:13,159
through Soulful potentially too you know

3384
02:22:10,719 --> 02:22:15,279
I know Nanda farms in New York they did

3385
02:22:13,159 --> 02:22:16,879
that with their hemp plants last year

3386
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:18,960
where they actually did a full and pick

3387
02:22:16,879 --> 02:22:21,239
and pull where people come in it was

3388
02:22:18,959 --> 02:22:22,879
done by veterans and

3389
02:22:21,239 --> 02:22:24,639
yeah it's they're doing again this year

3390
02:22:22,879 --> 02:22:28,920
where they grow the plants out and then

3391
02:22:24,639 --> 02:22:28,920
people just roll on up and they do

3392
02:22:40,359 --> 02:22:45,239
it the farm and then they came and were

3393
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:47,040
able to ask all their questions and they

3394
02:22:45,239 --> 02:22:48,920
make their own bomb and other things

3395
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:50,200
like that shout out to Sarah stth and

3396
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:52,600
them and their veterans out there in New

3397
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:56,000
York that do that much love and

3398
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:56,000
respect that's

3399
02:22:58,280 --> 02:23:03,560
right yeah just take a few nugs home dry

3400
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:08,359
it just dry it there take a couple of

3401
02:23:03,559 --> 02:23:10,478
colas I mean that'll last you for a

3402
02:23:08,359 --> 02:23:12,640
while yeah they did it by you could

3403
02:23:10,478 --> 02:23:14,478
either take colas or the whole plant

3404
02:23:12,639 --> 02:23:16,519
most people tended to take the whole

3405
02:23:14,478 --> 02:23:21,478
plant interestingly

3406
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:23,680
enough whoa I love it

3407
02:23:21,478 --> 02:23:25,559

02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:27,318
the whole plant I've shown a lot of

3409
02:23:25,559 --> 02:23:29,760

whole cannabis Journey for me uh has

3474
02:26:26,398 --> 02:26:30,799
been the Catalyst to everything good

3475
02:26:28,719 --> 02:26:34,079
I've learned in the last you know 20

3476
02:26:30,799 --> 02:26:36,799
years all the good people I've met um

3477
02:26:34,079 --> 02:26:39,920
this is a true honor to be here and uh

3478
02:26:36,799 --> 02:26:41,920
single Source farming uh has just taught

3479
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:44,478
me to search for quality in all aspects

3480
02:26:41,920 --> 02:26:46,398
of my life and uh the thing you said

3481
02:26:44,478 --> 02:26:49,039
about the pizza kind of was a fun old

3482
02:26:46,398 --> 02:26:50,639
irony because it was like when I used to

3483
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:52,520
be at the spot on the hill it was like

3484
02:26:50,639 --> 02:26:54,159
you couldn't even order a pizza you know

3485
02:26:52,520 --> 02:26:56,279
and that was one of the sacrifices of

3486
02:26:54,159 --> 02:26:57,680
being up there for the summer um you

3487
02:26:56,279 --> 02:26:58,960
know you're growing your good pot you're

3488
02:26:57,680 --> 02:27:01,318
having your couple turns in the

3489
02:26:58,959 --> 02:27:02,759
greenhouse and you're full term outside

3490
02:27:01,318 --> 02:27:05,000
and you can't even order a pie when

3491
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:07,760
you're tired after like a 12h hour day

3492
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:09,600
so I just love that and you know

3493
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:11,318
anything where people are really into

3494
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:13,920
something they dig that deep and you

3495
02:27:11,318 --> 02:27:16,398
make a couple fun and not so fun

3496
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:18,600
sacrifices and uh yeah thank you guys

3497
02:27:16,398 --> 02:27:21,760
all for everything you

3498
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:23,200
do hell yeah man and well said and you

3499
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:25,000
know what we didn't hear much from you

3500
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:26,560
do you want to tell us about sort of a

3501
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:28,478
little bit of your journey and maybe

02:27:33,079 --> 02:27:38,200
last decade I was lucky enough to rent

3506
02:27:35,239 --> 02:27:41,639

3511
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:50,840
kind of bullied our really cool small

3512
02:27:49,439 --> 02:27:53,520
community

3513
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:55,200
and uh I was lucky enough to go on an

3514
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:57,600
organic Journey because I was working

3515
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:59,359
for an awesome Egg Farm there that does

3516
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:01,800
the best vegetables around and they

3517
02:27:59,359 --> 02:28:04,040
would practically give us truckloads of

3518
02:28:01,799 --> 02:28:06,318
compost to take up to the spot and work

3519
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:09,640
with then we started making our own

3520
02:28:06,318 --> 02:28:12,478
compost making our own teas uh try to

3521
02:28:09,639 --> 02:28:15,318
keep it simple worked on through the old

3522
02:28:12,478 --> 02:28:19,679
slab days the envelope days parchment

02:35:09,079 --> 02:35:13,120
through we already did a little bit of

3684
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:14,920
harvesting on here just kind of su

3685
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:17,120
sessions here's some smaller plans

3686
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:19,960
starting to do their

3687
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:23,960
fade but yeah we're just getting some

3688
02:35:19,959 --> 02:35:25,959
nice rain right now I mean we'll take it

3689
02:35:23,959 --> 02:35:28,000
and plants these plants will hold up

3690
02:35:25,959 --> 02:35:30,398
nice we'll

3691
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:32,559
uh it's actually kind of fun to see

3692
02:35:30,398 --> 02:35:34,959
which ones stand up tall through all

3693
02:35:32,559 --> 02:35:37,760
this and and kind of breed accordingly

3694
02:35:34,959 --> 02:35:40,239
and all that kind of fun

3695
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:42,359
stuff um yeah some more of the key

3696
02:35:40,239 --> 02:35:44,559
liines here the key lines have been nice

3697
02:35:42,359 --> 02:35:47,559
they've been dumping some good resin for

3698
02:35:44,559 --> 02:35:47,559
us

3699
02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:55,240
what's up with uh what we're we're still

3700
02:35:52,439 --> 02:35:58,040
kind of learning like you know optimal

3701
02:35:55,239 --> 02:36:00,398
harvesting for for fresh frozen you know

3702
02:35:58,040 --> 02:36:02,600
I got we got some buddies who we we've

3703
02:36:00,398 --> 02:36:05,840
done you know like cured hash with and

3704
02:36:02,600 --> 02:36:07,520
stuff like that and uh he'll see a super

3705
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:10,159
Frosty PL be like oh that one's going to

3706
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:15,079
dump but then I feel like for fresh

3707
02:36:10,159 --> 02:36:15,079
frozen do you feel like if you

3708
02:36:26,639 --> 02:36:30,199
let him get

3709
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:32,639
right this one's looking pretty nice and

3710
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:32,640
ripe

3711
02:36:32,879 --> 02:36:40,318
here hey Sam do the thols really uh

3712
02:36:36,799 --> 02:36:42,438
build up at the end of the cycle as well

3713
02:36:40,318 --> 02:36:45,199
as the terpenoids and everything from

3714
02:36:42,439 --> 02:36:48,000
your experience is that some another

3715
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:50,159
reason to let the plant ripen more I

3716
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:52,478
think you might be losing them a little

3717
02:36:50,159 --> 02:36:57,159
bit during cultivation

3718
02:36:52,478 --> 02:36:59,879
but I find at the moment of harvest

3719
02:36:57,159 --> 02:37:03,239
seems to be when it's has the strongest

3720
02:36:59,879 --> 02:37:08,039
smell but then during the say two week

3721
02:37:03,239 --> 02:37:11,398
in the dark drying it uh it's a I mean

3722
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:13,640
you can smell it for half a mile away if

3723
02:37:11,398 --> 02:37:16,199
it's a large

3724
02:37:13,639 --> 02:37:19,920
dry hey uh Marcus can I I want to give a

3725
02:37:16,200 --> 02:37:23,960
shout out real quick uh to uh Dean elban

3726
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:26,000
and his victory um uh Glass Works they

3727
02:37:23,959 --> 02:37:28,799
gave some donations to our veterans that

3728
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:30,959
we able to use all week for our dabbing

3729
02:37:28,799 --> 02:37:33,599
in DC and I just want to say thank him

3730
02:37:30,959 --> 02:37:35,879
for helping us out we appreciate it much

3731
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:38,318
love hell yeah absolutely I want to get

3732
02:37:35,879 --> 02:37:40,839
Brian on the show again maybe do another

3733
02:37:38,318 --> 02:37:45,000
hash church about uh maybe it even could

3734
02:37:40,840 --> 02:37:47,000
coincide with uh um Shar and Nick and

3735
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:48,799
the volatile organic compounds because

3736
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:50,439
not only do we want to talk about and

3737
02:37:48,799 --> 02:37:52,759
understand how they're produced and how

3738
02:37:50,439 --> 02:37:54,559
they're preserved but then if we're so

3739
02:37:52,760 --> 02:37:57,520
obsessed with preserving them then too

3740
02:37:54,559 --> 02:38:00,519
shall we be to the level that Brian is

3741
02:37:57,520 --> 02:38:03,359
obsessed with how we consume them and

3742
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:05,479
and how does the material we consume

3743
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:07,359
them off of them create buffers to

3744
02:38:05,478 --> 02:38:09,039
further preserve those compounds right

3745
02:38:07,359 --> 02:38:11,120
up until the point where we are

3746
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:13,200
experiencing them instead of changing

3747
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:16,520
them before they get into our old

3748
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:20,680
factory and into our uh you know taste

3749
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:21,960

to me I love

3814
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:04,920
you one thing that I think would be

3815
02:41:02,279 --> 02:41:07,079
interesting to share is um I've uh I've

3816
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:09,879
been running through I'm GNA read read

3817
02:41:07,079 --> 02:41:13,439
the list of things I95 times cherry pie

3818
02:41:09,879 --> 02:41:16,639
times Tony Clifton watermelon skill

3819
02:41:13,439 --> 02:41:17,960
Skittles times uh Z times Tropic

3820
02:41:16,639 --> 02:41:22,760
Tropical

3821
02:41:17,959 --> 02:41:27,318
Skittles uh times peanut butter runs and

3822
02:41:22,760 --> 02:41:31,079
then Gary pton times banana

3823
02:41:27,318 --> 02:41:33,199
runs and all of those are hitting above

3824
02:41:31,079 --> 02:41:37,559
6% on

3825
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:41,159
yield uh for washing all of them all all

3826
02:41:37,559 --> 02:41:43,959
all of those that I listed

3827
02:41:41,159 --> 02:41:46,920
so sounds like the progenitors are

3828
02:41:43,959 --> 02:41:48,839
correct yeah they I mean I thought you I

3829
02:41:46,920 --> 02:41:53,639
know you're a g you're a fan of Gary so

3830
02:41:48,840 --> 02:41:57,200
I think the banana the banana runs adds

3831
02:41:53,639 --> 02:42:00,239
adds some adds a little little twist

3832
02:41:57,200 --> 02:42:02,439
yeah but those are uh banana runs is

3833

02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:44,479
breeding projects right now and then

3844
02:42:40,799 --> 02:42:47,559
we're going to partner with

3845
02:42:44,478 --> 02:42:49,840
a uh there's an outfit here that we're

3846
02:42:47,559 --> 02:42:52,799
working with to get those to licensed

3847
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:55,880
producers so we can put those into play

3848
02:42:52,799 --> 02:42:57,759
so those have a have a home for them and

3849
02:42:55,879 --> 02:43:01,039
then there um will be banked with

3850
02:42:57,760 --> 02:43:04,159
canopia and medicinal genomics and then

3851
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:06,720
backed with P pathos which is their kind

3852
02:43:04,159 --> 02:43:08,398
of um pathogen kind of verification

3853
02:43:06,719 --> 02:43:11,679
system what's what's the max that

3854
02:43:08,398 --> 02:43:16,519
they'll pay in the mass market for six

3855
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:18,800
star if if they even get it yeah this

3856
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:22,359
that's that's the other question but um

3857
02:43:18,799 --> 02:43:25,799
I think think um it's it's still like

3858
02:43:22,359 --> 02:43:29,000
it's still like to 2016 in you know in

3859
02:43:25,799 --> 02:43:32,438
California 85 Plus dollar a gram you

3860
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:34,318
know what I mean so um that's just where

3861
02:43:32,439 --> 02:43:37,680
it's at right now because the pounds are

3862
02:43:34,318 --> 02:43:40,199
still on the on the um just the

3863
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:43,520
regulated side are still reaching three

3864
02:43:40,200 --> 02:43:45,960
grand you know so it's just the Paradigm

3865
02:43:43,520 --> 02:43:48,479
is still there and it's strong so there

3866
02:43:45,959 --> 02:43:51,438
it's still holding somewhat but um

3867
02:43:48,478 --> 02:43:52,199
you'll find in wholesaling for like 22

3868
02:43:51,439 --> 02:43:56,200
to

3869
02:43:52,200 --> 02:43:59,880
30 grand you know yeah

3870
02:43:56,200 --> 02:44:03,000
so quarter of the price of the full

3871
02:43:59,879 --> 02:44:04,358
Mount yeah it's it's you know they're

3872
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,680
not pressing the full Mount they're

3873
02:44:04,359 --> 02:44:08,120
pressing

3874
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:11,159
the it's not all the same strains though

3875
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:13,800
like the the six star is gonna be four

3876
02:44:11,159 --> 02:44:15,959
or five strains where like the $22 hash

3877
02:44:13,799 --> 02:44:18,199
rosin is going to be like eight [ __ ]

3878
02:44:15,959 --> 02:44:20,879
strength eight of the same culprit eight

3879
02:44:18,200 --> 02:44:22,840
of the same 16 culprits that you see

3880
02:44:20,879 --> 02:44:26,119
everywhere

3881
02:44:22,840 --> 02:44:28,520
third yeah yeah and then exactly it's

3882
02:44:26,120 --> 02:44:31,640
like full it's like a you know mix

3883
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:33,960
Micron and stuff you know all that so

3884
02:44:31,639 --> 02:44:35,840
full spec yeah so the East Coast has a

3885
02:44:33,959 --> 02:44:37,199
lot of like just in terms of like where

3886
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:39,559
we're at just because there's not a lot

3887
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:42,359
of accessibility still you know like we

3888
02:44:39,559 --> 02:44:44,879
kind of forget because we're so spoiled

3889
02:44:42,359 --> 02:44:46,200
that um we just don't have it and I

3890
02:44:44,879 --> 02:44:47,920
that's I think that's the other thing

3891
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:50,120
people are excited to learn about hash

3892
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:54,520
right now on the East Coast or re really

3893
02:44:50,120 --> 02:44:56,760
ReDiscover it I think honestly um so

3894
02:44:54,520 --> 02:44:58,520
it's you know it's like it's I think

3895
02:44:56,760 --> 02:45:00,639
it's like out there what I see is a lot

3896
02:44:58,520 --> 02:45:02,279
of product still goes to flower market

3897
02:45:00,639 --> 02:45:05,119
because it has value in flower market

3898
02:45:02,279 --> 02:45:07,600
too so it's a little different where you

3899
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:09,359
know and and the reality is like West

3900
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:12,720
Coast and the East Coast smoke a lot of

3901
02:45:09,359 --> 02:45:16,120
hash the difference is our Q-tips are a

3902
02:45:12,719 --> 02:45:17,599
little less dark on the west coast yeah

3903
02:45:16,120 --> 02:45:19,240
I don't know you know when we clean up

3904
02:45:17,600 --> 02:45:21,040
our Banger It's like because it's

3905
02:45:19,239 --> 02:45:23,959
different material that's going in there

3906
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:25,520
more availability of super high-end

3907
02:45:23,959 --> 02:45:27,519
stuff and that's because you have two

3908
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:30,159
different forces pulling there's the

3909
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:32,920
market pulling to flour which is always

3910
02:45:30,159 --> 02:45:35,279
viable there and then just you know the

3911
02:45:32,920 --> 02:45:36,639
the the P the buying Market it's just

3912
02:45:35,279 --> 02:45:39,079
kind of different I mean New York's

3913
02:45:36,639 --> 02:45:41,199
interesting to see it kind of turning on

3914
02:45:39,079 --> 02:45:43,639
and just watching like popup stuff go

3915
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:46,079
from California to New York and things

3916
02:45:43,639 --> 02:45:47,439
happening and other stuff but um how's

3917
02:45:46,079 --> 02:45:50,279
that because you're close to that market

3918
02:45:47,439 --> 02:45:52,200
too like what's what do you kind of see

3919
02:45:50,279 --> 02:45:54,239
you know it's it's the kind of as I

3920
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:56,640
alluded before I think it's like

3921
02:45:54,239 --> 02:45:59,039
everyone needs to just slow down and let

3922
02:45:56,639 --> 02:46:01,278
like the structure kind of get there you

3923
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:04,040
know and then we can be really truly

3924
02:46:01,279 --> 02:46:06,000
excited but um I think it's it's just a

3925
02:46:04,040 --> 02:46:08,319
mixture of everybody kind of you know

3926
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:10,680
wanting to get their chance and gearing

3927
02:46:08,318 --> 02:46:12,359
up for it and gonna have a lot of

3928
02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:15,120
personality you know I think that's the

3929
02:46:12,359 --> 02:46:18,439
cool part about it so I I'm really

3930
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:21,279
honestly I'm super excited I think it's

3931
02:46:18,439 --> 02:46:23,559
it's GNA be amazing and interesting and

3932
02:46:21,279 --> 02:46:25,920
everything in between and um it's a

3933
02:46:23,559 --> 02:46:27,680
center of of many cultures so I'm

3934
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:30,478
excited to see what that comes of it too

3935
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:32,359
you know so yeah there's been a lot of

3936
02:46:30,478 --> 02:46:34,398
trapping that's the that's the one thing

3937
02:46:32,359 --> 02:46:36,960
I seems like Daniel Boone [ __ ]

3938
02:46:34,398 --> 02:46:39,358
banging out in New York It's the Last

3939
02:46:36,959 --> 02:46:42,199
Frontier though you know what I mean so

3940
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:44,960
um when did the roen caps with the with

3941
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:47,159
the Tails happen then

3942
02:46:44,959 --> 02:46:50,599
that's they're coming there's the

3943
02:46:47,159 --> 02:46:55,719
push-ups guys anybody going join me

3944
02:46:50,600 --> 02:46:55,720
push-ups two every two hours but

3945
02:46:55,879 --> 02:47:01,278
yeah there's a lot of cool people that

3946
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:03,398
want I think have uh have have been

3947
02:47:01,279 --> 02:47:07,760
doing things that want opportunity and

3948
02:47:03,398 --> 02:47:12,519
this is their chance so you know

3949
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:14,040
um gonna be cool yeah that's uh I mean

3950
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:18,040
piff doesn't really make the greatest

3951
02:47:14,040 --> 02:47:21,840
cash does it oh no no no no you look the

3952
02:47:18,040 --> 02:47:24,319
all this all it um I think again has to

3953
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:27,040
go through its own contemporary kind of

3954
02:47:24,318 --> 02:47:28,760
Rance change and all those because

3955
02:47:27,040 --> 02:47:30,640
people have been holding things for

3956
02:47:28,760 --> 02:47:32,200
decades in these areas that have just

3957
02:47:30,639 --> 02:47:34,559
been growing the same

3958
02:47:32,200 --> 02:47:37,079
thing they just don't want to go out and

3959
02:47:34,559 --> 02:47:38,719
find a new thing or buy a seed pack and

3960
02:47:37,079 --> 02:47:41,879
take the chance on honest because they

3961
02:47:38,719 --> 02:47:43,398
don't have the space for it yeah so um I

3962
02:47:41,879 --> 02:47:45,278
think that's going to be interesting and

3963
02:47:43,398 --> 02:47:47,239
seeing kind of what you know because

3964
02:47:45,279 --> 02:47:49,200
knowing just what I've kept and been so

3965
02:47:47,239 --> 02:47:50,199
insular with and knowing some of the

3966
02:47:49,200 --> 02:47:53,680
other people that have been doing the

3967
02:47:50,200 --> 02:47:55,200
similar things I you know that crossed

3968
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:58,040
with some of this newer stuff that I'm

3969
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:59,600
now starting to explore I think is is

3970
02:47:58,040 --> 02:48:02,720
gonna drive a lot of what New York's

3971
02:47:59,600 --> 02:48:03,680
gonna become you know it's gonna be

3972
02:48:02,719 --> 02:48:07,039
