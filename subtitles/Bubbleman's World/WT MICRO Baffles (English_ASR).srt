1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,560
now we're going to put the baffles in

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,439
the tank the baffles help the water move

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,318
properly and the Cannabis to the tank as

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,320
it

5
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:11,839
mixes so once it's nice thought it comes

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,839
in really

7
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,599
easy for different sizes of Tanks

8
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,960
now I'm going to put the impeller into

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,680
the motor so you have the quick release

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,640
coupling you let it fall

11
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:46,519
down and then you have to make sure it's

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,840
in the centered position once it's there

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,520
you push up on the spring rotate it Let

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,600
It Drop into position now the tank is

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,800
ready to mix now once you have the water

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,640
level filled up to the top of the baffle

17
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,038
all the Cannabis is thawed it's time to

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,920
start it up so we're going to turn on

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,920
the impeller

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,960
as the tank first starts to mix it might

21
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:16,319
need a just a little boost to start

22
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,239
fluidizing the material so get it up to

23
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,000
your speed and then just start to loosen

24
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,000
material from the edges
