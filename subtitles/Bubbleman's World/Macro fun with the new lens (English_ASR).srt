changes we know that the vamin or heroin

4
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:39,399
or even alcohol can produce longlasting

00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:42,519
changes in the neurochemistry of the

6
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:42,520
brain so this is

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,960
really it is because it has been cross

8
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:56,280
high THC content which is boosted by

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,878
being grown under light how many young

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,640
smokers actually use gun is another

00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:07,438
matter it is expensive the best estimate

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:13,879
suggest that account for just % of the

13
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,879
UK Market 15% of the UK Market
