00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,759
well that is a big boat considering

274
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,279
there's a smaller boat in front of it

275
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,759
really giving you the size uh difference

276
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:15,079
barely fits into my wide angle lens

277
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,400
camera look at that barely fit the whole

278
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:19,720
boat

279
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:23,480
in you're doing

280
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,480
great knocking boards

281
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,159
over all right so Chris called it time

282
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,519
for a for a little puff session we got a

283
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,559
couple of options I brought the little

284
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:36,960
saram saram pen little uh vape pen but I

285
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:38,480
think we're going to

286
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,319
go

287
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,319
full if you brought it we should use it

288
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:46,599
ooh wait a minute now we might have to

289
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,720
go see we'll see what we got I think we

290
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:52,558
can do this I think we can do

291
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,079
this make sure we got all the pieces all

292
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,759
the components that are necessary such a

293
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:59,158
nice day each nice day gets

294
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,359
consecutively nicer I would agree with

295
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,159
that actually supposed to be like

296
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:07,240
cooking this summer too

297
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:09,520
so beautiful we deserve it yeah for sure

298
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,839
so is there any like uh really nice like

299
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,158
new pavement out in Lions Bay if like

300
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,439
you know up in the up in the mountains

301
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,360
there or anything like that I think the

302
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,038
best place in Lions Bay would probably

303
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,879
be

304
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,519
um this is where some of the upper upper

305
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,360
streets are pretty good but it's mostly

306
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,480
longboarders who are going at extreme

307
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,959
speeds down and sliding with hand like

308
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,120
when they have those World competitions

309
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,558
down in Washington there's usually about

310
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:37,199
five or six of those guys that drive up

311
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:39,000
over the border and then they hit a few

312
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,480
spots in the British properties and they

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,079
usually get as far as lion's Bay these

314
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,120
boards I think they would be really

315
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:46,798
amazing for Squamish cuz now Squamish

316
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,678
has a seaw wall type of thing that goes

317
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:53,079
throughout it um any yeah Whistler and

318
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:54,360
even pton has quite a bit of it so yeah

319
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:57,720
I think that this could become really

320
00:21:54,359 --> 00:22:00,038
popular along those lines sure so let me

321
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,319
see here we got

322
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:02,879
get a little dab this will be the

323
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,678
easiest I think for us we'll do a little

345
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,640
all that stuff was like a thing of my

346
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,440
past you know all the surfing and

347
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,400
skating and stuff had been so long this

348
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,080
kind of what I needed to reinvigorate my

349
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,919
life a little bit was that kind of

350
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:03,558

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,960
egg you know I guess I could have but I

356
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,960

369
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,360
say when I'm doing stuff like this I

370
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,038
don't want to sit around and puff for

371
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:06,038
like an hour I really just want to have

372
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:08,119
a get hit and then on the road exactly

373
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:09,558
for sure man I think you know all board

374
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,278
Sports it's like you know you go to any

375
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:13,599
snowboard scene and there's going to be

376
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,119
the hardcore guys that are hitting the

377
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,119
hitting the herb and hitting the hill

378
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,879
hard you go to a surf break there's

379
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,959
going to be the hardcore Surfers that

380
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,120
are hitting hit the session on the beach

381
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,519
before they paddle out skateboard park

382
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:28,558
same thing and I don't know like I think

383
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,720
that uh in regards to board Sports those

384
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,960
type of sports cannabis can really throw

385
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,600
you in that Zen head space that where

386
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,240
you just kind of get in the zone with

387
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:37,959
what you're doing and stuff like that I

388
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,240
don't know if totally if performance

389
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,679
enhancement is right but performance

390
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,240
Focus yeah performance Focus for sure

391
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:45,600
you know he's literally claiming now

392
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,278
that cannabis is a performance

393
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:50,199
enhancement uh drug for him so I think

394
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,480
have to take him out for escape you know

395
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,840
what he'd be really down to this

396
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,360
actually yeah yeah for sure we could

397
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:55,959
definitely get Ross to come and and

398
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,359
cruise around with us on these things I

399
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,679
think uh maybe when we go up to Whistler

400
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:01,558
we'll make sure that he's around and

401
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,080
we'll uh bring the extra board with us

402
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:05,398
and yeah for sure man you know we could

403
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:07,398
