2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,640
okay hello welcome everybody to Bubble

3
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:28,559
man's world I am back today again with

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,359
Sabo and we are going to sit down and do

5
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,399
a little bit of a sort of organ

6
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,440
conversation while we enjoy a couple of

7
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,359
vapex hailes mine turned down

8
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,000
substantially the way I like it his

9
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,840
turned up a little bit more Yep about

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,159
the 1:00 setting here 1:00 setting and

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:48,800
I'm down at what you would say

12
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:51,119
maybe 7:00 7 o' yes maybe 7 o' little

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,640
bit of a lighter lighter hit that takes

14
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,519
a bit longer to give that Smoky Rip but

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,679
uh yeah we've got eight quartz tubes

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,399
here that are nice and clean and ready

17
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,239
for for dipping three varieties of rosin

18
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:09,079
so we've got a hash plant we've got a

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:12,159
sweet skunk and we've got a congal oo

20
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:14,679
and then we also have seven varieties of

21
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,240
tpin two in the closed packages here the

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,079
Blue River we got Swiss sonami and the

23
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:22,679
ACDC both High CBD CS actually not that

24
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:24,478
there's any cannaboids in there but

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,159
still they are the profiles that come

26
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,560
from a high CBD cultivar and I'm of the

27
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,640
firm belief that

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,599
those r ratios of Tarpin synergize and

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,040
modulate CBD a particular way I think

30
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,438
probably in a better way than just

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,719
extracting out CBD by itself interesting

32
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,639
oh I will be uh Curious to try and you

33
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:47,640
know I love the taste of CBD strains in

34
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,759
general so I'm sure I will yeah they

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,439
always have they always have a bit of a

36
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,239
cherry esque sort of nice turpine flavor

37
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,879
to it that I that I found that's a great

38
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,718
description also excited to show you

39
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:59,438
guys this new little piece here a step

40
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,000
in the right direction for me now don't

41
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:04,279
get me wrong I loved the pipe that came

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,640
with the vapexhale it was thick and

43
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,439
strong it didn't feel like you know

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,919
inexpensive glass that you didn't get

45
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:12,400
your money's worth I felt that it was a

46
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,399
nice heavy thick piece and the way it

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,080
fit on the unit I loved as well but

48
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,159
coming from the perspective of someone

49
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,080
that collects uh you know even though

50
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:24,519
they're clear fairly expensive glass

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,280
pipes uh I think it's a great idea to

52
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,159
offer an option that doesn't involve um

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,959
the tube which is fine I've hit it four

54
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,519
out of the sublimator and I've used the

55
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:37,598
one for the vapexhale I just love the

56
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,840
idea of preserving it in glass uh me too

57
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:43,000
as well you know uh the the silicone

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,800
hose was designed more for usability and

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,519
utilitarian purposes but I I am like you

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,959
you know I love collecting really nice

61
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:53,319
glass and many times when you have a

62
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,640
silicone hose in between a high-end

63
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:57,719
vaporizer and a top-notch Mothership

64
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:59,359
like this one uh you know it's almost

65
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,479
like a one of these things doesn't

66
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,959
belong with with the other so we decided

67
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,878
to create this all glass uh connector

68
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,280
here and you know um this is just the

69
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,318
version one of it you know we think that

70
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,919
uh based on the time I spent with you

71
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:14,719
and D yesterday you know there's some

72
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:16,399
improvements that we can make but at

73
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,400
least it's a step in the right direction

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,920
and you know really excited to to show

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,480
everyone uh how it works as well as to

76
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,759
taste all of this awesomeness in front

77
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,598
of us and by no means am I saying that

78
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,840
this is the better there it's a quiver

79
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:32,839
Sabo and I are quiver guys we like to

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,479
have more than one option because we

81
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,039
know there are more than one type of

82
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,359
person out there and what's great for

83
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:40,519
you may not be great for the next person

84
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,879
so the Silicon Co tube is actually going

85
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,799
to is is is absolutely going to find its

86
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,719
place with certain people and the the

87
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:49,239
glass on glass accessories are going to

88
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,719
find their PL people have different

89
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,200
preferences and for

90
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:56,239
me the taste of the vapix hail the way

91
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,919
the heat heats up the quartz in the

92
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,400
little tube of glass that sort of

93
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,318
convection style of heating

94
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,920
um it offers me such a beautifully

95
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,919
preserved hit that I want to take it

96
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,798
through glass I want it to go right

97
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:11,798
through glass right to Glass and and for

98
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,480
me I do obviously notice a difference in

99
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:17,120
in in the hint so I'm quite excited to

100
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,560
get this uh get this little Gauntlet

101
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,720
going here yeah absolutely me too and to

102
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,079
your point you know uh I never been want

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,040
to say one is better than the other I I

104
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,680
like to have options as well when people

105
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,000
ask me you know what's my favorite piece

106
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,959
of glass or what's my favor favorite

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,680
Hydra tube that goes on top you know

108
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,198
typically my response is anything I

109
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,879
didn't use yesterday you know like I get

110
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,000
used to the different pull and feelings

111
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,719
of certain pieces of glass and you know

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,478
for me just having that variety really

113
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,919
keeps things new and fresh for me I

114
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:47,199
think it's an incredibly important

115
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:48,680
perspective for us to have that although

116
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,000
you know when you find something that's

117
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,439
great and you want to share it with your

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,839
friends and you're inspired it's

119
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,759
important that you don't let your ego

120
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,638
get too involved and where you want to

121
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,400
enforce that this is the best Better Way

122
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,000
by all means show your friends things

123
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,038
and Inspire them to do things

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,600
differently but understand that there

125
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:08,079
are a lot of different people out there

126
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,199
and for me who comes to mind right away

127
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,319
is Irv Rosenfield one of the two or

128
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,160
three legal federally exempt cannabis

129
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:18,759
users in the US along with Elvie Musa he

130
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,039
gets the big cans of joints 300 of them

131
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,439
every month from the Mississippi

132
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,079
facility and we had on hash church and

133
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,918
we were talking about the quality of

134
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,719
this bot and of course it's Swag and

135
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:29,918
they're grinding up all the stock and

136
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,840
this that and the other thing and all of

137
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,519
these connoisseurs in the rumor saying

138
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,359
we got to get you better product ir and

139
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,079
that's just ridiculous and and then Irv

140
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
just came up with this most beautiful

141
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:43,159
perspective that none of us had and he

142
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,919
said guys this works for me this is

143
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,280
working for me and in that moment I

144
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,639
realized then he should have access to

145
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,318
that we can never make access only what

146
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,038
we think is best or what we want as best

147
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,080
but we need to open our minds and hearts

148
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,038
up to the opportunities of the quiver

149
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,120
all of the options that we can bring to

150
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:04,560
the table and we have a few good options

151
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,160
here on the table today what are you

152
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,319
thinking you want to start with you know

153
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,120
um had the congales yesterday so maybe

154
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,280
the was this the super skunk or uh we

155
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,840
got the sweet skunk and then we got a

156
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,918
little bit of hash plant here as well

157
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:22,279
that's this one's nice because it has

158
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:24,598
not as strong of a presence as the other

159
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,038
ones it's almost closer to a distillate

160
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:29,680
even though it's not it has a turpine

161
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:31,839
profile but a lower uh profile uh from

162
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,840
I'm used to in these other uh more

163
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,279
narrow Leaf drug cultivars this is a

164
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,918
wide Leaf drug cultivar and I find that

165
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:41,198
when you dip it into the turpine you

166
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:42,560
really experience that particular tpine

167
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,520
that you're uh that you're dipping into

168
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,839
so this is more like a blank canvas it's

169
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,359
it's closer to a blank canvas absolutely

170
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,959
yeah that's the reason I brought that

171
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,960
one I thought these ones are amazing to

172
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:55,079
mix because their profiles are so unique

173
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:57,638
even without adding Turpin but this one

174
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,598
is really one that is more closer to you

175
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,519
know pure canabo with uh a tpine profile

176
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:04,360
added yeah and this parchment paper is

177
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,038
really top notches well I don't know if

178
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,160
anyone could see this well let's give a

179
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:11,478
shout out to Snick and the 710 parchment

180
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,919
crew this is a great concept and idea

181
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:14,399
and I'm glad that you mentioned it they

182
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,519
come out with these little squares

183
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,560
they're wonderful for um for companies

184
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,318
even like vapix hail or any company that

185
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,439
wants their logo it's almost done in

186
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,759
like a braille so it's raised so you put

187
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:30,439
the rosin in and you peel it open you

188
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,319
see the imprinted in the rosin too the

189
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:33,918
that is very cool yeah I like that

190
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,160
myself so let's do uh let's start off

191
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:36,959
with a little hit of this and what do

192
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,360
you think I I'm thinking maybe grape

193
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,038
ghost hey that's the first one that was

194
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,400
staring at me back so I think that's a

195
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,680
good one all right let's give it a

196
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,239
little whiff now I will say a neat thing

197
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,360
about the vapix Hal as we're about to

198
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,199
hit some Tarpin mixed with um some some

199
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,560
rosin is that this is one of the first

200
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,800
units I used that actually allowed me to

201
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,918
hit pure Tarpin in a way that I felt

202
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,759
that they were preserved enough that I

203
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:03,918
would actually do that cuz before I was

204
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,479
dabbing pure drops on a nail I found it

205
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:09,279
to be a little bit harsh it just the the

206
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,680
direct Grill style of heat that

207
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,679
conduction was just too much compared to

208
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,720
the the light preservation of this

209
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,120
convection style unit and uh well Brett

210
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,360
and I from West Coast concentrate I

211
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,879
think we did like 10 or 15 tpin a

212
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,038
gauntlet right at this table yeah watch

213
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,720
that all the gauntlets have been done

214
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:29,000
right at this table the first D40 yes

215
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,360
the first d420 K Gauntlet that we did 18

216
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,200
flavors

217
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,759
uh was here and then Brett and I did the

218
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,080
10 or the 12 whatever that was and now

219
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,759
you and I are going to do just a mini

220
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,320
one just a mini one just a little mini

221
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:44,080
one four four four each uh because we

222
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,760
have four clean uh tubes but uh that

223
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,680
leaves at least three tpin that we're

224
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,519
not going to experience but that's okay

225
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:53,759
yes we've always got off camera yeah we

226
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,959
could do those off camera excellent

227
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,559
so can do I usually get a

228
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:02,078
little I usually Heat this up a tiny bit

229
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,599
but I we should be fine so what I liked

230
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:06,159
about what you said earlier about having

231
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,759
the multiple Quivers is um you know

232
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:11,240
there are certain concentrates and

233
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:13,480
certain you know forms that I feel like

234
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,639
you know might be better for dabbing and

235
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,200
then there's other things like

236
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,120
concentrates and what we're doing today

237
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,440
that I think you know really work well

238
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,480
with our convection based methodology

239
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,040
But ultimately you know I feel like if

240
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,278
you can find a safe easy effective

241
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:29,958
consistent healthy way to consume your

242
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:31,919
concentrates you you know whether it's a

243
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:34,039
low temp nail or through a device like

244
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,759
this you know these are all uh uh

245
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,360
Positive Directions to go in and

246
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,480
removing you know the smoke and

247
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,159
carcinogens from your from your lungs

248
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,680
just a small little dab to give you guys

249
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,399
an idea I'm not sure how well you can

250
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:45,479
see that but it's it's nothing major

251
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,759
that we're putting in here we're going

252
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,240
to do a little Gauntlet so we're not

253
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,319
going to be packing these in but uh by

254
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,759
all means you uh are welcome to all

255
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,879
right have the first go cool thank you

256
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,879
so much so I'll try to do it at an angle

257
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,399
where people can see what's going on

258
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,519
yeah and got your carb

259
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,639
perfect so we could already see the

260
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,360
first bits of vapor coming out I'm going

261
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,919
to lock this in right

262
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,919
here and here we

263
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,200
go this stuff is just

264
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:28,439
shatter

265
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,599
wow that was really tasty that was the

266
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,079
the ghost that was the

267
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,320
ghost all sorts of interesting things

268
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:36,319
going on in that flavor

269
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,379
profile

270
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,610
beautiful got me excited

271
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:47,610
[Music]

272
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,278
here jeez

273
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,919
wow wow yeah it's an impressive little

274
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:59,078
unit you've built here I'm not going to

275
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:01,039
lie when I first saw it I was like oh

276
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:02,838
okay okay it's like it reminds me of a

277
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,039
few other units that I've seen and I

278
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,279
wasn't you know as excited and then Tony

279
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,639
said that he had tried it and he was

280
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:09,679
like no you have to try this I'm always

281
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:14,278
Blown

282
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:16,919
Away by any unit that can taste as good

283
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,958
as like a big dab off of a nail through

284
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:22,159
my through my mother's [ __ ] and uh the

285
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:24,838
vapex hail definitely has that hands

286
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,719
down and that's why I so wanted to be

287
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,440
able to hit it through my mother's this

288
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,720
this is a treat this is a treat thank

289
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,959
you and I don't know if we're filming in

290
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,079
high enough definition but anytime I

291
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,759
take these TPS I get crazy goosebumps

292
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,479
you do that is wonderful I mean there's

293
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:43,799
no denying that reaction it was almost

294
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,320
like when I went to the hospital with

295
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,078
d420 K and we visited Johnny B after he

296
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,680
had his neck surgery his spinal column

297
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:54,159
was being flattened and so they released

298
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,239
this one of his vertebrates off of it

299
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,278
and they were worried that it was going

300
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,959
to blow up like a balloon and just pop

301
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,919
cuz your spinal cord is very much like a

302
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,879
a little little balloon and his was

303
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:05,199
flattened well when the pressure

304
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,039
relieved it it worked out in his favor

305
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,040
and he was extremely you know the the

306
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,838
pain that he was out of was incredible

307
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,078
but he was still obviously sore in the

308
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,680
hospital bed having just had spinal

309
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:17,799
surgery and we go there and it was the

310
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,719
purple punch that I pulled out and I put

311
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,439
under his name under his nose and

312
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,720
literally in a second he was

313
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,600
like he felt a shift in his

314
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,000
Consciousness and the way the pain was

315
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,959
being experienced and it was a very

316
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,278
short shift he said it just went away

317
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,958
and he he was he was blown away at how

318
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:38,838
powerful just inhaling smelling a tpine

319
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:40,479
not not vaporizing just the tur huh yeah

320
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,839
so mine's at a lower temperature that's

321
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,519
why I talked a little bit uh and let it

322
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:49,399
kind of get going we spoke about this

323
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:51,480
yesterday at the cchq right so as the uh

324
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,360
glass tube is in the heating chamber

325
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,120
longer it does continue to build up heat

326
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,120
so bubble man here is at the lowest

327
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,480
temperature which is roughly

328
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,120
225° and it's sitting there baking in

329
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,560
the hot air oven uh he'll get probably 4

330
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,320
to six inhalations I got 2 to three at

331
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:13,159
the 1:00 position which is closer to

332
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,160
375° but you know the great thing is

333
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,159
whether you're a high temp low temp you

334
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:18,919
know somewhere in between type of Dabber

335
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,519
you'll be able to have the control to

336
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:24,159
get these hot air dabs oh my God is that

337
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,560
delicious and it immediately felt under

338
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,278
my eyes like inside my head right under

339
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:32,159
my brain I can literally feel that's

340
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,278
those tpin getting it right to me it's

341
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,879
amazing that we have all these different

342
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:38,958
compounds that we can now use but it's

343
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,159
as important to have mechanisms that

344
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,679
allow us to vaporize them unadulterated

345
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,319
and unchanged yeah that's the important

346
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,559
factor that we're dealing with now I

347
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,480
believe so I mean I think a good analogy

348
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:53,039
is you know it's like um if you have a a

349
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,800
coob beef you know you get a steak of it

350
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,719
um it's it's taken so much time to to

351
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,758
create something like that and if you

352
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,879
were to let's just say make ground beef

353
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:06,240
out of it and make hamburgers well it

354
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:08,720
could be you know almost uh you know a

355
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,519
bad use of it so uh when I saw what you

356
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,680
and Tony were doing with these

357
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:16,000
tpin and I I I just knew that this would

358
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,919
be a device that would really kind of

359
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,480
you know help people enjoy it at a

360
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:23,838
higher level and really I mean all the

361
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,360
the amount of plant that is required to

362
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,440
create just this amount of Tarin I mean

363
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,278
you know it really is like liquid gold

364
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,720
or or liquid Platinum because um the

365
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:37,198
therapeutic utility that I get from this

366
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,680
it's it's on another level with the

367
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,639
concentrates and I I'll be very curious

368
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,359
as to hear what you know what the

369
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,360
research and science has to say as to

370
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,120
why we feel this way when we add more

371
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,839
tpes to the plants but um there's going

372
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,120
to be a lot of people focused on this in

373
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,880
the upcoming years and I think it's

374
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,839
going to be important for us not to

375
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,198
react in this sort of like who are you

376
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,120
who do you think it's like no let's

377
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:02,159
embrace all of these people that are

378
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,799
coming into this part of the industry

379
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,159
the people that are going to get phds

380
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:07,198
and they're going to learn chemistry so

381
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:10,240
that they can study these molecules and

382
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,679
and explain maybe the pathways or the

383
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,079
relationships that are occurring

384
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,679
underlining that we don't yet understand

385
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,039
especially in regards to how the

386
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,879
interaction occurs in our own endoc

387
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:23,159
canabo systems which is it's an

388
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,278
incredible amount of science even if we

389
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:28,039
were just to pick you and one cultivar

390
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:30,120
that's an incredible amount of science

391
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,559
once we break it into the world and all

392
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,039
of the cultivars that are available

393
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,919
including the ones we can produce

394
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,240
through

395
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:39,639
breeding it makes the hair on my arm

396
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,318
stand up you know yeah well what's

397
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,919
interesting is I'm going to be very

398
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:46,958
curious about the CBD chirps and how

399
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:49,120
they affect the body and if uh that's a

400
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,439
good way for people to you know get that

401
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,639
into their system I mean one of the

402
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,319
biggest things that we've seen

403
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,079
especially with the professional

404
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:59,559
athletes like Eugene Monroe bu Williams

405
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:02,359
Taran Jones is uh when they are able to

406
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:04,159
consume larger amounts of CBD per

407
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,680
inhalation you know they feel a

408
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,480
substantially different effect and why

409
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,838
you know we've been uh really promoting

410
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,560
CBD use with our device uh we're getting

411
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:15,199
one over to Nate Diaz as well who had

412
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,838
been using the pen but um for whatever

413
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,838
reason you know um when the CBD is

414
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,519
combined with some of these TPS you know

415
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,880
we're noticing a much higher level of

416
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:26,078
pain relief for these athletes and you

417
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,198
know it's essentially why I've been

418
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,000
getting goosebumps every time I've been

419
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,679
you know fortunate enough to experience

420
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,679
them myself there you go sir that is the

421
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:38,000
same rosin with now the kovo or Coello

422
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:40,278
I'm not sure how you pronounce that

423
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,720
Valley in California I don't want to do

424
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:46,360
it Injustice but this is the sour diesel

425
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,278
tpin oh Sour Diesel give you a nice

426
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,879
little dip there and a nice reasonable

427
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:54,399
size rip the the efficiency of this unit

428
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,559
is also uh you put in big monster dabs

429
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,159
and you're definitely not going to be

430
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:00,958
getting through five or 10 of them in a

431
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:05,078
row cuz one one big monster dab will be

432
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:06,438
like 15 plus hits I got three light one

433
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:08,480
really good one and a couple of light

434
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,919
ones after that out of the one I put in

435
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,558
but I put in a really small dab like

436
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,919
substantially small I gave him a little

437
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:19,038
bit bigger one uh this time around and

438
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,600
I'll take a bigger one as well so nice

439
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,759
to see there's something really quite um

440
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,599
rewarding about seeing a clear piece

441
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:30,480
fill up with vapor and I also like

442
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:32,240
watching it travel down this pathway

443
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,200
I do never get tired of watching it

444
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,359
that's for sure and obviously this is

445
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,480
the beginning right now I I picture

446
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,279
maybe a little stand that's custom built

447
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,599
for your pipe or whatever that your pipe

448
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,759
is in place the unit is in place and

449
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,759
it's all one unit so we're not having to

450
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,879
hold it up but truly it's it might it's

451
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,798
not as awkward as it looks I wouldn't

452
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,280
trust just anyone with it that being

453
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:55,960
said this would definitely not be the

454
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,558
good idea to go down to the cchq lounge

455
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,880
and just blaze everyone down and go here

456
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:01,000
you go yeah you just fit it right in

457
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,120
into there definitely someone along the

458
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,558
line is going to do something that you

459
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,719
don't want them to do but uh it it's

460
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:09,798
working great for us well I think the

461
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,279
idea of a stand like this that could go

462
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,079
up and down right into this that's it

463
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,639
like this is locked in we didn't really

464
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,879
do this properly but this is a really

465
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,000
beautiful stand that Sable brought as a

466
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,159
gift it fits all of these little uh

467
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,079
these little units I think we're going

468
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,559
to get ones with holes drilled that fit

469
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:28,079
the tping jars I can picture that in the

470
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:30,798
future for sure uh at least Blue River

471
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,720
versions and uh then also the the little

472
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,720
mechanism here that maybe attaches

473
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,679
through holes so you can use different

474
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,880
size ones that fits the pipe right into

475
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,120
the unit yeah you know then then when

476
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,480
you move the whole unit um it would uh I

477
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,199
would also maybe put like a nice felt

478
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,279
you know so you can move it across the

479
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,038
table Yeah we we have rubber feet but we

480
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,918
have felt feet too that we can put on

481
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,599
the bottom but I like the way this locks

482
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,000
in so it doesn't get knocked over did

483
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,000
you get your rip already I did get my

484
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,839
rip thank you so much than dude I wasn't

485
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,079
like paying attention it's funny when

486
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:06,519
you're just loading you know thank you

487
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,158
I'm using the the dab tender so I I feel

488
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:11,200
blessed to have someone uh uh do it for

489
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:12,880
me for once I hope I'm doing it justice

490
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,200
you are you know you never you never

491
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,720
want to use someone's unit in a way that

492
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,200
is uh just not the way the unit was

493
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,440
designed to be used so if you were using

494
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,600
it incorrectly I would let you know you

495
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,840
are a pro I would appreciate that always

496
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:30,199
for sure so that was cavello and I'm GNA

497
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:33,519
hit that as well so you know yesterday I

498
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,519
heard you uh telling people about you

499
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,879
know kind of the methodology you guys

500
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,918
were using to create these Tarpin versus

501
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,760
you know how some other people create

502
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,480
tpin so not all people are using you

503
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,679
know uh uh same technology well right

504
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,960
off the bat for sure you know not it's

505
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,200
it's a pretty you have to have a a

506
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,200
commitment in your procedure and Tony

507
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,240
absolutely has commitment in his

508
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,038
procedure he's developed it himself you

509
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,839
know over the last year and a half to

510
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,720
two years and he's gotten to the point

511
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:07,558
where I can tell from just hitting the

512
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,038
different tpin and smelling them I've

513
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:12,480
only really tasted a few out there where

514
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:14,158
I was like this well it's whatever he's

515
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,919
doing is he's doing it right and and a

516
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,960
lot of them have just like off color off

517
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,559
taste little things that when you first

518
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,159
smell with your nose it's you learn to

519
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:25,759
decipher the difference between a real

520
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,400
gassy sort of like woo to something

521
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,038
that's not supposed to be there to

522
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,919
something that's not was not on the

523
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:32,319
plant when you smelled it right you know

524
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,280
and so this can be tpin that are

525
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,839
exchanging and changing into new tpin

526
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:39,038
based on heat so depending on how much

527
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:41,519
of that steam is being in contact with

528
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,359
the actual resin so there are tricks to

529
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,839
inverting and there are tricks to using

530
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:48,359
vacuums and there are tricks to using CH

531
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:51,079
chambers that cool things down Tony's

532
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:53,678
obviously come up with an incredible IP

533
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:55,678
and his tpin you know and I say his tpin

534
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,840
because I I don't make the tpin I do

535
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,320
represent Blue River here in Canada but

536
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,879
really the making of the tpin is Tony

537
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,439
and uh he's he's he's nailed it he's

538
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,039
done a great job and and that's not to

539
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,600
say that someone else isn't going to

540
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:11,440
nail it tomorrow but at this point in

541
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:14,240
time I don't promote Blue River because

542
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,519
I sell them I sell Blue River because I

543
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,558
promote them yeah I know I I get it

544
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:22,918
because uh when I became familiar with

545
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:25,798
tpin was with Blue River so unbeknown to

546
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,759
me I was experiencing it at the highest

547
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,879
level then

548
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,839
as the idea became more pervasive and

549
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,240
more and more people were doing it I got

550
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:39,399
to you know see other people's t or

551
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,240
whatever they wanted to call it and it

552
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,798
was different so when I heard you

553
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,278
explaining it to someone else I was like

554
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:46,038
oh that's why it's different well and

555
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:47,400
people are calling everything tpin we

556
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,759
should be specific when we call these

557
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,360
tpin that they're cannabis derived tpin

558
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,558
that they they were ratios derived from

559
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:57,798
Cannabis ratios they're they're accurate

560
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,200
ratios they're not mixes that we created

561
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:01,960
do you know what I mean right we're not

562
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,480
purchasing food grade tpin and then

563
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,640
making um mixtures in them and that

564
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,278
that's something that worries me because

565
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,320
cannabis has been producing tpine

566
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:13,400
profiles for us to inhale safely for

567
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:15,918
thousands of years but we don't

568
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,400
generally inhale pure tpin extracted

569
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,360
from lemons or pure Turpin extracted

570
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,240
from mangoes or or any of those things

571
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,839
so yeah it is really interesting that

572
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,200
the tarpine science you know where it's

573
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:31,599
derived from and what ratio and it's

574
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,880
really amazing that your body you know

575
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:37,000
has these such

576
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,679
pronounced um effects from you know

577
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,278
these different smells it really makes

578
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,640
you think about you know what you what

579
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:46,640
you eat as well and how all these things

580
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,679
synergistically work together well

581
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,480
exactly we've been talking about that in

582
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:53,840
um hash Church lately Dr Natasha uh rise

583
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,599
has been coming in and sharing some

584
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,798
beautiful information with us in regards

585
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,038
to how to activate the endoc canabo

586
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:01,158
system something will have a great

587
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,400
interest in of course through exercise

588
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:04,880
and through activity uh there are

589
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,919
different diets there are different

590
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,799
activities and diets that we can use to

591
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:11,200
actually activate our endoc canabo

592
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:14,319
system and these things will have a

593
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,038
great greater uh return as to say for

594
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:19,200
the experience that you have from that

595
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,919
amount in that particular time meaning

596
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,400
it's not just a runner's high that

597
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:24,159
you're getting when you're exercising

598
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,720
and you're using cannabis you can

599
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,840
actually somehow get that cannabis

600
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,558
seemingly communicating all over your

601
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:32,519
body and really feel the effects much

602
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,119
more intensely once once you're active

603
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,240
and it's why for me I've never been an

604
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,199
inactive cannabis user I'm not really a

605
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,720
couch and video game kind of guy not

606
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,480
saying that that's a bad thing you need

607
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,120
to do your enjoyment and relaxation but

608
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,480
I see some people getting sucked into

609
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,038
that and I think it would be great for

610
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,519
them to get out and go hiking get your

611
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:53,919
blood moving get oxygenated and it's it

612
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:57,240
to me for nothing else just to be able

613
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,278
to enjoy your cannabis Vibe on a whole

614
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,720
other level and then obviously realize

615
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:04,240
that's livity the importance of that is

616
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,558
incredible and it's just one more thing

617
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,720
cannabis is trying to tell you yeah you

618
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,000
know uh for me that man thank you for

619
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,440
saying that I mean I obviously an active

620
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,319
cannabis user as well U maybe not

621
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,798
obvious but that's what we try to proot

622
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:19,558
to me it's obvious and you know this

623
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:22,400
device is kind of like the first step of

624
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:24,879
you know how do we deliver the canono in

625
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,278
like the safest healthiest way but you

626
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,720
know let's be honest like cannabis is

627
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:32,640
also like enjoyable thing so how do we

628
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,759
make it fun for the user to use so you

629
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,559
know I really loved dabbing but there

630
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:39,558
were a few things that you know

631
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,678
especially I'm 39 I have you know

632
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:44,879
friends that are in their late 20s I

633
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,640
mean sorry late 20s in their late 40s um

634
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,320
and for them like the torch and nail was

635
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,278
just something visually that was hard

636
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,000
for them to get over there's no denying

637
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:54,200
that the torch and nail is is hard to

638
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,558
get over it's it's

639
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,120
hardcore it is hard it just is and way

640
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:01,440
before dabbing occurred like in the '90s

641
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,839
before it was named and I'm sure there's

642
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,399
people that are watching this laughing

643
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:05,839
we were doing that in the 70s of course

644
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:07,678
you were you were taking oil and putting

645
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,678
it on a hot metal substance and inhaling

646
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,120
it of course that's been around for 40

647
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,159
plus years I'm not denying maybe

648
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,918
thousands maybe thousands you know off

649
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,200
the coal cuz I remember traveling in

650
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:19,840
Guatemala nothing else but some oil and

651
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,880
being like dropping a a drop on a coal

652
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,439
that was just burning red hot and clean

653
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,399
and it was like man I'm dabbing in

654
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,919
Guatemala that was

655
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:30,479
1998 but uh yeah back then we would hit

656
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,520
the man a this crazy contraption that my

657
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,558
friends made and uh yeah it was

658
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:37,398
definitely uh some Next Level [ __ ] we'd

659
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:40,440
bring that stuff to a party and it was a

660
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:42,719
blowtorch that had a spoon bent over top

661
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,519
of the to the torch and they would heat

662
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,200
up the spoon and then there was a glass

663
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,119
Bell that went up into a buong it was

664
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,840
super ghetto and really hardcore and it

665
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:52,038
scared people yeah when you showed up at

666
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,839
a party and and not people in their late

667
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:57,319
40s young people were freaked out by it

668
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:00,519
they were like what the it didn't pass

669
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:02,278
the mom test did not pass the mom test

670
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:05,519
so it's kind of a neat thing that you've

671
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:07,839
done here because you know did did this

672
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,158
ever exist before you came up with this

673
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,359
concept of like sliding the I I've never

674
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,000
seen it before uh you know it's it's one

675
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:19,558
of those things where um it was actually

676
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,679
designed for flowers and um as we were

677
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:25,720
designing this device uh concentrates

678
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,399
became very popular so uh during the R&amp;D

679
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,480
process uh we wanted to make it a hybrid

680
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:33,158
device but we also didn't want it to be

681
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,558
like really good at flour and just

682
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:38,520
average at concentrates so uh luckily

683
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,759
the design that we came up with for

684
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,359
flowers was able to be transferred over

685
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:46,200
to the oil side and apply you know not

686
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,519
all but most of the technology um you

687
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,480
know we were able to create a device

688
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:53,960
that I think is is really good at both

689
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,679
and um ultimately I think for especially

690
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,759
a lot of uh uh uh cannabis users that

691
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:02,440
are athletes or are very active um being

692
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:05,640
able to get the canabo without any of

693
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,159
the fats waxes lipids or plant matter

694
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,278
you know um it is more congruent with

695
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,159
that type of diet and uh you know I

696
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:16,558
believe allows you to be a much more

697
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,760
active cannabis user as well awesome I'm

698
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,720
just like at getting the the dab here

699
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:22,720
and thinking of all the haters on

700
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,159
YouTube going Bubble Man didn't dip he

701
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,919
didn't clean his Dabber and he was

702
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,840
dipping it into different cpin I'll have

703
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,799
you know that I'm only dipping the tip

704
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:34,319
of the hash into the tpin and not the

705
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:36,000
titanium portion of the Dabber it's

706
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,918
crazy when you start editing and doing

707
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,119
so many of these videos that you become

708
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,840
so aware of the things that PE you're

709
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:43,678
just trying to you're trying to share

710
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,119
these great messages that you feel are

711
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,720
important and it's just you know what I

712
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,639
said it the other day when I was talk we

713
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,519
were talking to Jeremiah and jod I said

714
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,399
you know we don't really get to create

715
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,798
reality exactly how we want it we get to

716
00:27:55,398 --> 00:28:00,079
we get to manifest but often it does not

717
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:01,720
man EST the way you think it will for

718
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:05,240
instance he just said this thing was

719
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:08,480
designed for flowers and to me it is a

720
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,720
100% concentration unit to to me you

721
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,319
know like I'm not saying you can't use

722
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,200
flowers I've put them in the basket and

723
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:16,398
it's great but I just would rather

724
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,600
concentrate the resin off the flowers

725
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:21,119
and use that to me that makes so much

726
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:23,359
more sense and it's uh yeah you can't uh

727
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,678
we fight for things and we fought for

728
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:28,678
cannabis to be you know allowed and and

729
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,600
more normalized here in Canada and and

730
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:33,440
uh to me we've won quite a bit down in

731
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:34,879
California you guys have won quite a bit

732
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,360
is it perfect no are people going to

733
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,840
jail still and being arrested yes but

734
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:40,599
the fact that we have these places that

735
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,319
we can go and buy cannabis and

736
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:45,240
concentrates and that these machines

737
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:48,639
exist that you can inhale them with damn

738
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,480
near per through Perfection is a is a

739
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,919
pretty big win and I think that we

740
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,399
should start congratulating ourselves a

741
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,159
little bit and sort of maybe even

742
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,158
throwing a little celebration and saying

743
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,120
hey we got we got some substantial [ __ ]

744
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,880
done in the last 25 years you know I

745
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:05,119
mean uh there's still more work to be

746
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,799
done but I feel like you I mean uh we

747
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,518
have made so much progress I mean I'm

748
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:10,440
wearing this shirt today power plant

749
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,839
Fitness you know this is the gym that

750
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,000
Ricky Williams and Jim McAlpine are a

751
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:19,119
part of that is going to open in the San

752
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,398
Francisco Bay area that um oops uh

753
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,678
allows you to

754
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:25,639
consume cannabis before you work out and

755
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,159
the machines that you will be consuming

756
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,480
cannabis with will be these nice baby

757
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:33,880
dude that's amazing that is really cool

758
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,399
yeah I mean you know just uh I mean even

759
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,559
a year ago this idea if I spoke about it

760
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,959
to people I think they would just kind

761
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:44,599
of scoff and say it was a you know a

762
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,360
pipe dream no pun intended but dude I'm

763
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:48,158
now the wheels are in motion so for so

764
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:51,719
many years since doing back country

765
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,240
Photography in like 2010 and 2011 and

766
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,000
being in the back country with skiers

767
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,440
and snowboarders that were just super

768
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,278
inspirational and that I saw were using

769
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,759
cannabis as their inspiration more so

770
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,200
than anything else but because of

771
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:06,240
sponsorships and whatnot the lack of

772
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,600
normalization it was like it had to be

773
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,480
hidden and it's it's it takes a lot for

774
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,959
these football players to come out and

775
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,759
talk about this I'll tell you because

776
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,278
there are multi-million dollar careers

777
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,278
at stake and when you see someone like

778
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:20,759
Ricky Williams choose to promote

779
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:24,519
cannabis over um his multi-million

780
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:27,558
dollar career it's really hard to argue

781
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:30,679
with the Integrity of such a cat yeah I

782
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:33,519
mean you know know like okay so what

783
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:36,278
could his agenda possibly be if he gave

784
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,798
up millions of dollars to do this right

785
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:42,640
I would think his agenda is to educate

786
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:45,278
and help I mean uh even more recently

787
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,320
Eugene Monroe who's been very vocal

788
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:49,319
about this I mean he was an active

789
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:51,678
player and he was you know telling the

790
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:53,918
league to look at CBD and cannaboids as

791
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,519
a way to help the players recover from

792
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,880
these intense exercises and you know I

793
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:03,159
told him the first time I met him like

794
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,480
to me he had so much to lose that you

795
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:07,278
know just having him come out like he

796
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,038
had all the respect in the world for me

797
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:12,159
because of what he had on you know on

798
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:14,960
the line for saying what he was saying

799
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:18,399
and um you know I think he brought a lot

800
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:22,319
of attention to uh not Justa uh can uh

801
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:23,678
cannabis but CBD uh uh in particular and

802
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,158
you know I'm having people from all

803
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,120
walks of life ask me about it that I

804
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,039
never would have imagined you you know

805
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:34,599
would even consider cannabis as a a way

806
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:36,558
for them to heal and um it it's cool to

807
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:39,240
be part of you know just a small part of

808
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,678
this movement no it really is man it's h

809
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,200
it's coming a long way and of course

810
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,360
it's speeding up you know if you ever

811
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,120
read I think it was Art Bell that wrote

812
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:50,959
a book called The quickening and it was

813
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:53,918
uh it was crazy David Ike actually but

814
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,639
uh showed a beautiful metaphor of how

815
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,960
the way we share information is

816
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:00,959
exponentially growing and the metaphor

817
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,798
that he used was a giant dinner plate

818
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,000
and he takes a dinner plate and he

819
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:08,480
wobbles it on a table so it's doing this

820
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,319
sort of thing and it's going W woo W woo

821
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,679
W woo and he's like okay that was like a

822
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,038
thousand years ago and then it starts

823
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,320
going W woo W woo W woo W woo and he's

824
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:17,440
like that was like a couple hundred

825
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:20,638
years ago and then it starts

826
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,120
going and he's like that's now and then

827
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:26,278
right before it stops it's just

828
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:28,199
like and then it stops which is also

829
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:31,200
gets into Terrence McKenna's time wave

830
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,038
zero it's pretty interesting stuff uh to

831
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,440
look into there's definitely the amount

832
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:40,000
of information that is passing every day

833
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:43,720
every hour is like more than what passed

834
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,119
a 100 years ago in maybe a week yeah so

835
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,919
that's a concentration that can only

836
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:51,079
every system reaches Q in engineering

837
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:53,720
right Q is like the maximum that any

838
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:56,798
system can can take before it basically

839
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,839
either stops or disintegrates so it's an

840
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:00,440
interesting time that we're living

841
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,240
living in of of massive amounts of

842
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,159
incredible energy and people like Eugene

843
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,240
Monroe and yourself and Ricky and all

844
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,919
these great people that are just uh

845
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,519
they're standing up to normalize

846
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:14,840
cannabis use in everyday life in

847
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:19,240
professional sports in um you know

848
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:20,798
pallative and homeopathic care canabo

849
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,720
pathic whatever that word that Lester

850
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,278
grinspoon came up with canab canaba

851
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,960
pathic they're so hard to say it's a

852
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:30,440
great term whatever it is I wish I

853
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,120
didn't train re I apologize uh Lester

854
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,200
but uh yeah I think I'm going to hit

855
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:36,199
this beautiful rip that I smell that's

856
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,278
how I feel when I try to pronounce

857
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,679
certain Tarpin um I I read about them

858
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,359
all the time and then when I have a

859
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:45,080
conversation with someone and I actually

860
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:47,959
have to say the name of it it always

861
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:49,960
comes out like really jumbled and

862
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,558
disjointed yeah I hear you well it

863
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,600
couldn't be anything worse than what I

864
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:57,960
just did to be

865
00:33:53,599 --> 00:34:00,599
cibopath uh word so um what what was

866
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:04,200
that last tpine that we just experienced

867
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:06,038
push cleaner oh yes dude and uh was that

868
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,000
still the hash plant rosin or a

869
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:10,800
different rosin no that was a different

870
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,039
rosin okay that was the sweet skunk and

871
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,599
the reason I put the sweet skunk in

872
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:16,719
there is because that cleaner from the

873
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,359
jack is really sort of sativa and exotic

874
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:22,598
and of course the sweet skunk has um

875
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,358
sweet skunk is not skunk at all so

876
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:26,159
there's uh there's some there's some

877
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:29,440
nice uh cultivar in there but it it is

878
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,000
not skunk oh I assumed it was skunk

879
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,000
because of its name um PR Steve told me

880
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,320
that uh Mark had run out of all his

881
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,639
skunk seeds on the menu and so he was

882
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,919
like we need something skunk and he was

883
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,599
like I got these and I can't remember

884
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,279
what the name was but he was just like

885
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,720
Mark just named them sweet skunk which

886
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,879
is incredible might have annoyed me back

887
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:49,519
then I probably would have been like you

888
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,960
can't do that but after so many years of

889
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,559
it being a favorite cultivar that the

890
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,440
name is is a part of it to me and it's

891
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,358
uh I kind of yeah I just went with it

892
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,800
yeah well the name is just to describe

893
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:03,400
something so exactly and Chimera

894
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,880
mentioned it in hash church one day

895
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:08,680
hopefully we'll be able to the names of

896
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,200
these cultivars will be you know below

897
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:14,239
that will be what makes that up what is

898
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:15,358
in it what are the cannabinoid profiles

899
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,919
and what are the Turpin and the

900
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,559
terpenoids because that's uh that's what

901
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,920
it actually is you know orange

902
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:23,719
creamsicle okay what it's orangey and

903
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,960
creamic actually it is we should

904
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:27,759
probably hit that one next yes well

905
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,119
isn't that aren't people doing that

906
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,760
already uh today where they are starting

907
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:34,720
to you know come up with you know the

908
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,000
the profiles oh yeah slowly but surely

909
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:39,679
but I mean like the full profile you

910
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,679
know like there's there's a potential

911
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,919
150 tpin that we could be testing for

912
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:47,039
and most places test for I mean most

913
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,720
cannabis cultivars nowadays only have

914
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,440
the same 10 to 12 right and that's a lot

915
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:53,919
to do with prohibition based growing

916
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,519
where you grow for the greedy purpose of

917
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,480
how much can you get and how fast can

918
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:00,318
you get it because if you were to train

919
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,119
only a specific way you would learn

920
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:05,440
quickly that the blind spots that you

921
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:07,519
left behind would be would be vast you

922
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,800
know they they got rid of a lot of

923
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,000
profiles by cutting down flowering

924
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,240
periods people that would only grow 6

925
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,838
weeks seven weeks drains well that means

926
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:21,719
all the 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18

927
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:23,719
19 20 21 22 week drains are all going to

928
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:26,519
be more rare because no one's taking the

929
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:28,399
time to produce them and those cultivars

930
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:30,199
grown in different countries produced

931
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,800
different cannaboids that we also don't

932
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:35,199
see in everyday strains we don't see

933
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,359
thcv and we don't see a lot of CBG or

934
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:40,759
CBC and there's cannaboids quite a few

935
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:43,559
of them that we don't see because and I

936
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,240
this is my theory that cannabis uh

937
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:48,880
prohibition based growing sort of you

938
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:51,358
know cut a lot of that out is

939
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,079
unfortunate really yeah it makes sense I

940
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:59,039
mean people were just growing high THC

941
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:00,359
strains right yep yeah yeah

942
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:03,920
it's fascinating reading all the

943
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:07,039
research on the various avonoids and how

944
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,880
they help the body I I had a chance to

945
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:12,119
sit down with one of the uh Chief

946
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,240
scientists from steep hill and uh he was

947
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:18,960
explaining how CBG has been helping his

948
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:21,759
father recover from a stroke and uh his

949
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,679
father is an oncologist and a few years

950
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:29,000
ago or maybe two years ago um suffered a

951
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:33,078
stroke where uh uh he was a essentially

952
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,480
um from the neck down you know paralyzed

953
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:38,480
jeez and uh for 6 months they went

954
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,358
through all the standard um therapies

955
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,440
and medications that one would go

956
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:44,920
through when they suffered the stroke

957
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,079
and then not too much progress and as

958
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,079
you can imagine

959
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:53,000
um uh uh was getting desperate so they

960
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,240
started administering CBG she pushing

961
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,239
out on you look at that well I'll finish

962
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:58,959
the story later that's a good rip I've

963
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:00,679
never seen it push out of the tube like

964
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,280
that I seen it come out just gently from

965
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:05,799
here before but she was climbing all the

966
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,720
way up yeah that was orange creamsicle

967
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,519
with congales rosin so that's going to

968
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,199
be yeah that's going to be a wow for

969
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:15,559
that's what I was assuming it would be

970
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:18,039
right there better have one of

971
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:19,318
those and please do finish that store

972
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:22,440
because I certainly didn't mean to cut

973
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:22,440
you off I just

974
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:30,679
uh well just to get cut to the point um

975
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:35,358
after 6 months uh he was able

976
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:38,679
to uh go back to practicing medicine so

977
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:40,358
they have been documenting this and uh

978
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:44,199
you know hopefully in time we'll be able

979
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:45,960
to to share this story incredible yeah

980
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:48,159
but to

981
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,599
me you know when people are talking

982
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,679
about whether this

983
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,960
is a medicine or just you know something

984
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:57,039
that people like to you know recreate

985
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,800
with you know I like it it's such a

986
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,599
silly argument

987
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,880
because if you believe in any type of

988
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:07,838
science yeah that's what I say just let

989
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,838
us have it please all of

990
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,839
us so I think that congales dreamsicle

991
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:17,200
was my favorite thus far it had the most

992
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:19,199
like uh complexity and depth to the

993
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:21,919
flavor

994
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:26,639
um I don't think I could even articulate

995
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,639
the flavor except that it was um

996
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,199
very very enjoyable um there's like a

997
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:35,199
nuttiness I don't know that I always get

998
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:43,800
whoa it was almost coconuty on the

999
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:46,640
exhale it was almost and but like creamy

1000
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:50,318
coconutty like almost like suntan lotion

1001
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:52,719
but not like or a p

1002
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:55,079
colada not bad like not the way you

1003
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:59,239
would expect like I hate this taste of P

1004
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:02,119
Cola but that was amazing

1005
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:04,719
Jesus I think that congales rosin is a

1006
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:07,838
really good base to be uh dipping into

1007
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:11,598
the cuz we had the congales with the

1008
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:13,719
cleaner yesterday and uh that one had me

1009
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,359
goosebumps for a good five

1010
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:17,358
minutes this is so

1011
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:25,519
good I just want to see this available

1012
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,000
to more people you know like I just

1013
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:31,239
think that it would be a cool thing

1014
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,800
for people to have access to Great

1015
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:36,358
tasting you know having the conversation

1016
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,318
with Jeremiah and jod emry the other day

1017
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:40,440
um where where it was like you know like

1018
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:42,800
what's the most important relationship

1019
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,200
that you have with

1020
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:49,400
cannabis other than the way it makes you

1021
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:51,960
feel and the smell of course of course

1022
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,200
it absolutely has to be the smell it's

1023
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,720
the flavor profile and The Taste and the

1024
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:58,358
smell and that's you know that's what

1025
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:01,039
the Tony he's done with these Blue River

1026
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:05,199
turpins he's just pulled them out in the

1027
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:06,559
most beautiful of manners and uh I'm

1028
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:08,919
happy to share it with people I'm happy

1029
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,519
to share it with you uh I'm very stoked

1030
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,519
that you came up with the vapexhale and

1031
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:14,440
I look forward to some uh potential

1032
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:17,239
future collaborations with the bubble

1033
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,559
man and the vapix halil team you built

1034
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:22,479
an incredible team and I'm definitely

1035
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:26,239
excited to see where the future leads

1036
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,880
vapix hail and Sabo yeah well I believe

1037
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:32,598
this

1038
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:34,519
this and this it at this point that is

1039
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:37,160
like the tippity top of how you could

1040
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:39,318
experience cannabis absolutely you can't

1041
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:42,879
fake the Goosebumps that I get you know

1042
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:44,279
it it it's no sales pitch here I mean

1043
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,960
that's what I'm saying and I've even

1044
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,400
made a point on and I'm sure you've

1045
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,280
probably done it with your unit as well

1046
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,920
where you're just like for the turps I

1047
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,599
just thought I have to step back for

1048
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,119
like a week or two and just like cuz I

1049
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:56,318
got so deep in and I was like I just

1050
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,960
love these things people like oh it's

1051
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:59,719
hype it's hype people that clearly had

1052
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,318
never done it every single person I've

1053
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:05,279
ever given a dab to has been like wow

1054
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:07,519
that's what they always say and so I

1055
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,280
just felt like uh I needed to pull back

1056
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:12,039
make sure that there was no hype or

1057
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,519
anything confusing me or any sort of and

1058
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:16,679
I didn't have TPS for probably more than

1059
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:19,119
a week actually and getting this these

1060
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:22,759
seven vials was just

1061
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,079
like thank you yes yes absolutely it's

1062
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,200
like your favorite sauce on your

1063
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,318
favorite meal Pizza without sauce is Noy

1064
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,838
I know well when I was little I used to

1065
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:34,358
really like reading those books where

1066
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:36,880
you could you know choose um you know

1067
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:40,318
either option A or option b me too yeah

1068
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,960
I feel like go to page 74 if if you want

1069
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,358
to jump off the cliff I was going to say

1070
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,280
look over the cliff that's so funny oh

1071
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:49,119
my gosh so I believe you know these

1072
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,839
Tarpin um especially with that first one

1073
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:54,519
the uh the Kush or the hash plant yeah

1074
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:56,039
it was has um you know I felt like

1075
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:58,599
because that was more of like a blank

1076
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:01,480
palet it really kind of took on the

1077
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:03,920
flavor of exactly how that smelled

1078
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:07,199
whereas when we had the congales as the

1079
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,680
base um especially with something so

1080
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:13,439
different like orange yeah it just uh

1081
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:15,558
the synergies of it was undenied it was

1082
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,318
next level Next Level I usually hit the

1083
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,160
Kush cleaner with the Congo because of

1084
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:21,599
that cleaner and that sort of sativa

1085
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:23,879
flavor or sweet skunk but uh I thought

1086
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,000
you know what he wants orange creamsicle

1087
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,000
it's our last rip and we haven't hit the

1088
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,119
Congo yet you also notice the vibe from

1089
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,760
the Congo is it's that's one that I

1090
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:35,680
would be working out with you will

1091
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,079
people will learn at that gym that there

1092
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,719
are cultivars that are congruent to

1093
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,760
getting them to working out yeah so um

1094
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,439
down in California one strain that seems

1095
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,599
to be very popular is the red congales I

1096
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,318
don't know how similar it is to this one

1097
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:54,200
right here right but um I

1098
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:55,960
do uh we have this other company can of

1099
00:43:54,199 --> 00:44:00,439
athlete that is making this recovery

1100
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:02,920
serum and whenever we can get uh uh our

1101
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:07,039
uh distillate made with this type of

1102
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:09,400
trim um we believe it is congruent with

1103
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,119
the feelings that you would need to

1104
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,079
perform at a high level after you

1105
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:17,599
consume cannabis where you get like the

1106
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:21,480
focus with the relaxation I guess uh you

1107
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,519
know more closer to Flow State and um

1108
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,800
yeah I mean I think this is a strain

1109
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:29,239
like you said is really congruent if you

1110
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,559
want to um you know do some sort of

1111
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:33,679
activity that requires like dexterity

1112
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,960
like maybe wakeboarding or yep

1113
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:38,358
snowboarding so absolutely yeah well

1114
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,760
it'll be interesting to see where it all

1115
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:43,440
goes in the next upcoming years I'm

1116
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:46,000
definitely uh I'm in it for the long

1117
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,639
haul this industry has had me for 20

1118
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,679
plus years and I don't see it letting go

1119
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:53,239
anytime soon so going to keep on

1120
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:55,919
enjoying incredible technology and

1121
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:58,318
learning as much as I can about that

1122
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,920
technology and these processes and the

1123
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:01,838
