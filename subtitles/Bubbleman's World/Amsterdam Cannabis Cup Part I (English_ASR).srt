00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:34,099
please oh my god but this isn't fun oh

3
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:49,408
my god I [ __ ] cannot believe it holy

4
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,058
[ __ ] this is [ __ ] up

5
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:53,058
with my detailed exposed

6
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,820
Oh

7
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,919
[Music]

8
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:14,280
oh I could just cry I could just hey

9
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:17,280
guys welcome to bubble man's world and

10
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,250
welcome to I'm Saddam I'm here at the

11
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,740
hotel crowds in the Polsky in my room on

12
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,689
the main canal here and just really just

13
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,900
super stoked to be here I'll tell ya I

14
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:29,669
got here I got a little excited I set

15
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,710
everything up I was ready to have a hit

16
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:35,399
with you guys and then I looked and I

17
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:38,909
realized I plugged in the D nail only

18
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,250
into a converter and not an actual power

19
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:44,159
like it doesn't convert the power it was

20
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,930
more like it changed the plug but it

21
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,370
didn't really change the power so this

22
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,920
has happened to me many many many times

23
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,020
and what happened is that boots this

24
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,750
whip so I pushed this whip and I boots

25
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,909
this bowl because it works with that

26
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,580
bowl so this bowl again is fine it just

27
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:02,879
needs to get another perfect sized whip

28
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,980
for it how ever the guys at D nail have

29
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,639
sent me this other whip with a much

30
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:10,319
smaller hole and a much smaller bowl so

31
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,879
it's a little smaller of a bowl than I'm

32
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,819
used to hitting off of but I gotta tell

33
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:18,989
you to have something as opposed to

34
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:21,239
nothing is huge so I'm very happy got

35
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:28,500
some beautiful sweets junk dry sift here

36
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:30,030
that's just ready to pop and good

37
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,819
cannabis cup I've already been in touch

38
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,500
with Gendo and Mike and they're

39
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,479
hopefully gonna hook up with us a little

40
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,099
later on today I'm waiting for Tony Tony

41
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,259
will be arriving in a couple of hours

42
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,120
and I might just go head on over to

43
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:46,079
skunk man Sam's house he's hanging out

44
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,250
with Robin canal Clark and I think that

45
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
it would be nice for me to go over there

46
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,400
and pop some bowls I highly doubt it

47
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,139
that they're gonna let me pull the

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,120
camera out but if they do I will

49
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:56,369
absolutely get a little quote from each

50
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,099
one of them skunk man sounds very very

51
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,840
non camera friendly so it's very

52
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,189
unlikely but we're all by Betty gives me

53
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,930
a little bit of an interview so kick

54
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:06,239
space to stay tuned for that on bubble

55
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,510
man's world and for now let's have a

56
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,509
riff

57
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:30,250
well I am in a non-smoking room so I

58
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,508
probably will blow this outside why

59
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:42,459
don't I show you guys what's going on

60
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:44,020
out there so we got a little bit of

61
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:46,418
construction happen in here they're

62
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:47,500
working on the canal down in front of

63
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:49,839
the place you can see they've got a

64
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,860
little bit of a thing set up right up in

65
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,859
front of the bulldog

66
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:59,409
and just down that way see the building

67
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,310
with the green awning

68
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:05,470
that is the world-famous greenhouse

69
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:10,290
where you'll see Franco and Arion and

70
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,290
the rest of the greenhouse crew so

71
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,569
Amsterdam in a nutshell is a really cool

72
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,509
place it's nice to arrive on a day with

73
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:21,129
a little bit of blue sky no rain and a

74
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:23,019
really nice warm temperature it's got to

75
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:24,850
be 10 or 11 degrees Celsius right now

76
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:26,379
it's unfortunate that there's a little

77
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:31,930
bit of noise out there but we can close

78
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:37,209
that off in a hurry and in the morning

79
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:39,340
for me right now for and just really

80
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:41,370

81

84

85
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,939
and Mike I'm probably gonna end up just

86
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,370
jumping in a cab and going and seeing my

87
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:57,699

these guys are talking right now and I

100
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,879
thought I would bring you guys in

101
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:29,019
because it was a great conversation and

102
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,240

104
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:38,439
in the Gold Coast just walked in the in

105
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,670
the door and introduce yourselves go

106
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,839
around and tell us a little bit about

107
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,840
yourself for bubbleman's world

108
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:54,899
hell yeah and you guys got some entries

109
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:56,639
this year we do and what's what's going

110
00:06:54,899 --> 00:07:04,499
in into the Cup this year from Gold

111
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:15,689
Coast we have some flowers are they

112
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:18,360
mentionable yeah we have a Crockett came

113
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:20,338
around speaking at EC labs Toni was just

114
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:27,838
talking about how he tasted all the

115
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:28,379
different oh geez and the flavors and

116
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:30,988
the taste

117
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:32,489
I mean Toni's high on [ __ ] taste right

118
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:34,348
now and it's really great that he is

119
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:36,058
because because of it he's got these

120
00:07:34,348 --> 00:07:39,269
incredible pure terpenes and he's

121
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:41,338
extracted off the plants and instead of

122
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:43,619
just hitting full you know pure dabs of

123
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:46,050
dry sifter wet wash we're finding that

124
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:47,669
sometimes he'll mix the terpenes in with

125
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,829
the hash with a little technique that

126
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,688
he's got and other times he'll just drop

127
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:54,088
it right on the on the dapper right

128
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,979
after you've hit your your hash kind of

129
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:57,959
juicer like a chaser interpretations

130
00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:00,899
that seems to be the best way it happens

131
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:03,809
to be really a great way so let's keep

132
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:21,119
going around we're at Brandon Brandon

133
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:22,919
Brandon sorry tripping so you did when

134
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:26,189
was this this was this is a recent piece

135
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:30,258
right I have it's brand new Rob's never

136
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:30,259
about fast pictures of these things

137
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:36,808
social media I haven't seen a that comes

138
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:38,639
in three pieces hold on and so what do

139
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,679
we this is a seriously that I would

140
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:46,980
guess extremely valuable piece of glass

141
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:49,078
I'm shaking holding it thirty and forty

142
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,839
thousand dollar pieces and he's like

143
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:54,179
this and it's like then he leaves he's

144
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,490
like a few left repeat they left they

145
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:59,508
left an ftk at my house one time a real

146
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:07,558
big one like this Big Lots lime green a

147
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:10,199
flying saucer all the mothership perks

148
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:12,088
it's got the bad egg which is just a

149
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:13,729
straight and then it's got no it's

150
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:17,370
actually blown out and then it's got the

151
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,829
torus and then the flying as well so

152
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,240
completely ridiculous piece much like

153
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:28,019
the one you brought I say we do a

154
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:29,579
session with that yeah are you love the

155
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:32,188
thing about quartz is this is hot as

156
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:34,078
[ __ ] like half an inch above my fingers

157
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:36,419
but you can always pull it out no

158
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:38,000
problem like the way quartz dissipates

159
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:42,289
heat this isn't hot this is like

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,289
brand-new hot yeah this is not

161
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,790
actually you can't do it with less you

162
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,100
don't this was a glass bowl it would be

163
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:51,599
hot right there fingers describe your

164
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,670
fingers I can even feel the heat as this

165
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,379
finger climbs I'd say right here is

166
00:09:53,669 --> 00:10:09,500
where it's really quite hot I can touch

167
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:09,500
here I'm excited bro so so weird oh yeah

168
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,460
James James you were the first you you

169
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:18,870
two were the first students I met and I

170
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:20,160
met them via heady heads which is your

171
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,100
brother and I've never actually met

172
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,539
Haddie but I I saw him come across I

173
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,750
think it was through Instagram and

174
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:32,069
immediately it's interesting how you can

175
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:34,879
find out the quality for via the quality

176
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:42,379
it's like if you have this following

177
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:44,549
generally wizard throws that all into

178
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:46,679
disarray because he's not really the

179
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:48,059
highest quality deeply not having ever

180
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,649
met your brother I believe he's a pretty

181
00:10:48,059 --> 00:11:06,629
high quality dude because when I saw

182
00:10:49,649 --> 00:11:08,189
those photos right away I was like sure

183
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:09,629
hope he does man really like the

184
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,060
palpable in his hash and I'd love to

185
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:13,730
know I wish he was here the session like

186
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,679
this which is pretty much every session

187
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:22,100
that we have had since we've been here

188
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:22,099
quality folks pure Terps and then

189
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:33,490
because he threw that around the other

190
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:36,399
day and people like Tony also extracted

191
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,500
pure anthocyanins which is the color

192
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,240
that climbs up the capitate stalks and

193
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,279
the glandular trichomes when you've seen

194
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,490
my macro photographs many of you asked

195
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,809
over the years what is that purple color

196
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,450
that's anthocyanin and it's an

197
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:51,099
antioxidant and Tony has also extracted

198
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,990
a pure form of that so I'll take a

199
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,480
picture of it with the Mack macro camera

200
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,399
so you guys can see it plus we want to

201
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,320
see this under the macro be interesting

202
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,720
hey we do that in a few minutes once we

203
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,720
start it look like fiber stop filming so

204
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,570
what can you say we should with the

205
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,670
sweet face triceps for sure oh so Kay's

206
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:13,750
terpene no numbers first

207
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:15,719
okay just sweet sustainable person you

208
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,710
don't want to stain the bone see that

209
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,330
sometimes strip teams can do that we

210
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:23,170
were talking about them my body stains

211
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:26,740
Matt but I never eat Angie

212
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:28,719
Jilly and Callie oh all very citrusy and

213
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,190
order smelly and that's why if you keep

214
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,379
drying it out of my mother ship right

215
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:37,230
now it basically tastes like that Julie

216
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:39,909
I told them I told a hint of coffee I

217
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:43,120
said I said you know the tansy is kind

218
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:45,289
of like the in spinal tap where you like

219
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,029
the guys talking about his skin

220
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:49,769
yeah you're like alright man alright man

221
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:51,750
I know it goes to 11

222
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,669
alright I know it's loud I know it's

223
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,460
louder than anyone else again but after

224
00:12:53,669 --> 00:13:00,659
after 11:00 after that's the best then

225
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:02,280
let's talk about 1090 you know because

226
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:03,509
of the TNT sellout it's like everyone

227
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,850
tries to compared to those like you

228
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:08,519
can't it's an 11 it's my pain somebody

229
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,159
Cup teams everything barb is around it

230
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,189
Barb's around the ten ten point five

231
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:16,139
when it's full Malcolm Deborah and I've

232
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:19,290
only ever made it from seed crops

233
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:21,269
so it's seeded barb if he's just got so

234
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:23,579
much of he cures it four weeks to a

235
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:25,470
month plus before he even does like this

236
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,750
a shake and then he'll collect like a

237
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,940
half pound full bag of barb like just a

238
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,070
big giant bag of yellow pollen it's it

239
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:36,860
gets incredible and keep that for like a

240
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,860
month or two and then get his means

241
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:43,948
three little bottles or three big pumps

242
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:45,478
or maybe one big pile kind of a medium

243
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:48,528
pile in a really small pile which is

244
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:51,209
generally the pilot most of us with one

245
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:55,798
we never hit the big it just never works

246
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:57,748
like that I wish it did but you're

247
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:58,619
dealing with things like well terpenes

248
00:13:57,749 --> 00:14:00,719
are so different

249
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:03,028
Kirra glandular trichomes even the other

250
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:04,469
side there's such small amounts of this

251
00:14:03,028 --> 00:14:06,688
when you look at this you have to

252
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:09,559
imagine how this is probably from

253
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:12,269
several planets or one huge giant planet

254
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:16,228
just a tiny little like half gram of

255
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:20,658
that decided small amounts of these

256
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:20,658
things so who's next up on the shoot

257
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:26,938
these guys literally just flew in so but

258
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,558
probably in the situation that Tony and

259
00:14:26,938 --> 00:14:30,389
I were in yesterday although it's hard

260
00:14:28,558 --> 00:14:33,178
to say who the server we puffed

261
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:39,178
yesterday I mean we've had tough but

262
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:41,749
those guys puff toffee love to star

263
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,749
yesterday

264
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:48,899
yesterday yesterday so this is basically

265
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,269
what we're going to be doing a ton of I

266
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:52,620
want to invite you guys into some of

267
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:54,569
these sessions with some of these heady

268
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,250
folks that we hang out with I mean I'm

269
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,530
not even surprised that Brett when I

270
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:01,049
first saw Brendan I've seen him for

271
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,669
years but not really like connected with

272
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:07,559
it but always known him to have some

273
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:10,229
sick piece of glass I met you we talked

274
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:13,229
last year at the only show at the marce

275
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,629
Marcel and Deline and we did a damn

276
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:18,269
crane you had I took photos of Artie

277
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:33,320
Reese's you had you had a mummy

278
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:33,319
money shot I got or your money was

279
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,690
literally the whole cup that was the one

280
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,329
shot that I was like that's our

281
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:46,340
hysterics done I framed it right and the

282
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:49,620
piece looks so [ __ ] like gangster

283
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,840
yeah capture that trip yeah really for

284
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,029
me - that is my last year Canada stuff

285
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,960
and you might have even had it in the

286
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:59,009
yellow Pelican case orange hard to

287
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,430
remember these things but that's pretty

288
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:12,179
good

289
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:15,379
can't remember the guys name worship all

290
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,379
right you just hit

291
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:28,759
yeah let's crack the window fishing if

292
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:30,079
we set off a fire alarm here in

293
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,679
Amsterdam we're looking at about a five

294
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:35,420
thousand dollar euro 5,000 euro feed so

295
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,370
if the fire department gets dispatched

296
00:16:35,419 --> 00:17:06,710
that happened three minutes of the alarm

297
00:16:37,370 --> 00:17:08,329
going off so to do that and here's the

298
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:11,529
neat thing about this week's a crisis

299
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:14,689
although it doesn't mean somewhat of a

300
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:16,099
Reese's really anxieties for me but for

301
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,380
some that get a little bit of it it's

302
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:21,579
not really what I would consider strong

303
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:24,650
resin it's it's like happier resin

304
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:26,839
sativa it's uplifting it's definitely

305
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,420
pays its sweet taste but when you get a

306
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:37,099
rocker like what he just took you can't

307
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:39,710
really almost feel like it racy and it

308
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:41,089
really is straight-up especially did you

309
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,640
just get off your plate

310
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:47,289
oh my god you don't even want to puff

311
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,290
much else other than this today

312
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,630
maybe a little coffee jelly bean

313
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:57,899
all right I'm getting in there

314
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,200
definitely one of those pipes that's

315
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:09,250
really no need to pick it up you go to

316
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,440
it it's actually it's amazing too

317
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,990
I can actually taste that better than I

318
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,140
could the mothership maybe just because

319
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:21,579
it's brand new as well it's small that's

320
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:25,960
why the taste is really

321
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:28,119
oh good was that taste the full drives

322
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,519
it yeah you get this you get that spicy

323
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:35,158
and was honest with you no well yeah

324
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:35,158
thank you Peter in yes for this piece

325
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:40,590

326
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,599
especially for guys like this that take

327
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:43,949
it to a level of quality that is equal

328
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:47,969
to the level of quality that these

329
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:52,049
hashes are also at or you could call it

330
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:54,690
a standard if you don't like the word

331
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:56,279
quality if it implies that you know oh I

332
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,559
don't like the idea of implying that

333
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:00,210
you're better and that's worse no

334
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,710
problem then just call it a standard we

335
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:05,370
all deserve the highest standards don't

336
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:07,019
we that is no and that's like that's a

337
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:08,239
that's a quality of standard that I can

338
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,529
get behind

339
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,779
yeah that sweet skunk deals with in

340
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:13,799
cases like that

341
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:16,430
yeah you can't own a piece like that

342
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:19,639
without a Pelle I got your actually

343
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,640

[Music]

345
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:37,690
you having dish that goes with it

346
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:39,039
because when you have a heavy piece you

347
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:48,930
might as well what did he carve the

348
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:53,920

350
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,300
d-mail whip goes with it like the green

351
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:05,640
coming off of the sneaker is too small I

352
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:05,639
can probably get a custom all

353
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,919
that was

354
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:20,240
everything so if a piece like this were

355
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:21,980
to go on the market not that it would

356
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,429
but there's a where on the market it

357
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:29,240
would sell for thousands of dollars make

358
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:30,429
thousands of dollars come on come on

359
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,569
come on

360
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:40,159
you know because here's the here's the

361
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:42,048
North American people always I've only

362
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,149
hit two of these sneakers before it was

363
00:20:42,048 --> 00:20:45,888

364
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:47,418
dude had both of them he had one for him

365
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:49,219
and his girl had one actually I think it

366
00:20:47,419 --> 00:21:07,250
was Johnny Blaze money I just mentioned

367
00:20:49,220 --> 00:21:09,798

368
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:12,019
percolating you know and he's like good

369
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:13,940
Evy and I was like just it needs its

370
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:16,038
recurring on draw a the same way it's

371
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,558
perking out the Swiss perk yeah you keep

372
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:20,839
you poking down yeah perks like that and

part as fast as possible as fast as

447
00:29:13,148 --> 00:29:24,189
possible maybe a smaller dab for the

448

apartment well I try to go with a little

449
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,999
tiny ball oh really

450
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:31,898
yeah it looks pretty big when I saw you

451
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:32,348
drop it in that's a big pile and break

452
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:39,668
it in half

453
00:29:32,348 --> 00:29:42,939
it looks more sure I just go with what I

454
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:45,459
read like really need to get re and I

455
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:48,129
have a pretty high tolerance I can take

456
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:50,169
you jabs all day long a little bit what

457
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:53,708
I found was that that yeah exactly can I

458
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:56,709
feel it that's that's good that's good

459
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:59,399
right there I'll have to attach it back

460
00:29:56,709 --> 00:29:59,399
onto there now

461
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,370
you're still gonna hit good though and

462
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:12,549
big so you might as well get this ready

463

5,000 euro fine blown up and kicked out

466
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:22,659
of the hotel but I think we're gonna be

467
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:28,060
good

468
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:31,259
that was a fine sized hit much

469
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:31,259
reasonable I'll either

470
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:55,390
in Spanish

471
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,950
you'd be surprised what this looks like

472
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,450
if I pressed it up like that with the

473
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,519
heat and this I will know something I

474
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:03,580
better move it you'll be gonna look very

475
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:05,200
much like this not direct see even that

476
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:07,869
was a little ball I just took and then

477
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,669
what I do is I did this and so now

478
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:11,678
that's that's really a little bit too

479
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:14,140
big for me like I just I could take it

480
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,019
all day long but not to take it

481
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,759
