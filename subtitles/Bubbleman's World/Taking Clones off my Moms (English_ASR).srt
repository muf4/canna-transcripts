2
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,278
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,000
and welcome on this fresh Sunday after

4
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,640
hash Church to my little grow that I got

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,678
going on here I've just got my three

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,079
little plants going right now I'll show

7
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:37,640
you the healthiest of the three is the

8
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,799
Astro Boy and so I've given it one

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,878
little pinch so far since Johnny B

10
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:43,839
brought it to me uh it was in darn near

11
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,079
perfect shape I believed when I first

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,879
got it and then I noticed the tiniest

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,198
tiniest little bit of powdery mildew

14
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,759
which I clipped off and I gave the

15
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:57,039
plants a little bit of a hydrogen

16
00:00:52,759 --> 00:01:01,039
peroxide soak you see this one is The

17
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,120
Afghani grow nice and stocky and

18
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,400
nice and

19
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:09,158
healthy so and then I'll finally I guess

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,759
I'll show you the Barb so here's the

21
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,280
Barbara so he she's the smallest of the

22
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,079
three but she's catching up and just

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,599
started to I haven't pinched her yet I

24
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,719
noticed the other two the minute I

25
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,798
pinched them the growth on them was

26
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:23,840
incredible the fan leaves widened up and

27
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,680
everything got bigger and it seems like

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,960
it really over the last just two nights

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,200
did some some excessive growing so what

30
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,559
I am doing right now now is um I had

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,879
some Devastation to my mom's while I was

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,359
away um I did manage to keep a lot of

33
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:40,920
them alive and so what I'm going to do

34
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:44,200
today is I'm going to be cloning those

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,079
moms taking the healthy reved um plant

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,079
matter that I've been able to grow back

37
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:52,839
after taking care of of of bugs

38
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:55,718
basically and um extreme dehydration

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,759
brought them back to uh uh good enough

40
00:01:55,718 --> 00:02:00,158
on the tips to get some decent clones

41
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,118
and what I wanted to do is kind of take

42
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,680
you guys through my B Botanicare cloner

43
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,519
uh we went through it one time before

44
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,200
but I figured you know what I'll show

45
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,598
this people seem to like this uh on

46
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,399
Bubble man's world and I don't show

47
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:13,639
enough about my growing so I'll figured

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,920
I'd show this up and it's real

49
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:19,000
straightforward and simple this is a 48

50
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,919
plant Botanicare unit it's got about a 5

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,239
gallon Reservoir it's got a small little

52
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:27,280
pump a utility pump in the bottom here

53
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,519
that's going to aate uh and then we've

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,439
also got a ariation stone that's all

55
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,439
been hooked up and lined up and plugged

56
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:38,239
in and ready to go um I used um the

57
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,598
Botanicare products that they sent me

58
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,158
which is aqua Shield which is basically

59
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:45,399
um chicken [ __ ] that they've broken down

60
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:48,799
and they've got the total nitrogen at

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,280
.2% ammoniacal nitrogen and available

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,319
phosphates and soluble poach they've got

63
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,519
the breakdown there uh and I also Ed

64
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,479
power clone so this is uh you know

65
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,799
basically a product I'm I'm not even too

66
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:06,359
sure of potassium nitrates ammonium

67
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:08,959
nitrates uh it's basically a liquid

68
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,799
Advanced liquid formula for Rapid robust

69
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,598
roots from cuting I'm not promoting it

70
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,360
over anything else I'm just saying it's

71
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,839
what I have on hand and it's what I'm

72
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,640
going to give a shot to um it very well

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,640
may not even be 100% organic as I read

74
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,518
the nitrates but uh they're just for my

75
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,199
clones and the last time I used both

76
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,158
these products it worked incredibly so I

77
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,878
used them in a lower amount than what

78
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,840
they ask for on the bottle so the bottle

79
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:39,079
suggests using uh 15 MLS of this

80
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:45,400
particular one per 4 L of water and this

81
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,400
one suggests 45 to 65 MLS uh

82
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,920
per into one per gallon so also four

83
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:55,039
gallon uh four lers of water I did about

84
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,839
half to a third of those numbers and

85
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,639
I've got it all right here in the water

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,719
so I'm basically just going to take this

87
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,679
guy

88
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,158
sitting over here

89
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,159
gently pour them

90
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:17,399
in so you want to bring this water level

91
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,798
up I believe it's still the pump is

92
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:24,839
completely

93
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:28,519
covered probably use uh oh maybe another

94
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:30,038
half gallon or so I did have that pH to

95
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,240
6.3

96
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:35,279
and I've got my pH pen right here a blue

97
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,280
lab pH pen uh it's very important when

98
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,319
you're doing anything with cannabis and

99
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,038
feeding and clones and seedlings that

100
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:44,038
you just keep in mind that the water the

101
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:45,478
pH of the water the natural pH of the

102
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:47,639
water that comes out of many people's

103
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:51,399
Taps is very high upwards of seven and

104
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:54,038
eight and uh when you put in organic um

105
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:57,239
um synthetic or organic nitrates like uh

106
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:59,959
manures you're going to bring the pH way

107
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,840
down uh down sometimes to 2 three and

108
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:04,680
four so it's important to a have a pH

109
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,000
meter so you can read your pH and then

110
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,038
of course it's important to usually have

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,478
uh like a ph up which is going to be

112
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:14,879
able to get your levels up I don't use

113
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,279
PH down because I just use food and my

114
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,399
food brings the PH down from the water

115
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,879
and then I bring it back up with the ph

116
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:23,439
up so I got those two guys in there

117
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,240
that's air rating very nicely I'm going

118
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:29,759
to put a little bit more water in here

119
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,280
and we will get to the next step which

120
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,879
will I'll be bringing up the Clones to

121
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,000
show how quick and easy we can just you

122
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,279
know Mark them down the names of them

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,279
and get them each into a row so we'll do

124
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,318
that next all right so we're back with a

125
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,439
little bit more water here just get that

126
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,800
level

127
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:49,879
up see to have it covering the entire

128
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,439
pump they want to make sure that the

129
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:53,918
levels are up high

130
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,639
enough so yeah that's basically that

131
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:59,120
we've got the top down here all cleaned

132
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,680
up to Perfection so what I'm going to do

133
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,399
next is I'm going to go downstairs and

134
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,560
we're going to grab those clones and

135
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,279
then I'm going to show you another

136
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,199
preventative means keep in mind these

137
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,679
clones are still growing on sickly

138
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,280
plants that have been growing out of

139
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,038
Health I've trimmed down much of the

140
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:17,239
sickness in order to get rid of any

141
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:19,120
types of bugs that are around and uh

142
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,360
anything that might still be on there as

143
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,120
far as an egg will be getting dipped

144
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,479
before it goes into the cloner and I'll

145
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,680
be uh also giving the minor uh sprays

146
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,918
with the Clone be gone or sorry bug be

147
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,360
gone that I've got as a product which is

148
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:35,799
much like a a soapy mixture that breaks

149
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,000
down the the outer layer of the of the

150
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,478
bug and it passes away due to that so um

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,680
yeah I guess we'll head on down and grab

152
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:45,199
those

153
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,840
clones all right guys welcome back I am

154
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,759
now down in the garage with some of the

155
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,198
hurting plants this is one that was

156
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,759
actually very strong in fact I wish I

157
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,079
could show it to you this one actually

158
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,000
just started producing resin in its

159
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,198
stress when it was not getting water and

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,279
it was it was all bugged out which

161
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,439
quite amazed that I can't even see bug

162
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:06,239
eggs or any activity of bugs but I guess

163
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,519
I have been trying to work with them for

164
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,639
quite some time so this is a northern

165
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,959
light from Dr Atomic and I guess we're

166
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,439
going to take a few cuts um what I've

167
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,399
done is I've managed to take a little

168
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:19,120
bit of these sticky tacks and we'll take

169
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,239
a variety of these put them all around

170
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,680
this and tape them up so they're the

171
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,598
Northern Lights so I'll just write on

172
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,240

00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:50,559
lot of her material so she's she's

203
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,760
hurting boys but that's okay cuz we're

204
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,199
going to make sure that we

205
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,720
uh we take care of business and we bring

206
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,200
them right back to the healthiest of the

207
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,240
healthy so grab one of these

208
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,240
we'll call it sweet

209
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:07,359
skunk all

210
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:14,000

211
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,479
go so a couple of sweet skunk Cuts one

212
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,799
right there

213
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,959
boom Another right here

214
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,799
boom taking these like it just don't

215
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,518
matter because it just don't matter I

216
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:30,000
may very well get rid of these plants

217
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,919
after this 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 4 then again

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,519
I might grow them out and pass them on

219
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:37,679
to well-deserving people so we'll see

220
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,039
what uh I guess two it's not a bad idea

221
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,399
to strip

222
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,559
them and strip them right down to the

223
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,958
bottom

224
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:47,119
there that uh it's going to make it

225
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,599
easier to to do the Clones

226
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,959
anyway and they're in an easy position

227

nice healthy one but this this is more

253
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,319
just a thing where you have to know that

254
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,799
you can bring your your babies back when

255
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,000
they've been uh when they've been

256
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,679
assaulted and my plants literally got

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,120
assaulted on this last trip they really

258
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:21,159
took a

259
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,159
beating and uh what do we got here

260
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:27,239

266
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:50,200

268
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,200

273
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,479
unbelievable let's get

274
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,159

275
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:29,720
okay I'll just take the two of the Astro

276
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,519
Boy two healthiest clones off that

277
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm going to take one Ortega which was

278
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,000
in full

279
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:39,958
bloom

280
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,399
uh well we'll get two

281
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,879
actually okay so these are the Ortega

282
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:46,198
they were the most hurting and they're

283
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,000
fully bloomed

284
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:53,278
out and man they smell

285
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,919
unbelievable so we're going to make

286
00:12:53,278 --> 00:13:00,480
sure these make it into the cloner as

287
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:03,599
well man woo that's some sticky yicky

288
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,199
right there

289
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,879
Ortega got juice all over my fingers

290
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:10,799
it's just greased out greased out

291
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,399
cannabis plants so there's two oras

292
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,838
they'll be the easiest to discover

293
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,919
because well because they're in full

294
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:21,199
bloom so there it is a little tray of

295
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:23,679
clones 4 1 2 four and

296
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:25,559
two bring these up to the cloner get

297
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,120
them labeled get them put in turn the

298
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,638
cloner on and that'll be the end of this

299
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,879
video guys so let's go do it all right

300
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,079
so one more thing we're going to do

301
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:37,159
before we get right to um putting the

302
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:40,439
Clones in is I've got my insect todal

303
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:44,000
soap okay this is safer soap it's uh

304
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,199
omry om omry listed as organic materials

305
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
for the review Institute so that's the

306
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:50,799
product right there and this is

307
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,320
basically just a variety of soaps uh a

308
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,799
mix of different soaps that uh attack

309
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,759
aphid buds mey bugs spider mites Whitely

310
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,799
soft Brown fids Ros or Paras slugs a

311
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:02,720
whole variety of these bugs are attacked

312
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:06,679
through this stuff and what I normally

313
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,278
do is I mix 10 MLS per 500 MLS of water

314
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,439
uh and I spray it on the plant because

315
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:12,838
we've got such small clones it makes

316
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,199
sense that we dip them and we know that

317
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,399
100% of anything whether it's an egg or

318
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:20,240
bug if it still exists on these plants

319
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,480
it's going to be exposed to this soap

320
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,759
the eggs are uh broken down even faster

321
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,839
the bugs broken down a little slower so

322
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,879
let's do that we've got 1,000 MLS of

323
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:34,360
water okay through 1,000 M of water into

324
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:39,639
the into the container and now we just

325
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:40,839
need to drop 2 10 ms this is a 15 mL so

326
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:44,240
I'll put in

327
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:47,880
15 and then a a light

328
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,879
five give that a good

329
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,360
stir

330
00:14:53,958 --> 00:15:00,239
okay we're getting there we're getting

331
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,720
there now I'm going to put on

332
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,959
this

333
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,720
part now I've gone and cleaned this

334
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,198
whole thing out it got bleach the whole

335
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,600
nine yards from the last time I had

336
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,799
anything in here I cleaned everything to

337
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,839
what I would consider uh very clean

338
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:16,319
there's one extra little guy right

339
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,920
there and so what I'll do is I'll get

340
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,879
the Clones I'll bring them over

341
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:26,319
here and as we go in actually before I

342
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:29,600
do that we'll make sure that we have our

343
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,319
labels so I did this last time not sure

344
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,399
if I have any tape nearby um I can I can

345
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:38,120
lay them down for for now though so

346
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,440
we'll start with sweet skunk this is the

347
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,959
another thing that I really liked about

348
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,519
the botanic hair it was really easy to

349
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:47,078
label the rows so we're going to start

350
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,078
with sweet

351
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,560
skunk sweet skunk and I'll just put that

352
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,399
right

353
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:00,879
there okay so that's our first

354
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:07,120
row and why don't we just get right to

355
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:10,639
that sweet skunk Come to Papa so here we

356
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,519
go got a nice not sure if I even brought

357
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,159
the scissors back up because those will

358
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,919
also come in handy yes I did just to cut

359
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:19,639
down the leaves I like to uh I like to

360
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,039
cut them down especially when they're

361
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,680
bigger leaves on a smaller clone it uh

362
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,480
that makes sense just get rid of the

363
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:29,719
excess so I will dump these into the

364
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,319
Soapy mixture and I will dump them all

365
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,519
the way up to the stock the whole stock

366
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:39,159
will be

367
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:44,720
exposed okay it's very delicate I kind

368
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:44,719
of want to just leap get this guy into

369
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,639
here

370
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:56,919
okay so there's

371
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:59,839
one one little sweet

372
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:02,078
skunk she'll pick up when she builds her

373
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,959
strength I did just give them a little

374
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:07,798
bit of

375
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:10,119
a a major soak so we're going to cut uh

376
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:12,759
I'm going to cut some of these

377
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:14,479
down I got rid of some of these big fan

378
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:17,720
leaves that

379
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,078
are that are looping this making it dip

380
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:24,480
all over so we got a lot of those out

381
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,480
dip it all the way down to the

382
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:31,279
stock all right

383
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,600
we'll go right into the next

384
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:37,960
one sweet skunks are hearty little

385
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:40,159
plants they'll uh they'll grow healthy

386
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,640
from this once they're uh right now

387
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,400
they're a little bit Droopy from the

388
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,120
from the excessive amount of soap that

389
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:50,559
I'm putting on on them but I'm taking

390
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:53,038
no um chances whatsoever and I'm making

391
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:59,038
sure that these things are

392
00:17:53,038 --> 00:18:00,798
properly um rooted without any bugs

393
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,599
and that's why we take these precautions

394
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:05,879
particularly when they just had bugs uh

395
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:10,038
you know maybe a month ago or 3 weeks

396
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,039
ago probably well even two weeks

397
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,320
ago

398
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,960
okay another sweet skunk in the in the

399
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,678
pile these will be exciting to see these

400
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,159
guys start to root I have to say always

401
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,000
nice to see that and one last sweet

402
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:29,760
skunk we'll cut that down a little

403
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,798
bit R of that big guy and that big guy

404
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,798
cut these leaves

405
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:37,639
down already super floppy so they're

406
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:38,720
going to get even more floppy when I dip

407
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,919
them in this

408
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,600
soap give them a beating of their of

409
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:48,559
their life it's pretty violent on this

410
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:51,558
uh bug taken care of so this is why we

411
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:53,599
going to bring it right down to the base

412
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:54,879
cuz that's going to hold it up and allow

413
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,959
it to stand so those are the sweet

414
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,320
skunks four planted you see how easy

415
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,120
that is with the cloner we're literally

416
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:03,839
just stripping the Clones down I'm not

417
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:07,558
requiring any rooting gel everything's

418
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,158
inside uh the um unit and what I can

419
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:11,918
start doing right away which I haven't

420
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,919
done yet is plug in so it starts

421
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,640
shooting up the Mist it's going to make

422
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,759
some

423
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,159
noise you can hear that sound now that's

424
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,000
a sound that you want to make sure that

425
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,840
you always have on when you're playing

426
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,839
around with your cloner when you want to

427
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,599
lift this up and you don't want the

428
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,359
water to be spraying all over what's

429
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,639
going to inevitably happen

430
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,279
is you're going to go over to the plug

431
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,600
and you're going to unplug the unit and

432
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,558
you're going to do your work now I

433
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:38,918
implore you do not forget to plug that

434
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,319
thing back in because it's a huge pain

435
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,360
in the ass if you don't you your plants

436
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:47,678
will die fast they will start limping

437
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:49,719
and and not doing well so let's see what

438
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,320
we've got

439
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,319
next let's go for

440
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,199
NL do atomic of course if you guys have

441
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,679
been watching Bubble man's for for

442
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,480
bubble man's world for any amount of

443
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,440
time you may have seen doc Atomic come

444
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,759
by and drop off his Infamous Northern

445
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,880
Light strain and man were we happy about

446
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,000
it our whole community of course because

447
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,400
uh we share our our strains with all of

448
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,359
our community and so it really was a

449
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,120
wonderful thing that he did for everyone

450
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,399
there's that Med

451
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,918
Kush make sure we don't get any of these

452
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,220
mixed up these are the

453
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,640
NLS and

454
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,440
[Music]

455
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,919
so make sure these are all good These

456
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,640
are nice fat little clones I have to say

457
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:38,320
the growth sites are so

458
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,520
close it's

459
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:45,000
incredible all right so we cut that guy

460
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:48,480
down to a reasonable size give him a

461
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,599
dip all the way the whole stock and and

462
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,480
and and

463
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:55,038
plant all right throw them into the

464
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,839
little Cube which is going to get them

465
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,599
standing up nice and straight for us

466
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:02,158
make sure you have a good inch plus to 2

467
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:04,519
in of stock on these things you want to

468
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,159
make sure your stocks down low really in

469
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:08,960
the midst of all of the of the water and

470
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:11,400
the mixture that's blowing around down

471
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,360
there this is going to be key factor in

472
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,559
your clones cloning out

473
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:18,439
nice all right so we just clean the

474
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:21,200
bottom of this guy he's got sights

475
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,038
growing every quarter of an inch which

476
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,278
is one more reason why we just love this

477
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:29,200
doc

478
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:35,400
Atomic really impressive little cuts

479
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,400
cut cut cut all right and

480
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,798
dip you almost want to give it that

481
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,639
little blow just so it can uh release

482
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:45,960
all of its leaves from being stuck

483
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,000
together when you see that it just feels

484
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,278
like this shouldn't be like this so

485
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
these ones are a little shorter than I

486
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:55,759
like they're barely an inch but

487
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,759
uh they will still grow they will still

488
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:02,038
root these these rooting um Botanicare

489
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,558
and the the the units much like them I

490
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:05,919
mean they're really all very similar

491
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:07,319
it's not like I've seen that one unit is

492
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,520
is doing it so much better than the

493
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:12,000
others but these things really make

494
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,720
cloning easy and particularly for some

495
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,200
sometimes for people that find it really

496
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,600
hard you try an AOC cloner for the first

497
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,480
time and as long as you listen to the

498
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,038
simple mathematics the simple recipe

499
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,000
which is you know make sure you have the

500
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:26,440
right pH and make sure you don't uh

501
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,278
underwater or overwater Etc these simple

502
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,159
things you follow them and you can't

503
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:32,319
believe believe the great success that

504
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,080
you have and how beautiful the cuts are

505
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,678
and I have no doubt that these Cuts

506
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:37,879
right here that we're cutting right now

507
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,320
that we're load loading into the trimmer

508
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,200
into the uh the cloner are going to be

509
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,720
of the utmost quality I really have no

510
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,720
doubt of it

511
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,200
whatsoever and really the interesting

512
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:52,798
thing about all this and I should tell

513
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,440
this part of the story is that the moral

514
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,879
of this story is that I really just want

515
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,720
to show myself and everyone that I'm

516
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,679
able to um bring these plants back to

517
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,480
life that were near killed and I want to

518
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,840
be able to do that but the bottom line

519
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,480
is I'm not forced to do that because

520
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:14,678
what I did in the beginning which was

521
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,759
smarter was I gave these clones away to

522
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,320
a variety of my friends maybe 15 to 20

523
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,119
different people I don't know you tell

524
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:23,119
me the majority of the times I shared

525
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:27,158
them was on camera with bubble man's

526
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:30,879
world so from Remo and d420 K and Johnny

527
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:34,400
B and true a genetics Phil and a variety

528
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,200
of many other people from Flav 421 and

529
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,480
many many other people I have shared

530
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,319
these strains with and and that's why

531
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,000
right now as I speak as I'm cutting

532
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,240
these and keeping these alive I have my

533
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,679
friends that have already cut clones for

534
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,359
me on all the varieties that I lost and

535
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,679
they've already got them in the middle

536
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:53,399
of getting rooted and they're going to

537
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,880
give them and bring them to me as gifts

538
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,519
just one or two plants that's all I

539
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,600
require just to get one or two back

540
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,480
Johnny be's already hooked me up with

541
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:04,359
Astro Boy Afghani and Barbara bud so

542
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,000
that was really great um you know this

543
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,479
is this is how it goes when you do it

544
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,599
this way if you if you share your

545
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,640
genetics you're going to be a lot

546
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:16,278
happier in the end particularly if you

547
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,960
happen to lose a strain you never lose a

548
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:20,839
strain when you share it that's all I

549
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,159
have to say about that you share that

550
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,639
genetic and it's not going to be lost to

551
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,360
you you're going to be able to maintain

552
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,759
it

553
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,558
throughout all right so we got two Astro

554
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,398
boys

555
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:34,319
very small little Cuts so we'll cut them

556
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:34,319
down as low as

557
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,038
possible give them the

558
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,799
dip most important part make sure that

559
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:44,038
they're I mean honestly this this is

560
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:46,519
just a good idea to do anyway I mean why

561
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:48,879
wouldn't you want to prevent bugs on all

562
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,278
levels from your plants even if you

563
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,840
don't have them this is a great

564
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:53,720
preventative especially if you're

565
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,959
getting cuts from different people and

566
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,120
you don't know you know if you can uh if

567
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,480
you can trust their the cuts that you're

568
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:01,079
getting they might seem like they're

569
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,720
great one day and then the next day you

570
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:06,639
might just have this huge influx of bugs

571
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,519
everywhere it happens everyone's uh seen

572
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,880
it happen you really have to be able to

573
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:14,759
set up a proper quarantine for yourself

574
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,159
so that you can uh be receive plants

575
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:18,759
even that have bugs but then make sure

576
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:20,278
that you can do something about it to

577
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:21,720
the point where you can uh you can

578
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:23,278
quarantine the plants keep them away

579
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,120
from the rest of your garden and make

580
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:27,519
sure you get rid of those bugs off of

581
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,759
those plants the way I look at it is

582
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:33,519
never under estimate these little

583
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:37,440
bastards they are endless they will

584
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:39,960
never stop you have to not underestimate

585
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,720
them you have to fight them aggressively

586
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,240
and uh you know if you do that products

587
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,720
like bug be gone safer these organic

588
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,278
products can be used without worry and

589
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,480
if you don't do it and you get yourself

590
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:55,079
in a situation where things are such a

591
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:59,519
mess well now you're in a situation that

592
00:25:55,079 --> 00:26:02,199
uh that uh you're going to be to try to

593
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,319
have to use some terrible chemical

594
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,640
substance that I would just personally

595
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:11,079
rather start over I don't want to spray

596
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,080
deadly chemicals all over my plant you

597
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:18,000
know all right so this is an medic cush

598
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,399
the one medic cush that I had it looks

599
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,720
real nice I think it's going to be a

600
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:24,079
nice healthy clone even though John has

601
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,720
offered to bring it back I love the idea

602
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:29,639
of keeping it alive myself so last but

603
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,000
not least we've got the big boys we've

604
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,799
got these Ortegas and these are going to

605
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,919
need to be cleaned out they are a lot of

606
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:41,679
Bud I mean literally I'd say this thing

607
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:44,559
is like easily three or four weeks into

608
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,759
flour which is uh I mean that's that's

609
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:50,079
pretty pretty big into flour for for a

610
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,519
cut and so I want to make sure this one

611
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:55,119
gets soaked I want to make sure there's

612
00:26:51,519 --> 00:27:00,960
no bugs hiding out in this

613
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:00,959
particular cut and get it all soapy

614
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:06,798
up put him in the far end

615
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:09,038
there

616
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,558
Orga one

617
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:13,919
Ortega clean these the best that I can

618
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:16,639
removing any leaves that have a

619
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,960
discoloration or uh burnt tips on the

620
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,880
end I just pull those out of the from

621
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,200
the bud uh this thing is for sure going

622
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,278
to reveg I've seen it many times it's

623
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,480
not a miracle it's not really that

624
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:32,000
difficult to do it really is just time

625
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,480
consuming so it's uh it ends up being

626
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,480
one of those things where if you take a

627
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,640
clone like this please don't anticipate

628
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,079
that it's going to be ready with the

629
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,360
rest of your clones it will be the runt

630
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,759
so these These are more just an

631
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:46,240
experiment for myself I'm sure that true

632
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:48,720
genetics Phil would give me this Ortega

633
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,960
back if I asked for it but when someone

634
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,640
gives you a clone do your best to keep

635
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,880
that thing alive before you just go back

636
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,120
and ask them for it again it's uh the

637
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,640
least that you can do uh when someone

638
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,719
has shared such a speci special thing

639
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,320
for you so a row of sweet skunk a row of

640
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,440
Northern Lights a row of Astro Boy one

641
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,480
single medic Kush and right at the far

642
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,120
end we have the

643
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:15,120
Ortega so the

644
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:18,918
Ortega blooming right out under 18 hours

645
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,959
of light that's how she reacts to stress

646
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:21,519
the

647
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,360
Ortega

648
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,399
so we will what I normally do is

649
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:29,359
actually I would spray the inside of

650
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:31,839
this so I got got my little half gallon

651
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,319
sprayer here that I'll pour a little bit

652
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,319
of water

653
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:41,399
into see if we can do this ghetto

654
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:43,600
fashion way no

655
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:47,079
funnel just catching a little bit of

656
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:50,439
spill in the the bottom

657
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:53,119
perfect perfect we can take that and

658
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,038
pour it right back into there and it

659
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:58,158
gives us the perfect amount of moisture

660
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,038
that's on the inside of this lid now

661
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:05,799
and

662
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:05,798
then I will crack that baby on plug it

663
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,200
in so I always like to check immediately

664
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:16,639
I open these three immediately water's

665
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,679
coming out so I know it's

666
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,600
working I'll give these guys a little

667
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:23,798
bit of a

668
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:25,398
moisture on top just a tiny bit not too

669
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,200
much cuz they've got that soap on there

670
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:30,319
and I don't want to wash it all off and

671
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:34,640
then I'll literally put the top

672
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:38,678
on so we've got our clones ready to go

673
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,640
we've got our light everything's working

674
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:42,120
perfectly and I want to thank you guys

675
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,120
for watching this little segment of

676
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:46,518
bubble man's world I know it didn't show

677
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:48,119
that many plants but there's got to be

678
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:50,640
something that you can pick up from this

679
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,719
this is simply as simple as it gets if

680
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,120
you're using a par a power cloner or a

681
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,679
Botanicare or any of these type of

682
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,678
cloners this is one way of doing it so

683
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,798
thanks for watching Bubble man's world
