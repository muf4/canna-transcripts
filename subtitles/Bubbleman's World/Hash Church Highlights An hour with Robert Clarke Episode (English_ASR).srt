1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,049
doing this for yourself this is good oh

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,299
yeah you gotta go into Joseph with the

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,910
mentality that their yields are gonna

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,099
suck and and you're gonna work hard to

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,449
figure it out and it might take you a

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,548
long time so if you have a lot of

7
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,288
material go for it but if you're the

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,419
type of dude that has like a half a

9
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,400
pound of material and that's all you got

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,820
and you want to make shift with it

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,829
I probably prefer you learn how to make

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,099
water hash just cause it's more failsafe

13
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:30,899
you know what it also is big-time the

14
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:33,058
material that kid just happens to be the

15
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:34,558
kid that has the fire everyone thinks

16
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:36,238
they have the fire until they try to

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,769
make full melt dry sift and then they're

18
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,539
like what what's going on here this

19
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,790
isn't right like why doesn't mine look

20
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:46,439
like yours Rob would you like to take

21
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:52,619
that question why doesn't mine look like

22
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:54,359
yours top metal the red yeah I can you

23
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,609
guys hear me welcome

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,619
my voice is really bad today I've got a

25
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:58,969
cool so I'm not sure how this is gonna

26
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,849
work

27
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:04,079
Kuban that was exactly right you know if

28
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,118
you don't have a whole bunch of good

29
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,500
product to work with don't don't even

30
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:09,868
get started and he can do a little

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,579
experiment to see what's possible but

32
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:14,180
you won't really get a lot of joy and

33
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:17,039
once you got a lot to work with

34
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,200
yeah a lot of utter hash is very

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,670
efficient back to the old techniques

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,299
it's really efficient and easier for

37
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,099
people yeah and I feel like um another

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,900
thing I wanted to touch up on well not

39
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:32,819
only do I get like almost double the

40
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,299
yields of water house so it kind of may

41
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:38,399
say but the quality of like the 45 that

42
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,070
you make into rosin comes out as an

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,350
actual desirable nice yellow oil now the

44
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,328
thing that I realized with Keith like in

45
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:47,640
fact if you just tumble [ __ ] on a kiefer

46
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:49,889
you press it into rosin it never is

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,710
gonna be the same color as water ouch

48
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,250
rosin so he's gonna be a little darker

49
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:59,069
more I don't notice lower grade I would

50
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,709
say right so I asked somebody and what

51
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:02,879
they told me is that the oil and the

52
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:04,078
pressure it can actually each

53
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,000
contaminates on the way out like

54
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,219
chlorophyll and stuff like that and

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,050
taint the color of the rosin not

56
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,979
necessarily green so there won't be a

57
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,819
cellophane clear you know

58
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:17,949
almost translucent no color rasa right

59
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:20,979
but when you get off so when you make

60
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:23,679
the sift the only way to get a rose in

61
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:25,619
the same color and comparable to water

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,659
actually is that you gotta make it 99

63
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,340
now why would you ever press 99 percent

64
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:31,659
dry sift into rosin I've done it before

65
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,420
it's kind of dumb

66
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:36,969
you know it's just smoke to say this but

67
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:39,669
the water hash when you got 45 it's

68
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:42,908
almost like that 45 is pure as it is it

69
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:44,939
makes beautiful oil the 73 does too and

70
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:46,900
all the grades above in all those bags

71
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,609
so yeah if you don't have a lot of

72
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,390
material you get a lot more very money

73
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:56,950
higher grade you guys sound like a bunch

74
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:59,318
of a bunch of glue heads yeah we please

75
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:03,669
do if you're tasting more than naturally

76
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:10,479
there you use them too much if it's

77
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:12,878
masking everything under it is that to

78
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,590
say because we extracted the resins that

79
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,179
we were doing too much and that it was

80
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,939
naturally only supposed to be done the

81
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,120
way nature intended well here no I'm not

82
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:24,609
saying only is way nature intended

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,689
there was a reason for curing weed there

84
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:30,489
was a reason for for treating it towards

85
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:32,829
being a finished product rather than

86
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,769
just jumping queue and making things

87
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:38,169
aren't fresh lead voice is messed up

88
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,569
because I got you know cannabis cup

89
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:43,060
along began or something but I've been

90
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:45,488
trying to stay away from this stuff I

91
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,709
think the fact that Tony's during that

92
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:50,019
terpenes is important that he's not just

93
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,539
capturing and fresh frozen or whatever

94
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,579
or or fresh and then and then putting

95
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:57,189
them out on the market heat he cures

96
00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:00,010
them out and they changed the same way

97
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:04,239
they do on the plant or in the hash in

98
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:06,098
the vial okay that could be to but let's

99
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,469
leave Tony out of this I was talking

100
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:09,429
about to just a general concept of what

101
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:10,810
you guys are talking about I was

102
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,879
forgetting you're talking about Tony's

103
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,069
product let's leave products out of this

104
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,988
and people are out of it for the moment

105
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:19,389
unless they want to speak up you know

106
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:23,799
these right here this morning so it I

107
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:25,210
just don't see this it's fascinating but

108
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,710
it can really

109
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:31,089
over done like anything you know and and

110
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:33,489
not all terpenes we could there's a

111
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:35,978
reason we aged our weed it became more

112
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,288
smokeable after a few weeks or months

113
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:40,269
depending on how you did it you could

114
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:43,000
also ruin it but you could make it

115
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:45,939
better from the point of view of smoking

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,610
you know and it is a smokeable product

117
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:50,348
now you talk about vaporizing but I'm

118
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,139
not a big fan of that either you know

119
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:54,939
call me old school but you know it's not

120
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:57,400
where I'm at about to stuff so I kind of

121
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:59,439
challenged the overuse of this oh this

122
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:02,109
is what I'll say against that I have a

123
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,000
lot of faith in my bioassay ability and

124
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,038
I've been curious for a long time and

125
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,860
I'm not in the thing that generally

126
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:10,659
aren't true I've I've been the one lead

127
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,580
away from things for issues that I just

128
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,229
felt like you know what you made that

129
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:16,029
with a weird nickel solvent and you

130
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:19,598
don't know if you cleaned it all pink

131
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:21,879
ass and because I've tried those things

132
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:24,699
felt sick from them gotten headache

133
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:28,719
turned green and so all I know about

134
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:32,439
this is it is amazing I mean I'm telling

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:38,229
you I [ __ ] love it I really do what

136
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:40,899
about you Cuban I want more men and I

137
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:44,800
might be a turpino I'm not a glue head

138
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:46,750
but I'm a Terp head straight up if I put

139
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,218
it like this so if I have hash that is

140
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:53,288
like tur P naturally the way it comes I

141
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:55,449
want I will mess with it you know what I

142
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:57,908
mean but it just it's an interesting

143
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:01,030
product to me to see that somebody can

144
00:05:57,908 --> 00:06:03,279
extract us the turbine terpenes are

145
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:05,739
smell the taste the essence of the plant

146
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:09,299
into a little vial you know what I mean

147
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,430
like that was just cool to me hey

148
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,139
perfumery is an amazing amazing field of

149
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:18,310
research you know that's what I'm

150
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:21,668
talking about there and and does anybody

151
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:26,620
still have any of the Swiss flavoring

152
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:29,620
oils left like see sunny happiness track

153
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,319
towards that green heavy stuff got stuff

154
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:35,199
to turn the guys have for Switzerland

155
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,788
10-12 years ago I don't have any more

156
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,650
that I use I'm going to see what that

157
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:41,019
natural cannabis

158
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,849
from at the best rope-a-dope it wasn't

159
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:45,459
really help that it was hybrid stuff and

160
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:48,030
see what that would do as an experiment

161
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:51,129
and also like see sunny take hop scones

162
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:54,129
yeah Jake all the resin glands off of

163
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:57,310
them put some some BHO that's just pure

164
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:59,439
THC on there that's easy to get even

165
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,149
close to pure THC and then start

166
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,240
experimenting with different terpenes

167
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:06,849
off the shelf on some neutral material

168
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,400
material like that for we really after

169
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,570
the terpenes are are we after a complex

170
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,569
mix of things

171
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:15,399
what are we end of here I hate let's

172
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,439
have some double-blind experiments and

173
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,219
that was Dave paint last night and seen

174
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,969
it in years

175
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:24,010
Dave's a really smart guy and he's not

176
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,770
necessarily buying this terpene thing at

177
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:29,800
all and and I'm behind him on this -

178
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:31,990
there's been no science I'm not I'm with

179
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,788
you guys I like it - okay we back up

180
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,069
your a little bit let's do these things

181
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:38,680
right and still little science let's get

182
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:41,139
a double-blind experiment that shows

183
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,569
these effects the only thing that's been

184
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:46,360
done is cursory for work by David and me

185
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:48,310
and a few other people and and we kind

186
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,800
of launched this whole thing in a way

187
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,329
but it's trying to do some serious

188
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,550
experimenting and see what's really

189
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:58,060
going on the problem is that it's it's a

190
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:00,310
circular problem we know what to expect

191
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,069
in two repeats so that's what we get and

192
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:05,500
that's what we portrayed back onto how

193
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:08,759
what we expect from terpenes which is

194
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:12,639
what we get and it's it's not scientific

195
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:14,079
it's been itís fine so I really like to

196
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,240
see some better work with this is all

197
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,819
I'm I'm [ __ ] floor and the me and time

198
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,860
take it out easy with these things none

199
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:23,259
of them have been approved for for

200
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,300
ventilating for for breathing they're

201
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:27,639
not really proof for that just because

202
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,770
terpene compounds like bergamot oil are

203
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,598
allowed to stick on cigarettes doesn't

204
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:34,778
mean they didn't hear search just means

205
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,889
they wanted to sell cigarettes so you

206
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:38,049
know there's nothing here to tell us

207
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:42,158
that this to say there's nothing here to

208
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:44,079
tell us that it's effective so we all

209
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,078
self trate trate well works exactly

210
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,810
right that was radar wave for for salt

211
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:51,669
for extracts for solvent and solvent les

212
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:53,049
extracts and I mean I looked at the

213
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:55,899
terpene

214
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:57,578
results in the Emerald cup and hopefully

215
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:01,839
Alec will be here soon to talk about

216
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:04,000
those results he's with SC labs he they

217
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,910
tested the milligrams per grams of the

218
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,019
terpenes and many of the strains were as

219
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:13,448
high as as ones that had terpenes added

220
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:16,480
but they never had terpenes added they

221
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:19,328
were just a really rich full terpene

222
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,009
producing plants that got made into an

223
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:23,379
extract the right way to preserve those

224
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:25,059
terpenes so what I'm saying is why not

225
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:27,519
the worry for all these years that

226
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:30,059
people have been inhaling butane solvent

227
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,100
extracts water extracts with potential

228
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:35,349
microbials what why haven't we you know

229
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,199
15 years ago said let's do the science

230
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,089
on that why just now with terpenes you

231
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:42,189
know can i interject something because

232
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:44,980
i'd like to ask for obvious and is there

233
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,199
in a sense are there mechanisms in the

234
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,500
chemical makeup of cannabis that combat

235
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:52,958
us being exposed to light mold on import

236
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,970
quality Mexican or Colombian because God

237
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:59,099
knows when we were getting brick we you

238
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:02,470
know it didn't grow brown that was

239
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,060
rotting so obviously we were exposed and

240
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,889
we were all lighting our bowls with our

241
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:07,719
big lighters and you know someone from

242
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:10,629
the lab I think it was Addison told me

243
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,149
that that's got a trail of 8,000 PP and

244
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:15,100
butane coming off of a low temp flame

245
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:17,740
lighter when we stick it in our Bowl and

246
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,899
you know and and my I think mark has a

247
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,399
great question what is there things in

248
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,929
cannabis chemicals in cannabis that

249
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:28,028
could have kind of buffered that

250
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:29,859
exposure to toxicity absolutely and if

251
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:32,049
you have any faith at all in whole plant

252
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,629
medicines and whole plant health care

253
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:39,519
products the answer of course is yes I

254
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:41,350
mean a complex herbal remedy or complex

255
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,509
herbal smoking next year or whatever you

256
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:48,040
want to call it is is going to have

257
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:50,078
compounds that may very well hurt you

258
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,480
but very well may very well protect you

259
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:55,000
as well all you've done by making be a

260
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,350
chose take an extract of the glands of

261
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,948
cannabis what about the other 90% you

262
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:06,190
know I mean whole whole herbal healing

263
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:07,779
people who are largely behind what is

264
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:12,160
supposedly going on with medical

265
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:14,439
cannabis are in shock about extracts

266
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,409
like this I mean their whole plant

267
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,190
extracts sort of but there's no

268
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:19,569
chlorophyll

269
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:23,790
there's no hardly there's nothing that

270
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:26,530
isn't either butane or co2 soluble so

271
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:28,959
your techniques are limiting how much is

272
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:31,149
in there you're not doing any seeing

273
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,460
near a whole plant extract so of course

274
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,230
you're missing out on the possibilities

275
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,730
that there are things there that are

276
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,190
going to ameliorate the effects of

277
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,259
smoking cannabis that cannabis smoking

278
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,980
in its raw form hasn't been bad for

279
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:48,069
people it is amazing

280
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:51,610
smoking is bad but ours are bad cannabis

281
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,900
smoking is good this is fantastic and it

282
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,919
seems to do what we're looking at right

283
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:58,990
now so far the answer would be fly no

284
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:01,149
and it's a plant experiment that we've

285
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,639
done so far this is a shunt from that

286
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:05,620
water hash is really a whole plant

287
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,509
extract a lot of ways the gland heads

288
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,360
are in there you know they're part of

289
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:12,549
the you have some bits of leaf stock if

290
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,259
you will it's it's still much more a

291
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:19,539
little closer to a whole plant extract

292
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:24,220
and solvent extracts are the beauty of

293
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:27,339
solvent extracts - Rob I was gonna ask

294
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,259
about my deadly allergy to hemp and the

295
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,200
sub allergies I have to cannabis and

296
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:34,960
what could be missing why I'm not

297
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,300
allergic to oils I'm allergic to dry SIV

298
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,480
I'm less allergic to water hash I'm

299
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:42,849
deadly allergic to the flower rosin but

300
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,759
I'm not allergic to solve in extracts so

301
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,649
the argument goes both ways because when

302
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,960
you fractionally distill an oil into all

303
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:54,159
those fragments and you see how many of

304
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:56,470
them are when superheated become noxious

305
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,389
a whole plant extract where you're gonna

306
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,839
cook that all down I'm like I will not

307
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:04,929
for the terpene burnt content back into

308
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,550
your THC and call that whole I just took

309
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:07,359
it out and I can see that I want it out

310
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:09,399
of my room

311
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,589
because once those terpenes were heated

312
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,809
they all changed and they might not all

313
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,790
change for the better if I was trying to

314
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:18,099
standardize a product versus every time

315
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:19,959
I throw a weed in its terpene explosion

316
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,269
soup and it's never the same

317
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:25,690
right I can see that I'd say reishi

318
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:27,519
you're a unique case I mean most people

319
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,050
don't need to refine their cannabis so

320
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,870
that it doesn't give them allergic

321
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:33,429
responses you're close to a unique case

322
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,440
first time I've ever read this but I

323
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:37,719
love you it's perfectly appropriate I

324
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,420
thought so too until I started looking

325
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,519
up adverse like emergency room reactions

326
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:44,110
to hemp protein then it starts showing

327
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:46,240
up in the comments then people are like

328
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,730
what the [ __ ] you talking about hemp is

329
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,240
not allergic I almost died I had a

330
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,800
tablespoon of hemp protein and it was

331
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,720
like getting kicked in the stomach for

332
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,458
four hours every four minutes with a

333
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,259
spike so like you're saying you have an

334
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:01,838
allergy to the plant there's something

335
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:03,519
most protein most allergies are protein

336
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,050
based so probably something like that in

337
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,720
there you're not gonna have I'm not a

338
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:10,750
doctor but you know it's you don't

339
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,209
extract proteins in oils obviously

340
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:17,980
whatever protein here allergic to

341
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:19,208
militia chunks of microbe bacteria in

342
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,250
there or something or other and there's

343
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:23,019
proteins in those but you can get things

344
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,179
that are small but a protein in but not

345
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:27,039
cannabis proteins so that would make

346
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:28,989
sense and a lot of sift would still have

347
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,269
it because it's got the hand cells in

348
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,560
there and they have their selves so

349
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:35,319
their proteins around around you know

350
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,329
trace tiny amounts but for allergies as

351
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,278
you know it doesn't take put a molecule

352
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,750
really sometimes so yeah it's

353
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,750
interesting so for you it's perfectly

354
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,490
appropriate and so it'd be a

355
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,110
pharmaceuticals made from synthetics I

356
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,399
mean as far as just trying to seek

357
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,379
relief I would think that they'd

358
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,579
wouldn't cause the allergy program

359
00:14:50,379 --> 00:15:01,059
problem but it's a problem that's what I

360
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:03,490
figured because I've looked at why it's

361
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:04,989
something it's not coming out nothing

362
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,778
organism it could be another organism

363
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:11,560
that lives on cannabis that he did his

364
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:14,759
body looks at as an attacking organism

365
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:17,979
and through an allergen antigen response

366
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,470
mast cell degranulation occurs and he

367
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:26,440
has an allergic response hey Rob what's

368
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:29,500
up with the Philo's project the final

369
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,320
project we we presented

370
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:38,509
loudly alms the edify Lois bioscience

371
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:40,760
and I presented a workshop at the

372
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:43,309
Emerald cup and basically I covered the

373
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:46,700
new taxonomy a little bit and tried to

374
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:48,619
explain how it presents a model for us

375
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,589
trying to figure out the evolution of

376
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:56,078
cannabis a hypothesis to hang real data

377
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:59,000
and Mowgli's project is looking at

378
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:04,189
genetic sequences the genome sequences

379
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,610
of so far about 1,500 dispensary samples

380
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:11,420
and seeing how they're interrelated this

381
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:14,690
is part of the project and now what I've

382
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:19,159
been looking for along with the Sam the

383
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:21,200
skunk man is getting samples of landrace

384
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,949
varieties the basic building blocks that

385
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:27,769
we use to make the scenes to meet

386
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,209
varieties we have today the hybrid

387
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:31,700
scenes medium varieties we have today

388
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:36,399
and once we have these older samples

389
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:39,769
from the 70s from before from very early

390
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:44,778
homegrown varieties pre indica Priya

391
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:46,519
Afghan pre broadleaf drug varieties then

392
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:48,769
we'll be able to put a time sense on

393
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,350
this and see some of the beginning of

394
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:52,850
the evolutionary ideas corroborating

395
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,100
some of the history we know but it'll be

396
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,199
interesting too to be able to click on

397
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,659
your sample for instance in the database

398
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,479
and see how it's related to other

399
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:05,168
samples in the database and how it was

400
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,120
related to ancestrally see if your

401
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:09,740
hybrid variety has tie or Colombian or

402
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,708
african and things like that

403
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,910
so that's the type of thing that one of

404
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,689
the things you can do with a sort of

405
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,339
genome data

406
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:18,140
yes that's what I'm interested in I'm

407
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:21,259
interested in the evolutionary questions

408
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,970
it might also genome work might also be

409
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:26,509
really interesting for terpene reading

410
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:29,329
because terpene breeding is difficult at

411
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:31,779
least in comparison to cannabinoid

412
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:35,000
breeding cannabinoids are basically a

413
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:38,329
linear chain of synthesis you

414
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,369
cannabidiol the and THC they're both

415
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:42,829
from the same precursor that's about the

416
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:45,319
only split in the pathway that we

417
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:47,048
deal with it on a daily basis we know

418
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:50,538
the enzymes for each of these steps

419
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:52,879
there there are multiple alleles of some

420
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:54,140
of these enzymatic steps but they're

421
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,909
pretty well understood they're easy to

422
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:02,080
breed for potency super easy to breed

423
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:04,909
for your breeding for one one allele and

424
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:07,460
against another allele so it's just it's

425
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:11,440
very simple but terpenes are much more

426
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,440
complicated they start with a number of

427
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:16,788
basic molecules they have ramified

428
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:18,740
pathways controlled by lots of enzymes

429
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:20,990
and more importantly there are lots of

430
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:24,288
changes in the synthesis that are non

431
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:27,620
enzymatic they happen due to heat and

432
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:29,329
time and things like this so it's it's

433
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:31,729
just a much more difficult thing to deal

434
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:34,038
with and I think we see Suites of

435
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:38,058
terpenes come through inbreeding but

436
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:41,119
they would be analogous to one branch of

437
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:44,200
this complicated synthesis biosynthesis

438
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,518
pathways and those seem to be pretty

439
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,919
reproducible in varieties we've also

440
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:50,778
lost lots of unique aromas over the

441
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,940
years every breeder asked you see a pop

442
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:55,638
up once and you breathe that plane and

443
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,669
it's just gone you know and it's it's

444
00:18:55,638 --> 00:19:00,288
that and then of course you have many

445
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:03,259
many terpenes instead of just a few

446
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:04,700
cannabinoids in many varieties so then

447
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:06,888
aroma the things that you're

448
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,500
appreciating particularly or the effects

449
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:11,569
that come from a suite of terpenes not

450
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,880
just one or two that's another aspect

451
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:17,028
when you're trying to apply what you

452
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:20,360
bred to what you got and how you use it

453
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:22,880
and how it affects patients or other

454
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,138
users so yeah it's really complicated so

455
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,000
breeding can help with this it could

456
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:29,269
give it generates get up with this could

457
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,679
give us our markers for some of these

458
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:32,750
terpenes that we'd be particularly

459
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,820
interested in rare ones for instance be

460
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,669
able to screen huge populations without

461
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:40,849
drying them to maturity all kinds of

462
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:43,580
advances for breeding did a genome work

463
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:45,199
so maybe turkeys in your blood is that

464
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:49,129
when you're focusing on initially a

465
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,798
particular genetic no no no no I'm only

466
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,179
interested in the evolutionary pathways

467
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:56,119
and what's really happened to make

468
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:56,360
cannabis what it is today and try to tie

469
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:58,069
the

470
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:01,459
into the human relationship with

471
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:03,740
cannabis instance my interest really do

472
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:07,610
you think man has been using cannabis in

473
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:12,890
conjunction how long have been using

474
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:14,178
cameras humans at least at least since

475
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,250
the beginning of the Holocene epoch

476
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:19,460
twelve thousand years ago ten twelve

477
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:21,890
thousand years ago I mean how much

478
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:25,130
before that really hard to say there's

479
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,720
there's a cursory evidence maybe some of

480
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,280
the fiber evidence that's been found is

481
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,620
actually cannabis but there's no proof

482
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:33,259
in areas but probably in the previous

483
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:35,479
warm periods before the Pleistocene the

484
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:38,140
last ice age Guinness was used as well

485
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,750
we don't really have any evidence of it

486
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:44,600
have you read Michael Pollan's book the

487
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,369
botany of desire uh yeah I kind of had a

488
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:48,529
hand at or hiding at least the cannabis

489
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:50,119
chapter sure I figured you would it was

490
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:52,009
kind of an interesting book the way he

491
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:54,199
goes back with humans and looks at these

492
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:56,390
important relationship these plants that

493
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,130
we've taken with us and sort of

494
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:01,160
popularized through our relationship

495
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,700
with them yeah I think you got a lot of

496
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,320
mileage out of that it's it's a

497
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:09,140
accessible narrative well-written

498
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,819
ethnobotany which is a field that most

499
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,880
people don't know much about you know

500
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:16,519
and it's the relationship both ethno

501
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,250
humanity with botany with plants and

502
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,990
it's it's like geography it's one of

503
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,298
these sort of all-encompassing field

504
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:26,599
sirs they all tie together there's death

505
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:29,029
note geography and geographical botany

506
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:31,069
so they're all related but they're

507
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:33,379
they're cool fields and what he did was

508
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:35,058
make this accessible to a lot of people

509
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,580
and not just I mean Canada's was sort of

510
00:21:35,058 --> 00:21:39,619
the Gateway plan on the four chapters I

511
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:41,539
suppose but you know potatoes and tulips

512
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:43,849
and apples are important too and they

513
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:45,589
all told the same story of how humans

514
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:51,980
interact with plants and vice versa

515
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:54,168
so that's of course paper another

516
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,690
another thing to build on what Rob

517
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:58,460
saying is you know you have the flavor

518
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,830
of the resin heads that are being

519
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,058
produced I also noticed you know with

520
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:04,759
breeding and growing out large

521
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:06,319
populations the plant material has a

522
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:08,079
distinct flavor as well I mean I've

523
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,970
found strains where

524
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,069
the resin smells really good the plants

525
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,750
growing really great I harvest the bud

526
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:15,669
they smell like what I want them to but

527
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,890
the herb doesn't smoke right and I grew

528
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:20,740
that clone several times after that in

529
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:23,770
the herb just has a poor flavor or I've

530
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:27,160
gotten strains that produce like little

531
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:29,859
tiny little black embryos in it you know

532
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:32,080
and and those are just like you know I

533
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:33,759
grew some like landrace Cambodian stuff

534
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:35,470
it's like they're not seeds but they're

535
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,539
these little little tiny things and they

536
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,200
they'll crackle and stuff and there's

537
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:39,759
all these uh

538
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,009
you know not only is there the terpenes

539
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:45,759
that are going to be and we're not you

540
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:47,410
know extracts aside of course when

541
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,539
you're breeding for a plant that tastes

542
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,700
good when you smoke the herb it's the

543
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:53,139
the terpenes that are growing on the

544
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,539
plant everything but also the how the

545
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:58,290
plant material taste can have a good or

546
00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:04,359
bad influence in my experience as well

547
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:08,678
yeah make sense Oh Rob's muted you can

548
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:10,629
unmute Rob it's it's the other 90% of

549
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:13,870
the plant besides the resins of course

550
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:16,620
it's gonna have its own flavors and

551
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:17,769
tastes and like any vegetable matter no

552
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:21,639
sorry

553
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:24,369
some are going to be bad yeah I hate

554
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,080
those little tiny nubs in some varieties

555
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:28,058
they're largely gone from our seats new

556
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,220
varieties but back in the day you get it

557
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:32,289
you think man I got a seedless button

558
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,240
you can't get those things out there

559
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:36,428
like little pyramids they don't roll out

560
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,240
like seeds they're they taste just as

561
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:42,370
bad yeah yeah yeah it's not it's not fun

562
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,380
especially when you get a plant that has

563
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:47,079
the terpene you know like the herbs

564
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,790
smell you're like oh oh yeah and then

565
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:50,710
you break it up you're like okay this is

566
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:57,308
this is totally [ __ ] for smoking herb

567
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:59,440
from it absolutely just someone just

568
00:23:57,308 --> 00:24:01,178
told me I sound stoned and I said well I

569
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:07,350
hope so I've been working at it all

570
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:09,910
morning trying my best

571
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:14,829
hey Rob have you ever heard of this

572
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:20,380
compound called hashish een that this

573
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:22,960
French group has isolated no I oh it's

574
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,690
is fascinating paper I mean again we

575
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,200
talked about this in hashed Church about

576
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:31,500
how the a lot of the terpenes again

577
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,490
undergo all kinds of thermal

578
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,140
rearrangements especially when you heat

579
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,690
them up so you know you know what you

580
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,400
see in the GC and what you see at room

581
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,250
temperature might be two very very

582
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,710
different things and so this group in

583
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,929
France this is a really fascinating

584
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:52,390
paper I think I'd put the link in the

585
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:55,450
chat here identify this compound in in

586
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:57,220
several different samples the effect in

587
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:00,240
fact it was in all of the samples that

588
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:05,110
they tested and it's a five five

589
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:07,298
dimethyl one vinyl by cyclo to one one

590
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:09,849
hexane it's a very interesting structure

591
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:13,869
and when I look at it it doesn't look

592
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:17,980
like something that would be stable even

593
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:20,918
at you know at nail temperature or even

594
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,919
even at rosin making temperature and I'm

595
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,270
wondering if there's things actually

596
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,059
polymerizing in some way to make some

597
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:31,869
sort of polymerized version of this

598
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:33,579
terpene it's a very interesting you know

599
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:36,308
Turkey and it's pretty rare it's not

600
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:41,199
widely reported on in the literature and

601
00:25:36,308 --> 00:25:43,750
until this group in France reported on

602
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,298
it I I had not really heard of it coming

603
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:50,079
from cannabis at all so this is a group

604
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:52,658
in in in France that's basically

605
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,939
reported this as being a volatile

606
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:56,980
constituent from many different samples

607
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,490
that they've looked at i I've never seen

608
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,558
it before

609
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:04,450
until this week I was just wondering if

610
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:06,009
you've ever seen it no I haven't yeah I

611
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,259
haven't seen it that's interesting I'd

612
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:11,230
like to know more about it's a terpenoid

613
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:13,329
huh yeah it's it's basically it's a

614
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:16,419
thermal and they've actually come up

615
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:18,490
with mechanisms to account for not just

616
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:22,059
this compound but several others that

617
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:25,870
are found that they found by it by their

618
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:28,210
GC analysis let me um post the link here

619
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:30,969
so you can be looking at paper maybe

620
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,910
well I think what will happen I mean the

621
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:36,519
the labs look for from

622
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:38,710
eight to maybe thirty terpenes not the

623
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:40,240
labs can find they're all named terpenes

624
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:44,558
they're the ones that can find standards

625
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:48,669
were there the easy ones we've done

626
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:50,700
analyses with with perfume labs also in

627
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:53,980
France years ago and they come up with

628
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:56,019
5060 terpenes and that are named and

629
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,419
then a whole lot of just numbered

630
00:26:56,019 --> 00:27:00,038
retention time Peaks so they don't have

631
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:02,950
names for and there's lots and lots of

632
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:04,629
terpenes that don't don't have names

633
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,460
from their source plan or whatever and

634
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,200
I'm sure the harder we look in cannabis

635
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,360
the more we're gonna find and so

636
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,069
possibly unique to cannabis although

637
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:14,678
none have been found yet that I'm aware

638
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:17,139
yes that's my real question I mean

639
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:19,390
cannabis has this unique ability to

640
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,820
smell like almost every other plant on

641
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:24,549
the planet right I mean you got pine you

642
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:29,109
got fruits you got almost everything out

643
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:31,960
there it's how does it do that right how

644
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:33,579
is you know how is when most oranges all

645
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,340
smell like oranges there's no blue

646
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:39,308
blueberry orange or like skunk orange or

647
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:41,408
you know whatever may be it may be

648
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:42,819
possible but you know the people have

649
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,980
done a lot of breeding with other plants

650
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:49,599
as well and haven't really gotten such a

651
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:53,919
wide range of of terpenes and it's just

652
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:56,349
it's amazing to me that it I display

653
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,030
it's got to have unique ones to it

654
00:27:56,349 --> 00:28:00,189
because there's plants that smell like

655
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:02,470
nothing else - there's cannabis plants

656
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,990
that are unique to cannabis in my

657
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:07,480
experience yeah those are manifestations

658
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:09,700
that happen at the genetic level that

659
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,220
like Rob said you know what the genes do

660
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,730
is the genes express proteins and the

661
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,850
proteins are essentially the Cellular's

662
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,880
machinery

663
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:21,099
that basically produces I mean proteins

664
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,340
or enzymes but they're also structural

665
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:26,349
in nature and they're basically creating

666
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:28,509
all the compounds including the terpenes

667
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:30,359
and the cannabinoids and and you know

668
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:35,109
like Rob said the unique thing about

669
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:39,399
about cannabis in terms of its its

670
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:41,469
terpenoids is that it's got this CB gea

671
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,140
synthase which preen elates

672
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,759
all at alba capsid which is a very

673
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,100
unique sort of you know

674
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,259
bond formation in in the plant kingdom

675
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:54,069
and that sort of creates that the

676
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:55,289
cannabinoid pathway but you know be that

677
00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:58,480
as of May

678
00:28:55,289 --> 00:29:02,440
terpenes are are are ubiquitous they're

679
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:05,230
in all the fruit and food that we eat I

680
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,180
mean people are like you know we can't

681
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,009
get good terpenes on the East Coast well

682
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:11,560
just open up your refrigerator they're

683
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:13,420
in there they're everywhere there's no

684
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:16,629
reason why mother nature would make a

685
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:19,810
unique set of phytochemicals for one

686
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:22,120
plant and not use them economically

687
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:23,980
throughout the plant kingdom so I mean

688
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:26,109
terpenes are everywhere they're the same

689
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,690
terpenes that are in mints in the same

690
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:31,750
terpenes in a lot of different varieties

691
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:34,690
it's just the mixture of those terpenes

692
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:36,700
it's like each individual molecule you

693
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,440
could think of as an instrument and a

694
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,930
different music that the orchestra plays

695
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,170
which is what we end up feeling is a

696
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:46,060
function of the ensemble of many many

697
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,650
different compounds and how they work

698
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:50,769
together and how they work with our

699
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:53,769
individual receptors in our bodies it's

700
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:55,389
not just individual one single terpene

701
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:58,450
that's why I always laugh one you know

702
00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:01,360
people say pure terpenes there's no such

703
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:04,450
thing as pure terpenes terpenes are such

704
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,859
a wide class a molecule that molecules

705
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,920
we're talking about it's such a very

706
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:11,199
very small fraction of you know phyto

707
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,630
terpenes that are derived from cannabis

708
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,809
and alike it's such a very very small

709
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:19,000
fraction of the total terpenes it's like

710
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:21,369
fungi I mean they have their own goddamn

711
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,619
Kingdom there's a huge collection of

712
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:27,699
terpenes that don't resemble anything

713
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:31,349
like what cannabis and if you try to dab

714
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,350
those you'll probably get really sick

715
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,799
question and because this is something

716
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:38,230
that I get asked all the time and it is

717
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:41,730
are all these terpenes equal because

718
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:46,779
when I get handed co2 pens that are

719
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:49,569
clearly mixed with terpenes that may be

720
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:52,240
found on cannabis but we're not derived

721
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:53,889
from cannabis like the D limonene thing

722
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,809
like when when somebody handed me that

723
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:58,780
and it tasted oh yeah while tastes

724
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:59,470
better than the co2 oil did um but are

725
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:01,418
these things

726
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:04,000
I mean if we have terpenes that are

727
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:05,919
honestly derived from cannabis that's

728
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,200
one thing because that's what's on the

729
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,650
buds we smoke but if we are now smoking

730
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:14,409
you know essence of orange degreaser

731
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:17,860
from Florida chemists I

732
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:22,690
I mean I have to ponder it this isn't

733
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:24,668
the same thing is it the molecules are

734
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,620
the same molecules I mean again whether

735
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:28,659
or not they have some residuals from

736
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:30,250
where they came from could determine

737
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:33,460
whether or not they can be you know

738
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:36,700
sweat it out is oh that limonene came

739
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,890
from came from orange peels I mean you

740
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:43,480
could talk to her ratio about this some

741
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:45,788
of the low-level decontaminant or some

742
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,099
of the contamination products hydro

743
00:31:45,788 --> 00:31:50,349
peroxides and whatnot can be noxious

744
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:53,619
materials but again I think you're just

745
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:55,658
getting it like an into larger dose it

746
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:58,509
would be like standing right in front of

747
00:31:55,659 --> 00:32:01,659
the tuba and let the tuba play you just

748
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:03,460
get this huge dose of tuba as opposed to

749
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:06,130
being in the back of the concert hall

750
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,659
and listening to the tuba as it plays

751
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,309
along with the rest of the orchestra

752
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,470
which is a completely different

753
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:13,029
experience than sitting right next to

754
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:16,419
the tube and getting blasted out by the

755
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:20,829
tuba right really does that make sense

756
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:23,049
absolutely any I love your analogies of

757
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:27,279
music they're just exactly right but

758
00:32:23,048 --> 00:32:28,629
it's it's a the Todd's also talking

759
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,308
about this quality in the source

760
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,350
material I mean certainly you can get

761
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:34,450
aromatherapy oils for more natural

762
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:36,609
sources and things and they've gotta be

763
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,919
better breathe than the keyboard cleaner

764
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:44,259
I mean you know there's levels of

765
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:48,009
limonene so yeah and where we're sitting

766
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:49,779
here at the Chateau level of extracts

767
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:52,029
and concentrates you know we're talking

768
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:53,379
in the cerebral levels but you got to

769
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:55,119
remember that there's a lot of people

770
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:58,750
who the best thing they can get is so

771
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:00,579
lousy co2 extract with some keyboard

772
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:04,929
cleaner put in it you know people

773
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:06,908
actually do smoke this stuff yeah it's

774
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:08,710
uh back to you know we need some

775
00:33:06,909 --> 00:33:10,539
regulation so sorry get slightly

776
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:13,090
political again but we need regulation

777
00:33:10,538 --> 00:33:15,240
for these things you know it's can't let

778
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:18,878
snake oil salesman runaround and

779
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,099
poisonous all right hey I asked Rob the

780
00:33:18,878 --> 00:33:27,609
13 question about if we could use it as

781
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:30,219
indicators of encode what we're trying

782
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:34,209
to do at the Philo's project is work use

783
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:37,200
genome sequencing or shall I say

784
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:39,429
differences in the genome to genetics

785
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,048
genetic content of different plants

786
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:45,788
different individuals because that's so

787
00:33:41,048 --> 00:33:47,740
really looking at um cannabinoids have

788
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:50,558
been used for this for a long time that

789
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:54,368
was the chemo taxonomic marker that was

790
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:56,618
first used and then lots of labs used

791
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:59,829
that and then carl hillock added to this

792
00:33:56,618 --> 00:34:02,709
and indiana university in the in the

793
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:04,868
early 20th century published in 2004 and

794
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:08,889
five and one of the characters he used

795
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:14,219
besides cannabinoids and terpenoids he

796
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:14,220
use terpenoids as well and he used also

797
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:20,289
isozymes these are enzyme variations

798
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,950
they're the direct gene products are

799
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:25,960
nearly direct gene products of genes you

800
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:27,878
know they're that they're the molecules

801
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,889
that do the active work they express the

802
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:32,348
genes and he looked at variations in

803
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:35,349
those another way of chemo typing or

804
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:38,409
using chemicals to do cat taxonomy chemo

805
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:41,318
taxonomy now the new way of course is

806
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:43,710
with the genome sequencing but back to

807
00:34:41,318 --> 00:34:46,088
terpenes oh they are useful

808
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:47,440
taxonomically i can't steal other

809
00:34:46,088 --> 00:34:49,328
people's thunder and they haven't

810
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,429
managed to publish yet so I'll just hint

811
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:54,039
around but there are terpene classes

812
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:56,050
that have been identified these are

813
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:57,909
looking at the major terpenes not the

814
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:02,589
entire profile but the most prominent

815
00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:05,230
terpenes in each group now should I say

816
00:35:02,588 --> 00:35:07,719
or without saying too much um their

817
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,099
heritable it's all very interesting and

818
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:11,169
a paper will be out soon that talks

819
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:13,390
about this on the other hand for

820
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,068
taxonomic ease they're very difficult

821
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:17,170
for the same reasons ratio and

822
00:35:15,068 --> 00:35:19,358
everybody's explaining about differences

823
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:22,599
in grow room part of grow room being odd

824
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:24,489
or cold or whatever the the profiles of

825
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:25,289
terpenes probably don't change as much

826
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,419
as the apps

827
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:31,190
lewd amounts but the problem with that

828
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:33,480
is terpenes are of varying volatility so

829
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:36,150
profiles change of all the monitor

830
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,530
fiends are gone you know okay but you're

831
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,180
more likely to see that you have the

832
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:41,010
same general profile least of the

833
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:44,509
prominent cannabinoids and the other

834
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:46,770
ones very more by epigenetic

835
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,150
environmental whatever reasons but so

836
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:50,849
we're taxonomic characters they're a

837
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,530
little bit dodgy now this won't be

838
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:55,079
stealing anybody's thunder and I waited

839
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:58,110
today and see if somebody from SC labs

840
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,150
came in but they didn't and I'm very

841
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:03,030
fascinating paper in my hand here that I

842
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,680
would like to share with people it's s

843
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,019
he was involved in so it's going to wait

844
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:10,079
for the beginner it's really a paper

845
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:12,320
primarily out of Nolan cane and Brian

846
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,779
Lynch is lab at RC Colorado Boulder

847
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,769
their genome guys and they've managed to

848
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:22,820
put together a number of datasets for

849
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:25,559
mostly drug varieties um they have a few

850
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:27,750
one Chinese Health variety won't be

851
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,840
broadly helped may be sort of an

852
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:33,539
out-group in the in the in the

853
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,130
experiment they've done a really

854
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:37,429
interesting job here it's on a cursory

855
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:40,079
level it's hard to match datasets

856
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:45,269
they're the first people to use the nlg

857
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:46,769
BLD nomenclature that the mark berlin

858
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,570
and i developed from carl Hilliard's

859
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:52,079
work and John Rick Portland's and others

860
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:56,190
and is interesting to see that more of a

861
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,980
genome look at the taxonomy rather than

862
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:01,200
just individual relationships so this is

863
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:04,019
a cool paper and steep hill did the

864
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:08,309
analyses of cannabinoids and terpenoids

865
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:10,320
in many of the samples and that was it

866
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:12,299
was taken into account also so back to

867
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,160
the US interpreting Xin taxonomy

868
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:19,160
it's the latest overlay of the paper it

869
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:21,299
mentions relationships rather than

870
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:24,569
general relationships rather than

871
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,550
fine-tuning things so that's kind of

872
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,800
where we're after beans taxonomy exists

873
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,630
papers called

874
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:37,640
genomic and chemical diversity in

875
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:37,640
cannabis just came out last week it is

876
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:52,119
boom it's put on bio bio r14 preprint

877
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:54,759
I'm not sure what journalist is actually

878
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:58,539
in this is a preprint copy to manuscript

879
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,640
copy all all any real friend just just

880
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:01,210
search genomic and chemical diversity in

881
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,679
cannabis

882
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:08,079
what's a quotes already you'll find it

883
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:09,669
it's Ryan Lynch my nch is primary author

884
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,269
Nolan Cain is the last author it's his

885
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:15,220
lab so yeah it's good stuff and this is

886
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:18,340
this is all these labs are giving us we

887
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:20,009
have this tremendous Mowgli and I gave

888
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,780
our our little presentation about

889
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,730
taxonomy and the finalist project and

890
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,330
then Mowgli nice at the next day on

891
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:32,260
Sunday on what they call the genetics

892
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:35,199
panel discussion moderated by Michael

893
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:37,900
Baucus a real smart guy and when his

894
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,819
colleagues Brian Lee was sitting on the

895
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:43,930
panel as well another real smart guy and

896
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:48,010
a breeder and known as chimera after

897
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:49,659
many of you and also on this panel were

898
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,140
some three really awesome games there's

899
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:55,449
Mowgli homes from Philo's Biosciences

900
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:58,000
John gage from University of British

901
00:38:55,449 --> 00:39:01,269
Columbia and I believe I got the

902
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,360
affiliations right and Kevin mckernon

903
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:07,150
for medicinal genomics these are all

904
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:10,150
three more extremely bright guys and

905
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:12,190
they're all working hands-on with with

906
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:16,690
the cannabis genome I wish we'd invited

907
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:19,539
Nolan Cain as well there was a really

908
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:21,190
good level of sites on many fronts at

909
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:22,599
the emerald-cut the shoes really

910
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:25,420
refreshing to see there are a lot of

911
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:27,069
panels about serious things not just

912
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,630
political which is a big issue in

913
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:31,030
California right now but also the

914
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:35,670
science front what these guys basically

915
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:39,360
explained was that it's not a big search

916
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:41,829
for genes please not within this group

917
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,680
it's not a big search for intellectual

918
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:46,360
property there will come a time when you

919
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:48,639
can patent cannabis plants in America

920
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,860
and insistently already have there may

921
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,429
come a time before that when our

922
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,670
industry develops

923
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:57,858
happening system but that's not what

924
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:01,369
this is about what this is about is

925
00:39:57,858 --> 00:40:04,000
making gene sequences from cannabis

926
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:06,980
excuse me gene sequences from cannabis

927
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,048
open source to make to bring them into

928
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,358
public domain this is what's happened

929
00:40:09,048 --> 00:40:13,278
naturally for years and years growers

930
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,469
are proud breeders are proud of their

931
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:17,778
new varieties and the sharing with their

932
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:20,778
friends that instantly makes them public

933
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:22,818
domain there are very few cannabis

934
00:40:20,778 --> 00:40:24,739
varieties that people have kept close to

935
00:40:22,818 --> 00:40:27,318
the chest whose wives have said them 10

936
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:31,328
years ago don't give this to anybody you

937
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:31,329
know whatever all Wellman all very good

938
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:38,358
but that's not what this is about what

939
00:40:36,108 --> 00:40:41,920
we're about is making it public domain

940
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:46,159
so that it's everybody is not anybody's

941
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:49,250
that meaning that it's for the entire

942
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:52,699
community and nobody can cubby hold out

943
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:54,318
and say it's mine only and that's could

944
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:57,379
be anybody that could be agribusiness

945
00:40:54,318 --> 00:41:01,308
that could be Big Pharma's people choose

946
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:03,349
to call it or it could be you

947
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:06,829
you know the breeder some individual

948
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:11,420
person that's a very sticky difficult

949
00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:13,068
slippery slope really it's uh takes a

950
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,420
lot of money to defend your intellectual

951
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:16,730
property rights through the patented

952
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,349
system and long and short of it if a big

953
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:21,650
company wants to steal from you can't

954
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:23,568
really outgo them anyway they have more

955
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:25,700
resources than you do so a better way to

956
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:28,038
protect us what would be presently being

957
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:32,088
called defensive intellectual property

958
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:34,520
rights protection and that is nearly

959
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:36,170
free you just submit varieties to a

960
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:39,380
group that is going to publish those

961
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:41,720
sequences any one of these groups might

962
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:45,769
be able to help you with that finalists

963
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:47,149
last slide certainly is we're also

964
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:49,338
sponsoring something called the open

965
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:53,200
cannabis project and that is exactly

966
00:41:49,338 --> 00:41:55,989
that an open forum for for not only

967
00:41:53,199 --> 00:42:00,439
publishing gene sequences but also

968
00:41:55,989 --> 00:42:04,489
discussing sticky issues like what is it

969
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,750
cush for things of this nature and with

970
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:09,348
more

971
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:11,809
genetic evidence we have more more ways

972
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:15,859
to entertain this discourse about what

973
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:17,829
varieties are and it's I'd also like to

974
00:42:15,858 --> 00:42:20,239
see something that's I'll suggested

975
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:23,049
openly now I don't see why not it's not

976
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:26,019
that big an idea I'd like to see a forum

977
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:29,269
set up by the the open cannabis project

978
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:31,880
that is set up like hash Church business

979
00:42:29,269 --> 00:42:33,949
worked so well this is brilliant you

980
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,130
begin possibly with people weighing in

981
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:39,079
maybe Sam the Scott man can talk about

982
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:41,150
what Scott number one is you know some

983
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:44,150
knowns as you would say in a scientific

984
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,369
experiment ease into this no talk about

985
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:49,070
the haze talk about some other ones that

986
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:50,840
are older building blocks things with

987
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:52,730
histories are quite known or if they're

988
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,349
controversial least they can be resolved

989
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,130
by somebody who was there you know

990
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:57,410
something like that

991
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,570
so a forum like this would be good it

992
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:01,608
would keep people from getting fight to

993
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:04,460
the back of the room and once that

994
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:08,690
people see what's going on with the old

995
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:10,099
standard varieties and if you'll andreas

996
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:11,869
discussions even they didn't get into

997
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:13,700
the fuel you know you can get into the

998
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:16,099
fire you know all this stuff you guys

999
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:18,500
are all wise you know Liz doubt about so

1000
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:20,420
yeah that's it that's a pretty much

1001
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,789
intellectual property rights things some

1002
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:25,369
dirt beatings and that's it

1003
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:27,588
take a run to Rob's only here for a

1004
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:29,720
couple more hours in flies away so he

1005
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:32,299
made his flight later so he could join

1006
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:35,750
us which I thought is cool so well thank

1007

1008
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,989

1010

00:43:58,338 --> 00:44:09,039
