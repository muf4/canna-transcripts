1
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,039
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,439
and today I'm here to talk to you a

3
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,599
little bit about one of my favorite

4
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,599
tools that I use on a regular basis you

5
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,079
guys see me traveling all over the world

6
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,600
with uh this tool and although most of

7
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,199
you are probably thinking it's the

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,120
mothership it's actually the denail that

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,399
I wanted to talk to you about today so

10
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:43,519
this is my 2.0 from the from the good

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,640
Folks at denail Stevie Hughes and Brian

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,480
schroer and I've been working with this

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,640
company for maybe a little bit less than

14
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:52,919
a year now I'm relatively new to the

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,759
whole dabbing scene and um I got turned

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,239
on first via the sublimator and quickly

17
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:02,320
found that uh the ease and the wonderful

18
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,280
just hit that you get from a from an

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,478
electronic nail in particular the denail

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,599
because that's the company that I ended

21
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:10,000
up going with after doing my

22
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,798
research I found that uh the guys at

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,438
denail are really pioneering and moving

24
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,360
things forward they're not just looking

25
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:19,000
at uh copying uh an existing company

26
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,280
that's out there but they've done a lot

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,359
of basically they did a lot of what I

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,759
did as as bubble bags and bubble man

29
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,640
when I first came out I was as you know

30
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,840
I was not the first uh bubble uh bag or

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,118
Bag company to release the water

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,320
extraction process there was one other

33
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,438
company before myself and uh that was a

34
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:42,158
two bag system and I feel that denil has

35
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:44,239
really done um I guess its customer base

36
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,399
a service much the way Bubble Bags has

37
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,718
done uh its customer base a service cuz

38
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,000
as you remember in the beginning Bubble

39
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:52,959
Bags was a two bag kit quickly became a

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,759
3 four 5 six 7even and an eight bag kit

41
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,359
and that increased the quality of the

42
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,078
product and it increased the quality of

43
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:01,399
the final product that the customer was

44
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,519
able to get so so I was going to take

45
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,879
you through a few things that Dil sent

46
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,438
me recently they've been sending me so

47
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,598
much stuff and I haven't really made a

48
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:11,799
perfect video just for them so I wanted

49
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:14,039
to I guess first go over the old uh

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,879
titanium nail uh that they have they've

51
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,639
got a two-piece nail here I do believe

52
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,439
it's just a two-piece yeah the bottom

53
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,839
part does not screw off on this one so

54
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:28,079
it's a 144 no matter what and then uh

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,280
the old style of element is right here

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,680
and that's how you attach that

57
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,039
that so this is the old thae nail a 144

58
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,400
and this was the one that I used uh with

59
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:42,158
denail for for anytime that my quartz

60
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,680
Banger wasn't working which I have on

61
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:45,000
here right now a pooking bee it is a

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,159
little bit dirty sorry that it's not a

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,239
little bit cleaner but that's the

64
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:51,598
pooking bee and that's the 20 mil coil

65
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:55,319
so the the bowl is a little bit bigger

66
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:57,518
than say the 16 which you can see right

67
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,639
here comparably they are quite a bit of

68
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,840
a different size one fits the ceramic

69
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,439
disc as well as the um Sapphire disc a

70
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,439
lot better and that would be this one

71
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:10,120
and this is the one that we're going to

72
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,959
do the sapphire hits on I will talk a

73
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,799
little bit about this pooking bee quartz

74
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,519
really like this this was my savior in

75
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,799
Amsterdam this year because I pooched my

76
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:23,599
20 mil cord I pooched my 20 mil cord and

77
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,519
I was forced to use um a smaller cord

78
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,479
which I'm not even sure if I have that

79
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,400
particular cord present here oh here it

80
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,639
is right here so this is the new

81
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,239
uh Kevlar wrapped whips that Dil are are

82
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:40,000
selling now and you can see that this

83
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:43,640
particular um coil is a 16 so it fits

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,799
that bowl perfectly and in fact it also

85
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,158
fits the new titanium nail so let me

86
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,000
show you a little bit about what these

87
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,120
guys have done they've made it a

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,079
wonderful that you can screw off the

89
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,079
part this is the 14th that fits into my

90
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,120
bowl you can screw this off and you can

91
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,400
get it in either 18 or 14 so you don't

92
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,438
have to replace your whole nail now the

93
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,200
nail is a little bit different in the

94
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,479
sense that the coil is going to go

95
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:11,119
around the top of the nail much like the

96
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,359
quartz bangers and they've offset the

97
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,959
hole to the side and it's quite a deep

98
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,519
dish so you can really fill that up if

99
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,600
you're looking to take monster rips I

100
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,160
also like the way they've allowed it to

101
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,759
split in half and if you want to collect

102
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,639
um some of that condensed reclaim um

103
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,560
this is really wonderful stuff for

104
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,240
putting on skin ailments this is great

105
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,600
stuff for removing moles or putting on

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,840
scars anything that you've got on your

107
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,320
skin that you're kind of not digging the

108
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:44,239
oil that condenses in these nails is

109
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,360
really an effective medicine for those

110
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,199
exterior skin problems you could also

111
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,199
use it to cook into metes and Etc but I

112
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,360
just personally use it on um different

113
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,639
skin things that I have I actually

114
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,160
removed a mole from my neck using this

115
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,000
very

116
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,199
thing so let me just get to the next

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,120
part here I've got a couple of other

118
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,680
quartz bangers from puking be these are

119
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,519
dirty ones they're both direct injection

120
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,038
so this one's obviously a slide that

121
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,639
just fits into the bowl and this one's

122
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,599
an actual you know goes on proper you've

123
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,360
seen me use this before um uh on the

124
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,919
Dosa from

125
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:25,280
Flav so um I've also got the new dog

126
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:28,359
housee from uh denil which is the um

127
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:31,399
quartz Banger uh all pooking be quartz

128
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:35,080
with a quartz Dabber with a quartz

129
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:37,679
um um cap cap so a carb cap so while you

130
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:40,159
drop your your HIIT into there you cap

131
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,959
the hole as well unfortunately I broke

132
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,000
this one in Amsterdam but uh how it

133
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:49,599
works uh simply put is you use the coil

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,639
it goes around like that and then it had

135
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,479
um it had a u on it that went around and

136
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,079
dipped into the piece some of you may or

137
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:59,079
may not have seen that on the channel

138
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:01,758
earlier but today what I wanted to

139
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:04,599
really talk about was the new denail

140
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,160
inserts these Sapphire inserts are

141
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,319
absolutely killer I'm not joking um the

142
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,240
ceramic was not even comparable they

143
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,879
sent me both their black ceramic and

144
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,280
their white ceramic a variety of white

145
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,120
Ceramics as denil was looking to get the

146
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,799
best possible ceramic that they that

147
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,918
they could get and on a side note um

148
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,038
speaking of ceramic Hive has a ceramic

149
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,478
bowl that now denil is working with so

150
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:30,680
I'm really happy to see Hive and denail

151
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,758
working together to produce the utmost

152
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,199
quality of ceramic because as you know

153
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,560
when we heat these things up if we're

154
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,240
using cheaper materials there's going to

155
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,038
be off gassing and there's going to be

156
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,038
things that we don't want to bring into

157
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,759
our

158
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:48,719
lungs so without further Ado I guess

159
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,598
right off the bat I'm going to take just

160
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,360
a straight rip I got some uh real nice

161
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:57,038
Astro Boy melty bubble here that I've

162
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,400
had curing for months so we'll just do a

163
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,399
little quick rip of the Astro Boy

164
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:15,439
and yes I'm using a hive ceramic carb

165
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,519
cap Dash

166
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:20,719
Dabber great little tool I picked up in

167
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:23,959
Amsterdam as well I picked up a highly

168
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,199
educated task Rock uh gift from my good

169
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:29,478
buddy Buddha from so thank you so much

170
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,038
Alex really nice kick down and I have

171
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:33,639
using it quite a bit but it is in my

172
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,519
other bag and that's why it's not here

173
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:37,680
God The Taste on that asra boy is candy

174
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,159
likee so we're going to open one of

175
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,160
these ceramic uh sorry

176
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,599
Sapphire the sapphire inserts and one of

177
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,840
the things that I really love about the

178
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:51,878
sapphire insert is that it just hits so

179
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,359
smoothly it's it's it breathes a

180
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,000
different way than the ceramic that I've

181
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,280
hit so far I find that when it's on the

182
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,399
sapphire that it's seems to give me more

183
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,878
of a hit like as if it was on a screen

184
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,878
that wasn't plugged as opposed to being

185
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,479
on a screen that was very plugged up

186
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,400
with carbon and and Ash I just don't get

187
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:15,680
the same pull and same taste but the

188
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:18,638
sapphire I'll tell you it has really

189
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,478
opened my mind to enjoying hitting bowls

190
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,400
with the insert now originally these

191
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:28,639
yeah these inserts were originally

192
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:30,839
designed to go inside um I guess I guess

193
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,519
they were origin designed to go inside

194
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:36,838
this kind of a nail my nail of course is

195
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,799
a special nail um let me see this one

196
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,200
might have it yes this

197
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,759
one uh originally when they made me my

198
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,120
titanium nail I asked them to shave down

199
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,200
the middle piece so you can see in this

200
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,320
one it's been shaved down and because it

201
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,120
got shaved down the the sapphire piece

202
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,480
does not fit and funny enough that's why

203
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,000
I started placing my sapphires on top

204
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,120
and I guess a lot of people are doing

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,839
this now uh it it wasn't really a tech

206
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,399
as much as it was a mistake and Brian

207
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,519
laughed quite loud that's how it was

208
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,159
supposed to fit this is how these are

209
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,839
supposed to fit on uh your nail they go

210
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,759
right inside however I never hit them

211
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:17,640
like that personally I love the idea of

212
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:20,639
placing it on top of of of a quartz and

213
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:23,838
then allowing the the viewer to see the

214
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,120
hit melting and and bubbling away so

215
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,880
without further Ado why don't we do that

216
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,120
why don't we throw one of these ceramic

217
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:33,049
stacks on top of the Dil and give you

218
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,450
guys a little

219
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:36,449
[Music]

220
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:46,639
show we is not here to trick the

221

224
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,639
of

225
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,600
dying well I imagine the there be some

226
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,600
cops setting

227
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:15,879
up upon your scene inter in my that and

228

behind your me and my

229
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:27,560
te all right so that was the tastiest of

230
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,680
rips that was the CBD Renee that first

231
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:32,919
rip on the sapphire insert I can't even

232
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,838
begin to explain to you the level of

233
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,759
taste that is coming off of that not

234
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,600
your standard Renee or your standard

235
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:42,958
canonic but a mixture of the two Fruity

236
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,759
Fruity goodness no doubt about it very

237
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,078
impressed and that was uh Matt Baron

238
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,120
from the house of the great Gardener who

239
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,838
crossed a canonic with a Renee to come

240
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,480
up with his CBD Renee really delicious

241
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,880
stuff um I have very very very little of

242
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,639
it left but uh there's what it looks

243
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:02,240
like and this is just dry sift that's

244
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:05,159
been cleaned to 99% heads or

245
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,039
so so next up what we're going to hit is

246
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:10,719
we're going to hit some of d42 K dry

247
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:12,599
sift this is OG Kush he gave this to me

248
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,079
probably a year ago now close to a year

249
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,920
ago because I believe I went up there in

250
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,719
December to visit him last time and

251
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,719
that's when he gave me this it's in one

252
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,959
of the 420 jars so it's one of those

253
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:27,360
glass light proof jars and I'll tell you

254
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:29,039
this is some greasy greasy [ __ ] I'm not

255
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,200
sure if it's going to allow the camera

256
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,919
camera to grab on but you know what why

257

SI no wet washing on this particular red

264
00:11:53,559 --> 00:12:00,359

M it is only here to do

266
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,360
pury

267
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,399
[Music]

[Music]

270
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,639
right well wow that d420 K sift was

271
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,799
explosive I'm sure you guys saw it on

272
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:09,839
the sapphire insert the way it seemed to

273
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,319
grease from the outside out just the way

274
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,639
the water almost water-like substance

275
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,639
seemed to just release and melt puddling

276
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:20,198
across that Sapphire insert I'll tell

277
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:23,039
you I was excited as I saw it I got to

278
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:25,319
take a really nice hit very strong still

279
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,039
a year later well cured in the jar I

280
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,399
haven't been keeping it in anything

281
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,439
other than room temperature I've lost

282
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,480
this thing probably 10 times since he

283
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,680
gave it to me it's the only reason I

284
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,800
have some left so that was a beautiful

285
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:44,479
taste I think what we're going to finish

286
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:46,879

294

everything that I saw um I saw some

295

it's got this fruity slightly sweet

335
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:17,440
taste but really what it's got is an

336
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:19,440
overwhelming exotic sativa Haze taste

337
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,199

338
