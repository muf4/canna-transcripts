out each one of these um herbs which I

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,680
believe you grew uh with your new

16
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:14,040
nutrient line yeah all grown with

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,200
rainbow nutrients and we've had some

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,920
fantastic results yeah well have to say

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,240
it looks great um I'm ready to dip in

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,280
for certain I'm quite excited to try the

21
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,599
the two that I passed your way but also

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,079
I'm really excited to try that headband

23
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,118
you know what that's my new favorite I

24
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:30,679
think this stuff could win a cup and

25
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,319
actually that's probably I entry into

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,320
any cups I enter this year um if you

27
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,679
look at it it's kind of got a silver

28
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:40,758
kind of tone to it lots of TRC Combs

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,360
unbelievable flavor unbelievable smell

30
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,799
um not the best producer in the world

31
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,159
but potency wise pretty strong oh it it

32
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,799
kicks you in the face all right so

33
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,320
that's saying a lot if Remo is saying

34
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,118
that it kicks you in the face that means

35
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,798
it's a definitely a strong string from a

36
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:57,399
from an ex broker's perspective it looks

37
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,479
like that herb that you could just you

38
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,280
know that always a pleasure to yeah the

39
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:05,039
Hollywood

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,519
looks looky here a little nugget oh look

41
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:08,479
at that you got it sometimes I have to

42
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:12,359
put my hand in the background to get it

43
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,720
to clear out like that all right well

44
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,280
why don't you pick the first one that

45
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:20,199
we're going to hit oh it's right right

46
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,878
for the favorite yeah I'll only need a

47
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:24,199
tiny little bit so maybe put a tiny

48
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:26,239
little bit in the grinder for me too

49
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,598
okay here I'll let you take a hit and

50
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,680
I'll throw the rest in the joint yeah it

51
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,439
fits it I mean it fits a decent amount

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,560
but not uh nothing compared to the giant

53
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:36,719
fat joint that Remo is about to roll I'm

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,840
sure I'll take it easy today cuz I got

55
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,318
to do all these six and right probably

56
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,439
in a small amount of time yes you know

57
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:45,639
there's a it's like a sampling I know

58
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,239
that uh they have it with wine or you

59
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:49,359
can have uh it's a cannabis tasting or

60
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,439
it's a cannabis tasting there should be

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,280
a name for this though a smorgus bud

62
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,800
aorus bud there we go so let me smell

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,519
that they should have a sneeze guard out

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,159
and a little basket of every kind of

65
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,680
weat you know Buffet I like it lit

66
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,878
gently lit with some fluorescent lights

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,319
so you can examine the buds before

68
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,959
smoking oh you got to just stuff it in

69
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,359
there yeah it's going trust me first

70
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,360
nice and

71
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:19,439
gentle

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,439
oh thank you sir yeah not a

73
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:25,959
problem I haven't really um well many

74
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,920
many people will see this video and say

75
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,400
wow bubble man you're smoking herb You

76
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,438
Never Smoke herb okay no he's baby I do

77
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,239
not smoke herb it's true it doesn't mean

78
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:38,199
that I don't love herb I love herb

79
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,000
because it brings me the resin and how I

80
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,479
choose most of the time to acquire that

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,519
resin is through the mechanical

82
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:47,719
separation using screens or through the

83
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,080
ice water extraction method now this is

84
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:53,438
merely a third method of extracting

85
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,280
resin this is the hot air extractor mhm

86
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,280
so we one two three four the

87
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,120
button there we go and then hold it down

88
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,318
for 4

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,360
seconds the light goes on and she starts

90
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,119
climbing wow where can you get one of

91
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,840

109
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,560
like when you have a big joint of

110
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:58,120
something awesome it's not that I don't

114
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,400
more for me of course but at the same

115
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,360
time I really want to try all these

116
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:11,439
different flavors and so you know now

117

cheers

120
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:32,680
wow that is some trippy stuff very nice

121
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:35,680
like immediate strong Kush flavors but

122
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,800
something else and it just hangs on the

123
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,280
lips The

124
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,360
Vapor very interesting guaranteed both

125
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,038
of us are getting slightly different

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,520
experiences from him smoking The Joint

127
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,439
the turpine profile cannabinoid profile

128
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,359
is going to be different for him than it

129
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,199
is for me through the vaporizer yet

130
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,199
we're both hitting the same strain oh

131
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,400
this stuff kind of takes my breath away

132
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,400
believeing it's just a unbelievable

133
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,720
okay well um while we're smoking this

134
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,720
and while you're vaping uh which one do

135
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,400
you want to try next I mean let's go

136
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,639
right over to the kosher kosher good

137
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,918
give my boys Don an air and a

138
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,879
shot right

139
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,680
on well that's where these seeds

140
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,038
originated from DNA

141
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,800
genetics and I think it was just a

142
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:29,240
standard pack of seeds I you know really

143
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,199
you'd have to smoke this weed to see how

144
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,918
good it is it is amazing but I can't

145
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,319
believe how produces it's one of my top

146
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:41,318
producing strains so that's up yeah that

147
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,720
was uh I I I sent a message to Aaron

148
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,360
today from DNA when uh Remo was telling

149
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,960
me a little bit about his Harvest from

150
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,759
the the kosher and Aaron was uh Aaron

151
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,079
was stoked of course he he was sorry

152
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:59,598
that he missed uh Remo while he was here

153
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,918
in BC Remo was over at uh Sun Peaks in C

154
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,319
well next year if we do it again we'll

155
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:06,198
make sure we all go to the same place

156
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:09,000
yeah we'll rip up some

157
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,439
slopes rip it up I say yeah we had a

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,439
good time lots of different uh levels of

159
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,160
skiers Dave had never been skiing ever

160
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,560
in his life you know um Kim was a pretty

161
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,479
good snowboarder Aaron was a pretty good

162

pretty decent it was nice we were all

164
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,000
able to stay in a group and not really

165
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:30,800
like separate too

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,240
badly those are sounding fun times

167
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,120
dude such good times I love hitting the

168
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,160
mountain fresh air and you know what my

169
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,840
favorite thing about going ski is the

170
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,560
chair left every time I go up the chair

171
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,119
left I smoke a joint I think skiing and

172
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,839
snowboarding are definitely Stoners SC

173
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,639
designed for you almost when you really

174
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,318
think of it well designed for our people

175
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,759
yeah I mean lit literally the I have to

176
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,319
admit like I am also very guilty in fact

177
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,879
sometimes when it's a more miserable day

178
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,080
and you've got a real storm kind of

179
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,400
happening we'll go down to Mid station

180
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,038
just to get on the Gandhi so we can have

181
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,719
a session

182
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,519
nice the gonola we like to call it yes

183
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,680
the

184
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:13,000
gonola that is of course the um the

185
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,199
excuse that Ross was able to use Ross

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,120
reati when he was stripped of his gold

187
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,319
medal in Nago Japan in 1998 oh it's a

188
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,240
secondhand smoke from the gonola that's

189
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,720
what he that's what he blamed absolutely

190
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,439
you to smell this this has got some

191
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,440
unique terpenoids a very um almost I

192
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,038
don't

193
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:34,240
know it's a sweet sharp smell let's

194
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:35,958
throw some of that in there oh yeah how'

195
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,440
you like the first one I liked it a lot

196
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:42,278
it had uh very very strong surprisingly

197
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,959
for Vapor I mean keep in mind for me

198
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:47,639
Vapor sure after I sit here and and

199
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:50,359
chain Vapor for an hour with Remo

200
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,240
through six to 10 varieties I'll have

201
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,639
the kind of high that I'm I'm looking

202
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,399
for throughout the day but I often get

203
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:00,199
that in just a couple of rips of dry

204
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,320
sift or wet wash so I consider you know

205
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,320
vaporizing especially out of a smaller

206
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,399
unit like this more for flavor for the

207
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,680
enjoyment of the herb uh but I literally

208
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,519
after one session on that feel pretty

209
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,278
damn good oh yeah no that's that is

210
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,360
medicine yeah that is medicine in the

211
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:21,039
sense that you could tell that that is a

212
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,879
pain reliever oh yeah it works for me

213
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,319
all right so here we go on the

214
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,639
kosher give her man Take It Out for a

215
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,360
Rip

216
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:31,360
eh absolutely

217
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,479
so the kosher has a more earthy taste if

218
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:41,359
I could explain the two Kush tastes uh

219
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,278
differently th this first one when I

220
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,919
tasted it for whatever reason when I was

221
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:50,039
tasting it the word platinum came to

222
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,958
mind Platinum I like I was just like oh

223
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,838
this is like Platinum kush or something

224
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:58,759
this is just so such a nice silvery this

225
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,360
one here is is is deeper in in its Earth

226
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:01,519
Tones through The Vapor at least I don't

227
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,240
know what the difference would be

228
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,200
through smoking it well it's got a sweet

229
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,079
uh taste to it when you smoke it but

230
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,519
it's uh it's very complex at the same

231
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:13,879
time it's got other flavors in there

232
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,560
yeah yeah the vapor changed a little bit

233
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,278
as well as of course what you'll notice

234
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,879
with the vaporizer like this

235
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:22,078
particularly when you're using herb like

236
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:23,879
this now Remo has not dried this herb

237
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,919
out to bone dry because that would be

238
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,039
very unenjoyable to smoke bone dry herb

239
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,199
makes it harsh harsh and terrible falls

240
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,000
apart you lose resin glands so I don't

241
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,959
know what the moisture content is but

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,120
it's it's nice and marshmallowy and and

243
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,119
well cured for for smoking a joint well

244
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,440
she snapping look oh yeah exactly for

245
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,039
sure she's Snapp I'll put this by the

246
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,920
mic okay 3 two 1

247
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,679
sh you hear that yep I heard that

248
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:50,559
totally yeah no I I don't mean that it's

249
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,439
wet in any way I just mean generally

250
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,319
when you're when you're um oh you don't

251
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,959
want it crispy crispy crispy that would

252
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,959
be bad for for smoking whereas for for

253
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,439
dry uh dry sifting and for vaporiz

254
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,319
making hash would be good though yeah

255
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,560
having it pretty dry is not not such a

256
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,560
bad

257
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,519
thing I guess the tries would fall off a

258
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:15,039
lot easier when it's absolutely crispy

259
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,240
oh I guess better turn up the heat now

260
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,278
she just turned down on me there we go

261
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,000
back up you go back up you go lot how

262
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,200
lot does that thing get well I'm not

263
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,879
sure I've never set it up past just 400°

264
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,120
right THC seems to vaporize around 387

265
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,519
or 390 or something so

266
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,320
406 I have it set at Fahrenheit right

267
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,679
now I think at 454 it actually ignites

268
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,120
and lights on

269
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:41,958
Fires exactly so when you when you see

270
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,078
me dump this it won't even be um very

271
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:46,359
discolored cuz I keep the temperature a

272
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,799
little a bit lower than just a little

273
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,759
bit yellow that looks like that Mexican

274
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:52,078
weed we used to get in the uh the 80s

275
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:56,480
there that color there except there'd be

276
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:57,359
a [ __ ] seeds in it sun uh sun dried yep

277
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,480
sun

278
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,879
dried still a little bit more when it

279
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,240
doesn't fall out good then there's still

280
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,240
more to

281
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,919
hit this is

282
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:10,159
unreal but I going to light up the the

283
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,039
next joint otherwise I'm not going to be

284
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,039
able to keep up with you

285
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,958
here I doubt that will ever be a reality

286
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:22,359
Remo no that thing consumes uh faster

287
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,958
than this thing well because you're

288
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,278
consuming much more for sure you you

289
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,319
each joint for you is probably four or

290
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:32,039
five of these I'm putting in like a

291
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,199
peners worth okay so after this youve

292
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:38,559
smoked like two

293

G since we sat down that's insane I'll

294

got like hundreds of of tickets to The

328
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,360
Commodore and she just showed me the

329
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,800
list and i' be like a Lee Scratch Perry

330
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,240
I'll go to that Michael Francy I'll go

331
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,439
to that like it was unbelievable for the

332
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,919
longest time the Commodore and of course

333
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,440
if you know this about the Commodore you

334
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,838
know that showing up really late unless

335
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,399
you've got a group of friends and you

336
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,040
know where they are is a bit of a pain

337
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,759
in the ass at the Commodore you it's one

338
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,838
of those places that you show up early

339
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,440
you roll in with a crew you sit down you

340
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,000
get your table and you claim your space

341
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,839
you claim your space you can move around

342
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,919
at that point but you have your home

343
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,880
base the home base the home base at the

344
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:36,120
commodor man the place gets packed and I

345
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,639
can roll in at 11:30 at night walk up to

346
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,519
that Booth it would be empty right and

347
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,000
just say to the security guard like hey

348
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,240
can you open that it was like a bank

349
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,198
thing you know a little Red Velvet Rope

350
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,440
right right and and we'd go with a pile

351
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:51,000
of people free tickets you know like 50

352
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,240
60 and even sometimes $80 concert

353
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,240
tickets You' give me six of them wow so

354
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,039
yeah that it felt like the Commodore was

355
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,240
my living room for about two 2 and 1/2

356
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:03,958
years it felt like that that it was

357
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,240
amazing yeah man those kushes were nice

358
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:09,278
I got the most beautiful flavor of both

359
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,320
of them right now yeah in the in the um

360
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,519
back of my throat well both those I

361
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,360
consider to be completely top shelf

362
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,278
cannabis and actually this whole plate

363
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,240
those might be my two favorite flavors

364
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,159
on this plate I I would believe that you

365
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,159
know even if I if someone were to ask me

366
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,319
what do you think Remo would like out of

367
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,000
these three I would literally right off

368
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,600
the bat go these three right here you

369
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,958
you pick them those are my three

370
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,959
favorites out of there and know these

371
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,159
are all these are still good don't get

372
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,359
me wrong but this medicates me all of

373
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,198
these have a little bit well I don't

374
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,480
know about this one cuz it's an unknown

375
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,719
to me but these two in general are a

376
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,639
much more euphoric and almost AE high in

377
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,519
the in the sativa sense you've got the

378
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,198
sweet skunk here and you've got the um

379
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,600
c99 the Cinderella 99 which produces

380
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,439
that racy effect of the Astro Boy right

381
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,440
more of a kind of get your mind spinning

382
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,360
than a get your back uh at ease which

383
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,560
these I felt it with both of these well

384
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,079
you know what it's interesting you're

385
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:08,159
talking about these two these two are a

386
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:10,559
lot more Floral in Aroma than these

387
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,838
three here these are very cush likee

388
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,399
they have that very dank cush smell this

389
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,480
is like especially this s Sweet gun it

390
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,958
stinks that is stinky stuff well you

391
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,440
know you just said it right there and

392
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,958
we'll learn in the future and I

393
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,639
guarantee you if it's not this exact

394
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,559
thing it'll be very close to it that

395
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:29,159
that smell that Remo's describing that

396
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:31,000
musky cushy dankness that that we get

397
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,919
that is literally the smell of pain

398
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,159
relief that is whatever tpine profile

399
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,879
that is or cannaboid tpine profile that

400
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:42,078
is the smell of pain relief and it seems

401
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:45,439
as though these more florally more like

402
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:49,439
exotic sativa ones um they have a whole

403
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,319
other uh variety of of benefits that

404
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,120
they offer I love that they get my mind

405
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:56,318
racing they really oh they're yeah they

406
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,839
definitely

407
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:00,838
Speedy oo I love that smell of the Astro

408
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,798
that was growing with an LED light too

409
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,438
oh you were saying that which led light

410
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:10,439
did you use for that well um originally

411
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,919
the LED light was called uh sunlight led

412
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,919
oh I think I have one of those is it a

413
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,120
big crazy thing with thing and then the

414
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:18,759
company changed their name to uh was it

415
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,918
a lawsuit or something I'm not sure if

416
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:22,318
there's a lawsuit but they changed the

417
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,038
name of the company I have to check out

418
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,838
I have the same the veg beautiful oh

419
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,240
yeah the vegging was great and what I

420
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:31,038
tried to do is grow a big plant mhm I

421
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,798
grew a big plant and the guy warned me

422
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,200
don't get this light closer than two

423
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:37,558
feet well because the plant kept growing

424
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,840
I kind of had to push the plant off the

425
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,119
that big black one that goes out like

426
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:42,879
this did it touch the light and get

427
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:44,519
burned no it didn't but it got um I

428
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,400
don't know at the end maybe 8 8 10

429
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,639
inches away and still wasn't burning or

430
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,798
that's what I'm saying cuz that light to

431
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,160
me feels very cool yeah like comparably

432
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:55,079
and you know compared to the other LEDs

433
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,880
in the market uh it it's got a great

434
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,639
color it was white light which is good

435
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,480
but we're doing another test with one

436
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,000
that came from Lush lighting I have that

437
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,200
one as well the XL Dominator yeah and

438
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,798
you know what I um last year I went to

439
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,080
Seattle to the um Seattle Cannabis Cup

440
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,440
and I met this guy from christon farms

441
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:16,839
and he smoked some weed that was grown

442
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,400
with Lush light and it was phenomenal so

443
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,678
you can definitely grow Good Buds with

444
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,000
it I've seen it with my own eyes so um

445
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:23,640
we got one of these lights and we're

446
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,798
putting to the test rate now and we did

447
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,919
a veg with them beautiful vegging and

448
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:29,839
now we're making buds so uh this video

449
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,400
will be coming excellent yeah you can

450
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,678
check out Remo's channel for that one I

451
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,919
would not miss that I've tried to do the

452
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,720
same thing with my um Lush light I

453
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,919
wanted to do Lush on one side HPS on the

454
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,120
other have three plants the same three

455
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,360
plants under each light and then have

456
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:48,239
the same three plants in between both

457
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,959
lights capturing both lights I thought

458
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,400
that would be a really neat way to

459
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,519
capture sort of what the LED light did

460
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,519
what the HPS light did what the

461
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:58,759
combination of them did cuz constantly

462
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:00,079
in all of these uh reviews and comp

463
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:02,400
comparatives there people are always

464
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,918
saying oh I'd rather do this than that

465
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,320
I'm getting to a point in my life where

466
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,240
I prefer to quiver over a single Arrow

467
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,000
you know the best greatest way to do it

468
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,960
the best light bulb the best this the

469
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,558
best that it's like who doesn't want a

470
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,240
quiver a variety of oh I couldn't agree

471
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,960
more yeah you know what the way I look

472
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,759
at it's like being a mechanic and you

473
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,600
have to have all the tools and all the

474
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:27,079
latest stuff a variety of tools is

475
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:30,359
definitely essential you know to to get

476
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:32,519
a beautiful variety such as this yeah

477
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:33,839
which uh which one you want to try next

478
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:36,000
well I guess we'll just go right along

479
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,038
the way to the Girl Scout

480
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,319
cookies okay and then uh I guess we'll

481
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,279
you know what I'm going to hit this one

482
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:45,240
last cuz it's the one I'm most anxious

483
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:47,359
forless it's the stinkiest I know it's

484
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,839
this is a real uh favorite of a lot of

485
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,839
people that I

486
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,200
know that lemony

487
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:01,690
smell thought it was the Congo but uh

488
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,798
I'd say it's sweet skunk yeah was a

489
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,840
[Music]

490
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:08,599
mislabel I wasn't disappointed though

491
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,918
sweet skunk is great weed look at the

492
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:13,759
density of the buds like if you put

493
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,360
those two side by side I'd say the sweet

494
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,879
skunk might even have that bud you

495
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:20,279
definitely not in density though uh

496
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,159
sweet skunk um they were a little bit of

497
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:24,599
an Airy fairy bud but I had um I had

498
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,080
stuff like but as long as my arm of the

499
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,158
sweet skunk was just

500
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,519
crazy yeah it definitely doesn't grow

501
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,360
like this and you seen those G13 buds

502
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:35,000
they at week six y we're getting some uh

503
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,158
what we call them marijuana swords yeah

504
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,319
your swords yeah exactly the swords we

505
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:41,400
do battle with they're definitely club

506
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:44,399
like the Cannabis

507
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,200
swords so that is the Girl Scout cookies

508
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,000
it is excellent and you know what when

509
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,440
you grind it up it's kind of got a an

510
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,079
interesting smell to it it's got a

511
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,440
little bit of sour in there mixed with a

512
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:59,519
bit of sweet yeah kind of reminds me of

513
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,080
uh weed from Europe for some reason

514
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,279
interesting the

515
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:08,759
European well I find lot the European

516
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:13,440
strains has white color has that tone to

517
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:16,158
it no that's like the the lime green

518
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,400
broken up like that oh you get just

519
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,520
giant big Frosty buds out of it I

520
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,159
couldn't believe like the size of buds

521
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,240
you get kind of reminds me of that

522
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,760
Jamaican string that was around uh a

523
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,960
number years Sugar Shack the the

524
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:33,319
Jamaican Jamaican spice

525
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,640
bear how many names did it have tons but

526
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:37,798
you know what tons I call it Fool's go

527
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,159
cuz it used to grow these giant buds but

528
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,759
you know you get immune to this weed

529
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,080
almost right away it was like had lots

530
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:45,038
of triom on it but it just was not

531
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,278
strong weed I feel that as well but you

532
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,480
can grow buds the size of your head but

533
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:51,839
man that's why I prefer this the cush

534
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,278
cush doesn't make big butts but it kicks

535
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,000
your ass and you know I need to get

536
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,480
medicated I'm not really interested in

537
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,720
what produces the most I'm what I'm

538
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,839
interested in what works the best for

539
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,759
myself anyway yeah well that's the key

540
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,240
difference for yourself cuz like a lot

541
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:09,079
of people that are just trying to grow

542
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,519
big buds if they don't have that head

543
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:14,678
space of like requiring real strength to

544
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:16,918
ease their pain or for that whatever it

545
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,038
is for them that they get out of using

546
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,840
cannabis whether it's a recreational or

547
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,798
a preventative or a

548
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,720
medicinal

549
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,960
um if you're not getting the potency

550
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,360
like this generally most people that

551
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,640
look to find these big giant plants that

552
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:35,959
you can grow throughout my history

553
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,038
anyway tons of them are just not potent

554
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,880
you sort of break the mold on that

555
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:43,400
because you're not just looking to grow

556
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,720
big buds to ship them off into the

557
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,038
marketplace oh you're growing exactly

558
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,759
you're growing for yourself and it's not

559
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:51,679
like you're just like you don't you

560
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:55,599
don't want just like a nice recreational

561
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:58,159
buzz you require a heavy narcotic pain

562
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,439
relief yeah and that's what those kushes

563
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,440
really

564
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,320
offer girl go cookies but you know what

565
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,440
it is

566
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,599
impressive that's

567
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,960
interesting definitely not as strong as

568
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:17,519
I would say um the headband or the

569
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,319
kosher kush or even that OG Kush but I'd

570
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:23,599
say it's uh you know if I had to give it

571
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:26,480
a a mark about maybe a 68 maybe not

572
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:30,439
quite a seven you know these are nines

573
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,440
and 10 I'd say right

574
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:35,440
well it's got a nice uh hit to the vapor

575
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,079
a good amount came out right away too

576
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,240
which always tells me a little bit about

577
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,199
the resin that's on the

578
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,120
plant you know what it' be interesting

579
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,640
is actually to test all these strains

580
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,199
and uh see how much THC they actually

581
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,799
have and what the canid profile is is

582
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:54,319
like how much CBDs cbn's Etc well you

583
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:56,000
know what I bet you the two of us

584
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,278
between testing the resin and you

585
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,240
testing the plant matter and resin that

586
00:23:58,278 --> 00:24:02,839
we we could pretty much nail it down

587
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,159
pretty pretty well at least where the

588
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:07,199
strongest lay and where the the sort of

589
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,840
weakest lay and where the smelliest and

590
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,960
the you know there simple things that we

591
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:13,079
can do through the through our

592
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,759
bioassay well these two right here these

593
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,319
are the strongest actually these three

594
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,640
that's your

595
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:20,639
Powerhouse they

596
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,679
Ripper that's nice it's enjoyable

597
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,558
it's different weed you know what it's

598
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:35,720
it's very full smoke when you you know

599
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:38,000
have it combusted like this it's um it's

600
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,839
got a complete flavor to it

601
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,640
mhm yeah I've smelled quite a few whiffs

602
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,879
from from your smoke as opposed to the

603
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,919
taste of the vapor and it's an

604
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:49,840
interesting way to uh to add to the

605
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,919
palette it tastes better than it smells

606
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,959
you know what I mean I'm not saying that

607
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:54,960
in a bad way I know what you mean

608
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,679
totally I've had strains that smell

609
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,399
better than they taste

610
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,640
yeah in the air you know had this

611
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:07,038
amazing crazy beautiful like exotic

612
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,120
spicy flavor and it's like I can't taste

613
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:12,038
that flavor I want to taste that flavor

614
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,038
not just smell it in the

615
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,240
air and and this stuff here actually

616
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:19,038
Burns pry nice so I was going to say the

617
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,720
flame or not the flame the color of the

618
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:24,720
smoke with the light behind you is three

619
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,919
dark yeah it's dark but it's it's got

620
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,200
that blue which I always sort of look

621
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:32,110
for in a a cannabis smoke you know as

622
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,309
opposed to that grayish

623
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:35,309
[Music]

624
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,440
smoke well I hope you guys are puffing

625
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,440
tough with us right now it's not that

626
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,240
often that I get to come over to Remos

627
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,080
and literally just have a puff tough

628
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,880
video no so while he's smoking that

629
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,599
joint I'm going to clear my palette with

630
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,399
a little bit of the full melt dry sift

631
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,119
that we made earlier I hope you guys

632
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:56,439
went over to his channel to check that

633
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:59,239
out cuz uh that stuff's insane worth oh

634
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,720
that [ __ ] blows my mind

635
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,480
yeah it's great well that's the [ __ ]

636
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,720
that is that you're that you're that

637
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,798
you're literally using right now you

638
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,759
know

639
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:10,798
that's what what better easier way for

640
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,240
you to acquire your medicine than

641
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,798
spliffs that are easy to take with you

642
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,599
they're not connected to anything you

643
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:19,519
can walk around and have them anywhere

644
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:21,079
you go very easy to use exactly I'll

645
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,278
tell you you don't see me with my denail

646
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,398
up on the chair lift up in Whistler you

647
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,240
know what soon there will be a way I

648
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:29,398
hope

649
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,240
yeah just give some Stoner a little bit

650
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:33,959

these little cell phones that are this

658
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,479
big that are computers like get GPS that

659
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,919
weigh like 6 o

660
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:58,240

things

664
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,480
mhm it's always a good

665
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,038
thing almost had a bit of a fruity

666
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,360
flavor in there too you should hit that

667
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:11,319
stuff again because it don't give me a

668
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,918
chance to catch up on this joint yeah

669
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:16,599
you're smoking uh big joints now Remo

670

I'm taking little Vapor hits um you know

671
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:21,038

it's going to be even more than just a

694

nutrient company no we we actually uh

695
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:10,558
we're going to expand hopefully into

696
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,960
medibles and uh maybe even paraphernalia

697
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,038

00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:40,519
Ridge to work at or waros that's awesome

709
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:42,439
dude I'm dreaming big but uh well you

710
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,679
got to think big right dude absolutely

711
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,519
no reason not to uh no reason to dream

712
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:50,080
small I think it was Dane Cook who said

713
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:53,640
dream it you [ __ ] dreamer it's your

714
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:55,278
dream yeah this classic Dane Cook comedy

715
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,559
that's awesome that's not comedy that's

716
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:59,798
reality it is but the way he says it in

717
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:01,759
the in the comedy skd he's like if I'm

718
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:03,079
Dreaming I'm going to create a house and

719
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,679
it's going to have Moes and it's going

720
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:07,000
to have like lakes that go through like

721
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,640
he's just going off on it basically and

722
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,240
why not right well that's what that's

723
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,399
basically the metaphor is if you're

724
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,000
going to dream something up for

725
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:19,000
yourself then uh why not dream it as big

726
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,759
and as as good as you possibly can

727
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,640
especially double especially when it's

728
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,919
something like what you just said to

729
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,559
hire a 100 people that's not for

730
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:32,159
yourself all right so let's see we've

731
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:34,639
hit the headband cush y the kosher cush

732
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,320
y the Girl Scout cookies mhm and now

733
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,000
let's go back into some

734
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:43,359
potency for the OG cush I just want to

735
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,440
point this up I put this down yeah went

736
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:49,759
and talk on the phone came back and look

737
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,360
it's still yeah burning beautifully

738
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:52,519
that's I didn't have to relight it oh

739
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,558
that's definitely

740
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:57,159
impressive uh when you have Camy

741
00:29:54,558 --> 00:30:00,278
schwaggy food in your herb that

742
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:01,480
definitely right there does not happen

743
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:02,759
that's when you're doing this all the

744
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,880
time every puff you're taking you're

745
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,960
lighting your your joint that's uh that

746
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,080
takes me back to high school so that's

747
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,480
the feel how hard that is dude I already

748
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,119
squeezed the tip of this nugget it's

749
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,519
ridiculous like you could smash a window

750
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,199
with that you could smash this with a

751
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:17,919
hammer and it wouldn't flatten the bud

752
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,080
and you know what that that was never um

753
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,960
that was hung dry too so usually when

754
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,879
you hang dry a plant it dries a little

755
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,720
bit looser but I don't know it just

756
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,519
produces such rock hard indicia buds

757
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,360
it's classic that's why I think G cush

758
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,240
it just like one of those old school

759
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:34,798
favorites old Gardener I tell you yep

760
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,359
the old

761
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,440
Gardener nice I'm always excited to hit

762
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:40,519

763

OG and then we're going to get into the

of that Vape it up I better take some of

777
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,359
that these ogs man I'll tell you they

778
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,519
really were game changers you know first

779
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:23,240
it was the

780
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,798
Diesels I remember when s came up that

781
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,960
New York City Diesel and it was just

782
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:30,720
like what oh I grew that that made

783
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,000
beautiful big buds oh yeah it can grow

784
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,480
short plants with super giant colas on

785
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,720
it yep it was a good one for sure it was

786
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,519
I guess there's been so many game

787
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:44,120
changers over the years

788
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,480
yeah I mean really the original game

789
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:49,359
changer would probably be uh skunkman

790
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,038
Sam's skunk number one you know what

791
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,599
skunk number one is the reason I started

792
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:55,798
growing cannabis

793
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,638
indoors I remember that basically

794
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:59,839
changed everything here on the West

795
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:01,158
Coast not just on the west coast changed

796
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:03,319
everything in Amsterdam I think it's

797
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:05,639
really responsible for a lot that

798
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:07,240
happened in Amsterdam and why I don't

799
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:10,240
think it's a coincidence that the fact

800
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,159
that he was there with his strain that

801
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,440
that Amsterdam blew up in the coffee

802
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,760
shop so much of the coffee shops in the

803
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,038
late 80s and the early 9s were that

804
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:23,000
skunk number one yeah it was very very

805
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:24,558
very pronounced strain in every and and

806
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,720
if it wasn't and they were calling it

807
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,158
something else yeah it would you'd smell

808
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,079
it and be like oh there's some something

809
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,840
in there yeah well you know what I

810
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:35,199
remember our choices back then you can

811
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:37,240
go get some uh Brown Mexican weed that

812
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,759
they called Cambodian or Tai weed but

813
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,480
you know you knew was Mexican it was

814
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:42,200
full of seeds you talking late ' 80s

815
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,240
early '90s we're talking mid 80s right

816
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,840
mid 80s okay and then they had the stuff

817
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,599
they called BC red hair which was a

818
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,759
bunch of outdoor [ __ ] and they just

819
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,558
didn't have any names for it so they

820
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:55,679
called it red hairs cuz they had lots of

821
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:58,678
um stigma hairs yeah exactly and

822
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,240
uh then came the skunky the skunk weed

823
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,360
they I remember it came around and

824
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,679
they're charging $40 e and it was wet

825
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:07,398
sticky weed but it smelled like a skunk

826
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,880
and you'd smoke it and get you way

827
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:11,158
higher than any of that stuff put

828
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,399
together and uh well you know I couldn't

829
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:15,720
really justify paying $40 for an a like

830
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:17,199
you know that's kind of what made me

831
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,639
consider growing yeah that was the

832
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,759
roadkill skunk now the roadkill skunk is

833
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:25,240
different from skunk number one and I'm

834
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:27,038
not exactly sure maybe one day I'll I'll

835
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,919
do a show on it or something because I

836
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:33,599
also remember the the road kill SC I got

837
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,038

861
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,639
get a nice head space on them and

862
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,079
experience the profiles wirelessly

863
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:47,919
without like I don't know I'm really

864
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,519
just stoked on technology I'm stoked on

865
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,440
all these companies right now that are

866
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:55,918
producing all these great little units

867
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,960
yeah I've uh I got a touch with volcano

868
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,400
recently and they've got new little

869
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,199
Wireless um units oh no way so I have

870
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,039
one of those coming I think it's called

871
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:05,319
The

872
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:07,679
Mighty and uh I'll I'll be doing a

873
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,280
review on that soon to see uh I mean

874
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:12,279
basically what I'm looking for in a unit

875
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,000
is obviously many many pulls an easy

876
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,040
charge that it's you know easy to to

877
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,880
handle and hold and doesn't break easy

878
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:22,838
but also that there's no plastic or

879
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,680
rubber or any type of that taste in the

880
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:28,719
herb cuz to me that's like a game Ender

881
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,440
I just can't do that if it's got a weird

882
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,159
taste where it's like oh they used a

883
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,000
strange component or the rubber wasn't

884
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,399
the highest end rubber I'm done even

885
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,800
containers I don't like you know the

886
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,280
little rubber containers that uh a lot

887
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,920
of people were using for a while they're

888
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,440
going to affect the taste and smell yuck

889
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,880
they gasing some sort of weird toxin

890
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,318
into your body as well well that's what

891
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,800
I'm saying cuz that nice tasty herb you

892
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:54,119
know what I like how portable this unit

893
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,880
is and I like how portable you know

894
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,240
they're letting medicating becomes cuz

895
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,079
you can be on the go we could be out

896
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,919
dirt biking and doing this right now

897
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:03,760
100% ring this would be a situation

898
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,200
where I could see this working for Remo

899
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,520
in a situation where you know he's at a

900
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:09,759
concert or something he's smoking a

901
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,039
joint and for whatever reason the guy

902
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,319
the the security guard says hey you

903
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,318
can't do that or whatever and he's like

904
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:16,279
oh that's weird and so he just puts the

905
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:17,800
joint down and pulls this out of his

906
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,800
pocket it's just like I'll just oh I

907
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,839
don't want to do that I want to keep

908
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,960
blazing my joint of course you do but it

909
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:26,000
would be a nice backup wouldn't it I

910
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,079
guess for backup yeah in an Investor's

911
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,559
meeting maybe that would be the

912
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:33,240
application yeah they're not down with

913
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:34,799
you whipping out big bags of weed and

914
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:37,479
rolling up joints in the middle of those

915
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,720
meetings been a few they should be

916
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,280
because that's really what it's all

917
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:44,519
about well you know I've been to Bay

918
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,160
Street now and uh well the whole they're

919
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,880
very excited about the whole weed

920
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:51,759
industry and what we're doing like all

921
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,400
of it like you know what and I think

922
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,599
having Bay Street and legitimate

923
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,800
investors get involved in cannabis will

924
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,039
help legalize and legit make it

925
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,920
legitimate for for all of us well I'll

926
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:03,880
tell you something if one of the things

927
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,400
when your company really has this

928
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,559
exponential growth that I'm sure it's

929
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,240
going to have and you guys have your lab

930
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,759
and your scientists working for

931
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:13,078
different you know to tweak the

932
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,560
nutrients in different ways I hope that

933
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:18,119
one of the things that you guys do is

934
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:21,599
figuring out a way to I don't want to

935
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:24,920
say manipulate but say increase or make

936
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:29,599
more available whatever it is that the

937
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,639
plant requires to produce um the vacs

938
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,559
and the plastids that are produced

939
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:36,480
inside the triome head that produce the

940
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:39,119
phenols and the tpin that produce all

941
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,480
the cannabinoids that we use now if we

942
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,760
could figure out a way to tune nutrients

943
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,079
to resin growth and phenol and turpine

944
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,119
production inside the gland head before

945
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,599
canabo are even cooked into existence I

946
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,920
think the advantage there will be

947
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,838
enormous tremendous and I really see

948
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,800
that I I I I get excited about it

949
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:02,679
thinking that you know someone like you

950
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,359
be done it's just we have to you know do

951
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:06,039
research SP a lot of learning right

952
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:07,759
exactly it's just a matter of learning

953
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:10,079
but I think so as well I don't think

954
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,720
that focusing on the vegetative

955
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,280
structure of the plant is going to

956
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:18,199
produce the best medicine in the end I

957
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:22,319
think we'll have to focus our our focus

958
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:24,159
on or change our Focus onto the resin

959
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:27,519
the resin well you know what that's what

960
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:29,480
I'm focused on is uh resin and

961
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:30,960
definitely uh lots of tricomes on the

962
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,599
planet this is important to me well

963
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,920
that's CU you're an end user and that's

964
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:37,280
the best thing that that's the thing

965
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:40,039
that no matter what like companies like

966
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,960
yours and mine and many other it's like

967
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:45,000
I always sort of saw that respect in a

968
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,519
guy like uh breeder Steve who he was a

969
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,800
real smoker he he knew what potency was

970
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:54,358
he was he loved all the extracts and the

971
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,960
hashes joints and Bong rips and you know

972
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:58,199
what I mean like the guy covered the

973
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,639

1103
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,679
nice taste so here we go Astro Boy here

1104
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,079
we go totally different high it's up

1105
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:36,078
here in the

1106
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:42,039
head it's the first one that I felt

1107
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:42,039
really strong in my

1108
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,679
head you know what this is really smooth

1109
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:50,000
too it's almost got a you know when you

1110
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:50,879
inhale first it's almost a cherry flavor

1111
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,838
I was going to say that could be your

1112
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,280
dessert joint yeah you know when you're

1113
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:57,119
sitting down for your three course meal

1114
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:59,040
you might have a a serving of a head

1115
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,240
band and a serving of OG with a side

1116
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,199
order of kosher kush but then for

1117
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:05,439
dessert you're going to order up that

1118
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:08,719
that Astro Boy and I think it really is

1119
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,599
that c99 cuz here the the Apollo 13 and

1120
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:14,159
the Ortega are both very like strong

1121
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:18,640
very much like these three right but the

1122
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:21,960
c99 is that sativa dominant racy kind of

1123
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:24,838
fruity flavor that you get really nice

1124
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,000
so what would be the salad course though

1125
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:29,239
well the salad course of course the

1126
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,318
sweet skunk the sweet skunk the sweet

1127
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:33,358
skunk is

1128
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,519
so light and enjoyable that people that

1129
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:37,440
don't even smoke pot can enjoy the sweet

1130
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:40,159
skunk it's almost like if you dislike

1131
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,200
fish but someone says oh here try this

1132
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:45,358

1133
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,799
oh yeah make even people that don't like

1134
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:48,000
salmon yeah they'll eat that stuff

1135
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,640
they'll eat that stuff and be like this

1136
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,679
isn't fish it's like no it is trust me

1137
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,118
so I think of the sweet skunk as that

1138
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:57,879
very one it's the uh it's the Indian

1139
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,240
candy of uh of cannabis it's even if you

1140
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,960
don't enjoy pot I've never seen it

1141
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,959
produce an anxiet as high in anyone you

1142
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,358
know women like the stream women love

1143
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,119
this string my wife who barely ever well

1144
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:13,639
she doesn't smoke at all anymore but she

1145
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:15,559
barely um uses cannabis um she does use

1146
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:17,558
essential amino acids and she produces

1147
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:19,839
her own endocannabinoids but she doesn't

1148
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:21,680
use cannabis in a smoking or

1149
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,519
recreational manner very often but when

1150
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:26,199
she wants to relax that skunk this is

1151
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:27,239
the sweet skunk that she I'm I'm

1152
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:29,159
actually going to I was I was going to

1153
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:31,159
say if I could grab one little bud not a

1154
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:32,838
big bud like this but a little bud for

1155
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:34,639
the wife oh yeah for sure you'll

1156
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:35,960
appreciate that remember when Steve

1157
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:38,279
cubby was around this was one of his

1158
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,519
favorites too back back in the day yep

1159
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,519
and I understand that because if he was

1160
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:45,239
able to smoke it Steve smoked an an

1161
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:46,880
unruly amount of cannabis just an

1162
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:48,919
impressive amount much like yourself I

1163
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,079
don't know what it was but it was at

1164
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,519
least an ounce a day and I remember at

1165
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:55,559
one point it was ridiculous big long

1166
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,639
joints even like 2 plus ounces a day and

1167
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:59,400
I was kind of like man that's like

1168
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:01,000
that's that's too much smoke and then he

1169
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,880
went and got his lungs tested at this

1170
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,400
big facility down in California yeah and

1171
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,519
they they said his lungs were that of

1172
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,200
like a young um athlete mhm so and this

1173
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:14,920
was when he was 48 years old so I was

1174
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:17,480
pretty impressed that uh sort of proof

1175
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,480
is in the pudding that like even in my

1176
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,400
own mind thinking that that much smoke

1177
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,599
couldn't be bad it still wasn't bad for

1178
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,920
Steve cubby keep in mind Steve cubby has

1179
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:29,559
a very rare form of adrenal gland cancer

1180
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,200
he has tumors that are growing on his

1181
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:33,319
adrenaline gland and they pump

1182
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:36,039
adrenaline into his bloodstream uh

1183
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:38,599
constantly 24/7 and many people that

1184
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:41,318
have this disease like a huge percentage

1185
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:43,480
most they pass away at an early age from

1186
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:45,599
either a heart attack or a stroke

1187
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,838
because imagine having that that acid

1188
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:51,960
running through your veins it would just

1189
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:54,078
it would just erode your or um your um

1190
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,760
what's the word I'm looking for arteries

1191
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,160
it would erode your arteries and so

1192
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,920
that's what ends up happening strokes

1193
00:47:57,159 --> 00:48:01,799
and heart attacks but Steve is one of

1194
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,318
the oldest surviving victims of that

1195
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,000
disease I think he's even on some

1196
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:07,558
medical books did you ever get the

1197
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,639
chance to go skiing with him I never did

1198
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:12,200
no way I wish I did yeah I know I went

1199
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:14,279
skiing with him a few times he was crazy

1200
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:16,719
very fast had these really super long

1201
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,240
skis and he started a ski magazine in

1202
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:22,879
the US and maybe West yeah in the 80s or

1203
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:26,078
something so I don't doubt that Steve um

1204
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,920
was a is a great skier actually Steve um

1205
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,160
got me into skiing again um I I didn't

1206
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,480
ski for a decade cuz after my accident I

1207
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,118
figured I was done and he was like oh no

1208
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,679
there's people out there with no legs

1209
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,480

lemonade on that tiny and I would say

1273
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,440
that I've I've learned recently that

1274
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:18,879
there's a fair amount of tpin that have

1275
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,519
that orangey sort of smell yeah uh

1276
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,440
lemony even

1277
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:25,119
citrusy there's mercine and there's

1278
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,240
mercine not as much it's the one that's

1279
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:30,880
in mangoes um there's Valencia or

1280
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:33,479
valencene Sor which is found in

1281
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:38,039
valencene oranges right and then of

1282
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:39,519
course delemon which is uh very not I

1283
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:42,480
wouldn't say popular but the one that

1284
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:44,480
you find a larger amount of often most

1285
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,199
common yeah definitely the most common

1286
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:50,480
one in uh in standard

1287
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:53,759
oranges I think that's what um Horatio

1288
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:56,880
is using in his in his extract in his

1289
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,480
extract he extracts lemoning delemon

1290
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,720
from Orange Rines and separates it out

1291
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:05,280
and then uses that tpine as a solvent to

1292
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:07,199
strip resin off of cannabis plants

1293
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,119
brilliant yeah it's I think I tried some

1294
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:11,399
of that I think I had some of that I

1295
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:13,079
think I had some of that yesterday in

1296
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,079
back no I wouldn't be surprised at all

1297
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,760
he makes uh he's M makes his way around

1298
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:19,280
he's also doing dry sifting now he's

1299
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:22,240
learned uh a couple of Tricks oh John B

1300
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,480
came over oh right there it is Johnny B

1301
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,959
that would be it yep he's always got

1302
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,480
some of her ratios he was the first

1303
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,720
person to in introduced me to her ratio

1304
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,719
in

1305
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:37,559
fact makes a really good extract that

1306
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:39,239
guy yeah shelf all good gu really uh

1307
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:40,680
conscious of what he's doing and aware

1308
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,798
and wants to make sure things are done

1309
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:46,639
to the utmost of safety so his lemine

1310
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:49,719
extract was really a reply to the butane

1311
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:52,239
culture that was the BHO uh guys that

1312
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:54,439
were all making a lot of butane oil he

1313
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:56,879
felt that it was fairly dangerous on a

1314
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,798
multitude of levels both for the contam

1315
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,680
that were potentially oil soluble being

1316
00:52:58,798 --> 00:53:03,358
trapped in the resin from the solvents

1317
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:06,159
and then put into the body but then of

1318
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:09,078
course the more simpler completely

1319
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:11,039
unarguable um explosions like it was

1320
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:13,160
just like kids blowing themselves up

1321
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:15,239
been some fires yeah you know burn

1322
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:16,879
themselves up terrible stuff so uh this

1323
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:18,598
was his sort of reply maybe I can

1324
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,680
produce something that still allows them

1325
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:22,920
to dab that's still in oil that's still

1326
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:25,798
potent but just doesn't use this sort of

1327
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,000
hydrocarbon to do the extraction mhm so

1328
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:30,400
I thought it was really

1329
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,400
cool uh of him to come up with that and

1330
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,760
do that I don't think he was the

1331
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,039
originator by any means but he

1332
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,359
definitely was one of the uh one of the

1333
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:39,239
first people here in British Columbia

1334
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:41,119
doing it on a conscious level right on

1335
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:43,959
I'm sure you'll Inspire others to do the

1336
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,480
same mhm oh you got to learn that's the

1337
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,240
thing it's not like a BHO thing where

1338
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,159
you just like go online and are like oh

1339
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:51,078
I can do this now like what he's doing

1340
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:53,558
with d lemoning is serious chemistry

1341
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:55,480
that you would really require even just

1342
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:57,839
having a conversation with him about it

1343
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:00,240
if you don't understand in chemistry is

1344
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:02,880
can be somewhat over over your

1345
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:06,279
head I have found anyway cuz I'm no

1346
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,280
chemist myself

1347
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:18,480
yeah sweet skunk ripping I've almost got

1348

with you it's been Ripper man absolutely

1352
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:29,079

1353
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:30,239
joint to go foro as he sits here and I

1354
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:33,680
don't know

1355
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:36,118
smokes six joints six joints yeah six

1356
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:39,199
six big joints too like I'm sure that's

1357
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:42,599
a 2 G joint or a 1 and2 G joint yeah

1358
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:42,598
there's some cannabis in there for

1359

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,719
the song is smoke two joints not one

your song it might be like smoke six no

1365

1394
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:31,000
going into the fruity AST boy and then

1395
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:35,038
the really light exotic sort of lemony

1396
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,039

1398
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:43,558
session you know next time allow

1399
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,159
somebody to help smoke these joints dude

1400
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:46,519
I think it was awesome I think I have a

1401
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:49,078
feeling that people will be very

1402
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:52,280
inspired to sit down and and watch you

1403
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:54,920
smoke uh six joints like it was nothing

1404
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:56,440
U my most popular video is and and this

1405
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,920
is once again you like oh just my

1406
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,318
supercharged joints people love that so

1407
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,358
one day I did the pure hash joint video

1408
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:04,798
yeah I've seen that one video has almost

1409
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:07,519
half a million views on it wow yeah just

1410
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:10,358
from smoking one gram of hash but you

1411
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:13,358
just smoked like maybe about the same

1412
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:16,880
amount 1 to 1 and a 12 grams of hash in

1413
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:19,880
like six fat joints that's probably

1414
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,680
probably you know 8 to 12 gram of herb

1415
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:25,240
you just consumed and on that 8 to 12 G

1416
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:27,038
of herb there's probably like 1 to 2 G

1417
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:29,038
of

1418
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,640
speaking of Ash can we finish this thing

1419
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:32,520
off maybe with one of those dabs with

1420
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:33,920
that really crazy [ __ ] right there I

1421
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:36,079
don't know if the camera can you see

1422
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,200
that oh yeah I've got pictures of that

1423
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:42,079
as well I'll show that to them and we

1424
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:44,439
will get a nice dab prepped for Remo yay
