1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:08,040
so this is um a fairly epic um piece by

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,519
Ghost and this particular piece has been

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,279
Electra formed it's got just I mean let

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,879
me get it off the stand it's it's not

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:17,679
your average piece just to pull off the

6
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:19,439
stand is uh is a bit of an experience

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,000
especially with the Bowl here probably

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,879
best to remove that first now you pull

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,679
it right out drop that bowl back in

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,160
which I have a Slinger Bowl in there

11
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:31,278
right now pull this off to the side and

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,960
I can kind of give you guys a little bit

13
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,719
of a show you can see it's got this

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,920
incredible brain marble up here it's got

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,120
uh just immaculate detail in the face uh

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,879
these are actual metal components that

17
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,718
have been uh electroformed right onto

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,280
the piece the base is completely metal

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,198
not glass at all and uh it's actually

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,439
quite a sturdy Place uh piece you just

21
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,960
wouldn't want to grab it around these

22
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,640
canes this would be a very delicate

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,920
place on the pipe and otherwise just

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,920

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,359
