20-year-old seeds that I cracked and I

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,520
I'll give you a little breakdown how I

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,600
did it I looked online I got all nervous

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,559
I thought I better do you know I called

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,879
uh the great Gardener I I asked

9
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:41,238
different friends I found a really good

10
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,920
seed germinating page and I haven't been

11
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:44,479
able to refind it I've been trying to

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,000
find it so I can link it to one of the

13
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,038
guys who asked about the other video

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,719
anyway I just went my old school method

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,520
that I knew was tried and true a couple

16
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,800
of plates um paper

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,879
towel Mo moistened the paper towel and

18
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:03,518
um basically covered it up I put this um

19
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,518
just like this under my office table and

20
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:07,158
I turned on my radiant heat floors just

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,040
to about

22
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,320
75° and so underneath the plate is a

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,080
nice kind of warm temperature um I the

24
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,478
paper towel has not moistened out and

25
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:19,280
the the water isn't like super cold to

26
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:23,078
touch it's about you know a a little

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,879
warmer than room temperature 75° or so

28
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:27,118
and this morning I opened it up and had

29
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,560
a seed crack so I'm going to show you a

30
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,519
couple of macro pictures of that look

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,560
how beautiful that is with the the old

32
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:37,719
outer shell cracking open and this just

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,680
perfectly beautiful New Life coming out

34
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:42,560
of that seed I'm very excited about that

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,360
so what I've done is um I've already

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,240
taken it it was literally just cracked

37
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,759
with a tiny little bit pointing out

38
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,478
which you could see and I I dug the

39
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,680
little hole with a pen I just pushed the

40
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,599
pen in a tiny little bit maybe about uh

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,759
jeez you know not a qu of an inch or

42
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:02,519
something and then I dropped it in tip

43
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:05,239
up so so um we'll see what happens it's

44
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:07,199
now in the the cocoa and the Pete Moss

45
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:10,758
and the the

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,719
promix sitting in the pot I've moistened

47
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:16,318
the pot and uh yeah I guess we'll wait

48
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,719
and see what happens we've got about

49
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:22,679
nine more seeds that are in here right

50
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:25,680
now not to expose them too too much but

51
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,640
uh none of these seem to have the crack

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,319
happening on them yet I try not to touch

53
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:31,559
them with my fingers

54
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,318
