1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:19,549
[Music]

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,880
said 23 million they said you did 23

3
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,240
million I said yeah can I have a real

4
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:31,640
piece of paper finally so I'm not a

5
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,558
criminal so things can't get done and it

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,600
and and I think you need to stand and

7
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:39,599
push forward and take

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,239
something thank you next speaker yeah I

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,160
just want to um maybe put a little shed

10
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,878
a little light on hanana that just was

11
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,799
up speaking I think there was a little

12
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:50,599
Mis understanding so let's let's go back

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,159
and understand a little bit of what he

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,558
was explaining to you um Mr dir what he

15
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,439
was trying to explain and I think he was

16
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,000
coming a little too hard at you if you

17
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,039
will but what he was trying to explain

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,159
to you is that in in the United States

19
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,439
in 2008 there was a court case it was

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,200
called The Kelly decision and that

21
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:11,158
decision was in California what that

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,200
helped us out as far as patients in

23
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,240
California was to identify I.E with the

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,400
doctor and the doctor would be like a

25
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:22,000
William Courtney which he does

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,200
juicy and the example would be that as

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,759
hosana was presenting to you that the 3

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,079
lb is really only minimal of what a

29
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,959
person would actually need so and that

30
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:32,199
is the fact that that is the truth and

31
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,919
if you did a little research you would

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,920
see that that is really what is needed

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,320
now it's not everyone that will be juicy

34
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,200
but if you set the limits at 5 and that

35
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,279
the example will be this if I went to

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,478
the doctor and I had a pain and then he

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,239
gave me oxycoton we started at 100 mg

38
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:51,640
for that and of course everyone in this

39
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:54,679
room would understand that oxycotton are

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,840
heroin so of course you will getting

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,640
addicted and then your addiction will go

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,719
up what a coincidence and when it goes

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,239
up you will take more Hairway and by the

44
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:08,639
time you're done you're a junkie so what

45
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,560
I really would like to help and really

46
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,318
applo to you if you're the one that's

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,239
making these decisions or someone that's

48
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:18,159
going to go in and at least work for the

49
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,920
people is that the five plan is for the

50
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,359
dumb people uh we really need to

51
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,598
understand that the plan itself

52
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,280
depending on who or what is going on

53
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:32,000
it's your situation it is again the

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,959
doctor and the patient that decide on

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,680
what they need to take not the country

56
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,920
not the laws and not the police so it's

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,760
you the people that need to stand up and

58
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:46,158
take charge of your your land and your

59
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,199
rights because at the end of the day

60
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:50,280
it's your right to be able to medicate

61
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:53,439
and I don't care what country you're in

62
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,158
it's your right if you're sick and I'll

63
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,680
end it with you had a young lady

64
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:58,878
yesterday that I know our company

65
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,800
Timeless was going to go out and see and

66
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:04,158
just get give our our two cents if you

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,640
will and and to understand her pain and

68
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,959
her what she was going through and for

69
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,958
all you that don't know she was in uh

70
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,878
one of your m one of your newspapers and

71
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,759
unfortunately while uh we were planning

72
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:19,639
to go out she passed away yesterday so

73
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:22,359
again it's the laws that are prohibiting

74
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:24,318
the health and the movement while we sit

75
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,640
around and we have all these people

76
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,199
talking you guys have to understand

77
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,598
Antony you made the point we are and it

78
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,919
will be legal I have friends that are in

79
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:38,679
the White House and it will be a

80
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:41,039
schedule to by 2016 I guarantee you that

81
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,680
and if you don't step up now and get in

82
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,239
the game you're not you are going to the

83
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,719
money that you think you're going to

84
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,280
make or that you want to make the United

85
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:54,239
States will just take that right away

86
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,079
because you people and and I employ you

87
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,400
that's gentleman over here that says to

88
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,719
walk out and stand with you it's time to

89
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,319
walk out and stand you need to get up

90
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,039
and get busy and that's what I want to

91
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,318
see from the people that are here that's

92
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,199
the excitement of the Jamaican people

93
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:13,598
and if you don't understand you need to

94
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,879
understand that you have a chance to

95
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:19,759
change the way the world looks at ganja

96
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,839
you do but it's a matter of when and

97
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,600
will how the government can actually

98
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:26,399
change this and again we can keep

99
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,000
talking and we could keep going back and

100
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,000
forth but that's not going to solve the

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,240
problems that you guys have right now

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,120
and it's really catching right now if

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,160
you don't move this Peg fast and really

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,079
fast you're going to see the united

105
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,199
states legalize and they're going to

106
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,959
capture the movement it it it will just

107
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,600
be done it will be over so thank you

108
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:53,279
again for letting me speak and thank you

109
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,000
what passion what enthusiasm we have let

110
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,799
me see there only three persons in the

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,319
line we I suggest it's the last three

112
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,120
and can we limit a 2 minute

113
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,439
hi

114
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:10,439
Paul Paul this is for you um I know we a

115
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:14,439
forum that Jus serve to flesh out ideas

116
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:17,719
as you go along but your idea of small

117
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,360
soal small farmers making up the bulk

118
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,720
for for the three years where the thing

119
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,800
is legalized I'd love to ask you if

120
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,319
there is a demand for the product in in

121
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,918
3 years even before 3 years what is

122
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,680
wrong with the big and small producing

123
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,879
is it is this principle any different

124
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,800
from how the sugar operate sugar

125
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,478
industry operated in the past where by

126
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,520
was there any discrimination between the

127
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:45,560
small man came going to dayon line money

128
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:47,719
and big properties came going on was

129
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,038
there difference in the price structure

130
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,680
I understand maybe I have not because I

131
00:05:52,038 --> 00:06:00,360
was guarded for

132
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:04,038
time I have tried to be very

133
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,319
conside what I'm trying to say that's a

134
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:07,318
when you

135
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:11,240
start you're going to be a certain

136
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:14,759
amount of demand for a product I'm

137
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,000
hoping that re insist that most our

138
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:21,400
products must be most of our raw

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,918
material must be converted into products

140
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,758
in

141
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:30,038
Jamaica if there's a need for you allow

142
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,120
all Farmers to go up

143
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:34,800
at the smaller level first before you go

144
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,879
into the big Fs in other

145
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,680
words if somebody has 5

146
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:43,759
AC and you have thousands of farmers

147
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,439
with 5 Acres thousands of farmers with

148
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,879
three acres you go up and allow as many

149
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,759
of the small farmers to get involved

150
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,800
then you need more you say okay we had

151
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,400
start limited to one AC in the first

152
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,759
year that us go up to 2 Acres then you

153
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,239
go up to 3 acres but you do that only

154
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,680
for a certain amount of whether it is

155
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:08,120
three or five years it is when when you

156
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,680
study the industry when you study the

157
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,519
demand then you talk to the

158
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,918
stakeholders and if they agree look here

159
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:19,560
we need to increase the m and it will

160
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:22,878
protect the small Farmer and the small

161
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,759
farmer is part of that decision to

162
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,720
increase them out I have no problem in

163
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,598
the same way I am saying in the first 3

164
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,000
years it could first 5 years allow

165
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:38,680
individuals a certain number of plants I

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,240
know you see the figure 2034 say Yes man

167
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,360
this is what you want to do from the

168
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,960
beginning so I think we have to be very

169
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,800
practical as to how we grow the industry

170
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,279
and protect the small farm but in

171
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,918
growing the industry it is about

172
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:57,598
protecting the small farm but you

173
00:07:54,918 --> 00:08:00,000
understand I'm going it's just basically

174
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,878
saying we'll have equity I'm trying to

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,319
wrap up and so I'm going to give to the

176
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:07,000
last three the fellow in the African

177
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,520
outfit that young young man in the

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,519
African outfit yes you

179
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:17,079
yes go ahead yes I also want to um

180
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:20,000
refocus on those first two Works

181
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,639
medicinal G I mean we have been talking

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,478
about money i' been talking about the

183
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,560
logistics of getting the thing right and

184
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:31,918
all of that um the next term is wealth

185
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,200
um and it's G and but I want to more say

186
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,278
health instead

187
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:43,640
of um I saw as everybody else I'm sure

188
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:45,439
did the um the Expo by sanj Gupta and it

189
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:48,600
really struck the for of a lot of

190
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,240
Jamaicans to see that the research in

191
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,200
medical marijuana could be applicable to

192
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,159
things like epilepsy and all of those

193
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:01,240
things and um I think we need to refocus

194
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:03,519
s research Council all of those guys who

195
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,799
did the chal stuff we have a lot of

196
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,720
genuses in Jamaica and um there's a lot

197
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:13,319
of um research that has gone in to where

198
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,959
the the medical marijuana can actually

199
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,240
Aid to heal the nation and I think that

200
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:21,559
is what I always really want to focus on

201
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,680
um the

202
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:28,119
products that are already out there how

203
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:30,000
can we bring their them in study them

204
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,759
those that can help

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,919
to heal our children with epilepsy

206
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:39,879
artism all kind of other diseases um I

207
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:42,559
kind of want to hear some more about um

208
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:44,559
Mr Tony I don't know if you have any

209
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,719
information or if there's anybody else

210
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,399
who can actually give us some

211
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,759
information sure we could go back and

212
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:55,639
forth on this one you

213
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:58,200
want so um the actual uh plan that I had

214
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:00,278
in place if if and when and hopefully

215
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,200
the government will do it if medical

216
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:06,519
gandulas were on the books and we were

217
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,560
able to do that um there's products

218
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,879
besides the ones that we focused on with

219
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:14,759
our capsules and sublinguals we take

220
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,399
Blended strains and we we take we start

221
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,838
with genetics so you have to understand

222
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,360
I'm a breeder manufacturer processor and

223
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,120
products so I do everything from seed to

224
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:29,120
sale as well as Implement those products

225
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,000
into other territories so I'm actually

226
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,919
the reason why I'm actually here is

227
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,879
because of the limit problem that you

228
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:40,439
just discussed we have limits in

229
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:43,000
Colorado and we and we have demands that

230
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,079
have with that and so we've developed

231
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
products that don't utilize active THC

232
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,399
and they offer the full spectrum of the

233
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,958
entire medical benefits of the plant and

234
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,720
sequenced products and those products

235
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,679
can get placed by simply educating

236
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,680
teaching the others and the locals so I

237
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,838
do have two two partners actually here

238
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,359
if you guys want to stand up just real

239
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,079
quick those are actually my local

240
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,600
Partners so they they're actually

241
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:13,479
Jamaican they've been there 30 and 40

242
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,839
years in Agricultural Science and

243
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,600
education and so the first step is

244
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,800
implementing that technology and

245
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,159
implementing that farming implementing

246
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,719
and standardizing the genetics and

247
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:28,559
utilizing the the local communities to

248
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,519
create sustainable Community involvement

249
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,000
in the products that are made here

250
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:36,159
branded here and then globally

251
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,559
exported so there's ways to do that and

252
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,000
that's it starts once regulations in

253
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,159
place then

254
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,720
education and then you heal the

255
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:49,679
nation thank

256
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,720
you good evening um just to add to the

257
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:56,679
query the gentleman raised when I

258
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,920
mentioned that father src's mandate is

259
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:03,278
to develop neutraceuticals and

260
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:07,519
Cosmos all the things we're talking

261
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:09,600
about good evening one one second um my

262
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,399
name is Dr Courtney I've been involved

263
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,159
in dietary cannabis for maybe 10 years

264
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,958
it's a whole new field um the raw

265
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:22,240
material consumed runs in the area of 50

266
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,879
to 100 times the amount that you consume

267
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,879
when it's heated and turn into THC we

268
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:31,679
know the THC dose is 5 to 10 milligram

269
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:34,120
we know that antiox dose is 500 to 1,000

270
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,278
um really good guidelines are in the

271
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,639
United States government's patent on CBD

272
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:42,360
they have a phrase an effective oral

273
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,799
human dosage schedule a contemplated

274
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,680
range um and then an example range and

275
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,919
they end up with and in particular 20

276
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,879
milligram per kilogram body weight and

277
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:55,599
they identify the conditions for which

278
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:57,958
that dose is effective it I beg that

279
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,920
people that are making decisions about

280
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:03,599
the amount of uh cannabis that an

281
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:06,479
individual needs at least to base it on

282
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,440
that you know 1996 information there's

283
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,920
much more current information but it

284
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,399
gives you a very explicit um uh dose

285
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:18,360
that's required for diabetes uh

286
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,839
reperfusion heart injury cancer glaucoma

287
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,320
and it's it's so much different than the

288
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,800
amount that you would smoke if you if

289
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,320
you're going to smoke 20 joints a day

290
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,958
you're not going to very consume very

291
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,440
much you're smoking we're now talking

292
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,919
about eating a 100 worth and so please

293
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,519
allow people access to um the amount of

294
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,679
non- psychoactive cannabis that's needed

295
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,078
to uh prevent cancer and preserve their

296
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:43,159
health and and it is in sharp contrast

297
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:46,559
to the amount that you could smoke so as

298
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:48,519
we go forward um it's a difficult thing

299
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,359
to distinguish how do we prevent the

300
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:52,360
dietary person from doing other things

301
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,480
with her cannabis but that's not reason

302
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,639
enough I think to eliminate the

303
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,879
possibility of preventing disease and

304
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,000
maintaining health and restoring health

305
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,958
um because we're we're fearful of the

306
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,440
psychoactive low do usage schedules that

307
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:09,359
really inform all the laws in uh in the

308
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,320
US this is 5 six plant thing it really

309
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,560
is yeah you probably couldn't smoke that

310
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,360
much um but you certainly need a lot

311
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:19,879
more than that if you're going to eat it

312
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,690
and uh use it in a non psycho actic

313
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:25,078
fashion I go now

314
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:29,279

320

00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,399
around Jamaica live in these big houses

355
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:17,958
and they would have a little pot in

356
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,879
their house at the back of the garden I

357

hope you're are planning to do that

358

must we must be careful how we use it

365
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:45,120

final um I've been told that I can only

378
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,199
talk shortly so I'm going to try and

379
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:27,918
contextualize this the best way I can

380
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,880
think right on Sunday I buried a very

381
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,520
dear friend

382
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,600
right he he was in an accident in 1995

383
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:39,160
and he lost a piece of his liver his

384
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:43,319
kidney sorry right now because of this

385
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:47,160

out right my brother died from an Asma

387
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,400
attack my mother died from diabetes my

388
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:55,558
father died from cancer have to get this

389
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,640
thing in context the majority of the

390
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:03,200
people in Graves that day would be alive

391
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:05,159
now regard well you know time but still

392
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,240
this is how important this thing is and

393
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,960
we're still playing with it I asked this

394
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,359
question two years ago in KC when is the

395
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,120
Jamaican public going to get serious

396
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:17,599
about ganja two years

397
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,839
ago but I wasn't even allowed to speak

398
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,279
to the people I could only speak to

399
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:25,480
what's her name Susan Sims and she run

400
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:29,359
me out the place do you know this is a

401
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,400
school so where else should I speak

402
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,000
no this thing is serious and we have to

403
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,240
get this thing in context the world is a

404
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,759
war zone and we are here to clear it

405
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,919
away we are our brothers Keepers you

406
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:46,079
hear just imagine this place like Cuba

407
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,559
with

408
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:51,158
money this is what we're looking at Cuba

409
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:53,639
with money Cuba has a very good

410
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:55,679
system yeah it's about love it's about

411
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,600
sharing so it doesn't matter about the

412
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,320
amount of land you have it's about how

413
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,000
much you care about the people around

414
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,798
you if you have it and you can afford it

415
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,400
let it go what do you

416
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:10,200
need how much do we need on the planet

417
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,720
now with the death around us the

418
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,400
decimation of the mother this is some

419
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,000
serious stuff and we're playing with it

420
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:22,519
I could speak for hours right but but we

421
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,119
only have one minute all right so let

422
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:28,558
let me say that you asked the question

423
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:32,239
in which Forum shall I speak and this is

424
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:34,440
for this is the exact reason why the

425
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,880
board and management of the scientific

426
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,960
research Council gathered experts from

427
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,080
all over to come and sit and share the

428
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,319
ideas and so that all the ideas could

429
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:47,839
contend because if people understand

430
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:49,639
what is at stake how valuable it is and

431
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,599
how you can minimize the negative

432
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,440
effects then we can move forward can can

433
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:58,079
I add one thing well cuz there's been a

434
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,880
couple things said uh when you see when

435
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,639
you you a couple comments were made

436
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,799
about this ganja wealth thing talking

437
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,080
about health right so when I said that

438
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:10,599
the industry you look at the

439
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:14,359
neutraceutical industry and you look at

440
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:17,918
the plant-based medicine natural herb

441
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:19,558
industry it it can affect and help

442
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,038
millions and millions of people on the

443
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:24,000
planet billions of people and that

444
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:26,240
translates to billions or trillions

445
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,798
because of the healing properties so

446
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,480
that's what we were talking about when

447
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:33,558
you explor the full potential of medical

448
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,360
cannabis in its raw form in its

449
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:37,879
semi-active and its fully active form

450
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,279
there's different methodologies and

451
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,440
delivery methods for that that will that

452
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,759
will in that will explode into products

453
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,759
into different things and so that

454
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:51,158
opportunity and that ability to help 70

455
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,798
or 80% of the of the public on the

456
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,840
planet is what we're talking about and

457
00:20:53,798 --> 00:21:00,759
so Jamaica has a very good situation and

458
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:02,759
a position to get that going started now

459
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,279
and I think everyone that I've heard

460
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:08,079
talk tonight and this is just from the

461
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,759
outside besides the political portion

462
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:13,678
and it moving fast or slow everyone in

463
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,879
the room wants this every single person

464
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,759
understands the medical value you have a

465
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:22,080
professer you have a pastor you have

466
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:24,240
every angle covering the fact that

467
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,720
everybody wants what everybody wants in

468
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,519
the room and so you have to approach

469
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,120
this in a systematic way and you have to

470
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,720
do it in a way whether you like all the

471
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:35,879
things and I don't know everything about

472
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,640
Paul I've just heard everybody talking

473
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,960
things I don't know all the things but

474
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,960
you have to take it in a systematic way

475
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,840
and you have to release things and not

476
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,880
be scared that was the first thing I

477
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:51,319
said it's how you perceive the

478
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,480
plan that's your potential one last

479
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:57,038
thing

480
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,519
um someone just spoke um about

481
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:02,720
regulation regulation and then education

482
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:04,480
I think it should be education and then

483
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,600
we can make the regulations because the

484
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,200
people can help to Define now how you

485
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:13,038
educate the people we have channels here

486
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,360
and there is so many documentaries about

487
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:17,278
ganja we just flood the people and

488
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,038
educate them just run ganja

489
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:25,558
documentaries are

490
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:27,440
we serious be serious wake the people up

491
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:31,480
you have the opportunity that the

492
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:36,519
dialogue has started yes and we must
