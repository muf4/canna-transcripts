49
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,069
lined up but we still want to share

50
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:03,148
information we still want to share our

51
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:04,709
content with you guys so I guess dabs

52
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,099
we've got our dabs out here we're

53
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,719
surrounded in

54
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:10,689
my strains right now the strains that

55
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,310
John has shared the strains that great

56
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:14,590
gardener has shared strains that I've

57
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,180
collected myself over the years and even

58
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,719
strains that uh some other friends have

59
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:23,319
collected yeah John's got the the world

60
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:25,449
phytolacca sea Jamaican it's kind of got

61
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:27,488
this triple leaf thing happening now and

62
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:29,889
for the first time it was doing two for

63
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:31,629
the first four and then it split into a

64
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:34,269
three so we'll see what happens this is

65
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:36,879
the Jamaican right here lower mutant

66
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,489
leaves starting to look healthier up top

67
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,979
nice dark color looking really nice and

68
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,810
we talked about that much about try but

69
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:45,609
with the tree and apparently it's what

70
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,318
you were saying and yeah one of our

71
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,060
viewers pointed it out I had heard of it

72
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:50,318
before I just sort of when Simon was

73
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,390
over the other day and he said oh you

74
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,518
have a triploid I guess that's basically

75
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:57,009
what he meant was the world fight Alexi

76
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,680
- the actual there's no bin no genome

77
00:02:57,009 --> 00:03:02,620
done on the plant to find out exactly

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,750
it's not a triploid is apparently

79
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,629
genetic and you need to do a test to

80
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:11,799
actually find out and Simon is someone

81
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:13,599
in the know yeah absolutely so today we

82
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,599
are going to dab up some flavors we've

83
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,829
got the six and a half year I mean my

84
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:22,120
God look at this joint

85
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:24,370
I just watched about me look at this so

86
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,890
this shows you how long how shocked see

87
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,930
it will last for stable stable had a

88
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:30,819
this is sitting in the heat okay this is

89
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,829
six and a half years old I mean that's

90
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,689
really I think we should start with a

91
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:36,129
dab of it I would actually like to you

92
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:38,259
know when it's been a long day so far

93
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:39,939
would be busy we're you know talking

94
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,879
about the next conference coming up and

95
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:44,650
you love stuff going on a lot of lot a

96
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:53,530
lot of good things happening nowadays

97
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:54,879
with recently in the news was a tool

98
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,890
topper that we talked about previously

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,049
when we went yeah a channel I just

100
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:01,818
posted that on my Facebook page today

101
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:03,890
and it was shared over 55 times within

102
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:05,929
no this is you Oh in such a short period

103
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,298
I want a guy it's a touching story you

104
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:11,359
know this this little girl has gone for

105
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:12,620
23 days with of a seizure which is when

106
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:14,480
you see her grandmother and her mother

107
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,340
kind of bursting into tears on camera

108
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,858
you realize how intense it is like this

109
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:22,038
is a serious thing every time she has a

110
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:24,500
brain CT seizure her brain actually is

111
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:27,110
deteriorating so it's slowly killing her

112
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,160
so cannabis is literally now not just a

113
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:34,189
curative but is now becoming a lifesaver

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,320
so cannabis saves lives every day it's

115
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:38,689
pretty awesome look at that though hey

116
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,879
where I peeled that off it's red and

117
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:44,810
it's good if you didn't get to see that

118
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,430
which I'm sorry it in it did the bubble

119
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,990
in that and that just how about the

120
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,220
taste for something six years old

121
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,769
because everyone wants to know how much

122
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,509
taste can be left it must be stale it's

123
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:55,159
not something I'm into you it's the

124
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:57,949
opposite of stale I swear to God some

125
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,410
flavor for whatever it is like it has

126
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:04,250
enhanced when you aged something and you

127
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:08,419
like like a gate or even I know

128
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:15,500
referring to oils and and and and I

129
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:21,019
guess anyways long story short it tastes

130
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,639
amazing definitely a nice treat and you

131
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:26,538
spent six years holding on to something

132
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,430
it's a special day every day you get to

133
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:30,319
share it it is a special day it's pop

134
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,870
Wednesday and I can't really really

135
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,779
think of a person I would rather share

136
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,220
it with Johnny Dee good buddy puffing

137
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:40,219
with him all the time sharing his meds

138
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,740
with me we're just stoked on inspiring

139
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,060
each other to be kinder literally John

140
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,650
and I have inspired each other to be

141
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,288
better people since we've met and hung

142
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:51,649
out totally you know why that's it focus

143
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:53,149
check ringing and well friend I mean

144
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:54,288
it's always been about education and

145
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:56,598
I'll come on to the strains it's

146
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:58,939
something I've learned from from you my

147
00:05:56,598 --> 00:06:02,418
friend is uh you got to share what works

148
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:04,219
so well for you and that's just it honey

149
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:05,359
why I you know I did a video the other

150
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,400
day and I passed

151
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,930
some genetics to Tim and awesome and

152
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:10,908
just slowly getting them out there and

153
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,918
letting people know hey you know if it

154
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:15,079
works it works and if it doesn't try

155
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:18,649
something else the flavor on this isn't

156
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:20,899
that amazing is over the top just like

157
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:24,769
that sweet it's almost like I should

158
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:26,899
bring some to Legends oh not not to be

159
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:29,060

163
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:45,198
old by then oh yeah I think there's

164
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:47,180

174
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:18,319
pressure on what could be a hole back in

175
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:23,778
there we hit that first one yeah dad's

176
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:27,189
up well I'm expecting this week to get

177
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:29,360
the new camera that Aurora so kindly

178
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:32,538
pre-purchased for me in exchange for

179
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,270
some beautiful photographs it's been a

180
00:07:32,538 --> 00:07:38,028
few days since I really managed to take

181
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:40,128
some good photos I'm feeling it it's

182
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:43,699
probably been over a week I have taken a

183
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:45,439
few with my my older camera but I'm just

184
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,329
not feeling it the inspirations not

185
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,260
there so I'm really looking forward to

186
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:49,969
getting this weekend

187
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,009
so I can just get back on the

188
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,660
photography to get back on the daily and

189
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:55,550
weekly updates on all the different

190
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,890
strains get on more macro photography

191
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,980
show you guys more resin show you guys

192
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:02,659
more more melting videos you know when I

193
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,060
get the ceramic discs back you know I

194
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,580
find it's hard to set up the camera for

195
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,829
a good melt shot with this particular

196
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:11,240
quartz bowl and it's hard for me to cut

197
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:12,740
mark off tell them that it's actually a

198
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,050
one-minute morning huh

199
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,639
I don't mind see I was gonna do the 1

200
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,800
minute warning because people need to

201
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,370
know it's one minute before 4:20 you

202
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,129
need to be ready I mean for me it's uh I

203
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:28,189
like to medicate and you know 4:20 for

204
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,839
me it's just it's time to relax look at

205
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:32,690
all this awesomeness that the whip is

206
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,860
like just gently traversing around well

207
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:39,200
that's one thing with nice about the

208
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:41,930
whip I love it it doesn't always see if

209
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,460
job gives us a call here for 20 and no

210
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:50,059
be exciting to talk to someone from me

211
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:52,280
all right bowl up 422 you guys if you're

212

217

218
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:23,110
beaten down real nice on the Vancouver

219
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,110
Lower Mainland these past week in a bit

220
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:31,400
really nice it's saving me because I

221
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:34,669
only have so much room I'm many many

222
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,539
many plants under my license I don't

223
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:37,729
even need grow

224
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:39,740
I don't even grow half the plants that

225
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,029
I'm legally allowed to grow and it's not

226
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,940
a book thing about plants that you grow

227
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:45,769
it's about what you get out of it well

228
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,590
that's it that's what that's just it and

229
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:49,939
I don't want to try and get into

230
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,940
annexation where I have more plants than

231
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,710
I bet I can careful that's one of the

232
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,870
bugs and the mildews and all these

233
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,450
different things move in something that

234
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:02,539
I'm fighting with a little bit right now

235
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:05,240
I'm just like everybody else in a while

236
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:07,219
it is what it is but you know just get

237
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,629
down to the nitty-gritty and a few of my

238
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,399
plants got a little bit of bug so I'm in

239
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:11,570
there daily working on stuff like that

240
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,789
it's something they got to pay attention

241
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,950
to mm-hmm that's why I keep my mom's

242
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:17,689
even these right now or bushier than I

243
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,520
like I'll probably chop them down real

244
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,750
soon I've I've kind of let them get a

245
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,519
little bit bigger because I have a

246
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:25,129
feeling that I'm gonna be able to when I

247
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,809
cut these down share them out rather

248
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:28,250
than throw them all the way you've done

249
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:30,139
this where you can cut these tops off

250
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,820
and these bottoms can explode and zoom

251
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:35,049
very nice and how you set up your mom's

252
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,050
I mean I'm gonna say

253
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,659

254
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,060

255

335

00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:30,220
on the puffs Wednesday Wednesday our

first time having that

338
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,720
now Joe called me last night we were

339
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,870
just chatting and he was telling me

340
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,000
about Louise he's been injured he's got

341
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,669
back problems he's had one of his legs

342
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,470
amputated he was on heavy pharma and now

343
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,539
we used as catalyst of pain control and

344
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,370
and him moving to Australia was for the

345
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:50,049
heat it was just so much better for me

346
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,629
today sounds pretty happy yeah and he

347
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:54,159
was explaining how yeah he was talking

348
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:55,750
about how we started doing that the

349
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,959
bubble bags and Halloween litters from

350
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:01,059
that and that's how he was using for his

351
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,950
pain control and he was watching you

352
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:05,859
from day one like he was talking about

353
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,269
yeah it's very cool I was very humble

354
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,929
he's like you know what you guys are

355
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:12,879
like legends you like and to him it was

356
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:17,140
because I wanted to marks like a

357
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:20,230
celebrity sure you I said I said mark

358
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:25,630
mark is a humble servant of Jah

359
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:26,980
mark is a guy that loves me I see when

360
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,170
you have a passion it's easy I think

361
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,500
I've seen a lot of people come and go in

362
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:35,289
this industry and I find that - the ones

363
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:38,009
that really have the true passion ours

364
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:42,279
are the ones that that stick through it

365
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:45,069
well it's a truly amazing plant it does

366
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:46,660
so much for us as we all know and the

367
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:50,369
more and more research that's coming on

368
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,500
with it and the information people

369
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:54,808
their education cycles and watching Oh

370
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,609
miles world and learning about the

371
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:58,139
different accuracies of different

372
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:02,729
ratings for different conditions of

373
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:04,440
course doing it legally it is legal

374
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,970
that's the best partner motive we

375
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,769
changed the world is changing

376
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,360
yeah it's nice to see it could have been

377
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:12,240
less than 10 years ago the Tron and I

378
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:16,799
both literally jumped up like maniacs

379
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:21,319
right now we'd be ready to fly over the

380
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:23,609
deck no big deal it's probably the RCMP

381
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:26,250
traffic helicopter which is the one that

382
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:27,719
flies over the most no concern of mine

383
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,339
I'm not doing anything out of the

384
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,710
ordinary here I have about six plants

385
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:33,959
seven plants up in my deck my clothes

386
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:41,370
right there 15 feet away where they

387
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:43,289
really actually hey no problem John

388
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:45,259
wants to make specifics he's got some

389
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:48,659
planted in this backyard

390
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:50,910
but we love them specifically as funny

391
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,200
as we were talking about the other day

392
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,900
because of how many moms you have a guy

393
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,200
got four four led into what 11 I just

394
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,880
kept counting always yeah I know it's

395
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,410
the old mom problem I'm sure some of you

396
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,880
guys have it out there too that's why

397
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:06,300
another great thing of sharing your

398
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:12,120
strains with your friends is the ability

399
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:12,940
to not have to hold all the moms at one

400
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,859
place

401
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:19,420
having broken up amongst different

402
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:21,549
people because now that way you don't

403
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,990
need to mom out all the ones I'm mommy I

404
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:24,519
don't need to mom out your strains

405
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,819
there's just like we can share the

406
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:29,200
strains without it made it easier for me

407
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:30,279
because recently that was really my

408
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,049
problem I was kind of like what am I

409
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:34,779
gonna do with all these many Hayes and

410
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:36,879
Haas and og wrong and you know the my

411
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:38,980
little pony to fee nose to fee nose of

412
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,070
Haas it was becoming quite a bit just of

413
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,589
your strains alone and I already had a

414
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:46,689
barbed an Afghani a Congo and a sweet

415
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:48,009
skunk those Forks are sure along with

416
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,559
astroboy and East Coast Sour Diesel

417
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:52,509
which is now six that I wanted to mother

418
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,629
and keep for sure

419
00:19:52,509 --> 00:20:02,170
so anything really for me on top of that

420
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:03,730
is it'd be a cool lifestyle actually how

421
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,980
about this they they let us have

422
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,690
licensed producers they let us have home

423
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,750
grows and they let us have dispensaries

424
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:13,750
and we start a new kind of company much

425
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,309
like the THC Bank or whatever the the

426
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,559
clone I can't remember what they're

427
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:20,679
called but much much more like the

428
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:23,589
concept where you just houses mothers

429
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:28,990
you just house mothers of strains and

430
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:30,609
those strains would become available to

431
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,710
not only licensed producers but also

432
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:34,359
home growers and even dispensaries that

433
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,759
wanted to go and buy you know a couple

434
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:40,169
pallets wholesale and sell them off at a

435
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:43,240
small profit to their to their patients

436
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,529
[ __ ] I think it's just that's the

437
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,970
future and that's the whole thing is

438
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:47,440
you're ahead of your time so saying this

439
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,048
now we're gonna look back with vinegar

440
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,609
we said

441
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:53,168
well it seems like it is what's

442
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:54,308
happening you know we're getting into

443
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,269
strength Pacific's for different

444
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:57,098
conditions we're looking at the

445
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:59,709
different values that medical values of

446
00:20:57,098 --> 00:21:01,628
each individual plant and really you

447
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:04,599
just can't have one there's so many

448
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:06,728
different varieties or so the profiles

449
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:09,338
are so complex that it's just hard for

450
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:11,169
them to detail these implants they want

451
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:14,408
to take one plant and make it everything

452
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:16,389
that they want and I just if they can do

453
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:18,459
that awesome I accept that but I also

454
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:20,168
want the availability of the whole plant

455
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:22,778
and the whole plant extracts to the

456
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:25,329
people that wanted in those forms the

457
00:21:22,778 --> 00:21:27,638
land raced and the hybrids but like

458
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:29,709
non-gmo and just like what we have today

459
00:21:27,638 --> 00:21:32,199
let us at least have what we have today

460
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:34,629
then we'll accept anything new down the

461
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,759
road as long as that new thing doesn't

462
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:39,878
push out the old you know why not I like

463
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:43,690
this idea of a quiver you know more

464
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:50,048
rather than less yeah that works for me

465
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:55,690
what did you just rip under pressure I

466
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:57,038
see it well that's nice a little bit of

467
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,109
moisture on the top there that's a good

468
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:06,009
way to cure your bubble you probably

469
00:21:59,108 --> 00:22:08,199
don't want a lot of moisture going at a

470
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:11,700
fresh jar that I am wrapped up of the

471
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,788
watermelon and I had it wrapped up and

472
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,769
never got into sifting this actually and

473
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:21,069
put the Sun here in it oh man beamed

474
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:23,200
right up and moist June she popped I got

475
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:24,700
a phone call I'm gonna go see if it's

476
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:30,869
another cool call in four puffs

477
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,869
Wednesday like isn't that cool

478
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:40,759
he's gonna call hello uh oh I missed it

479
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:44,429
I'll have to call him back that was a

480
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:46,288
friend calling uh about a new project

481
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,970
that John and I are putting potentially

482
00:22:46,288 --> 00:22:50,908
starting that we probably aren't really

483
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,528
allowed to say much just yet but trust

484
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:53,940
me it's cool and you guys will hear

485
00:22:52,528 --> 00:23:02,880
about it first here on bubble man's

486
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:04,110
world yeah definitely so I guess yeah we

487
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,179
were on our way to go look at the seeds

reserve let us know we're interested

546
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:08,429
we'd like to hear about it you know I've

547
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,110
I saw the quality photos I've known a

548
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:11,580
few people who have grown these things I

549
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:15,479
haven't personally seen the butter the

550
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:17,399
resin yet but yeah you know we've got a

551
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,929
long list of genetics to crack Jon and I

552
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,900
are trying to figure out a way to get

553
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,970
ourselves a greenhouse get a company

554
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,860
going where we can do a little R&amp;D and

555
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,450
that way we could start cracking all

556
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:28,979
these seeds otherwise it's just right

557
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,960
now it would be crazy to crack these

558
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:35,009
seeds without a place to really properly

559
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,690
grow them right so these are gonna go

560
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:38,579
into the bank you know I can hold on to

561
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,289
seeds I've had my Jamaican one for 20

562
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:42,720
years and it's growing right now behind

563
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:44,879
me so hopefully these get planted in the

564
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,190
next six months to a year we want to

565
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,470
thank dynasty genetics we want to thank

566
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,769

567
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,009

00:30:24,528 --> 00:30:29,808
I want to step it up I know that if if

00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,989
I'm able to get down there and meet my

631
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:35,418
buddy Tony who we were within in Spain

632
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:37,220
he's able to come down and bring a film

633
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:39,110
crew or bring his camera then we will

634
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,298
definitely be able to film the second

635
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:43,969
part of the documentary you started in

636
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:47,359
Spain we haven't forgotten about it I'm

637
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:49,519
still actually editing Spanish video

638
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:53,359
around part six part six is getting

639
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,859
edited right now and it will be it's a

640
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,569
little bit mismatched because it's

641
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:59,898
footage that wasn't really going to be

642
00:30:56,569 --> 00:31:01,308
filmed specifically for editing Tony has

643
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:03,528
the majority of the footage so I have

644
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:05,418
little bits and pieces from my camera of

645
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:08,359
us heading over to the Ripper seeds guys

646
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:11,090
place and whipping off a batch of wet

647
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:13,369
washed bubble hash and then I also clean

648
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:15,230
old geez it must have been a three or

649
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:17,209
four hundred grams of dry set for them

650
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:18,919
yeah that was definitely a legendary

651
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,298
moment yeah a little bit of a highlight

652
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:23,809
for the trip when I kicked everyone out

653
00:31:20,298 --> 00:31:26,240
and I quickly you know as fast as I

654
00:31:23,808 --> 00:31:29,178
possibly could managed to clean that

655
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,788
resin up to an absolute wonderful purity

656
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:33,559
separate it out into piles and when they

657
00:31:31,788 --> 00:31:34,859
came out back into the room five or ten

658
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:39,629
minutes later they were all just

659
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:41,099
like how did you do that so these are

660
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,929
fun things that we experience when we're

661
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,969
away on our trips and I know that this

662
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:46,530
Jamaica trip is going to be I mean is it

663
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,720
a coincidence you know we cracked the

664
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:51,690
20-year old Jamaican seed we talked

665
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,130
about to Jamaica and after that we

666
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:55,080
talked about to make an answer I've been

667
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:56,790
talking about Jamaica for 20 years I'd

668
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:01,558
love to make since I talked to you you

669
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:03,149
like Jamaica everything especially if

670
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:06,240

671
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:10,798
into this scene this industry it's hard

672
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,509
not to go to Jamaica and it's like it's

673
