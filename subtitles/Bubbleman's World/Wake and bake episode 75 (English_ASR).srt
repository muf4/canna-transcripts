11
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,419
better than that

12
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,089
well you know what gets better than that

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,890
being able to spend my my afternoon for

14
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:32,219
a half an hour with all of you guys I

15
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,140
get stressed out I'm not gonna lie I had

16
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,700
to go pick my daughter up out on the

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,649
ocean today and we got into a pretty

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,540
hairy situation with some family on the

19
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,009
boat it was going up and down and it was

20
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,109
kind of sketchy we had to turn back

21
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:45,299
around so I've been out on the water all

22
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,579
day since like 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock

23
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:51,599

24
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:55,799
missing in action but I'm here now

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,780

40
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,070
to give these away I don't think I'm

41
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,259
gonna do like a contest I think I'm just

42

43
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,099

44
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:40,259

pretty bad I think the only thing I can

113
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,900
say in like an Australian accent if you

114
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,150
say the name Jennifer Lopez it's the

115
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:41,049
easiest name to say in an Australian

116
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:42,969
accent Jennifer Lopez Jennifer Lopez

117
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,170
that's my Australian accent anyway we've

118
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:53,350
been through this before let's keep it

119
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:56,949
up so little angel holding a pot leaf

120
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,900
you know just standard there's a little

121
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:03,240
bit of a low low temp rep so we're gonna

122
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:03,239
we're gonna boil that resin up again

123
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:17,110
yeah the classic the classic shrimp on

124
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:19,930
the Bobby I'm not sure I pet Matt's

125
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,490
probably probably a variety can't

126
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,949
imagine Ron and I growing one thing but

127
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,949
I love the idea of pulling a Congo crop

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,470
peasant ah see I want to crucify you

129
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:34,539
mate

130
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,090
I know it's terrible I apologize to all

131
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,860
Australian people all around the world

132
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:40,810
I do love my Australian brethren and

133
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,360
sisters we have a lot of them up in

134
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,970
Whistler they hold it down tonnes of

135
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,620
Aussie people Australian people work on

136
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,220
Whistler mountain so every year we have

137
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:53,110
Australian day and it is quite an

138
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:58,480
experience to party and rage with the

139
00:05:53,110 --> 00:06:00,790
with the Australians I don't think

140
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,520
that's true at all Dave I mean some do

141
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,800
for sure but my buddy Wally duck puffs

142
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,278
the fire I got friends in Australia like

143
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,359
the Mullen bin be mad nap man

144
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:14,449
in Mullen bimby who grows the fire super

145
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:17,829
exotic rare terpene profiles that you

146
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:20,149
have probably never even experienced so

147
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:25,278
although yes some people smoke out of

148
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:26,809
Billabong's plastic shitty bongs it

149
00:06:25,278 --> 00:06:29,199
you're right fires everywhere but

150
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:31,729
Australia is very lucky they can grow

151
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,728
incredible quality herb on a massive

152
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:37,968
scale they have a very very powerful Sun

153
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:39,588
and ya know I [ __ ] give my props off

154
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:42,319
to Australia is this cannabis thing

155
00:06:39,588 --> 00:06:44,749
comes to fruition I don't doubt that

156
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,019
Australia will be a powerhouse in the

157
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:50,179
cannabis world they've got the they've

158
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:51,918
got the Sun what's the last time you

159
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:54,918
smoked a hash joint she's probably on my

160
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:58,639
video that got 1.3 million views the

161
00:06:54,918 --> 00:07:01,359
hash the hash joint video is the last

162
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,360
time I smoked one

163
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,129
wasn't that a good hash search yesterday

164
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,110
I felt the same way about it I thought

165
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:14,920
it was incredible

166
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:19,720
I was like super stoked on it cleaning

167
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:22,540
out this minor Chaz here I was very

168
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,740
impressed with Peter Peter had some

169
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,290
great knowledge you know he was very

170
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,720
kind and compassionate and loving

171
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,870
individual and I was very glad that my

172
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,160
hash Church cohorts didn't jump down his

173
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,019
throat because sometimes the hashed

174
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,150
Church guys are a little bit harsh so be

175
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:38,740
a little you know so it was good to have

176
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:40,389
Indra in there who's very you know

177
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,460
spiritual and I was very impressed with

178
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,079
chimera chimera came and dropped you

179
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:46,569
know primaries like a scientist so he's

180
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:49,149
also not always on point with the sort

181
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:51,909
of airy-fairy sorta but he really liked

182
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:53,349
Peter he loved his vibe he thought that

183
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,410
the information here's the bottom line

184
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:59,020
about Peter Peter knew his [ __ ] you know

185
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,850
he knew his [ __ ] he knew his bacteria he

186
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,259
knew his information and that's what we

187
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,879
loved on hash Church when someone can

188
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:06,759
share information with us I mean I

189
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:09,129
learned a ton I can honestly tell you

190
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,500
that I didn't know most of what Peter

191
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:14,490
was talking about and for me like a huge

192
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,930
you know I never call us experts I

193
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,060
didn't know Todd even had a new show to

194
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,740
be honest but that's awesome that he has

195
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,930
a show and that he's doing his thing

196
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,340
I know that he's choked at me and he

197
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,019
doesn't want to do hashed Church anymore

198
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:28,449
so it's kind of how it goes right you

199
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:30,099
know start your own show see how you do

200
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:32,889
he's taught he can get lots of people

201
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,930
you know he brought lots of great people

202
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:38,439
on to hash Church so I suspect what he

203
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:40,989
would do is maybe to make his own show

204
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,720
and bring a lot of great people onto his

205
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,549
show so hey the more the merrier I hope

206
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,110
that Todd continues to do his thing I

207
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:49,389
certainly don't have a dislike for Todd

208
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:52,389
but you know he backed me into a corner

209
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:53,860
and tried to get me to you know he tried

210
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:57,009
pulling a bit of a power trip on me and

211
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,810
I absolutely will not be powered when it

212
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:00,730
comes to hash search Todd is always

213
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:02,619
welcome on hash Church but yes hash

214
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,170
Church I do believe he quit hashed

215
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,360
Church recently and someone just said if

216
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:09,679
I could comment on his new show so I

217
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,139
suspect he's moving

218
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,449
and forward so I'm not sure what his

219
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:16,490
channel is but if you just google Todd

220
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,290
McCormick I'm sure you'll find it maybe

221
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,669
his show will be great maybe it will

222
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:21,439
blow up maybe he'll realize hash

223
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:23,419
charters churches something special and

224
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,060
it's just not that easy to bring people

225
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:27,860
together and run and and create a show I

226
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:31,000
think at hash Church is something really

227
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:35,330
special and I want to hold on to it and

228
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,309
you know make sure that you guys have

229
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,589
oh he posted it in the hash Church page

230
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:41,419
that's hilarious all right well we'll

231
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:44,300
see we'll see what's what's going on

232
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:47,179
there anyway I don't think I would

233
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:50,449
probably want him to be advertising in

234
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:52,489
my hash Church group for his new show

235
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,690
you guys get me right it's kind of like

236
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:58,879
isn't that a bit of a classless sort of

237
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:05,350
kind of maneuver so anyway I'm gonna

238
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:10,389
have Peter back again all right

239
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:13,159
Saturdays at oh there we go

240
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:15,169
he's got my whole Scott he's got yeah

241
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:16,789
he's got let's see he's got Mel Frank

242
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:18,319
Tom Alexander southern skunk man Rob

243
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:20,149
Clark cave trichome technologies and

244
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,370
Todd mcCormick hey looks like it'll be a

245
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:24,769
Greek great great show I gotta give him

246
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,049
props you know it'll probably be a great

247
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:29,720
show and I'm not gonna be upset about it

248
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:32,870
I want people to have more access and

249
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,550
honestly if his show became the show it

250
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,799
would probably be a huge relief to the

251
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:39,109
hash Church crew but that's church is

252
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,689
special and it's not just about inviting

253
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,459
great people to make it come together

254
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,740
and so we'll see what happens you know

255
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:49,699
it's gonna be an interesting year 2017

256
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,110
we got some pretty good news here in the

257
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,730
last couple of days I'm not gonna

258
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:56,060
mention it yet but it's very exciting

259
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:59,149
and we'll see what would you go if

260
00:10:56,059 --> 00:11:01,039
invited Wow I mean probably like I said

261
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:02,929
I'm not sure I don't want to get into a

262
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:06,559
war with Todd Todd and I have very

263
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:09,049
strong egos very strong egos yes exactly

264
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,729
drew bingo you nailed it there is some

265
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:12,289
negativity there that I don't like to

266
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,920
get into I've had it before with him and

267
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:20,469
I'd prefer to not you know get into it

268
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:23,059
on that level so we'll see what happens

269
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,660
all right anyway I gotta get going here

270
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:26,239
we've

271
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:28,250
we've done up a new I can't get going I

272
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,659
gotta give some papers away I got my kid

273
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,419
knocking on my door but I'm gonna hang

274
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:34,610
out we're gonna puff some bowls and it's

275
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:36,829
the greenhouse isn't is your

276
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,570
relationship I don't think it's becoming

277
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,590
like that it was real issen all tell you

278
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,590
know what you guys want to know what it

279
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:46,879
is I'll just put it right out there Todd

280
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:52,070
um is not a fan of oh that's a bummer

281
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:53,269
you guys got it sorry I bumped out there

282
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,920
I went to push something and someone

283
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:56,569
sent me a message and it all changed up

284
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:59,059
but yes that's it he's not a fan of

285
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,560
Indra he finds Indra to be not his

286
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:02,719
favorite person and it got very

287
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,819
uncomfortable for me for him to try and

288
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,100
so what happened was when I invited into

289
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,840
her last time on to hash Church talk

290
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,850
about very upset and he said that he

291
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,680
felt like I blindsided him and I was

292
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,680
like oh god no I would never I would

293
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:17,989
never try to offend you and I offended

294
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,639
him so he I invited Indra on you know

295
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,230
for me hashed Church is bigger than Todd

296
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,799
McCormick it's bigger than Mark

297
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,659
Richardson

298
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,490
it's bigger than Tony for szura it's

299
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:28,339
bigger than any of us that are on the

300
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,289
show okay so when we're having a good

301
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,660
conversation and Indra fits into it I

302
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:34,370
have to send him the link I have to send

303
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:35,959
him the link people love Indra they love

304
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,850
his stories just because Todd thinks

305
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,800
he's not a good person and he thinks all

306
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,840
these negative things it doesn't mean

307
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:43,549
that's what hash Church thinks and I

308
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,139
tried to explain that to him and I got

309
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:47,569
where he was coming from in the sense of

310
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:49,879
how he felt I blindsided him and I I

311
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,190
apologized for that Todd I really didn't

312
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:54,559
try to blindside you but this is bigger

313
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,270
than you it's bigger than me it's a it's

314
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,269
a thing that we have to kind of put our

315
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:01,730
egos aside a little bit and I learned my

316
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:04,220
lesson with Horatio our egos clash so

317
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,279
great we both left you know and never

318
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,720
talked to each other again and so I

319
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,669
don't want to have that happen with

320
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
other good long-term activists and

321
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:15,319
friends in the community so I will

322
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,409
continue listen bottom line we slayed

323
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,730
hash Church this week it was an

324
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:22,189

342
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,829
coming to you soon in the meantime we

343
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:05,600

yeah Jenna said he was gonna be coming

345
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,360
back to hash Church absolutely that's

346
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,519
yeah FATA Mike you know we got to

347
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,259
inspire more shows more people doin the

348
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,909
good things and we the more the merrier

349
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:19,789
because let's be honest if hash Church

350
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:22,039
falls to the wayside wouldn't it be nice

351
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:24,679
to have a couple of other shows that

352
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:26,629
were going and that you could get this

353
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:28,250
information from that it was just I

354
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:29,208
think it would be really really

355
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,490
wonderful

356
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:34,088
oh me too Rick Green listen I felt that

357
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:37,579
Todd was one of the most valuable assets

358
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:40,520
of hash Church hands down he was huge

359
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:42,708
asset to hash Church but I can't let

360
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,389
that you know you just because you're an

361
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,669
asset doesn't mean that you can start

362
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:48,588
making rules for a show that's really

363
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:50,059
just a show that you're you know that

364
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:51,980
