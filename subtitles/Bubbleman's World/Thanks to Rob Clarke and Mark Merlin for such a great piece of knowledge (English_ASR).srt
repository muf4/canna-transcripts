sapiens now this is the book that they

39
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:50,319
are kind of rocking the boat with that

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,399
is talking about the nlds and the the

41
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:57,279
wlds now that is a narrow Leaf drug

42

cultivar and a wide Leaf drug cultivar

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,759
both of which he's stating are from the

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,118
Indica family and that the sativa uh

45
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,959
rather than an actual species is more

46
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:09,280
like um a useful plant it's the hemp of

47
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,680
the species and he's saying Indica

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,719
branched out and created uh a wide leaf

49
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,920
and a narrow Leaf um drug cultivar for

50
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,719
obviously recreational and medicinal use

51
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,518
and that's covered in this book so if

52
