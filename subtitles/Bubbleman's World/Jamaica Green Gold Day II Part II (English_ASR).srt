00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,480
overcoded C no interest by the media no

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,118
interest by

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:33,960
human no middle class person is there

5
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:38,000
some that perspective but where are we

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,920
today we been talking talking talking I

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,200
because a on why I'm actually here

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,800
because I respect the work and Comm and

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,640
what he has supported the group that we

10
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:54,479
work with but I really want to

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:57,239
contribute to another talk shop and I

12
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,878
for one don't believe that going to jica

13
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:05,759
is AC with any sense of urgency on this

14
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,759
matter I don't believe that

15
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,520
[Applause]

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,719
exec and I said this to many of them

17
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:18,239
there's nothing I'm saying their

18
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:22,719
back understand the vast

19
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:26,719
potential the magnitude of the potential

20
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:29,118
that this industry is about in people's

21
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,920
minds unfortunately it's about more

22
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:31,920
people just

23
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:39,280
and that is just the least of it the jur

24
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,118
of as to

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:47,519
what

26
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:49,718
what G people smoking under habit much J

27
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,679
I'm going to get into that today I had

28
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:55,199
my few Puffs while I was in JC 64 I'm

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,759
not more probably J

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,600
1970 I didn't see any negative impact on

31
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:04,879
me I was noted right

32
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,879
and I won't call the something

33
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,680
this they hold some very serious

34
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,640
positions in the society who used to go

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,319
upstairs and SC

36
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:23,039
her but talking about the the farming

37
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:27,159
implications I think all of us not just

38
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:29,959
the parli all of us have to be

39
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,079
Guardians that this industry is

40
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,000
protected for

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,840
Jamaicans and protected for Jamaican

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,400
Farmers I don't think everybody should

43
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:44,039
be excluded but I am just amazed by some

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,239
who call me and I welcome their Interest

45
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:49,158
Who

46
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,239
want about 500 Acres willing and wanting

47
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:54,079
when this thing going fre up when the

48
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:58,840
gate going fly I have

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:02,040
just who I would never have thought

50
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,840
of in growing this

51
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,158
product

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,959
so as you know we have the Cannabis

53
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:12,479
commercial medicinal research task force

54
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,719
and we spawn the gang of future girls

55
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,919
and producer Association I hear the word

56
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:20,639
future won't be with it too long but

57
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,039
what are the farming

58
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,598
implications all we going to make sure

59
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:31,239
it is protected for the Jamaican

60
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:36,158
farm and remnant conted final decision

61
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:39,640
but certainly in my mind in the first 3

62
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:42,479
years it has to be restricted to strict

63
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:46,479
the Jamaican farmers and it has to be

64
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:50,039
restricted in s otherwise those who want

65
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:52,280
to grow 200 Acres 300 ACR 400 Acres will

66
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,569
take over the industry they too must be

67
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,050
allow to grow their 5 ACR

68
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,919
[Music]

69
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:02,680
[Applause]

70
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:06,639
the Jamaican farmer understands the

71
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,599
industry from a international legal

72
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,438
understand from an international

73
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:13,560
perspective but from a legal

74
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:15,638
International perspective it can't be

75
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,839
that people should be allowed big

76
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:22,319
farmers should be allowed to grow 100

77
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,638
200 300 acres of this certainly the

78
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,519
people who need the product must

79
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,759
contract Jamaican Farm to grow their

80
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,120
product put their quality control

81
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,479
experts give them the kind of seeds they

82
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,319
want but they should not be allowed to

83
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:41,199
grow more than their own research era

84
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,199
and then they contract Jamaican

85
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:50,279
Farmers the farmers who Supply must be

86
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:53,120
able to through a Cooperative own part

87
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:56,079
of that Enterprise so that we're not

88
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,160
just producers and suppliers but we earn

89
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:03,839
from the finished product so if

90
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,120
hire is that valuable that up to a month

91
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,959
ago I was told by Dr law at is law was

92
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,918
selling more an ounce of hempire for

93
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:16,638
sending more than an ounce of

94
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,198
gold we want our Farmers not just

95
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,680
provide the raw material but we want

96
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:26,400
them to benefit from the finished prod

97
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,759
certainly the workers we have to dust

98
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,198
off ESOP employee share ownership Pro

99
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,759
programs that they get preferential

100
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,080
shares so it is not for foreign

101
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,680
companies to come in and say Yes grow

102
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,519
the crop for us and we make the finished

103
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,120
product and and not we they make the

104
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:46,879
finished product and the finished

105
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,160
product leaves Jamaica 20 times value

106
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:54,560
added 40 50 times and all we are doing

107
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:58,479
is producing the raw cannabis GI them we

108
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,120
have done that all house as we have seen

109
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:05,839
so this has to be

110
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,079
how should the money be used I certainly

111
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:11,198
support that has to go to public

112
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,318
education some it has to subsidize

113
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,439
development and research and some it has

114
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,639
make some people still grow food for to

115
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,478
eat I say to

116
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,960
you it is not that threat everybody's

117
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:28,839
just to go there in the same way you

118
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:32,038
have the farmers in s having Tomatoes Ro

119
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:34,119
you got D so it's not what you want to

120
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,159
grow it's what people want to

121
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,639
buy so

122
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,240
the the future grows Association is very

123
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,759
is a very important group and they have

124
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,038
excellent leadership and they have a

125
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52,879
collective leadership and they have

126
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:54,120
people who are not restricted back in

127
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,839
political

128
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:01,079
conserns right uh because as I said

129
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,159
before very day when I became sure that

130
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:06,598
I would have a chair for more than 3 4

131
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,840
months and they have put a Le in place

132
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:11,199
that they are really studying the

133
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:14,079
implications of this

134
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,520
industry we also want to make sure

135
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,719
that most of things leave in Jamaica is

136
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,439
finished

137
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,840
products not the raw cannabis but there

138
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,759
a market for raw cannabis yes and in

139
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:30,878
many countries right now they are

140
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,720
selling their own stock as make on her

141
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,039
CU I call used to sell things as Blue

142
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,199
Mountain Coffee right and people are

143
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:41,560
marketing and branding all kind of

144
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:46,478
strong as jamaan which is not authentic

145
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:49,240
jamaan so there's a Marketplace for that

146
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:52,758
now the oversight

147
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,360
committee the criteria so clean and

148
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:59,038
straight for those who want to grow that

149
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,598
once you meet 1 2 3 4 five you get your

150
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,800
license

151
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:06,038
nobody must feel that to know somebody

152
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,800
nor a politician nor a good man it must

153
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:13,478
be open that the average jamaan the man

154
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:17,680
that use te blows and the lips right can

155
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:17,680
grow his strong

156
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:24,918
finally

157
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:28,279
finally I believe if the Jamaican people

158
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:30,680
are not mobilized to push this and you

159
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:34,199
believe that announcements our victories

160
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,278
as sincere as they may be and this is

161
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,719
what has caused some of the passive

162
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:40,799
thing that we just believe is going to

163
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:46,320
come but let me tell you my last

164
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:49,120
story in 1978 Dr Kim M shared a

165
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:53,080
committee and of that and we just

166
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,959
learned the other day there a 197i study

167
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:00,040
done and Louis found that study which

168
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:05,000
showed clinical evidence that the a lot

169
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:07,399
of the myths that gandja was universally

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,839
dangerous that once you use gandja you

171
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:13,039
were going to go man and all those

172
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,760
things and that has been univers Landing

173
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,679
for many years and know many people and

174
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,078
it's just last week has been coming out

175
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,879
again there's a lot of information about

176
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:27,120
that but in 198 in

177
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:30,759
1978 the the the Jamaica Council of

178
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,679
churches was opposed the medical

179
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:37,000
asso so that parliamentary committee you

180
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,639
could appreciate when 1980 n the two

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,240
political parties

182
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:45,439
wanted to take on in charge the Medical

183
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,320
Associate Jamaica United States of

184
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,320
America all of

185
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:55,159
that an inside story I made a

186
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:59,000
fundamental mistake in

187
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:01,078
1999 I was in a different room a

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,320
different time about to move a

189
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:07,359
resolution for a certain party to

190
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,160
legalize call for the legalize from G

191
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,399
and the members of that party were very

192
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,719
interested and very militant and we're

193
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,399
going to pass that

194
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:21,079
resolution and I was told don't do that

195
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:24,480
because and the shabans committee was

196
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:27,639
set and that committee did some good

197
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,320
work fell short but many of us who were

198
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,319
there R silver

199
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,000
that was a good first thing but as deiz

200
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,000
was a half step like when gave the

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,559
slaves apprenticeship not the real thing

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,958
yet but still move the thing forward so

203
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:51,159
I wouldn't accept it and that sat down

204
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:54,719
for 10 years nothing

205
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:57,519
happed I am saying to you if you

206
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,399
understand and appreciate how important

207
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,440
this thing is it's one of the pl

208
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,919

209
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,240

211
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,639
distribution allow people to grow their

212
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,440
own plants for their own own use that we

213
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:20,600
must not wait until the government is

214
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,600
ready right we must agitate we must

215
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,079
Advocate we must

216
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:30,680
insist and then we can start F and then

217
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,679
family will have reputation for

218
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,760
thank you very

219
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,479
much I like the idea of of protecting

220
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,480
our intellectual property rights because

221
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,159
that is s important if it's high grade

222
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,800
gandering our next speaker will expand

223
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:54,039
these issues you look at the economic

224
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:57,519
implications of a ganja industry because

225
00:11:54,039 --> 00:12:01,120
if in fact if in fact it is as high

226
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,039
as 140 billion US doar I can't even put

227
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,519
that in

228
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:08,919
J if it's that our future is in

229
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,679
Gant but we would need to have an

230
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,159
economic framework what kind of

231
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,278
incentives would we need to put in place

232
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:16,879
to have fair play I mean what sort of

233
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,958
incentives we need to have to get people

234
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,799
involved in the industry and what kind

235
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,039
of regulations would we need to put in

236
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,639
place to have Fair place so everybody

237
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:28,240
can come and sit at the table and what

238
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,198
kind of financing mechanisms would you

239
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,480
need because from all that we have heard

240
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:34,838

241
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,360

places to tell us today about the

277
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,020
economic implications of

281
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,799
the well I was checking my notes in it

282
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,600
it didn't say anything about liido or

283
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:36,758
the female plant I wish I had that

284
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,120
subject my mine is a little more cut and

285
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,278
dry I think it comes down to a few

286
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,278
things and I wrote some notes down

287
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,120
here it comes down to awareness it comes

288
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:49,439
down to timing it comes down to

289
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,440
standards regulations Brands and

290
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,360
Community what do I mean by that is how

291
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,759
is how aware is your community how aware

292
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,480
are you

293
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:03,320
about medical cannabis hemp social

294
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,839
aspects social responsibility of using

295
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,560
cannabis in a recreational way it's your

296
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,480
awareness which is what's going to

297
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,879
expand the economical impact how where

298
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,360
are you and how willing are you to

299
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,159
accept the entire plant and its full

300
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,519
spectrum capability of helping people

301
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:23,480
and and having a place for industry and

302
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,919
also having a place for responsible

303
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,278
recreational

304
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:31,519
use so the uh timing is also an

305
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,879
important important issue because the

306
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,440
rest of the world is changing around you

307
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,559
so depending on how fast you act and

308
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:43,000
this particular time and I mean timing

309
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:45,479
within 90 days to 6 months and I know

310
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,480
that's very very very fast for everyone

311
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,399
in Jamaica but you have to look at what

312
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,800
some of the other professors and

313
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,399
principles from UI talked about in

314
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:56,559
timing of what's going on in the United

315
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:59,559
States what's going on in Guam what's

316
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,799
going on in Canada Uruguay

317
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,758
every country around the world and at

318
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,318
one point Jamaica had the ball and they

319
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,399
weren't first we all knew that that's

320
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:10,360
what the Rosses talked about that's what

321
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,039
music talked about then there became

322
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,680
prohibition a Prohibition spread in the

323
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,318
United States and spread around the

324
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:19,559
world many people went to jail many

325
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:22,719
people sacrificed their lives and so

326
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:25,119
today is that opportunity of that timing

327
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,480
so you can stand up as an entire nation

328
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,399
and not fight among yourselves and and

329
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,039
find those solutions to to where you can

330
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,600
help every aspect of life in every

331
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,599
department so that starts with standards

332
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,120
so if everybody wants to be part of

333
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,240
these products and everybody wants to be

334
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,679
a part of what's going on you have to

335
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,519
stand within a community and you have to

336
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:49,359
build that like uh Paul Burke had said

337
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,799
before I came up here so that's simple

338
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,600
that's creating a standard a standard of

339
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:56,198
waying to grow a standard of your

340
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,000
cultivation a standard of your resin a

341
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:00,958
standard of processing and creating

342
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,440
local branded products by the people

343
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:06,159
that are here through a regulation and

344
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,120
Regulatory system that also opens up

345
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,199
more economical impacts once you're able

346
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,318
to do that then you can have localized

347
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,880
branded products that are actually made

348
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:18,558
here like you have your Blue Mountain

349
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,199
Coffee not the raw not raw cannabis but

350
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,480
actually products that are finished and

351
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,558
made here and branded here and then

352
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,319
exported to the rest of the world that

353
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:31,720
has vast huge Community impacts not in

354
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:34,359
not in the billions but in the

355
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,960
trillions that's the truth because if

356
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:40,038
you accept it and you're aware of it and

357
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,000
you understand that there's industrial

358
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:45,200
medical and social aspects of this plan

359
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,960
and you embrace it and you turn the rest

360
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,160
of the world on to you and you

361
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,200
understand that you have to study it in

362
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,320
a scientific aspect and debunk all of

363
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,720
the different myths or the different

364
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,480
solutions or the different things that

365
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,919
you've seen you have to find the most

366
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,159
effective way to use the plant possible

367
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,960
for all three of those categories so

368
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,919
that's going to affect your economical

369
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,840
impact so those are pretty big

370
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,120
statements and why do I say that I say

371
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:14,119
that is because I started on the floor 6

372
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:17,719
years ago like anyone else less than

373
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:21,000
$200 six lights and six

374
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,839
plants that's how I started so I had no

375
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,240
economy I had zero and so I was a

376
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,279
patient and an activist and somebody

377
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,558
that had a mission to help myself and to

378
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,038
help the other around me so I also been

379
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,079
through opiates I've been through

380
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:36,440
painkillers I've been through car

381
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,759
accidents I've been yelled at I've been

382
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,320
told I'll never make it I've been

383
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,839
disowned by my family all of which did

384
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,439
not come true I just kept pushing

385
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:49,918
through so that's how I started River

386
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,960
Rock and in 5 years we we developed uh

387
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,840
both indoor and outdoor cultivation 300

388
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,120
different strains in house and we've

389
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,279
created actually I've created a program

390
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,359
and that's what she was talking about

391
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:05,918
with the acel program which is utilizing

392
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,918
all full spectrum of all the cannaboids

393
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,640
85 medical of that in its raw and Live

394
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:15,320
Form not utilizing activated THC so I

395
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,000
eliminate THC in the entire program but

396
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:20,639
I use the acid forms of T andc this

397
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,079
developed into a widespread medicinal

398
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,759
outbreak if you will in Colorado so what

399
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:30,439
ended up happening was we didn't help 3%

400
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,960
of the nation we started helping 8 80%

401
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,798
of our population with effective

402
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,240
effectiveness of 90% so the list of

403
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:40,000
immune autoimmune and Central Nervous

404
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,480
dysfunctions we are able to address

405
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,759
without any psychoactive experience

406
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,440
whatsoever utilizing the full plant and

407
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:49,640
it in its full

408
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,919
Integrity we also legalized cannabis so

409
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,919
I need a round of applause for

410
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:01,038
that so in that process I also went

411
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,279
public and I took all of these products

412
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:05,558
and all these inventions and these

413
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,440
things and these ideas and decided to

414
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:09,599
implement them in state by state since

415
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,919
we weren't allowed to cross borders so

416
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,439
we still have prohibition going on and

417
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,759
in doing so this allowed us to

418
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,600
infiltrate into different territories to

419
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,720
set up this information and use part

420
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,079
terms and localized growth and

421
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,960
sustainable Community projects that

422
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:29,639
allow us to grow within this is massive

423
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,319
in massive economic impact and this all

424
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,080
comes from how much do you want to

425
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:36,678
accept this do you just want H do you

426
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,480
just want medical ganja do you want to

427
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,240
accept the social and the recreational

428
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,079
aspect in my opinion having all three of

429
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,640
those and taking your time with that and

430
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,759
understanding how to actually create

431
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,600
those regulations and standards and

432
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,400
following the lead of everyone that's up

433
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,439
here that saying those things is the

434
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,960
most appropriate way so you have to

435
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,440
think of this as an industry with

436
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,600
training farming education testing

437
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,360
careers banking it's humongous it's not

438
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,959
in the billions it's what's going to

439
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:07,879
save multiple Nations and multiple

440
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,880
places but what makes Jamaica

441
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,960
unique it's not just the vibe it's not

442
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,960
the high

443
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,440
grade it's the people that want to make

444
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,400
it you actually want to do it that's

445
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,000
different today I spoke to Children

446
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,038
about wanting to get involved in

447
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,919
cannabis I don't get to speak to

448
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,359
Children about cannabis the United

449
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,880
States so this starts early and it

450
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,879
starts with

451
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:44,120
[Applause]

452
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:49,798
you uh thank you very much Tony for your

453
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:54,519
very inspirational talk on the value of

454
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:56,200
Gand well Paul said that nearly well

455
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,278
several years ago that the jamaic

456
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,840
Council of churches opposed the whole

457
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:03,119
business of gandra they didn't say lick

458
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:06,798
them Jud Jud lick them Lord they would

459
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:09,798
have said that polite church group but

460
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,158
the Bible says that herbs are for the

461
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:15,720
healing of the

462
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:18,840
Nations um so I wonder then what with Dr

463
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:22,600

464

468
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:37,679
responsibility when it's our

process of change where real poverty

499
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,079
could be solved if we could harness the

00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:08,960
resources from Gano and make several

501

products and make real Income At Last

502
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,680
please join us at the podium to tell us

503
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:18,608
about the B and

00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,609
[Applause]

505
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,880
more thank you very much um good evening

506
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:29,839
everyone it's really good to be here and

507
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,960
to be part of participating in this

508
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,599
[Music]

509
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,600
conversation I am not going to present

510
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:40,678
an official position of

511
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:42,359
JCC and I must say that it is not likely

512
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,399
that what I will say will represent the

513
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:47,798
view of the church in

514
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:50,359
Jamaica but I have in preparation for

515
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:52,519
coming and sharing with you I did

516
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:56,639
reflect with some of my colleagues in

517
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:59,038
JCC to hear their thoughts um on this

518
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,399
matter and

519
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,278
if those responses that I've gotten well

520
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:06,489
they seem to be indicating Paul that

521
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:09,618
some conversion is taking

522
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,618
[Music]

523
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:16,158
[Applause]

524
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,038
place yes and I suppose the church like

525
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,320
many

526
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:22,919
others

527
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:24,798
um lack of full information and

528
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,520
knowledge when you do not know something

529
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,918
it creates it has a way of creating

530
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:32,319
anxiety and fear and so forth and I

531
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:35,278
don't think the church is is is

532
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:38,240
uh is perfect and therefore you'll find

533
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,599
that happening as well but I I shared

534
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,480
some thoughts with some of my colleagues

535
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:45,119
or got some of their input as I prepared

536
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:48,798
to share with you and I want to begin

537
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,798
by where we

538
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,760
call creation

539
00:25:52,519 --> 00:26:00,079
Theology and that is based on our

540
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:03,278
understanding of the creation narrative

541
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:08,879
where in Genesis God created the heavens

542
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:12,519
and the Earth and he said it is

543
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,159
good and the psalmist in chapter 24

544
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:15,480
captures it very well when he says the

545
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,278
Earth is the

546
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,558
Lords and

547
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,319
everything that is in

548
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,599
it so from a faith

549
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,359
perspective we believe that the universe

550
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:29,199
is

551
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:31,319
created by God and that God has

552
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,000
entrusted the

553
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:38,079
stewardship of its resources to

554
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,759
humanity and since

555
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:45,599
Humanity or human beings are God's

556
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:48,798
stewards we are accountable to God for

557
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:51,199
what we do with God's creation amen and

558
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,798
therefore we should not abuse God's

559
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,159
creation we must use it in ways that

560
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:59,558
enable

561
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:01,840
life in ways that Empower human beings

562
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:04,569
and the rest of the creative

563
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:05,839
order marijuana then is one of the

564
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:08,439
[Music]

565
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:11,278
resources and our

566
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:14,919
scientists and their Knowledge and

567
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:16,079
Skills are among the gifts that God has

568
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:20,720
given to

569
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:24,278
creation and to us human beings and they

570
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,919
too like the rest of us must Endeavor to

571
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:29,000
be good stewards of the resources that

572
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:30,120
God has given to us

573
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,319
so it is

574
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:37,558
appropriate to give thanks to God for

575
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,480
our scientists the discoveries that are

576
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:42,960
been

577
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,798
made and that all of us together must

578
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,038
work at protecting

579
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:52,038
Health well-being and the economic

580
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:54,319
empowerment of our

581
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:56,919
people love and

582
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:59,278
neighborliness are important principles

583
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:02,200
of the Christian faith

584
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:06,398
as such we must be

585
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,880
concerned about those who are anxious

586
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:11,798
about what decriminalization and

587
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,640
legalization May mean and the negative

588
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:17,960
impact it could have on families Society

589
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,200
in general and especially people who are

590
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,960
able to speak from their own experience

591
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,880
of how it has affected them or how it

592
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,679
has affected their families so we must

593
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,840
do all that we can

594
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,919
to protect the vulnerable while making

595
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:38,158
good of the resources that God has given

596
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,840
to us in fact for us that is a moral

597
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,760
issue that you must protect the

598
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:44,759
vulnerable and Dr Le has raised some of

599
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,119
the

600
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:50,640
concerns Justice and I hear Paul

601
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:54,479
speaking to some of this but Justice is

602
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:58,519
another important principle um for us as

603
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,519
Christians um we consider it unjust

604
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:01,640
where the negative side of the story is

605
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:04,159
what is

606
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,399
highlighted and has prevented the

607
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,760
scientific exploration over these many

608
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:12,518
years to advance in the ways that it

609
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:14,158
could have

610
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:18,240
advanced

611
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:21,679
and what we see is

612
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:25,038
that our greatest critics if we're not

613
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:29,519
careful will deprive us from the

614
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:31,759
benefits and if we allow that to happen

615
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,839
if we allow others to

616
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:37,000
manipulate the

617
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,759
possibilities and like other things

618
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,319
where we export and then have to turn

619
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:44,519
around and import that would be

620
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,439
irresponsible another Justice question

621
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:49,640
surounds and again I hear Paul raising

622
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:54,320
that the fact that over the years it is

623
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:56,720
mostly our poor black males who have

624
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,879
been dragged before the courts for the

625
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,640
use of marijuana

626
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,919
now if we're going the route of

627
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,320
embracing a more liberalized approach we

628
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:11,440
should ensure that the wealthy in our

629
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:13,639
land are not the only ones to experience

630
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,679
the significant benefits from the

631
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,679
industry Hallelujah we should

632
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,278
ensure that it is so

633
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,200
structured that the

634
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,480
ordinary organized Dominican people can

635
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,720
also benefit

636
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,720
from

637
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:38,640
it there's issue of greed that we need

638
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,840
to watch and that's a moral issue as

639
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,840
well that sometimes there's a tendency

640
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,599
to want to get the most out of it and

641
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,720
put the least in it and so we would need

642
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:50,759
to

643
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:54,038
ensure that greed does not allow us to

644
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:56,919
sacrifice standard and quality and so we

645
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:58,519
need to ensure that all the necessary

646
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:01,960
inputs are made

647
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:06,240
so that we maintain proper standards um

648
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,240
of the product thank you very

649
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,679
much when I must say all I can say is

650
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:21,038
amen really I think this was an

651
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:21,038
extremely balanced presentation

652
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:25,088
[Applause]

653
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:32,518
on our final presenter is Mr Courtney

Betty who will tell us about the

655

medicinal tourism

656
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:40,240
implications currently Betty is a lawyer

657
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,720
but it's a law he's a lawyer with a

658
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,960
conscience he's a lawyer that has a

659
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,480
social has some kind of social

660
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,960
responsibility he he has gained an

661
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,599
excellent understanding of the legal and

662

664
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:02,079
successful track record of contributing

665
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:05,120
to the development of Jamaica having

666
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:07,678

of Affair of trading commission and he

668
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,080
helped to pave the way um to have the

669
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,120
deregulation of telecommunications in

670
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:18,879
Jamaica Mr

671
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:21,439
Betty will is has played a key role in

672
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,480
advancing the development of medical

673
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,798
marijuana industry in Jamaica and his

674
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,599
model of the green gold triangle he tell

675
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:31,879
us what that means the green gold

676
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:34,798
triangle maximizes the opportunities for

677
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,159
Jamaica by creating Partnerships which

678
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:41,240
ensures participation from all sectors

679
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:44,440
his vision for Jamaica is to utilize our

680
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:47,038
natural herbal resources to create

681
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,880
health and wealth for our nation ladies

682

the thank you

685
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,840
good evening um as I heard Paul speak

686
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,720
and I was just reminding him how long

687
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,558
ago we actually started this battle not

688
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,440
as long long as Paul Chang I got to

689
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:11,440
recognize Paul please stand up Paul

690
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,519
Chang and uh for the work that Paul has

691
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,120
done really on the on the whole issue of

692
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:21,919
social justice and uh that work has been

693
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:23,959
going on for many years with you Tom

694
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,480
about Peter Tosh or many of the others

695
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:30,960
that are really being at the Forefront

696
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,519
um as a lawyer uh sitting um and looking

697
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,159
at the opportunities here in Jamaica was

698
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:36,798
very interesting because as a lawyer you

699
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:40,720
start off first with your legal mind and

700
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:44,000
what I discovered um was that in

701
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,600
1974 the laws of Jamaica actually have a

702
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,558
provision that excluded medical

703
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:52,319
marijuana from the definition of ganja

704
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:53,638
it's a really interesting situation

705
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,759
because we're actually one of the first

706
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:58,798
countries that I'm aware of in the world

707
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:01,038
that actually has a medical marijuana

708
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:03,879
provision from back in

709
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:06,119
1974 and it was a result of that that

710
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,280
you have individuals such as Dr lockart

711
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:11,239
that presented this morning and Dr West

712
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,119
that were able to develop amazing

713
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:17,078
products canol and

714
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,760
asmol know so it was quite a surprise as

715
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:22,919
we're now going through many years later

716
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,599
trying to put in place a illegal and

717
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:27,519
Regulatory framework I've been fortunate

718
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,960
in working along with Haw Thorne from

719
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,878
the initial

720
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,960
process looking at the type of

721
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:35,838
submissions that would go to

722
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,960
Cabinet um working on with the Minister

723
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,279
of Justice who in his presentation of

724
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,519
the first document that was tabled

725
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,280
recognized the work that uh that time

726
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:47,759
has sit down in trying to look at a

727
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,399
potential legal and Regulatory framework

728
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,760
and what I saw was a couple of things

729
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:55,719
when I started on this I saw

730
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,839
Israel started after Jamaica but they

731
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:00,358
had moved this so far Advanced they put

732
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,000
place a legal and Regulatory framework

733
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:04,078
they began all the scientific and

734
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,039
research development that was required

735
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,960
they own the vast majority of patents if

736
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:09,079
you go and you search marijuana patent

737
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,400
you're going to be shocked how many

738
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:14,119
Israeli companies actually own those

739
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,320
patents I mean they're very far ahead so

740
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:19,320
my vision which we launched here in

741
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,640
Jamaica on May 22nd was to really

742
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,240
combine the the research the technology

743
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,679
that has been developed the common

744
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:29,039
practices from Israel with the greatness

745
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:30,719
of Jamaica or actual goods and products

746
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,239
that we're able to grow here and bring

747
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,319
it to the international market and we

748
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,078
called it the green gold triangle and so

749
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,480
as I looked today we didn't P we didn't

750
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,839
trademark that one but I'm glad to see

751
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,358
that we're here at uh at the green gold

752
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:44,960
green gold conference and so we move

753
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:47,199
farther because we had a particular

754
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,920
Vision having worked here in Jamaica

755
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,960
having worked on the community level on

756
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,280
many different projects I don't need to

757
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,720
to mention them specifically what we

758
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,200
wanted to do was to create first and

759
00:35:55,719 --> 00:36:01,679
foremost a common

760
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:04,199
infrastructure that all Industries and

761
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,279
all people in Jamaica could actually tap

762
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:09,199
into so some of the things that Tony

763
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,280
mentioned for example testing facilities

764
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:15,480
and ha had mentioned as well being able

765
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,240
to um distinguish the amount of C CBD

766
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,760
versus THD all of those infrastructures

767
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,399
actually now in place at the University

768
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,599
of the West Indies through a partnership

769
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,280
that timeus has put together to form a

770
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,640
herbal medicine Research Center at the

771
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,359
University of the West Indies the next

772
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,358
partnership that we went to we look

773
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:36,358
forward because we really thought it was

774
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:39,719
important to ground ourself in some

775
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:42,400
history was the Maroons and colonel

776
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:44,358
colonel lumson is here with us today now

777
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,079
looking at setting up colon Lon you

778
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:51,440
stand up please as best I can as best as

779
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:54,079
we can and col Lon came to us with the

780
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,480
project with a project aimed at tourism

781
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,318
for the Maroons community in Portland

782
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,559
and so we've been assistant working with

783
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:04,679
them in terms of getting that rural Echo

784
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:07,078
System uh tourism project going the next

785
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:10,480
initiative that we look at we'll talk um

786
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,920
was tourism outside of mono Bay and with

787
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,119
Dr William Courtney and his wife

788
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,318
Christine and others we're looking at a

789
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:19,440
medical Utopia where people can come in

790
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:22,440
from all across the world particular

791
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,838
senior citizens and be able to get the

792
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,960
type of treatment that they're not going

793
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:28,400
to get in the North American environment

794
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,400
the type of medicines the type of herbs

795
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,280
if you look at Dr Janice fiser one of

796
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,720
the leading experts on medical tourism

797
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,920
and St stem cell research and the work

798
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:40,318
that she's been doing in mono Bay we're

799
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,838
now looking to enhance that so the

800
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:45,440
opportunities from a tourism standpoint

801
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:47,078
again you know it's a challenging

802
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,960
situation because we're trying to

803
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:52,280
separate recreational and all these

804
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,240
other elements the medical tourism side

805
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,599
internationally is one that has

806
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,919
tremendous potential and people will

807
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:01,519
come to the shores of Jamaica people are

808
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,599
now coming to the shores of Jamaica uh

809
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:07,440
as Dr lockart may have said people are

810
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,880
coming here and importing canisa into 23

811
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,318
countries so there are things that we're

812
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,960
already doing the goal is not to

813
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:17,318
reinvent the wheel the goal is to see

814
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,920
how we can build put the proper

815
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:23,000
infrastructure in place to be able to

816
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,000
move this ahead thank

817
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:30,519

203 million users use ganu G 203 million

836
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:25,679
persons use

837
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:28,078
gandu um currently I see that it's $140

838
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:31,598
billion it's that's a business with bed

839
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:36,160
products but

840
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:38,640
Tony Zur says no you're looking at what

841
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,679
is today you're not looking at the

842
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,519
possibilities you're not looking at the

843
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:44,559
future and if you look at the future

844
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:48,159
you're talking trillions when he said

845
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:50,519
trillions my eyes saw dollar signs and I

846
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:54,078
thought about the health of the people I

847
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:58,318
got so excited about Simon and the

848
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,880
health implications on all of this but I

849
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:05,679
people like

850
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:08,280
uh Dr Harriet and Courtney Betty says we

851
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:10,399
need regulations we need to have an even

852
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:14,000
and careful playing field we need to

853
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,240
make certain that we can have what we

854
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,599
want and minimize the negative impacts

855
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:22,598
because Dr Winston de was not afraid to

856
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:24,119
say there are possibilities you know but

857
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:25,640
let me caution you about some of the

858
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:28,000
negative impacts you don't want to hear

859
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:30,440
about it you think I'm a Dooms but I'm

860
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,599
going to tell you anyway and so he told

861
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:35,318
us what are the possibilities what you

862
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:38,359
call cannabis induced

863
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:40,318
psychosis you see things you pretend you

864
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:43,639
see you think you're hallucinating your

865
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:45,159
out of body experiences I say wow and he

866
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:47,519
said you don't want to have that and if

867
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:52,799
you're a kid you don't want to take it

868
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:56,079
but still the P said we need to have B

869
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,440
let us see how we can eradicate poverty

870
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:02,920
develop viable business bu and move on

871
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:08,480
while minimizing the negative

872
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:12,079
impact and then again the possibility of

873
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,639
medicinal tourism in Jamaica well I'm

874
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,839
sure you have a lot of questions so I'm

875
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:19,838
going to open the floor now for you to

876
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:25,159
ask the panelist and to share your ideas

877
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:28,599
on the possibilities of simia caner

878
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:32,759
cannabis hemp Mar or whatever you call

879
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:34,800
it is it really Jamaica's green gold

880
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,880
okay the floor is open I see someone

881
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,480
waving

882
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,440
here vanity prevented me from putting on

883
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:46,119
my glasses so I can see you in the

884
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,119
black can you me I think there's a

885
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:55,159
mic oh there you go night everybody um

887
00:41:55,159 --> 00:42:00,519
vse okay I'm just going to call him Tony

888
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,358
um he mentioned something about timing

889
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:04,759
in his presentation I just wanted to

890
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:08,318
find out if anyone can shine some light

891
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,560
on where we are in terms of Regulation

892
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:14,318
getting all of these things up cuz what

893
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:17,559
was it 6 weeks to 6 months he said um

894
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:19,920
can we meet that kind of T do you know

895
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:23,838
anybody um can we get some assistance

896
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:28,480
here might is the mic

897
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:31,039
on you want to come to the podium

898
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,039
started that

899
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:42,640
problem so yeah and timing is everything

900
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:45,000
I can't speak to your regulations cuz I

901
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:47,440
don't I don't like to take political or

902
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,119
government involvement in any type of

903
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,760
political stuff or regulations I just

904
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:53,680
lay out my opinion and what I think

905
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,920
people should do and how it could impact

906
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:59,318
people on all

907
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:03,079
levels but I will be on uh USA Today and

908
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:04,719
then later on on Vice um that's on TV

909
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:07,880
talking about what will happen when the

910
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:12,078
United States reschedules cannabis to a

911
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:15,119
2 three four or even five and they will

912
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,318
they will reschedule it eventually so

913
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,240
there's elections that are coming up

914
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:21,440
what ends up happening is when the

915
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:24,719
United States makes that move and it's

916
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,800
no longer a class one so THC would not

917
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,399
be up there with Heroin would not be up

918
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,599
there with cocaine or acid as everyone

919
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,599
in this room knows it shouldn't be not

920
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,359
even smok in a spliff should be even

921
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,920
anywhere near that so when they change

922
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:40,920
that that has drastic implications on

923
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,318
what can happen in the United States

924
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,039
currently clinical trials are very very

925
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:47,920
difficult to start

926
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:49,838
universities uh professors and and

927
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,800
science communities don't integrate as

928
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:55,239
they do here and no one's all for that

929
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,559
so therefore even someone in in my

930
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:59,358
position can't actually take

931
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:02,200
um the products that we're using to help

932
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:04,480
for cancer and epilepsy and seizures

933
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:06,399
chronic pain opiate dependency things

934
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,679
like this we can't just go test them we

935
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,400
can't just go to the local University

936
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:13,919
and ask them to get involved and help us

937
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,960
with that so the moment they change that

938
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,039
is when the opportunity changes so if

939
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,358
you if you don't act as a as as a

940
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:26,558
country upon that in the

941
00:44:22,358 --> 00:44:29,519
next I said 90 days to 6 months then

942
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:31,960
that window starts to shrink so I think

943
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:35,239
you have 6 months and then that window

944
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:38,240
starts to go away now do I still would I

945
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:40,239
still uh think that the economy would

946
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:42,399
still boost if even if you made the

947
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,759
changes absolutely because people want

948
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,200
to come to Jamaica I want to come to

949
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:50,160
Jamaica I don't want to right right now

950
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:52,558
it's 17° where I

951
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:54,558
live if I could if I could take part in

952
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:56,480
medicinal herbs and all kinds of

953
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,760
plant-based medicine and integrate this

954
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,440
with canav oids I would be here so

955
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,079
people want to come here even patients

956
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,519
want to come here this is Paradise this

957
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,559
is going to open up tremendous amount so

958
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:08,559
you want to act upon it in a very smart

959
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,640
and intelligent way as soon as

960
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,450
possible no no

961
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:15,400
no no

962
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:19,358
[Applause]

963
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:21,720
just just to add to what um Tony just

964
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:24,000
said and um in relation to the question

965
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:27,078
that you raised uh unfortunately you

966
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,599
missed the earlier session of the the

967
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:32,760
the presentations but uh we had somebody

968
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:36,160
who made a presentation regarding the

969
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,559
status of the dangerous drugs act and uh

970
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:41,199
we were told that hopefully by December

971
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,680
of this year it should be in Parliament

972
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:46,960
and you know we're moving on track to

973
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:52,799
get it sort to go as quickly as

974
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,800
possible okay next person uh the

975
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,640
okay good night night everybody just

976
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:06,599
before you answer May invite persons who

977
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,960
want to ask questions to do exactly what

978
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:10,160
you did to come the island and use the

979
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,159
mic in

980
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:14,639
the go

981
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:16,519
ahead I I would like to ask the the

982
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:19,759
creators of this conference the the

983
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:21,280
theme of the conference is medical G and

984
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,040
I would like to know what level of

985
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,119
consultation there has been with the

986
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,759
medical fraternity considering that

987
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,440
neutrals are not necessarily traditional

988
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,400
medicine and as such but canol is not a

989
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:36,559
neutraceutical so there is spere for the

990
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,960
use of carabids in terms of as a

991
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,319
medicine what is the level of

992
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,159
consultation in terms of this kind of

993
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:43,639
conference with the medical fraternity

994
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:46,759
or the Ministry of Health or whoever

995
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:49,000
there is that controls medicine in this

996
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,240
country is there anybody who wants to

997
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,679
take a

998
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:56,919
question

999
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:59,838
um there really has not been any level

1000
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,400
of consultation with the medical

1001
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:06,639
fraternity conference such as this is

1002
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:09,318
really designed to get ideas rather than

1003
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:12,039
Consulting a particular group you s it

1004
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:14,440
open to get ideas like yours and

1005
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:17,119
everybody's that is put into the Melting

1006
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,519
Pot and recommendations are put forward

1007
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,309
so the conference is really designed to

1008
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:25,318
get information and to give

1009
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:28,039
[Music]

1010
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:32,679
information okay Dr de do you want to

1011
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:35,880
say anything oh all right good evening

1012
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:38,719
everybody I have been

1013
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:43,559
noticing with all that is going on that

1014
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:43,558
the manufacturing part of it is already

1015
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,280
set we have been asking the question how

1016
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:52,919
are we going to get the government to

1017
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:57,480
work faster to

1018
00:47:52,920 --> 00:48:00,760
make production legal because

1019
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:04,760
the manufacturers are right them set

1020
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:07,720
right medicinal ganja is already on the

1021
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:09,400
team but we need the farmers cuz you

1022
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:12,000
need the produce you need you need a

1023
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:14,358
product to work for and to work with

1024
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,760
right you need the ganja to do your

1025
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:19,440
extracts you need a ganja to do whatever

1026
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:23,319
you need to to to to make your

1027
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,200
products our problem is if there is no

1028
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:26,920
farmer then you're going to have a

1029
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:31,039
problem in getting your stuff you're WR

1030
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:35,240
material right right so what I am

1031
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:38,838
suggesting is all

1032
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:43,199
the producers of the various

1033
00:48:38,838 --> 00:48:46,960
products come together with us as a

1034
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:49,159
farmers and press the case along with us

1035
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,559
make the government know that if you

1036
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:55,239
Don't Legalize the farming no we won't

1037
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,960
be able to produce anything to export

1038
00:48:55,239 --> 00:49:00,879
from Jamaica

1039
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,798
so if that doesn't happen we are still

1040
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:07,039
going to be here talking

1041
00:49:02,798 --> 00:49:10,159
talking right so this is the suggestion

1042
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:12,558
to you and I'm sure all the farmers are

1043
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:15,279
in agreement with this that all these

1044
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:19,040
people who are producing the products

1045
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:22,400
should come into the game with us or put

1046
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:27,880
some petition to the government saying

1047
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:30,559
if we You Don't Legalize the farmers no

1048
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,720
then we are going to shut down CU we

1049
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,680
won't be getting any raw material to

1050
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:37,000
make our

1051
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,000
products that's

1052
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:43,039
why really interesting comment I must

1053
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,440
say but I think the government kind of

1054
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:48,079
is a little interested in it the days of

1055
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,280
resistance are over as I understand it

1056
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:53,240
I'm going to ask you young man if you be

1057
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,319
kind of enough have Kel speak before you

1058
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:58,318
yes you in the blue blue jacket or black

1059
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:58,318
jacket

1060
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:13,559
I I asked I requested that I I sign

1061
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:17,199
until I I I speak because I I have

1062
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:18,040
beyond what the country needs and

1063
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:21,639
sometimes you have to think about

1064
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:25,440
yourself because I do have a personal

1065
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:28,519
problem situation but what I want to

1066
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:31,798
speak about is uh uh uh uh uh Mr bet is

1067
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:34,798
uh talk about um uh

1068
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:38,719
tourism medicinal tourism or tourism

1069
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:42,358
that could generate from uh uh uh uh

1070
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:47,838
medical marijuana marijuana uh uh period

1071
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:47,838
we have a uh a tournament a wrestling

1072
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,839
tournament with the former own

1073
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,599
communities in Charleston on the 6th of

1074
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,159
December now we have a magazine out of

1075
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:58,280
uh America that said that they would

1076
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:00,078
fund

1077
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,839
this

1078
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:05,839
tournament and would

1079
00:51:02,838 --> 00:51:10,920
guarantee a certain number of people

1080
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:13,960
coming to the uh tournament the the size

1081
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:17,920
that would make Portland as a tourism

1082
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:20,960
destination get a significant boost

1083
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:24,039
however one of the things that they are

1084
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,559
are requesting is that there be

1085
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:28,639
some

1086
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:33,960
something that says that when these

1087
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:36,960
people come to uh Jamaica within the

1088
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,358
boundaries of char ST which is clearly

1089
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,920
demarked that they would not

1090
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:46,598
be

1091
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:49,960
harassed the 6th of December now aong

1092
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:52,838
aong gets the same thing on the 6th of

1093
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,720
January 6 might be something you know

1094
00:51:52,838 --> 00:51:58,519
the ancestors what but the 6th of

1095
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:58,519
December and I'm wondering if

1096
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,210
the government can't give us that money

1097
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:02,480
to put on that

1098
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:05,039
[Music]

1099
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,440
tournament and we are suggesting that we

1100
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:10,838
are trying to find our own and we're

1101
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,838
wondering if the government would help

1102
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,159
us in this in in some way shape or form

1103

to to to to to to

1104
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:22,838
satisfy uh these people

1105
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:26,000
that

1106
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:28,920
indeed we could get a away just for that

1107
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,199
one day nothing just one day get a

1108

give a commitment at this

1119
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,599
time

1120
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:14,798
suggestion next next um person good

1121
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:18,159
evening to the panel good evening ladies

1122
00:53:14,798 --> 00:53:21,159
and gentlemen um I want to preface what

1123
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:24,318
I'm about to say first by saying that I

1124
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:27,000
only heard about this Gathering the

1125
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:29,159
conference on the radio Nationwide

1126
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,199
I have absolutely no interest no

1127
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:35,039
business interest in it um I am

1128
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:37,838
completely and totally against

1129
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:41,000
recreational use of marijuana having

1130
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:44,679
seen what it has done to a few persons I

1131
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,599
just want to start here having said that

1132
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:50,838
though in Jamaica we have a way of

1133
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:53,798
blocking the road when our roads not

1134
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:56,880
getting looked after by the MP I think

1135
00:53:53,798 --> 00:54:01,199
this is a good cause to block the road

1136
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:05,798
because if half of what you all said is

1137
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:08,838
really so with the type of money that is

1138
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:11,119
waiting for Jamaica to exploit then this

1139
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:12,719
is a really good cause to block Hope

1140
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:16,160
Road tomorrow

1141
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:18,118
morning I'm going to ask let me preface

1142
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,879
the rest of what I'm about to say first

1143
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:23,240
by saying I'm also a

1144
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:25,240
Christian no but at the end of the day

1145
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:27,439
at the end of the day the lord gave us

1146
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:30,399
as the Reverend said all these things

1147
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,119
for our own betterment so as I said I am

1148
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,280
completely and totally against the

1149
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:37,680
recreational use of this

1150
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,040
drug having two young daughters myself

1151
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:42,000
now

1152
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:46,759
question when has Jamaica

1153
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:49,639
ever um taken and held with both hands

1154
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:53,000
an opportunity like this when the people

1155
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:55,960
did not intervene and get radical about

1156
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:00,559
demanding that the government does it so

1157
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:03,760
if we go by our history us sitting down

1158
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,319
discussing it as you all said earlier

1159
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,520
where these things have been done from

1160
00:55:05,318 --> 00:55:12,159
10 15 20 years ago will change very

1161
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:14,519
little I listen carefully to um my

1162
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:17,719
brother from up North who said that the

1163
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:21,639
window closes or or starts to shrink in

1164
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:24,838
about 6 months that means we have to act

1165
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:27,480
now Mr Burke I think you are uniquely

1166
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:30,719
placed and positioned considering the

1167
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:34,960
governing Administration to hang on to a

1168
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:37,838
few persons and say here ye here ye this

1169
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,920
is the chance and the window is closing

1170
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:43,000
so I would really love and know sorry

1171
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:46,760

love at the end of all that is said that

1173
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:53,680
a very clear course is charted as to

1174
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:56,358
tomorrow morning what is it a person

1175
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:58,480
like me who just interested in Jamaica's

1176
00:55:56,358 --> 00:56:01,358
betterment because it is not is not a

1177
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,838
business interest for me it's only about

1178
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,880
what can how can Jamaica benefit in the

1179
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,960
long run so I would want to hear over

1180
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,920
the radio tomorrow morning if I must

1181
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,190
show up down half Tre to help block the

1182
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:17,559
road I'm willing to

1187
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:37,358
[Music]

1188
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:38,640
the thank you very much um good evening

1189
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:43,318
brothers and

1190
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:45,598
sisters um my question is for Paul I

1191
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:49,440
don't know if I heard you

1192
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:53,280
right when you spoke about the size of

1193
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:56,559
the fs are you saying that we should

1194
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,000
limit the production in terms of the

1195
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:01,039
size of the

1196
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,440
Farms are allowing people to have

1197
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:06,640
production just up a certain size I

1198
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,440
would like you to explain

1199
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:12,759
that I have been very

1200
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,559
consistent that in the first years of

1201
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,880
the

1202
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:16,960
industry that you have to allow the

1203
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:21,160
small

1204
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:26,559
farmers they place on the plane field so

1205
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:29,199
they not go home because if the problem

1206
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:32,400
is to make manufactured production or to

1207
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:34,960
go abroad then scales of economy dictate

1208
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,599
that those that own 200 Acres 50 acres

1209
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:43,720
100 acres 500 Acres would be the person

1210
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:46,680
engaged in the contract if you force a

1211
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:50,159
situation where only small farmers can

1212
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:52,759
grow in the first 3 years it means that

1213
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:55,279
who wants to come in the industry has to

1214
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,480
engage a small farmer and not a big

1215
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,880
farmer so that the big farm and the

1216
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:04,440
small farm on the same platform can only

1217
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:07,838
grow one acre 5 Acres whatever the

1218
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:13,159
amount is for the first 3 years then we

1219
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:14,440
can review and decide what is if we ever

1220
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:17,759
make the

1221
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:21,480
mistake of allowing those who have money

1222
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:24,799
to buy a license pay by acreage you're

1223
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:27,599
going to find that this industry is

1224
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:31,119
going to end up for the big big Farmer

1225
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:34,318
and the traditional farmer is going to

1226
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,960
out what people are going to tell us is

1227
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:39,960
that we're going to lose some economic

1228
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:43,119
Advantage so be it economic Advantage

1229
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:45,039
for who the big farm was never

1230
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:49,200
involved I

1231
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:53,160
believe honestly that unless you protect

1232
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:57,159
this small Farmer at the outset he or

1233
00:58:53,159 --> 00:59:01,038
she is going to be a c to

1234
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:04,318
um let me just say this that I been in

1235
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:05,760
farming for a long time very poor person

1236
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:10,599
coming from

1237
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:13,960
Grassroots and I do not think we should

1238
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:15,880
limit the productivity in any area in

1239
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:19,679
agriculture listen to me

1240
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:23,559
carefully I was president of the Jamaica

1241
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:25,759
be Farmers Association B fun be and a

1242
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:27,880
lady came here from New York and she

1243
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,960
said

1244
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:33,200
let me see the kind of honey that you

1245
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:36,838
have and we say okay we know that to

1246
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:40,118
make a l honey is the best so we gave

1247
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:43,880
her a sample to take you know what she

1248
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:47,358
said to us how many trailer loads can

1249
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:49,358
you supply after she tested it we have

1250
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:55,038
not replied

1251
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:57,679
yet you can't so you see 3 years is a

1252
00:59:55,039 --> 01:00:01,599
number of hours we we talking about we

1253
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:05,480
cannot limit productivity for 3 years we

1254
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:07,440
are a country of samples we have to get

1255
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:10,400
out of the idea of saying we are going

1256
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:13,119
to produce this into our home we have to

1257
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:16,160
expand and begin from the beginning if a

1258
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:18,920
big person has a th000 Acres what we

1259
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:22,960
have to do is to make sure he pays tax

1260
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:25,599
like everybody else for the benefit of

1261
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:28,280
the country we cannot small farmers have

1262
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:31,400
to be protect it cuz I am one to you

1263
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:34,480
have to protect the person regulation to

1264
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:37,160
protect but in terms of production if we

1265
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,159
are going to limit it to this small

1266
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:41,199
amount but if the market outside wants

1267
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:43,239
to take the rest of it we have to

1268
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:46,879
produce for the market and the market

1269
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:49,159
wants it here we are Jamaica we I I

1270
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:53,798
agree with you and I believe in

1271
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:55,358
cooperatives 100% I farmed a few so that

1272
01:00:53,798 --> 01:00:56,639
is important we have to protect the

1273
01:00:55,358 --> 01:01:00,279
small farm

1274
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:03,639
but in terms of productivity we have to

1275
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:05,798
make sure that we maximize our efforts

1276
01:01:03,639 --> 01:01:08,598
and there a simple way is to allow

1277
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:11,759
everybody at the same time to increase

1278
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:15,119
the acreage they can grow that is all so

1279
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,599
when you decide it goes from 5 to 10 to

1280
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,200
15 is for

1281
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:22,798
everybody right so as the production

1282
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:24,318
grows you study the market and you say

1283
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:26,838
well everybody know instead of having

1284
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:28,798
one acre 2 acre 3 ACR whatever it is you

1285
01:01:26,838 --> 01:01:31,880
can now go up to five you can now go up

1286
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:33,798
to 10 but it can't be that a big man

1287
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:37,318
because he owns a land and I'm not

1288
01:01:33,798 --> 01:01:40,280
against anybody a big farmer uh can grow

1289
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:42,679
50 acres 100 acres when a small farm

1290
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:46,160
doesn't have that capacity allow

1291
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:48,639
everybody to grow allow them to get land

1292
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:52,679
from the government that is Idle small

1293
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:56,960
farmers and encourage and Empower that

1294
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:59,199
group to grow so we can debating it and

1295
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:04,920
I'm sure we can find a Middle Road

1296
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:08,759
solution okay but there is much cicis in

1297
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:10,519
and I've heard it that small is going to

1298
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:14,160
be sold

1299
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:16,079
out and let me tell you it is going to

1300
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:18,960
be a major

1301
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:22,559
backlash if people in the communities

1302
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:26,720
and across jica feel that now that the

1303
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:28,400
industry is open that is not open and

1304
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:32,318
fair

1305
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,318
term again FS

1306
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:37,598
well might very well be cooperatives but

1307
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:40,038
then that's another Point ton you wanted

1308
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:42,680
to respond I wanted to add to that so

1309
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:45,760
when we talk about he said that we might

1310
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:48,399
be uh limited economically I actually

1311
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:51,359
don't think so I I I think that you can

1312
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,760
do this with a happy medium and they did

1313
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:55,838
this in Colorado too so people that are

1314
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,200
in the industry in Colorado actually had

1315
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:59,719
had to live there and they had to be

1316
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:01,519
residents for many years so you can't be

1317
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:04,038
an owner you can't work in the industry

1318
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:06,920
without have residency so in this

1319
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:09,400
situation when you when and who writes

1320
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:11,200
regulations it's very simple and you say

1321
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:14,880
that you can only hire

1322
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:16,519
local farmers that are certified and

1323
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,119
registered through whatever local

1324
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:21,519
program you would have so therefore

1325
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:24,760
anyone that has whatever size land has

1326
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:27,480
to use local farmers so therefore

1327
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:30,240
everyone that works in farming has a job

1328
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:33,240
so if somebody has a market demand for

1329
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:35,038
something that demands more than 5 Acres

1330
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:37,919
well you have to expand that within the

1331
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:41,119
community so part of what our program

1332
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,599
was about was utilizing 5 10 and 15

1333
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:45,119
acreage and the smaller farmers and

1334
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,079
giving them guidance and giving them

1335
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,760
things for free and supplying them with

1336
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:51,318
the tools the genetics and the

1337
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:54,000
information of how to do it better and

1338
01:03:51,318 --> 01:03:57,119
so forth that increases the value of the

1339
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,960
medicine that increases with the demand

1340
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:01,400
and that increases with the actual

1341
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,278
income which that local farmer will make

1342
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,400
which will then turn around and spend

1343
01:04:03,278 --> 01:04:08,278
that back on the community so I think

1344
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:10,760
you can do it you just have to all

1345
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:13,480
however the system works come together

1346
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:16,720
and figure out how to keep the community

1347
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:18,920
locked and involved some other companies

1348
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:22,239
that will come here and we're what he's

1349
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:24,400
talking about is company's bigger than

1350
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:26,598
what I would be considered and I don't

1351
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:29,240
really consider myself very big big but

1352
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:30,480
somebody like fizer or somebody that

1353
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:34,038
would come in here they would bring

1354
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,400
their own uh system their own labor and

1355
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:37,520
that could happen and you can get

1356
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,880
extorted out of a lot of things and you

1357
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:41,960
want to prevent that and so you have to

1358
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:43,760
figure out mechanisms very simple with

1359
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:49,240
labor and with the

1360
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:49,240
farmers okay we take the next person yes

1361
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:57,359
Gan this is um ganja juice raw ganja

1362
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:57,358
juice and I am SS

1363
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:06,200
help people anyway but

1364
01:05:02,278 --> 01:05:08,159
anyway farmers and protect the farmers

1365
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:12,358
big farmers and

1366
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:12,358
this they have lied

1367
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:20,160
am something like

1368
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:22,798
that think sometime say the citizens

1369
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:25,278
have limited amount of tree where them

1370
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:26,318
can plant one two or tree tree they have

1371
01:05:25,278 --> 01:05:29,559
something like

1372
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:31,798
that no so the citizens can't plant any

1373
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:35,400
amount of tree all citizens no no no

1374
01:05:31,798 --> 01:05:37,798
what what what Mr B was saying Paul get

1375
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:40,599
want get it before in fact in fact

1376
01:05:37,798 --> 01:05:42,880
instead of telling Mr B story I Paul B

1377
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:46,599
say what he wanted

1378
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:49,440
to there are two situations there are

1379
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:52,760
people who want to go into it for bus

1380
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:55,760
yeah and therefore there must be some

1381
01:05:52,760 --> 01:06:00,240
regulatory system how they enter the

1382
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:03,200
business yeah but I believe also that

1383
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:06,719
each and every individual yeah who wants

1384
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:09,838
to grow for their own personal use uhhuh

1385
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:13,879
not for commercial purposes should be

1386
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:18,558
allowed to grow a certain number of PL

1387
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:20,480
and for his her her own personal use I

1388
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:23,680
don't see why somebody who wants to use

1389
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:26,079
it must be forced to go and buy it

1390
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:29,558
perfect so

1391
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:32,960
what is that limited amount you have any

1392
01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:36,720
idea I don't know I would let me I heard

1393
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:40,720
rumors talking about five can I tell

1394
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:44,239
have a view even for the start to allow

1395
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:46,598
people without any license without any

1396
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:49,278
regulation within the confine of their

1397
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:52,359
home boundaries to be able to go at

1398
01:06:49,278 --> 01:06:53,719
least five trees I'm not five trees hold

1399
01:06:52,358 --> 01:06:57,159
on hold on hold

1400
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:58,439
on hold on

1401
01:06:57,159 --> 01:07:03,399
I am

1402
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:05,760
not the number the bigger point is I

1403
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:08,000
don't believe

1404
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,640
yeah we're not talking about those who

1405
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,199
want to grow

1406
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:13,838
commercially so if you want to grow

1407
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:16,318
commercially for

1408
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:19,639
business that's a different

1409
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:22,519
situation I am talking about un

1410
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:26,318
license that people should not have to

1411
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:29,480
go and get a license yeah to grow for

1412
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:32,558
their own personal know

1413
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:34,920

culturally we I like I like deal with

1477
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:53,279
principl

1478
01:10:56,359 --> 01:11:01,039
people we ought to know Atlantis the

1479
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:04,479
people who built Atlantis in Bahamas

1480
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:08,359
they came to Jamaica first we really

1481
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:10,319
have a serious problem with putting off

1482
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:14,079
an almost anti

1483
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:17,639
business we we need to have a culture of

1484
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:21,039
I know it's nice to you know soon come

1485
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:23,520
but everything we seem to do is always

1486
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:25,719
just seem to put up and I think that

1487
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:28,199
somebody suggested block the road that

1488
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:31,279
you know that's one thing but the point

1489
01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:36,039
is that I would really like us as a

1490
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:39,279
culture to get to to to the stage where

1491
01:11:36,039 --> 01:11:41,880
we we demand of our leaders we demand

1492
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:46,319
performance and not talk talk talk talk

1493
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:49,760
talk you know and and and um I I I feel

1494
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:52,559
that what wherever the opportunities

1495
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,840
come up the Avenues we need to do that

1496
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:57,800
we need as a culture maybe doing things

1497
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:59,920
on time and just and just put and just

1498
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,119
said to them you have have you have

1499
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:06,719
spoken

1500
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:08,679
enough we away um too many we away too

1501
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:11,760
many opportunities and I see every day

1502
01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:14,840
anyway that's I agree with you that

1503
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:18,800
there's a fierce urgency of now but I

1504
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:20,279
must suggest that two things one 10

1505
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,920
years ago you and have a scientific

1506
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:25,599
research Council having a meeting like

1507
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:28,119
this where all ideas can contain and the

1508
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:31,600
second thing is that remember that

1509
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:35,158
minister paulw is the patron of the

1510
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:37,360
Cannabis task force so it seems to me

1511
01:12:35,158 --> 01:12:39,638
we're in good hands he's the minister of

1512
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:41,519
science technology energy and Mining

1513
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:44,239
we're making progress but we have to get

1514
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:46,679
it right and we're moving in my view as

1515
01:12:44,238 --> 01:12:48,879
fast as we can I see where courtly Betty

1516
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:53,600
wants to say

1517
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:56,639
something I don't want to be defending

1518
01:12:53,600 --> 01:13:00,000
government but the work that's been done

1519
01:12:56,639 --> 01:13:01,880
by Minister Golding in coming forward in

1520
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,119
starting it's been

1521
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:08,600
slow it has been slow but here's the

1522
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:11,760
other part of it if we don't get it

1523
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:13,679
right then all of this is lost that's

1524
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,679
that's that's my view that's one point

1525
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:19,279
doesn't mean that they haven't been slow

1526
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:22,920
the other part of it is Jamaica

1527
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:24,880
Jamaica from a legal standpoint is

1528
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,399
different from many other places in the

1529
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,159
world

1530
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:34,719
because whether we like to admit it or

1531
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:36,759
not ganja is de facto legal in Jamaica

1532
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:39,639
there is a according to the United

1533
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:42,520
States government there's 35,000

1534
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:46,600
hectares of ganja that's being grown in

1535
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:51,159
Jamaica right now so how do you how do

1536
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:52,560
you try and impose a legal system on

1537
01:13:51,158 --> 01:13:55,198
something that's ingrained in the

1538
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,520
society so there are some cultural in

1539
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:58,719
sensitive years I'm not justifying I'm

1540
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,159
not saying that there are not things

1541
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:04,198
that they could have done but it's not

1542
01:14:01,158 --> 01:14:06,238
as simple as many of us would like to

1543
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:08,238
think from a strictly legal standpoint

1544
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:11,839
from the political standpoint I'll leave

1545
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:15,439
that to others um I'm sorry Courtney and

1546
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:18,480
I are friends colleagues but I have to

1547
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:22,238
disagree fundamentally about getting it

1548
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:25,519
right you can get interm legislation in

1549
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:28,439
place and you can review it in two Fe

1550
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:31,760
time you can allow the growing right now

1551
01:14:28,439 --> 01:14:35,359
for research and development you can a

1552
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:38,760
number of this thing can be done if

1553
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:39,599
there is the political will in less than

1554
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:44,039
a

1555
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:47,120
month the gun Court was put up in seven

1556
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:49,238
days this thing can be done in less than

1557
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:53,679
a month if you're going to wait to cross

1558
01:14:49,238 --> 01:14:55,158
every teeth and D every eye and go to

1559
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:58,560
and you're going to wait another another

1560
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:59,879
a year or two to get that legislation up

1561
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,960
what you need to do is to put in

1562
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:04,480
something interim and have the

1563
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:07,840
consultations with the stakeholders and

1564
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:13,238
you make it you upgrade the law and you

1565
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:17,000
you add whatever it is but I am totally

1566
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:19,879
opposed to this concept of getting it

1567
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:23,639
right because it will by can we get a

1568
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:23,639
grad wrong

1569
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:30,679
under any law we the difficult easy part

1570
01:15:28,439 --> 01:15:33,238
is you can make regulation say listen

1571
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:35,960
not withstanding section so and so we're

1572
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:37,919
allowing so the minister to give

1573
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:41,158
permission blah blah blah can I say one

1574
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:43,199
thing two on that just want to add to it

1575
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:45,799
had some experience with this so United

1576
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:47,319
States moves really slow as well and the

1577
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,560
way they're getting it done is they're

1578
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:52,319
issuing little pieces of paper that are

1579
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:54,760
provisional licenses and they take years

1580
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:59,439
to dot all dot all the eyes and cross

1581
01:15:54,760 --> 01:16:02,480
all all the te's it took them 5 years to

1582
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:05,399
give me not seven licenses I have 19

1583
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:07,599
licenses 5 Years From the time I started

1584
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:10,879
on the floor with three lights they gave

1585
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:13,159
me a little piece of paper that said go

1586
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,719
in the fifth year they finally caught up

1587
01:16:13,158 --> 01:16:18,039
to me and they said well how much

1588
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,039
business did you do
