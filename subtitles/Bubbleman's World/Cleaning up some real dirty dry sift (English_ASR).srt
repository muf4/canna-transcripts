00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,320
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:28,960
uh I was just actually going to clean up

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,159
a little sift that John B brought

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,320
by I've got it right here it's a quite a

6
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,599
low quality I'm not sure what it is but

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,719
it had all this hair in it so before I

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,079
got it onto my screens I figured I was

9
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,879
just going to do a real quick cleaning

10
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,399
out of the hair so I thought you guys

11
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,839
might be interested in it so I'm going

12
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,799
to set the camera up so you can see a

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,199
little bit better you're not going to

14
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:50,599
see my ugly mug but you're going to see

15
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:53,079
what my hands are doing and how we're

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,920
working the the sift through the screen

17
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,878
to fall down on the catch and then

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,760
hopefully be left with the hairs on top

19
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,960
so let's get to

20
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,079
it okay okay so generally what I would

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,519
do in this situation is I would kind of

22
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,118
gently Let It Rain Down you can see it

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,000
uh already leaving quite a bit of dust

24
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:12,759
this is a very large screen so it's not

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,040
a small screen and uh we can use the

26
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,000
brush a little bit to kind of brush it

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,200
through it's going to contaminate the

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,640
brush quite a bit but that's okay I am

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,118
using in a really large amount of sift

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,118
here I wouldn't normally do this but I

31
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,000
thought it would kind of make a neat

32
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:31,719
little video where we just watch all of

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,680
this sift get Works through the

34
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:35,640
screen and eventually be left with just

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,680
the

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,840
hairs which is what should be happening

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,439
here of course I've gone and

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,159
uh I could have showed this same trick

39
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:51,239
with a very small amount

40
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,640
but it's not how Bubble Man rolls is

41
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:57,199
it not

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,200
lately maybe not

smoking drop a little bit there on the

side not overly worried about the

49

this other good sift out of the way too

we don't want that that sort of

contamination now do

60
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,599
we be careful while sifting lowquality

00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,959
sift around your high quality

62
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:44,318
sift wouldn't that be brutal you go to

63
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,199
take a nice rip of your 99% Barb dry

64
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,280
sift and you've got

a final product

it's almost not worth the

it you start seeing the little pieces

the little balls here in the bottom that

80
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:57,879
are not quite breaking up but have like

pressed themselves

to the nitty now almost

done as we get down lower

87
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,478
it's the brush will even push it through

faster when it's a big screen like this

00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,918
you can use the brush if you're going to

00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,839
try to use the brush on the smaller

when they're making the Moroccan hash

how much of this resin and small

particulate is flying around in the

rooms that they're in my nose is so

99
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,240
itchy right now and it's funny cuz

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,759
people often ask me if it's if it if it

101
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,400
gets itchy and I'm usually it doesn't

102

when it's high quality it doesn't at all

103

it's more likely when everything's

it'll make it even more difficult and

116
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:53,879
you'll start seeing contaminants that

would

otherwise be in the hash not that I'd

call this hash just yet let's let's call

wrong with Farmers grade that's what you

00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,038
start with you

125
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,560
know maybe there's something wrong if

126
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,240
you're putting it in your pile as the

your favorite

128
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,120
thing but if you're starting with farmer

129
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,319
grade

130
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,319

00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:09,879
can't really see but it's feeling

135

different under the brush now and it

might look different on the camera as

00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,439
left with this much I thought it would

141
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,480
be more like a small pile but it it does

142
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,880
feel like the majority of what we have

143
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,759
here on

00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:31,240

a

146
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,680
contamination usually the heavier heads

147
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,680
will have fallen down by

148
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,879
now it's not to say you know because

149
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:44,240
it's a big

150
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,000

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,120
to fall

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,278
through but it's not necessarily

153
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,639
something we want to do so I'll take it

154
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,799
down a little bit more see if I can

155
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,519
clean it up a little bit more and then

156
00:09:53,799 --> 00:10:00,319
um yeah it's pretty wild how the

157
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:04,480
consistency has changed completely

158

real terrible quality of that we

166

just took out of that hash and look how

00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,480
much we took out of it that's a fair

in my office is covered in resin I'm

170
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:42,838
going to pick this up this was uh what I

171
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,480
worked through the

172
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:49,880
screen and it's still you know a

173
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,879
terrible quality by by most people's

174
00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:01,720
standards but much cleaner than it

175
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,720
was before we we started the

176
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,759
project not a bad sign that some of the

177
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,760
resin's

178
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,759
sticking

179
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,799
awesome all right so I'll probably get

180
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,039
to screening this uh over the next

181
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:29,838
little bit but for now that was just a

182
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,639
little tip on how you can remove

183
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,200
this unwanted stuff from your

184
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,360
hash I really hope you guys can see the

185
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,399
quality of that and how it's not even

186
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:45,200
hash at all it's a weird like substance

187
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,839
that is not hash anyway thanks for

188
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,240
watching Bubble man's world we'll talk

189
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:55,160
to you

190
