2
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:24,359
hey welcome to bone man's world everyone

3
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:27,570
I am here with yet another unboxing

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,779
video this came from the good folks over

5
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:35,009
at load elapsed I've never actually seen

6
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:36,988
this unit in real life I'd only seen

7
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,259
pictures of it it's sort of an electric

8
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:42,299
dab RIT I wouldn't compare it to the

9
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,530
puff co although I did see them time to

10
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,679
comparing it to the puff Co but I'm

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,450
pretty sure it's a wired device so it

12
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,390
might be more of a comparison to like a

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,300
vapour tail or a unit like that so it's

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,308
supposed to be unit for dabbing it's a

15
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,538
pipe I saw it it looked pretty cool and

16
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:59,849
it looked like something I wanted to

17
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,219
check out so I guess we'll start with a

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,489
small box first probably some of the

19
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:11,939
accessories that came with the unit

20
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:20,070
that's usually how it goes in the front

21
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:22,079
there all right so we've got a dabber I

22
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:26,359
believe it's a glass tapper so you want

23
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:29,759
to be careful with that right there

24
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:32,578
dabber these are gonna be components

25
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,728
that I saw yeah so there's the you piece

26
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:38,188
that goes underneath the pipe I watched

27
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:41,069
on their website at little apps I

28
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:42,868
basically watched the guy you know you

29
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,548
know put it together from right out of

30
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:45,868
the box so hopefully I'll be able to get

31
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,399
this right and I won't have too many

32
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:53,099
pauses in here but I guess we'll see

33
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:55,049
okay so we've got this is the magnetic

34
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,030
Bowl there's also a little nail that

35
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,780
fits in there

36
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,640
we're seeing it's probably in here so

37
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,868
I'm not even sure how this thing works I

38
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,728
don't know if it's the nail that's

39
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:07,040
conducting the heat and create like I

40
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:08,389
really I'm not too sure what the design

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,050
of the pipe is even though I've seen it

42
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:15,199
on video I haven't seen it in person so

43
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:17,390
okay and then there's that all right

44
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,899
just the L must be with the other stuff

45
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:24,129
so I'll keep this stuff separate and

46
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,129
then we'll open up the big box

47
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:44,798
okay here we go nice looks like a box

48
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:51,299
with inbox shipping details interesting

49
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:51,299
slow case little labs doing it upright

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:14,090
and to read this first excellent right

51
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,860
huh

52
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,870
might as well crack open that accessory

53
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:23,570
stand nice little wood stand - I suppose

54
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:26,080
hold these components I'm not even sure

55
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:28,729
if that's what that's for or not

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,240
probably not these this must be for the

57
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:35,030
dabber and of course all right so put

58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,650
that there so let me just guess this is

59
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,449
probably just an empty case that the

60
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,330
piece goes and oh yeah look at that

61
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:44,179
as keys it has nice high-density foam

62
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:47,390
cut into it for all of the components so

63
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,430
that is a pretty nice touch I'm not

64
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:51,739
gonna lie right off the bat I remember

65
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,349
seeing this you want to push out the box

66
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,930
to remove the sleeve it's nice to watch

67
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:59,000
these videos I have to admit I know that

68
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,689
their video was probably oh there's a

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,539
picture of the unit right there actually

70
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:07,129
so it's nice to have these unboxing

71
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:08,929
videos and I'm sure they did a much

72
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:10,939
better job at it than I am

73
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,800
but hey I might have different people

74
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:15,439
and it might be still nice for you guys

75
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,560
to see so rather than just send you over

76
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,870
there you can watch this one and then

77
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,720
you can go over there and watch a proper

78
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,310
unboxing video

79
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,530
alright the two sub sectors are in the

80
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,550
black the two susceptor are in the black

81
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:33,849
silicone carry case alright thank you so

82
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:42,220
let's see this cut out really well

83
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:42,220
there's your base and here's your glass

84
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,530
and then there's your silicone cases as

85
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:53,339
well as more of these little guys in the

86
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:57,809
dabbers and a pipe cleaner which is

87
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:59,369
always nice okay so that's what they're

88
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,360
talking about the susceptor so I guess

89
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:06,780
these are little nails so these are the

90
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,470
nails and then okay I got all of these

91
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:12,659
other components again as well all right

92
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:17,520
so let's start with moving this over

93
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:21,570
here I know that how they started was by

94
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,909
unscrewing the bottom the grommets

95
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:27,589
already in so that was not in in the

96
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,590
actual original

97
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:51,550
such a strange angle for this

98
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,490
I think that's right I head over to the

99
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,679
glottal labs okay that's the step by

100
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,978
step you must season the magnetic nail I

101
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:16,709
do remember that I remember this part

102
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:18,659
goes in here so this little part comes

103
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:39,359
off this is the little guy you will

104
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:51,440
slide this into there some paper this

105
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:51,439
will click just make sure that's right

106
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:58,439
all right so we got that figured out

107
00:06:55,529 --> 00:07:00,448
basically the grommet was put in the

108
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,459
wrong way when it came so I confused me

109
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:04,770
I went and watched and now it makes

110
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:06,359
sense I've got the little u pipe

111
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:08,069
actually it was another one so this

112
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,288
little guy goes under here

113
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:12,569
the long piece goes right into the

114
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:15,538
center and the short piece goes into the

115
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:17,459
grommet that this Center cut a piece of

116
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:20,158
glass that slides down into there making

117
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:23,819
it so you basically have an all glass on

118
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:26,839
glass on glass hit so we put the base on

119
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:29,339
there and put the bottom of the unit on

120
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,959
which is fine that's good now we're

121
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:33,209
gonna want to put water on here you put

122
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:40,129
water up to about a third of the way

123
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:40,129
down put a little water in there

124
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:52,980
oh that's just about perfect right there

125
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:55,349
okay then we're going to drop this

126
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,569
little guy on right so that goes on top

127
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:00,090
of that then you have this little a

128
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:01,860
guest titanium nail that's open on one

129
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:04,859
end and closed on the other and it goes

130
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,480
inside this little piece of glass and

131
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,660
that little piece of glass goes right

132
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:15,090
there and then yeah I guess you get your

133
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:17,730
pipe right there and your pipe cleaners

134
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:19,399
and your little Gabor's and then it's

135
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:22,200
just a matter of pulling out our

136
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:26,310
electronic components for this little

137
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:28,259
bit and pull up a chair and sit and have

138
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,709
a quick down with you guys see how this

139
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:33,509
unit works I'm always excited for new

140
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:36,809
technologies when it comes to dabbing

141
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:39,330
always always interested to see what

142
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,859
people are working on I always think

143
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,400
that the next best thing is right around

144
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,230
the corner so not to you know not pay

145
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,319
close attention to the works that people

146
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:52,379
are doing and so little labs caught my

147
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:56,000
attention with this little unit soon

148
00:08:52,379 --> 00:09:00,870
enough we will have an idea

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,460
so all right right in the front there's

150
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:09,120
a push on the button let's got a light

151
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:17,820
and then I guess blue being the coldest

152
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:20,279
and pink being the warmest there we go

153
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,440
maybe didn't goes to red yeah it does go

154
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,419
to red so you can see that tiny little

155
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,930
bit of smoke that just came out that's

156
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:29,429
that little bit of that little bit of

157
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:30,959
seasoning that's coming off the nail

158
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:33,120
anytime you've ever used any type of

159
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,090
metal component you know that it's a

160
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,730
good idea to make sure that that is

161
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:40,649
clean before you start hitting it so the

162
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,720
way it said on the well it says right

163
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:44,490
here important make sure to turn legend

164
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,300
on and off for each session Oh before

165
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,310
using legend

166
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,500
must season the magnetic nail the

167
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:51,539
susceptor to do this turn the dial to

168
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,129
red and leave it on for 15 to 20 seconds

169
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:56,069
let it cool for five minutes and then

170
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:58,169
you're ready to begin alright make sure

171
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,940
you turn legend on and off for each

172
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:01,439
session legend their legend heats

173
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,329
extremely fast the biggest mistake many

174
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,760
users make is leaving it on for too long

175
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:09,899
five to ten seconds is all you need okay

176
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:11,639
so let's cool that down yeah it's got

177
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:17,958
quite a coil that's wrapped around here

178
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:17,958
so I'm gonna pull up a chair down here

179
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:26,810
you probably wait that five minutes and

180
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:26,810
then I've got some flavors right here

181
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:32,909
I'll be starting on the lowest temp for

182
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:36,120
this particular unit oh it's got a great

183
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:38,219
little great little how-to book that

184
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,220
shows you know in really nice clean

185
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,278
photographs shows the whole process I

186
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:51,389
mean this is simple simple simple I like

187
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:53,309
this okay power level zero blue no heat

188
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:56,129
level one a little darker than Purple's

189
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:58,349
level two much more purple is level

190
00:10:56,129 --> 00:11:00,809
three than sort of a pinkish is level

191
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,500
four then we're getting into red level

192
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:06,509
five and then almost a Horan's level six

193
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,399
so also there's error modes if you leave

194
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:10,528
the magnetic nail out I guess what

195
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,328
happens is you don't get that heat it

196
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:14,429
doesn't heat up and it'll start flashing

197
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:16,349
on you so it'll flash orange three times

198
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:19,379
when it's over temperature it'll flash

199
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,839
orange until susceptor is inserted when

200
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,939
you leave that out so so also Bluetooth

201
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,860
you can Bluetooth download the app press

202
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,360
and hold button on legend legend will

203
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,220
enter pairing mode and flash a teal blue

204
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,769
color the legend will hold a solid teal

205
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,070
blue color when the device pairs well we

206
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:37,370
gotta do that I gotta get my phone

207
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:41,250
alright so let's go see if we can't find

208
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:43,049
the app the app amok slow control of

209

00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,389
waiting for this to cool anyway right

224
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:31,559
now so this will download after

225
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:33,028
downloading the app and following the

226
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:34,739

227
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:36,419
phone press and hold down button on

228
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,339

and flash a teal blue color the legend

230
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,630
will hold a solid teal blue color when

231
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:45,629
the device pairs well let's see how easy

232
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:47,600
that is so far it's been very easy

233
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:56,009
I guess I'll create an account why not

234
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:56,579
let's do this let's be bubble man let's

235
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:01,350
do it

236
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:03,269
alright oh yeah you got to put the what

237
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,649
here that's funny I just put bubble man

238
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:10,709
I didn't I put bc bo man I didn't put I

239
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:14,399
didn't actually put at icloud.com

240
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:16,679
just definitely good to have so now

241
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,269
we're gonna sign in that was very easy

242
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,309
to set up I don't have to wait for them

243
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:23,459
to send me in an email or anything like

244
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:25,919
that they let me pick my own password

245
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:27,119
fast enough and I guess they're a new

246
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,799
enough company that all the names

247
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,049
haven't been taken yet so that's time

248
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,049
nice okay so we're gonna hold this down

249
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:45,930
alright so there we go connect to

250
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:49,039
legends we are connecting a pair yes

251
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:51,750
pair we want to pair with this guy

252
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:56,730
register this legend yes name your

253
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:58,528
legend bubble man's bubble man's legend

254
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:02,009
then there it is now I've got my legend

255
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:02,809
here she's all paired up I can put it on

256
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,980
what

257
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:08,119
I want easy enough that's pretty cool

258
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:12,470
now I'm definitely controlling this

259
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:14,600
thing I want to do a fairly low temp tab

260
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,879
but I don't want to do a cold down I

261
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,750
don't want to do a super hot down so

262
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:22,490
they didn't say it was 10 seconds of us

263
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:25,399
let's see what this thing can do but

264
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,589
they give me a carb cap it must have a

265
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:31,159
carb cap right like I can't really

266
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:35,080
imagine that not having a carb chat let

267
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:35,079
me see if you missed the carbon cap

268
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:44,019
maybe this works carb free let's try it

269
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,019
out shall we

270
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:17,820
oh it was interesting I've never hit on

271
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:21,100
a pipe before that didn't have a carb

272
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:25,540
that actually still hit pretty damn good

273
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:28,240
now I think I heated it up a little bit

274
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:30,610
too much I think I'm gonna even go for a

275
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,690
lower down but one of the things I read

276
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,480
in the book is that it gets up to

277
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:38,950
temperature very fast 5 to 10 seconds so

278
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,960
I suspect this unit is a unit that you

279
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,850
want to have your dad ready when you

280
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,889
turn it on almost like the dream

281
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:48,040
cold-start unit and that's what I'm

282
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:50,949
gonna do for the next tab because I know

283
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:52,629
I've hit this resident enough that it it

284
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,920
just had a little bit of a different

285
00:15:52,629 --> 00:16:00,340
taste almost like it got heated up to

286
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:02,740
750 degrees instead of 680 and lately

287
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,769
because I've got the temp tech USA I've

288
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:09,129
really been paying Louis attention to

289
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:11,079
the taste of the hit and associating it

290
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:14,049
with that actual temperature of that hit

291
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,960
so definitely got nice and lit off that

292
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:20,669
hit that's for sure let's let's go again

293
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,670
and let's go almost right away this time

294
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:41,230
oh yeah that tasted fire

295
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:51,309
yeah I got a car of mine got it

296
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:06,649
important for the low temp dabber make

297
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:08,900
sure you turn it off right away because

298
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,480
as fast as you're getting it it's

299
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,970
heating up and so I think this unit is

300
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,730
pretty damn cool I love the way it's

301
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,900
different you know you know it's still a

302
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,400
pipe but it's a little bit different

303
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,189
than what most people have been coming

304
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,449
out with oh yeah that's magnetic that

305
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:25,429
holes right in there and that's real

306
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:27,470
nice that just pulls right out and this

307
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:30,410
will be super easy to flip and clean so

308
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:33,650
actually see how hot that is not too bad

309
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:36,769
I did have q-tips I was going to use but

310
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:39,230
I'll just do that later on pretty cool

311
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:41,000
little unit all around I like the feel

312
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,470
of it I like that it's different and

313
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,539
then it's not that same old same old

314
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,460
bomb I feel like people who are new to

315
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:49,428
cannabis and maybe new to dabbing might

316
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,470
find this of interest really clean unit

317
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:54,640
the glass just goes on and off real

318
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:57,200
simple real easy to turn on and off and

319
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,020
you know works obviously with any dabber

320
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,090
that you have you know not too shabby I

321
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:05,420
think that getting a great-tasting head

322
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:07,250
out of this probably won't take me much

323
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,610
longer than three or four more hits even

324
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,289
my second hit was just tremendous and

325
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:13,669

326
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:14,928
towards the end of it so for those of

327
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,120

taste it you know that cold start where

329
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,019
you really get that enjoyable rip but

330
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:23,150

331
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:24,679

a low temperature I didn't go up to read

333
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,179

334
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:30,710
thousand degrees at read probably

335

342
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:47,569

343
