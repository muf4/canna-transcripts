Day two of or day one of Spanibus. Day

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,920
two or three of hanging out in HQ.

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,239
Exactly. That's what's happening here.

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
That's what I say. So, I missed Spanabis

8
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:48,078
today. I I went too late. Couldn't get

9
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:51,199
in. So, I came back to HQ. Uh David had

10
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,160
um the banger or sorry, the quartz bowl

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,640
and the coil as well as the plug from

12
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,238
Dabinator. Thank you, Dabinator. Um,

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,759
because of it, I'm able to take dabs

14
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,000
right now without my ship blowing up.

15
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,280
So, that's very uh appreciative. And

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,079
we're just hitting some lovely

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,280
flavors. Got a little devil's

18
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,719
fruit, a little of the no-name. Which

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,599
one was yours again called? Uh, no name

20
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,519
monster dry sift. Oh, wow. Yeah, that's

21
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,759
tasty and heady. We got a little dab

22
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,438
over here. And we're with Phil. Phil's

23
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,439
with us, too. What's up, Phil? How's it

24
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,279
going, dude? It's going good. Have they

25
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,798
found your luggage yet? No, my luggage

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,478
is still lost. So, they lost your

27
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,720
luggage. It's in the abyss. But not my

28

bubble bags with some some of Mark's

29
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,158
bubble bags, but that's okay. But not

30
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,199
most of them. You had most of them in

31
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,920
the carry-on. Yep. I was smart. That's

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,560
awesome. All right. Well, here. Let's

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,759
give you a big dab, Phil. All right. Not

in the door really. We stopped right at

in the building right now and don't know

aspects of coming to

doesn't last and at the end of the

night can't get the juice. Got to get

69

the juice early. Early bird gets the

a drink like this, not just a pop. You

We're going to make some rosin from uh

106
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,679
some flowers here, I guess. Going to

107
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,439
make rosin with the reverend. What is

108
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,120
it? The panamese. I think we're going to

109
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,240
do this panamese. Yeah, this was really

110

Everyone just looked at it and was like,

111
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,879
"Ooh, ah, that's nice." Yeah, let's do

112
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,918
that. So, it doesn't look like there's

00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:22,240

messed up and put it far

away. Um, I do have No, that's not an

121
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:48,719

Yeah. No, I didn't see the light. Yeah,

136
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,080
it's working. No, I even mean that

137
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,800
light. The green light glowing out of

138
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,639
the white box. But yeah, that red light

139

is definitely on. Okay, so that's

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,280
what are we doing here, Jeff? Are we

of the panamese. Kind of a micro one.

160
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,239

longer. Yeah. You want to collect that

162

first? Yeah. Yeah.

165
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,319
hold it up against the edge of the dail

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,320
or the dabinator.

168
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:17,080
squeezing the rosin out. How's it going,

169
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,080
dude? Good to see you, man.

170
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:28,000
It usually picks up pretty nice, I find.

171
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,919
Yeah,

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,159
pretty nice. You know, we got a nice

173
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:35,120
little dab here. Sometimes it doesn't

174
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,838
pick up really well if uh

175
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,000
It's really really tiry and then it just

176
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
wants to stick on the paper. I kind of

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,679
snap pick it up. I kind of push the

178
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,000
dapper down and just pick it up and it

179
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,479
works pretty darn good.

[Music]

181
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,200
Got a little dab. Take a dab. Dab right

182
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,199
there.

183
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,800
Little bit of

184
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah, it's yours. I think you should hit

185
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:02,439
it. Yeah. Let us know how the uh how the

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,120
Panamese dabs again. He's dabbing

187
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,160
Panamese. piece right here as well.

188
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,399
What's the

189
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:13,399
quartz? Is it quartz? What's the other

190
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,399
kind?

191
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,560
Silicon. It's a high-end ceramic.

192
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,399
How's that? It's really nice with

193
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,879
sapphire insert especially. It's even

194
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,879
like more spectacular.

195
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,278
Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Should we go buy

196
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,360
a pound of the Panamese?

197
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:39,759
I don't know. We should squish some more

198
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,440
buds and find out. I like it. Excellent.

199
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,958
Should I squish it again? Well, my

200
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,000
brother's been doing it with all his dry

201
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:49,278
suits. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, I mean,

202
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,159
you just use the screen and I've got,

203
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:55,838
you know, 25 micron screen is uh is what

204
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:58,399
I used from the bubble bag set. So, you

205
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:03,120
turn like some like some low grade like

206
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:05,440
some B or Craig into smokeful A grade.

207
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,039
into a dabable product. Even I saw that

208
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,090
on Hash. Yeah. Hash church. You saw me

209
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,759
on Hash Church.

[Music]

211
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,759
I like the concept. Pretty much squeezed

212
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,519
most of it out on that first shot there.

213
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,120
It happens like that sometimes. Eh, that

214
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,120
was a nice from a little bud. Yeah.

215
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,120
Yeah.

216
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:39,879
Any more squishing to come?
