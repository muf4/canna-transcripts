1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:23,000
[Music]

2
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,380
because we've done this before one cake

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,050
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

4
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:31,559
I'm here with Horatio Delbert and we are

5
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,600
at the CC HQ vapor lounge on the second

6
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,850
floor nice private place for us to shoot

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,338
today yeah you know I wanted to get

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,679
together and celebrate major victory in

9
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:42,960
Canada I mean it's for the most part

10
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,729
it's status quo NBC but for all of our

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,429
brethren around the country on they get

12
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:50,488
to explore something new it's he was

13
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:53,939
down it's huge what of course Horatio

14
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:57,298
was talking about is the Smith versus

15
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,579
Regina case Owen Smith and Ted Smith who

16
00:00:57,298 --> 00:01:01,768
was the owner of the dispensary that the

17
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,469
bakery was working for at the time of

18
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:06,929
the initial bust a couple years ago the

19
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:09,030
judge struck down the word dried out of

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,820
dried marijuana and he changed the

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,430
definition of just us being allowed to

22
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,709
have cannabis into being able to have

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,689
anything cannabis so when you remove the

24
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:23,129
word dried in the novel sudden it stops

25
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:25,078
seeds resin leaves any part of the plant

26
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:27,478
whatsoever so that was two years ago for

27
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:29,728
BC the judge decided it was only for BC

28
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,188
guys like myself when I go back home to

29
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:33,780
Manitoba I was unable to bring hash back

30
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:35,938
there I was only allowed to travel with

31
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,769
herb in the vaporizer so when I leave to

32
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,408
go to Manito

33
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:41,090
the end of this month you've damn sure

34
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,710
I'm going to be bringing some extra is a

35
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,930
different world same thing with me

36
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:46,188
traveling to Ontario it stings for a lot

37
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,890
of people that move out to the west

38
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:52,008
coast but at the same time Ontario is

39
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:54,890
that East Coast hub and it's where you

40
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:56,629
are going to get to that crowd and it's

41
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,179
funny about what we take a stand in

42
00:01:56,629 --> 00:02:00,798
medicine I saw a news article where it

43
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:03,560
was like someone was caught with four

44
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,590
grams of shatter this stuff is potent

45
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,420
bandits and it was made and to get just

46
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,060
with it turned it right back into crack

47
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:12,859
right and now I can see the you know

48
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,170
that person's case being overturned that

49
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,819
thumb got arrested for it and the whole

50
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:19,099
police division that was kind of gearing

51
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:21,798
up for um cracking heads on the subject

52
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:24,259
matter I mean the way to go it's a very

53
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:26,599
important decision nonetheless the best

54
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:29,239
analogy I've ever heard Kirk use was in

55
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,609
the what was the court case after the

56
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,379
fed the first one and and before the

57
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,269
Supreme there was three judges and it

58
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:37,009
was here that was art was in our

59
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:38,689
medieval Supreme Court yeah maybe that

60
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:40,699
was our provincial Supreme Court so at

61
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:42,439
that --cork a skirt to saw said

62
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:44,839
something absolutely brilliant and it

63
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:46,489
really I saw the sparkle in the judges

64
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,170
eye I'm sure it's where the dissent came

65
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:50,120
from and I'm sure it's how he got to the

66
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:52,759
Supreme Court and it's when he mentioned

67
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,879
that under the current regime we are

68
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,949
allowed to like an elder elderly woman

69
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,810
can acquire cannabis and it's legal for

70
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:03,009
her to have that but if she takes that

71
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:06,140
cannabis and steeps it in a cup of tea

72
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:08,719
she's now done an extraction and she's

73
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:11,119
now looking at potentially a mandatory

74
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,340
minimum of two years in prison she

75
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,159
became a manufacturer just by simply

76
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,079
getting closer to her passing and that's

77
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,299
how they had it worded but in reality

78
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:22,400
the judge didn't see that

79
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,219
as her becoming a manufacturer he saw

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,159
that as a flawed law that was written in

81
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:30,169
a way that had to be changed and so that

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,729
change has come we are now able to use

83
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:34,699
extracts right across the board in

84
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:37,489
Canada and unfortunately it's really

85
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:40,489
only for the 40,000 of patients under

86
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,650
the MMAR program and I suppose it'll be

87
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,810
their discomfort the MMPR patients but

88
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,490
it doesn't give them access it doesn't

89
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,460
give them access that's the key right

90
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:53,330
there the MMPR patients can take their

91
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:55,430
product and they can get who knows who

92
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,680
to make it I don't know if I'm legally

93
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,629
allowed to make it if for a sheõs are we

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,250
allowed to have a lab and make products

95
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:02,509
for people we don't know right now we're

96
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,669
allowed to make them for ourselves

97
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:06,169
horatio obviously goes out of his way

98
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:08,000
and makes them for people because he

99
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:09,379
believes that you know helping people

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,870
that are sick is the right thing to do

101
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:14,060
and I sort of I stand behind him that

102
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,160
firmly but at the same time we have

103
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,079
families we have wives and we have

104
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,209
children and we have things that we need

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,939
to protect while we're doing this sort

106
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,459
of good work yeah it's it's one of those

107
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:28,399
I mean even congratulations all the M&amp;P

108
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:31,039
are people who some of them pay the

109
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,870
price some of them use it to engage the

110
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,670
dispensaries so currently that's the

111
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,100
only model where dispensaries are

112
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,379
available that MMPR people have been

113
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,270
able to find access but again that

114
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,089
access is technically legal still

115
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:45,680
because there's no such thing as a

116
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:48,319
designated processor we're already other

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,389
type of term like that and we don't

118
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,159
exactly have that type of back and forth

119
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,550
infrastructure but for somebody in

120
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,230
Manitoba you can always get online maybe

121
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,389
it's time to order yourself a bubble bag

122
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,600
kit on you can start to convert your

123
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:05,180
stuff up but on a scale that actually

124
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,530
deals with you could almost say type 1

125
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,709
patients patients who are either

126
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:12,168
physically unable to actively do

127
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:14,060
anything um mr. Bay tries to keep

128
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:15,889
whether it's the fakirs fine or they're

129
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,019
in a condition of such terminology that

130
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:19,789
thumbed they can barely get justice or

131
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:22,099
something down they require to be make

132
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,439
they're gonna need help and eventually

133
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,730
somebody it's like I see this happening

134
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:28,399
all over again with somebody

135
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,020
reaching out getting caught and then we

136
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,089
end up in a challenge when it comes to

137
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:35,120
um the right to produce for someone else

138
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:36,379
because of that same eventually the

139
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,090
government become aware of the unique

140
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:40,189
talents that it takes degree of some of

141
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:41,959
these medicines absolutely some of those

142
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:44,180
unique talents are sitting right here at

143
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,709
this table right now one of the things I

144
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,810
wanted to mention while Horatio was

145
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:50,209
talking about the ability to make your

146
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,870
own hash bubble bags is going to be

147
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:55,659
offering a 25% discount to all MMAR and

148
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,970
MMPR

149
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,950
patients that would like to get into

150
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,410
water extraction you can go to bubble

151
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:06,439
bag comm and you can use the code health

152
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:09,020
canada that'll be the code for the 25%

153
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:11,329
discount off of bubble bank kits and

154
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:16,549
machines so we're always down with

155
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:19,129
giving discounts alright i guess to

156
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,069
start the commemoration of extracts

157
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:25,069
let's start with an extraction of our

158
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:27,288
main ingredient THC a so we're gonna

159
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:31,370
start with the main ingredient a ratio

160
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:35,689
has done a fine extraction here done

161
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:39,038
some pure THC a that's the THC acid it

162
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:41,990
has not been heated so this is the

163
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:45,918
carboxylic acid ring still intact and

164
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,408
it's very very very white and I'm

165
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,228
guessing

166
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:50,908
has pretty much knows no older give it a

167
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:53,488
go and see where breath that's kind of

168
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:55,558
why I said last time I'm not high purity

169
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:59,938
but I'm not going around thumping on any

170
00:06:55,559 --> 00:07:03,319
chest but pretty close to odorless I

171
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:09,869
mean the tiniest little bit of that

172
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:12,479
University the limine valencian mm-hmm

173
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:14,429
but really like it's just funny because

174
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,738
I've seen so many people that all we've

175
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:18,808
got pure and they'll somebody 98 percent

176
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:20,968
and it's the yellow it's still got

177
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:24,360
discoloration so it seems as you get

178
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:26,038
closer and closer one percent I mean I

179
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,588
know this is a couple of notches

180
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:31,738
brighter than the previous incarnation

181
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:35,550
so on the next question is how much

182
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:38,248
stronger is it if you keep removing that

183
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,019
contaminated the adults all right

184
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,759
so okay here's the question did you want

185
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:44,189
to hear that hit that off of the

186
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,389
Sapphire insert on the shelf or do you

187
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,599
want to go right into the silicon

188
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:50,668
carbide bit well in this case it's not

189
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:53,038
really like we're going for flavor here

190
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:54,808
and one thing I noticed and it was a

191
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,788
definite notice is remember we made that

192
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:59,729
anecdote about it it kind of having a

193
00:07:56,788 --> 00:08:03,300
slow kind of standardized melt to it it

194
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:05,428
got even slower with on that subtlety on

195
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,050
to find out so I've actually been

196
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:09,598
hitting it hotter oh so find I can't

197
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,728
finish now what time are you thinking on

198
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,709
my home nail they looked about 400

199
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:15,359
Celsius so I have a feeling if it's a

200
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,728
percent we're already good to go it's at

201
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,769
about 680 Fahrenheit right now yeah that

202
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:21,038
sir that should be fine did you want to

203
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:23,379
go direct into the cell

204
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,088
or put this afire additional because it

205
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,619
doesn't matter to me I don't mind going

206
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,778
to write come to the silicon I just kind

207
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:30,879
of want to see it yeah but are you down

208
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:34,769
with that you're up to your head

209
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,769
the hardest thing is the balance

210
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,120
No

211
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:09,699
interesting

212
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,649
I found it I mean I white them announcer

213
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,160
sitting in the Sun but it's not as bland

214
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:18,039
as historically described I guess maybe

215
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:20,769
they took sativas for granted but WBC I

216
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:23,230
don't get many upper aggressions that

217
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:37,509
aren't hybrids it's completely invisible

218
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:39,879
on the nail well that was interesting

219
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:45,370
hard to explain almost no taste

220
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:50,049
whatsoever effects are absolutely there

221
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:52,480
but they are very one-dimensional you

222
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:54,399
know as I sit here and feel the effects

223
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,930
trying to slowly curl up behind my eyes

224
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:00,629
and I feel the effects a little bit in

225
00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:03,849
my body I definitely feel like

226
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:05,980
please would probably get too too

227
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,110
focused on hitting Pierre TFC all the

228
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,909
time might not a specific range for

229
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,250
something well the thing about it is

230
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:14,860
isn't it son amendment it is basically

231
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:17,460
in a way to rev it out because now let's

232
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:21,159
say we jump over and take it down about

233
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:23,290
some Sour Diesel how well that basically

234
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:25,209
we're bringing these terms to the THC in

235
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,339
their system right that's all because we

236
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,650
know that basically you never know what

237
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,780
the team she was genetically growing in

238
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:34,090
the potential of the Terps so I'm

239
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:37,449
throwing a little rosin sativa behind it

240
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:40,570
it might give it the final run of gas it

241
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:45,520
means but that how was this name on

242
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:48,790
that's rosin Oh rosin from dry sens

243
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,370
just a little rosin from dry sent us you

244
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:52,889
know how it goes rosin from dry said

245
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,269
that's who I am

246
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:57,509
the spirit boys I got this bear suit

247
00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:02,199
well that's great that looks like a

248
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:04,330
potent stuff so yeah let's put that's

249
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,129
kind of why everyone Google wanna make

250
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,940
be super high on like well you still

251
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:13,600
need a turf either in your system before

252
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:15,010
or after but that whole recipe I mean my

253
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,690
analogies always been Terps in two

254
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:18,519
directions some directions can take you

255
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,890
know where some directions can take you

256
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,500
around the world but the THC is the gas

257
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,710
and we don't always have enough gas to

258
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,600
get to amazing

259
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,940
smells amazing but it didn't produce

260
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,800
that punch all those directions all

261
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,320
extended an amazing trip and it doesn't

262
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,479
yield the actual high so I'm looking at

263
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,129
ways to pretty much bring every straight

264
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,409
into its full potential the only thing I

265
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:42,419
can't do is make more tours right but I

266
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:47,100
can't bring well I'll tell you the pure

267
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:49,469
THC a is very almost just like I said

268
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,450
one dimensional heavy it sort of could

269
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,220
almost get you just staring and I love

270
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,560
the effects in the past when we've taken

271
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,200
the terpenes and modulated that THC and

272
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,819
really felt the uplifting of facts I'm

273
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,800
almost like the feeling of smelling a

274
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,400
flower are squeezing cement and psmith

275
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:07,199
and smelling some mint david malan

276
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,049
olivine and the house here guys can i

277
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,730
plug my new book please dinner mana free

278
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:14,129
copies for all potter activists and

279
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:17,610
otherwise it's 8 bucks it's the answer

280
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:20,009
to the question this cannabis inherently

281
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,680
harm young pieces developing minds the

282
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:24,569
answer the short answer is no one of the

283
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:28,199
reasons I know that is because when I

284
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:30,900
came to BC I came from London and like

285
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,120
everyone I had an internal instinct to

286
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:36,629
I'm to Burnaby Mountain and walked he

287
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,210
sings all the way to here and I only use

288
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:40,679
serve for some of the more life-changing

289
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,570
experiences of my life

290
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,339
oh thank then what you provided at the

291
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,180
herb school during that era did the

292
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:50,580
Hurstville was legit

293
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:52,349
upper level next-level [ __ ] it dung it

294
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,540
paid a critical point in many people's

295
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,420
development - you're looking at one of

296
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:59,849
them today I had some unique psychedelic

297
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:02,250
trips that I would never have safe

298
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,100
access to anything like it in any way I

299
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:07,320
could trust that changed my life in

300
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,750
significant ways that your mushrooms

301
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,000
play a major role in my luck we had some

302
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,860
fine fungi today yeah good positivity

303
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,009
that's how it goes I remember the year

304
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,389
at school back in the day and I remember

305
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:21,188
she's what was the place that you opened

306
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:23,589
after the Erb school where you were so

307
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:26,740
nervous we thought in Burnaby oh jeez

308
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:29,439
both the Burnaby operation was back in

309
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,209
97 yeah with the game Yogi's that was

310
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:32,889
yeah that was predate service going when

311
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,778
he's like oh that was close those Dutch

312
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:37,810
embassy flower and achievers yeah

313
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:39,639
because we figured well we're gonna get

314
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:41,198
arrested myself a funny medium and one

315
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,299
that makes people think at the same time

316
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,278
the embassy kind of you've always got

317
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:47,258
great names I only just recently before

318
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,429
the accident that you're spotted someone

319
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,528
told me that you opened this place

320
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:53,828
called stressed and stressed in two

321
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:55,419
breaths yeah great [ __ ] names about

322
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:58,208
it sorry I broke the national

323
00:13:55,419 --> 00:14:00,639
perspective on what a dispensary or what

324
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:02,739
a place that yeah example medicine is

325
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,980
medicine can also be for the relatively

326
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,990
healthy so trends it I drove under the

327
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:13,240
retro box I even know the name I just

328

for Malmo Levine cannabis activist here

00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:27,169
in Vancouver we're coming at us like I

423
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:31,700
can say I can remember way back in like

424
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:34,580
96 97 you know no one all of these guys

425
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:37,009
Dana and Marg and David and Chris

426
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:39,769
Bennett and yeah just it's been a long

427
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:42,019
time that we've been actively promoting

428
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:43,669
this agenda here in Vancouver so what

429
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:45,200
I'm seeing with a lot of different

430
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:47,720
characters changing the rules as well

431
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,100
absolutely dave was a frontliner he's

432
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,069
always he's never been afraid to get

433
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:53,329
arrested he's always really been just

434
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:55,519
like Horatio said like he definitely

435
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:57,439
deserves that sort of level commands a

436
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,569
level of respect over the years for what

437
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,340
he's done and for the way he's held his

438
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:01,999
you know putting himself right on the

439
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:05,329
front lines

440
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:08,089
absolutely and often to figure out other

441
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:09,618
ways to sell herb get herb to the people

442
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:11,028
you know like the minute I saw the names

443
00:19:09,618 --> 00:19:12,109
stressed and depressed I just thought

444
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:15,200
that's something different

445
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:18,288
that's not just your average that's not

446
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,240
recreational that's that's we need yeah

447
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:23,079
mine whatever one weed was called stress

448
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,960
because that's what you used it for and

449
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:29,028
then there was weed that was stress I

450
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,829
had a great hit on that Sour Diesel I

451
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:34,148
discovered that's why I feel like when

452
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:37,009
you pair it with more THC back to back

453
00:19:34,148 --> 00:19:39,528
it creates you more some of the

454
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,509
experience in typical so it's really

455
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:44,749
something you shouldn't need a lot of to

456
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:47,120
take strains further and further so get

457
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:49,220
it again and then like then hit the tee

458
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,109
CA and see if the rush is the

459
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,808
one-dimensional orchids more like this

460
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:56,569
our diva I'm gonna throw this sapphire

461
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:58,190
do it I got the sapphire on the there's

462
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:59,960
a little shelf here that this thing goes

463
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:05,090
on if I can get it on without burning

464
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:07,160
myself there we go

465
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:08,959
I guess they should know what a nice

466
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,390
cold sapphire hit might be unique as

467
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,130
well go for well not all over the town

468
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,490
do it up inside well that's what I'm

469
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:20,080
saying

470
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:20,079
right are you a little change

471
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:42,719
oh you're getting another one of those

472
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:44,308
stretches see how we're just on the

473
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,000

480
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:04,288
on their YouTube channel and we're just

481
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:05,668
going to finish up here and have a

482
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:08,220
little bit more conversation a little

483
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:10,379
bit more bowls maybe hit some of this so

484
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,829
now I'll combine it with and see if you

485
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:15,298
experience it as Sour Diesel or a squat

486
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:17,720

491
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:49,789
duration and let it my system because

492
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:52,549
there's nothing priestess very little

493
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:54,170
contaminant and you get away with almost

494
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:55,579
because it's so smooth

495
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,289
I turned that's why I turn the heat up

496
00:21:55,579 --> 00:22:01,369
and I kind of take it all in and I just

497
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:03,889
hold it and it seems to where do you

498
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:07,099
feel do you feel it more like flatlining

499
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:09,200
like the Saudis put more like the Sour

500
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:11,719
Diesel but something different

501
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,539
hmmm I can't even express its different

502
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:18,049
throttle yeah stir all it's definitely

503
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:19,369
behind my eyes and a sort of a more of

504
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:21,919
an it's you know even though I didn't

505
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:24,889
take added Terps many feels like it was

506
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,990
kind of this it's just like almost

507
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,660
surgery time I find it like a dry hit

508
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,019
like it's eased a bit but that's kind of

509
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,029
weird

510
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:33,799
back-to-back hits are interesting

511
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:38,750
because you're all so back-to-back

512
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:40,460
hitting it but it seems to do more or

513
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,160
because it you know you're not adding

514
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,240
anything new so if it's just THC what

515
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,130
does it do to this Sour Diesel

516
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,390
experiences at the mersin in the sour

517
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:52,340
diesel is that only mean that um I like

518
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,410
it when I have something to pair it's

519
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:56,480
not fun on its own because it's like

520
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,980
driving as fast as you can straight I

521
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,480
definitely agree with that I wouldn't be

522
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,860
hitting it all day long like that I

523
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,289
would hit it either with a variety of

524
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:06,349
terpenes or even safer and better I

525
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:08,779
usually bring a spring that you know has

526
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:12,319
a terpene profile i bets I actually I

527
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:13,849
prefer to ramp up every strata that's

528
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:14,589
kind of boards like I have it on deck

529
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:16,569
and I both

530
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:17,769
what happened it's not it's not

531
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:20,109
something to smoke on its own

532
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:22,990
nonetheless I guess this is kind of

533
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:26,109
where I wondered from a pain standpoint

534
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:28,538
is this refried beans in comparison to

535
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:30,579
this and is that why it hits you harder

536
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:32,109
because if these two hits should be

537
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:34,298
technically the same the only thing is

538
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:35,889
this is double activated because it's

539
00:23:34,298 --> 00:23:37,480
active and then we double activated

540
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:40,630
refried beans is different than beans

541
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,710
sure so it is refried beans little bit

542
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,510
give you gas or dope

543
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,278
I don't like I mean that from a good

544
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:47,019
thing by honest there's a reason for

545
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,839
refried beans really it actually

546
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:51,819
ferments it then people seem to go that

547
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,720
way but I look at these two like this

548
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:56,980
should be like that on the go in of this

549
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,740
but it seems to be like this is this

550
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,419
this is the narrow leaf drug cultivar

551
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,909
this is a broad leaf drug cultivar from

552
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:05,710
the same cannabinoid well this is

553
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:08,230
something strict and this is something

554
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:11,350
comes with a profile so I mean this is

555
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:15,788
his terpenes are in their cannabinoids

556
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:17,379
are in their well in the end its goal is

557
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:20,109
to have his least amount of terpenes

558
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,510
impossible sure so I mean that's kind of

559
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:24,908
what standardized if I get two ravines

560
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:25,179
in there then then we got Sour Diesel in

561
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:26,590
it

562
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:29,110
yeah that's that's what takes it out of

563
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:31,240
the nutraceutical yeah I guess the one

564
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:34,479
term things thanks to last week's hash

565
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:39,250
search that I really enjoy is the fact

566
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,500
that these are components in the canal

567
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,619
bando Pathak library of medicine's

568
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,740
Lester yeah it loves it good enough can

569
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:49,298
a but no path a lot of that because I

570
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,740
mean this is a prescription this is the

571
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:52,418
prescription that is a balanced

572
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,220
prescription of making a murder scene

573
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:56,350
and what makes it sour diesel yeah and

574
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,909
all of them but these based

575
00:24:56,349 --> 00:24:59,469
prescriptions seem to be the ones that

576
00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:01,778
are most needed because of the quickest

577
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:05,048
to standardize I can make this and this

578
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:07,288
and um you know I was once a patient of

579
00:25:05,048 --> 00:25:09,849
this store and have its person then

580
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:12,099
there's going to be access for a few and

581
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:15,069
in our country only there's access in

582
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:16,480
America but um these are whole packages

583
00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:18,639
this is up and down I don't know what

584
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,679
the goers fit to it it's dope it still

585
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,149
contains more of the variables because

586
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:24,038
we're not a professional growing of

587
00:25:22,148 --> 00:25:26,288
course where if I factored these out

588
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:29,009
it's not full cornucopia of medicines

589
00:25:26,288 --> 00:25:32,230
that makes our days of Sour Diesel but

590
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:34,179
if this is the antidepressant and this

591
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,190
is the pain management even though

592
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:38,259
they're one dimension why I'm very happy

593
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,058
because something this is something we

594
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:42,278
could literally start making articles

595
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:43,690
and trials and you try you try are you

596
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:46,538
all finding an antidepressant

597
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:49,509
well then THC has a definite therapeutic

598
00:25:46,538 --> 00:25:52,298
value outside of the antidepressant

599
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:54,369
Turkey which is me me and how can we use

600
00:25:52,298 --> 00:25:56,139
it because clearly sativex

601
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:57,639
those guys tried something they thought

602
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,540
they could just simulate this and it

603
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,300
would do the trick

604
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:03,190
well I think that they might have not

605
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:04,539
had a close enough connection to the

606
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,210
puffers mm-hm

607
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:09,399
well even in a finger reel it is an

608
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,630
important factor that and I was just

609
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,220
talking to marijuana man in the other

610
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,740
room and he mentioned it we can go talk

611
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,569
to him about this afterwards just that

612
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,900
there's this connection with you know in

613
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:22,509
the new rules and how they are now I'm

614
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,360
gonna allow extracts he said they kind

615
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:27,940
of made a point on saying that because

616
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:29,829
smoking is bad and his says shoot and

617
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,440
and so what marijuana man is saying well

618
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:34,629
but that's what got us here it was

619
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,058
literally all these years of smoking

620
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,920
that led us the learning and the

621
00:26:37,058 --> 00:26:41,230
knowledge came via that process of

622
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,940
smoking he also told me a story of going

623
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,589
and getting his lungs tested than the

624
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,330
doctor asked me if he was a swimmer

625
00:26:44,589 --> 00:26:47,649
because he couldn't believe the hell his

626
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:48,519
lungs were in even though he admitted

627
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:52,540
that he was a smoker

628
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:55,389
hmm so it's an interesting factor the

629
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:58,389
the you can smoke to cough up bad things

630
00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:00,610
yeah whoo that's the whole process of an

631
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:02,370
expectorant and opening of those

632
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:04,199
particular areas of the lung

633
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:06,359
to bring in aqsa Skyrim yeah you're

634
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,549
actually carrying weight that you didn't

635
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:11,399
know because you were so each breath was

636
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:13,289
slowly accumulating crowd you don't even

637
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,330
know how you got here then you cockpit

638
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:17,609
on that corner guy if I've been living

639
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:19,470
this way from all these years I like

640
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:21,569
this baggage in my lungs so sometimes

641
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:24,690
yeah smoking is the expector if you need

642
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:25,079
next Molly even in when you're getting a

643
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,600
cold

644
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,189
to cop it up and get that bacteria out

645
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:33,299
rather than holding on to it so it

646
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:34,799
develops and amongst well very cool well

647
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:37,919
maybe we'll end up having a quick talk

648
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,808
with marijuana man I'll see if Joey and

649
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,330
Jeremiah want to come in and throw their

650
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:45,269
five two cents out in regards to the new

651
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:47,879
laws and yeah see you guys there

652
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:49,799
all right so Mauricio is up Johnny fees

653
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,020
in just like that in just a second just

654
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:53,009

frozen rosin that looks clear yellowish

658
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:04,109
and maybe we were just talking about

659
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:05,759

rosin with some fresh frozen which

661
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,140
there's a little bit of water in there

662
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:12,869
be careful because sometimes when you

663
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,940
drop the hash onto the nail it can hurt

664

747
00:32:55,819 --> 00:32:59,450
feel bad she's always founded by the

748
00:32:57,589 --> 00:33:00,829
media I feel like when I see her the

749
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,480
last thing I want to do is try and stick

750
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:07,548
the camera interface and record what she

751
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:19,089
