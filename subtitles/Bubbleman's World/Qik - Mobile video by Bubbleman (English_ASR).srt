6
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:21,160
saw on the internet one time this Museum

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,800
in American Midwest some dinky little

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,800
town they had this saate in their Museum

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,640
it hadn't been open for a very long time

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,480
so they gathered all the local

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,599
dignitaries in the news and brought them

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,759
all out and open up the safe and turned

13
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:35,759
out the safe was full

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,039
marijuana and that's exactly what they

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,320
did all the people in the room cheered

16
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:44,320
and

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,520
clocked now I don't know who was in the

18
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:53,038
room but as far as I can tell in just

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,559
about every scenario that you get into

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,160
anybody speaking about something and

21
00:00:54,558 --> 00:01:00,619

[Music]

24
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,798
I'm not sure why it's

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,879
illegal but um over the years you

26
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:16,400
certainly in this media they all talk

27
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:18,839
about uh what a genius businessman the

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,840
marks

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,959
are now I see how you guys did

30
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,078
that they talk about how much of a

31
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,399
genius Mark is with business but uh let

32
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:31,359
me tell you a little story about some

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,478
business that we did one time

34
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,438
now not very often and I don't think

35
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:41,239
other than this one occasion did we ever

36
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:45,158
sell drugs but on this occasion we

37
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:47,679
did Mark ranged a young couple from the

38
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,240
United States came up here and they

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,719
needed a pound of

40
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:55,839
wheat so we got him a pound of

41
00:01:52,718 --> 00:02:00,679
wheat this is up on the Sunshine Coast

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,680
we met these people in a motel room

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,039
it could not have been sketchier or

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,719
crazier thing for us to be doing it was

45
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,439
just we didn't know who these people

46
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:18,120
were at T but uh on faith we were doing

47
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:21,318
it anyway but uh from

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:26,349
Louis woman was

49
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:27,560
cute that's why we did from St

50
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:30,519
[Applause]

51
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,080
Louis but at any rate when we finally

52
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:33,719
make the deal with these people we did

53
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,599
get them a pound a week sell it to them

54
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:40,158
in a motel room got out of there walked

55
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:45,000
away lost $200 on the

56
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:47,959
deal we didn't make any money we lost

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,479
money market quoted them a price

58
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,598
whatever it was and that's what they

59
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,518
paid but we had to pay

60
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,878
more that was the only time we ever

61
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,969
dealt any drugs we lost

62
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:02,759
money so it was never for the money

63
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:04,439
[Music]

64
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:08,598
