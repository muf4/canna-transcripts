00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,270
Sarah Sarah Sunday and we are gonna talk

58
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,590
a little bit about the karma Cup today I

59
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,689
talked to her the other day and she

60
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,330
asked if I could you know maybe share a

61
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:38,870
little bit of pertinent information I am

62
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,030
going to be a celebrity judge for

63
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:44,009
solvent list for the hashish and so if

64
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,229
you want to have me testing your hash

65
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:48,389
smoking your hash you're going to want

66
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:50,399
to get in touch with the Karma Cup calm

67
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:53,009
and you're gonna want to do it before

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,780
July 28th because at July 28th is the

69
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:59,129
cutoff date that you need to have the

70
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:03,389
product in Sarah's hand so that's pretty

71
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:04,859
important July 28th and yeah she's got

72
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:06,958
all sorts of categories she's got

73
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,450
[ __ ] pen categories and solvent list

74
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,699
categories and solvent categories but

75
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:16,169
categories so much so much well Kayne I

76
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:18,569
think wholesale it's worth about fifty

77
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:20,309
thousand plus US dollars I think retail

78
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,259
considering they did a piece with

79
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,729
mothership that was very similar that

80
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:26,489
retailed for a hundred and twenty five

81
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:28,229
thousand US dollars I think that cups

82
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,840
worth at least a hundred thousand US

83
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:33,000
dollars so it is a little bit insane to

84
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,370
think that I was balancing it in the

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,340
palm of my hand 30 stories above the

86
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,439
ground when I turned around and the

87
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,629
owner of the pipe was inside the

88
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,269
apartment he was clutching the Pelican

89
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:47,250
case and clenching his teeth and he just

90
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:49,019
he was like dude I have never been so

91
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,759
nervous I'm like hey man you know I'm

92
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,340
good for it I'm not gonna break your

93
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,289
glass and if I did I'd pay for it

94
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,870
I mean don't [ __ ] around with people's

95
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:58,439
glass if you can't pay for it you know

96
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,959
what I'm saying

97
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,879
cuz geez Louise that's uh yeah that's

98
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,330
it's well it's not quite a Lambo a Lambo

99
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,919
here is about 300 plus K depending most

100
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,959
people are buying the Gallardo z-- and

101
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:14,548
the the upper levels of Lambos at least

102
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:16,168
here in Vancouver I think for 150 or 125

103
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:18,780
you might get like a nice Audie or a

104
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:21,629
decent not a not a great Mercedes but a

105
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:24,059
decent one crazy how much people pay up

106
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:25,860
for [ __ ] cars crazy for how much

107
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,430
people are paying for [ __ ] pipes but

108
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,629
hey

109
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,668
you've got the money you've got the

110
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:31,680
ability don't get down on people who are

111
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:34,560
doing that [ __ ] I personally would love

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,810
to see people who were buying $125,000

113
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,728
pipes also take care of people in their

114
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,560
life I hope that they're helping feed

115
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:42,659
people and helping clothe and house

116
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,038
people but hey to each their own man

117
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,960
we're all allowed to buy the things that

118
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,000
we want I just sometimes think that

119
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,439
there should be a humility involved that

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,129
when you get yourself something on that

121
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:55,050
level that you might want to be taking

122
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:57,860
care of some of the rest of the world

123
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,280
you got a pay-to-play there DB Cooper

124
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,910
let's do this up shall we

125
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:08,609
well that was a cheap Mercedes for 6k Oh

126
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:11,460
is it only 120 km Canada that surprises

127
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:16,080
me that really surprises me because we

128
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:19,258
have a local club here and you can't get

129
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,240
into it without a $250,000 car and

130
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:24,449
there's quite a few Lambos in there so

131
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,610
I'm gonna go out on a bait a limb and

132
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,800
say you guys are talking bass models and

133
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,229
these kids that are buying these Lambos

134
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,569
and these Ferraris and these Bugattis

135
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:35,848
they're they're paying high dollars they

136
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:38,728
like they're not paying 125,000 dollars

137
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:45,209
for a Lambo I can promise you just

138
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:46,800
saying I'm not too sure I don't go to

139
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:48,299
the dispensaries too often I think

140
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,228
they're kind of on par I think be a

141
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,120
butane oil sells a little bit there you

142
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:55,769
go an f-150 there you go and that's a

143
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,680
good deal I know a guy that just paid 75

144
00:05:55,769 --> 00:06:00,680
grand for one yeah you're talking 1995

145
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:20,360
okay there you go that's a little bit

146
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:22,449
more accurate because there's no way

147
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,749
people are getting Lambos for 150 grand

148
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,749
not here

149
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:36,038
[Music]

150
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:37,968
alright let's clean this minor Chaz out

151
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:39,829
sometimes I'd like to hit it a little

152
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:41,658
warmer in the morning that wasn't too

153
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:45,589
warm the Terp dip listen when you hit it

154
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:49,430
with the Terps the taste is so [ __ ]

155
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:51,019
OnPoint it's ridiculous whoo and there

156
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,500
burned my fingers I put so much in there

157
00:06:51,019 --> 00:07:02,180
sometimes when it comes out it steams

158
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:03,490
hot burn your [ __ ] if you do that we'll

159
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,689
see what happens here

160
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:11,620
I'll get this Chaz off I always do

161
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:13,909
sometimes I got to go in a little harder

162
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,038
especially if I hit it a tiny little bit

163
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:17,688
warmer than usual I'll go in with my

164
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:21,889
little dabber and I'll just sort of

165
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:25,729
remove the majority of you know the part

166
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:29,379
that's just not coming off nice and then

167
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:29,378
I'll just heat it up a little bit more

168
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:36,100
and go in with the DC glass cleaner now

169
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:39,069
remember I've given this tip a few times

170
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,770
even though you might want to try not to

171
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:45,490
move the q-tip around too much let it

172
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:48,009
just sit on the Chazz and what it'll do

173
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,019
is if you just let it sit there it'll

174
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,420
pick it up even easier than it would if

175
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:55,709
you know you try to do this intuitive

176
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,819
sort of scrapey scrapey scrapey thing I

177
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:00,549
mean obviously at one point you're gonna

178
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:02,529
have to scrape a little bit but for the

179
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:07,810
most part you shouldn't have to do too

180
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:11,439
much oh yeah getting her off feels good

181
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:15,100
feels good to clean the banger feels

182
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:18,250
good to clean the banger a little bit

183
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:21,100
harder on this one and then last but

184
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,680
nonetheless I do believe it's ready for

185
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,140
another rip that DC glass cleaner is

186
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,340
made from this sort of oil not-not-not

187
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:32,319
Ranjha karanji karanji oil process

188
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:34,209
coconut extract process kelp extract and

189
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,589
process extract of sugarcane for those

190
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,030

191

the future you can go to DC glass

cleaners website I don't know it but if

193
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,149
you punch it into Google just the same

194
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,100
way you would ask a person where what is

195
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:47,439
DC glass cleaner made of or where can i

196

buy it and whatnot Google will give you

197
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,160
the proper answer each and every time

198
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:55,929

221
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:52,778
with me I'm just joking dude I'm so

222
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:55,269
funny like it's like I I tried I

223
00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:57,009
apologize if I'm reactive sometimes and

224
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:58,360
I don't mean to come across I'm intense

225
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:00,369
I don't know if you guys have noticed

226
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,289
this yet but I am a fairly intense

227
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:04,480
person if you spend any amount of time

228
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:06,219
with me sure we could get bubbled up and

229
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,839
I'd be pretty relaxed and pretty baked

230
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,019
but after a couple hours you'd be like

231
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,179
this [ __ ] is intense and I'm not

232
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:15,539
talking about intense camping I'm

233
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:18,308
talking about like intense energy

234
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:21,669
flowing outward off of me in all

235
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:23,230
directions at all times people are kind

236
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:25,028
of enamored with it at first but it's

237
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,769
sort of gets annoying after a while

238
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:32,110
I'm just being honest tell us a new joke

239
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:34,808
no joke I think I told the horrible

240
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,709
horrible horrible rabbi joke already did

241
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:40,149
I tell the rabbi

242
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:41,558
and the priest joke I must have it's

243
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:45,039
like one of the only jokes I know it's a

244
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:48,100
terrible joke it's definitely not a good

245
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:51,159
joke but I'll say it anyway it's

246
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,649
derogatory it insults Jews it insults

247
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:55,269
Christians and I'm friends with

248
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:56,889
Christians and Jews and I have nothing

249
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:59,649
against either of them but I will tell

250
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:03,370
the joke the joke goes like this a rabbi

251
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:05,828
and a priest are walking down the street

252
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:09,909
they walk by a park and see some boys

253
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:12,099
playing soccer the priest says hey let's

254
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:17,948

255
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:19,928

256
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:21,159

259
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,939

260
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:29,798
funny it's a joke but it certainly

261
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:31,719
doesn't have any malicious intent and

262
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:33,759

00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:43,269
creating stereotypes but hey it is what

267
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:45,399

funny that at the time and even in this

281
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:17,559
time still to this day people like

282
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,950
there's nothing funny about that a

283
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:22,268
comedian can make something funny about

284
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:25,750
anything as long as you take the hate

285
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:28,560
the anger the derogatory the you know

286
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,850
and make it a positive sort of like

287
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,879
perspective where you're looking at it

288
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:37,269
and kind of like hahaha yeah absolutely

289
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:39,669
George Carlin one of my favorites one of

290
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:41,709
my favorite well I don't even hate

291
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:44,189
everybody I think I love everybody the

292
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:46,958
same it's good there's no reason not to

293
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,910
any any tips for starting a terpene

294
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,189
business I mean dude honestly just do

295
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:52,629
what everyone does copy blue river find

296
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,690
the same containers find the same

297
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:58,600
stickers find the same lids create a web

298
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:01,779
page but figure out a method to extract

299
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,180
your terpenes with I mean it's it's a

300
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:06,730
whole and then try to innovate you know

301
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:09,939
once you've kind of copied the base I'm

302
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,709
not even being joking here so what

303
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,620
everyone does anyway

304
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,489
and once you've got the base then your

305
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,589
responsibility is to be like okay I

306
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,259
totally like [ __ ] copied everything

307
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:22,360
about these these guys companies what

308
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,860
can I do to make it something different

309
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,810
for the customer because in the end

310
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,209
that's all that competition is really

311
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:30,309
about it's about making the product

312
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,989
better for the end user and it doesn't

313
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,789
matter if I don't like that you want to

314
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,860
start a company or vice versa

315
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:37,899
the end user is the person who's gonna

316
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,180
benefit and if you do a great job and

317
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,799
you copy blue river but then you come up

318
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:44,889
with your own method and you innovate

319
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:46,629
and you create something different well

320
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,549
you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna

321
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:50,379
be the next step in the ladder and trust

322
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:54,278
me it will be someone who comes along

323
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:55,720
and kind of copies the base cuz listen

324
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:57,129
there's a half a dozen companies and

325
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,720
they've all pretty much done the exact

326
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,939
same thing they've copied Blue River

327
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,170
whether they want to say it or not it's

328
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,640
what they've done there were they

329
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:05,639
weren't even thinking about it before we

330
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,189
started having this

331
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,779
they heard the conversation they watched

332
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,630
what started happening and then they

333
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:14,339
then they jumped in it's not I don't

334
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:15,600
know why we [ __ ] on people so much for

335
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,690
that I mean do you think that [ __ ]

336
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,120
Eminem just made up all like he was

337
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,980
inspired by rap he was inspired so then

338
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,470
he had to go and show his stuff and this

339
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,470
is how it is we all we all kind of are

340
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,910
inspired by the Giants whose shoulders

341
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,269
we get to stand on and those are the

342
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:35,219
people that we're going to you know copy

343
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:36,809
a little bit I don't know why we're so

344
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,490
afraid to say it when it's like if

345
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:40,349
you're inspired by someone imitate

346
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,299
emulate innovate there you go Tyler

347
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,950
however you want to say then fancy

348
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:45,839
beautiful words that's a very nice way

349
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,190
to say it it's like you're basically

350
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,139
gonna fake it till you make it you're

351
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,760
gonna copy it you're gonna innovate it

352
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,580
you're gonna change it bubble bags were

353
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,799
the exact same thing and I took mad

354
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,590
[ __ ] slack for a decade plus over

355
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:59,429
something that I really shouldn't have

356
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,110
because let's be honest

357
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:02,699
bubble bags are [ __ ] awesome they

358
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,279
blow isolator bags right under the water

359
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,230
and they were for North America when a

360
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,569
European woman who was promoting this

361
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,409
process was not doing any promotions in

362
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,600
North America

363
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,399
I came to up in North America and I

364
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,409
promoted this when it was very illegal

365
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,090
and shared it and showed it and that's

366
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:20,490
what bubble bags did they weren't the

367
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,590
first but they have been the best and so

368
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,980
it shows you that the first isn't always

369
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:30,000
the best and so I'm not even being like

370
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:34,170
joking at all when I say copy I'm really

371
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,149
not I'd say James get in touch with

372
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:38,549
Peter there's no one that knows more

373
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:42,240
about it in my circle you can reach him

374
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:44,189
at Peter at soil balance procom you can

375
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,870
also google soil balance pro just in

376
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:50,550
case to make sure that's the right email

377
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:52,379
and it should be good I didn't watch the

378
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,359
M&amp;M thing that was trending recently

379
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:56,309
about the story of how much Dre put

380
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,779
himself out there and how many people I

381
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:59,669
guess what Dre was saying was like

382
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:01,500
racist people in his life that he didn't

383
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:03,209
even know where that racist you know

384
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,129
talkin about em because he was white and

385
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:09,240
had blue eyes who gives a [ __ ] what

386
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:12,929
color you are if you can do the job then

387
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,680
I could care less if you're purple you

388
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:19,159
got the job you know

389
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,998
that's it did you miss everyone's missed

390
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:22,308
everything

391
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:24,290
every Wow I mean that's been a lot of

392
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:26,240
work too but back in the day isolator

393
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:28,578
bags were known better I've done a lot

394
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,740
of work sharing this information and if

395
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:32,508
you guys haven't noticed I try to share

396
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,879
it in a very like I don't want to

397
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:35,869
shamelessly plug my company if that's if

398
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,659
that makes sense I don't want to

399
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,889
shamelessly promote my company over and

400
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:42,828
over and over again you very rarely see

401
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:45,379
my logo or me wearing one of my own

402
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:47,178
shirts or my own hat for that matter I

403
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:50,240
try to like stay away from that

404
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:51,828
shameless plugging but I figured my way

405
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,419
that I could market my product is a

406
00:16:51,828 --> 00:16:55,278
coming out and having conversations with

407
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:57,979
you guys sharing bowls with you guys

408
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,528
answering your questions and always

409
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,928
being there to support and give tips and

410
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:04,578
answer in regards to the curing and the

411
00:17:02,928 --> 00:17:07,009
processing and the preparing and all

412
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:10,849
these things I've been doing it for

413
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:13,788
almost twenty years so I don't think I'm

414
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:16,038
gonna stop anytime I'm actually getting

415
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:18,109
pretty excited I'm planning my trip for

416
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:20,000
Jamaica I'm gonna be flying there in the

417
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:22,158
next like week we've got a whole bunch

418
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,359
of cool [ __ ] happening in Jamaica right

419
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:28,580
now and it just kind of blew up with

420
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:30,288
these products that we've had registered

421
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:33,230
with the Ministry of Health and these

422
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:35,960
permits now that we have to grow and

423
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,630
process and cultivate which is growing

424
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,120
actually research and developments

425
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,220
produce products basically and and and

426
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,719
sell those products so we're pretty

427
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:49,490
[ __ ] excited we're gonna be getting

428
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:52,190
lots of videos we're gonna be rolling in

429
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,440
Tony and I are rolling in a week after

430
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,820
Ernie and Amy from the United cannabis

431
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,740
who are going to be going in and doing a

432
00:17:55,819 --> 00:18:00,648
little doctor training going to a

433
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,450
conference in Kingston Tony and I are

434
00:18:00,648 --> 00:18:04,639
gonna be heading to a conference in

435
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,288
Montego Bay so that'll be kind of

436
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,960
different we're gonna fly into Kingston

437
00:18:06,288 --> 00:18:10,940
but eventually end up in mo Bay quick

438
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,100
trip hopefully I'll have a couple of

439
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,450
days in Toronto afterwards some of my

440
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:16,149
friends want me to come there and teach

441
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:19,809
them how to make water hash

442
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:22,000
and well if I can't facilitate helping

443
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:26,169
my friends make water hash then I'm

444
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,640
failing miserably so well potency you

445
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,550
know we used to be really impressed with

446
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,200
THC like if you're up in the 70 Plus THC

447
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:34,990
and the oils guys would come in and say

448
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,549
we have 80 plus percent THC slowly but

449
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,990
surely we learned about the importance

450
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,740
of the modulating effect or the

451
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:44,109
entourage or the ensemble effect of

452
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,480
terpenes and how it creates more of the

453
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:49,959
Spacey full kind of like what I would

454
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,940
call high vs THC and cannabinoids which

455
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,640
I would call stoned very one-dimensional

456
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:58,059
II just kind of like this the terpenes

457
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:01,000
they're much more of an ensemble and

458
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:03,849
that just changes the game completely so

459
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,579
we're more impressed with 40 50 maybe 60

460
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:09,789
percent THC and in that a large

461
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:11,799
percentage of terpene profile I don't

462
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:12,279
like to micro plane bubble too much but

463
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:17,940

464

that stuff's been sent just the other

517
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:35,559
day cost me $115 to send like I had like

518
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:37,990
eight or nine things saved up vape pen

519
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,899
we had designed by Gary from Omicron we

520
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,579
didn't want to pump out disposable pens

521
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,410
I don't like the California has this

522
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:46,119
huge marketplace for distillate mixed

523
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,950
with terpenes gold drop and blue river

524
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,589
are crushing it I don't do distillate

525
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,450
but we figured out a way to do rosin and

526
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:55,359
create a distillate like product without

527
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,250
the use of chemical solvents and adding

528
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,859
the terpenes back so what I wanted was a

529
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,809
pen I could put my name on you know a

530
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:03,849
pen that I could feel good about that

531
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:06,069
people weren't throwing away each time

532
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:07,959
they smoked a half gram and so we had

533
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:10,659
Gary design as a pen he also designed

534
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,840
the Hercules which is a beefcake like

535
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,340
last you forever type [ __ ] cartridge we

536
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,009
had him design our cartridge so it's

537
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:19,569
renewable it's not disposable and we've

538
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:21,789
got applicators that you can buy the

539
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:23,619
product a little cheaper afterwards and

540
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:25,659
you'll be able to fill your own pen

541
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:28,419
cartridge so it's going to be the

542
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:31,300
Trinity cartridge the bubbleman Trinity

543
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,650
cartridge and yeah from Omicron and blue

544
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:34,899

545
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,430

546
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,500

here this time we chaste good

604
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:00,819

605
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:08,069
and puts it in the middle in a way that

606

609
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:20,439
Karma Cup we talk about Jamaica a lot of

610
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:24,548
[ __ ] going on right now what are we

611
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,649
gonna talk about well listen don't be

612
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:29,519
nervous at all like off a lot because I

613
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:32,829
take rips that would crush your soul

614
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:35,888
there Terp rich okay it's not about the

615
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:38,918
size of the RIP it's how much terpene

616
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:41,769
there are present in the RIP I'm not

617
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:44,440
even joking like it's Eickhoff Verret

618
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:45,180
not a lot to be honest and keep in mind

619
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,529
one of the

620
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,259
things that I'm doing that maybe a lot

621
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:51,119
of people aren't doing is sitting and

622
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:52,890
talking and using my vocal cords and

623
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,569
vibrating my vocal cords without the use

624
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,520
of water or taking sips

625
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:58,769
I'm also puffing extremely strong

626
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:00,839
concentrates with terpenes added to them

627
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:02,039
most people's mouths would dry up and

628
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:04,559
their heads would shrink and they'd just

629
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,599
be here not talking in the way that I'm

630
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,119
able to actually articulate my

631
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:12,329
conversation I don't have a cold right

632
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:14,099
now I very rarely get colds and my

633
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:16,409
throat feels pretty good other than the

634
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:18,719
fact that I took you know probably ten

635
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,160
rips before I went live and then a

636
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,740
couple of no I've got a little bit of

637
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,180
water in there even these pipes even oh

638
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,769
don't worry Raymond dude we're still

639
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,870
[ __ ] doing this [ __ ] we're out we're

640
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:30,960
not leaving anytime soon we're just

641
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:33,089
getting into it while we could talk

642
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,610
about the reason why people complain

643
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:37,230
about expensive art when you don't have

644
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:39,990
that kind of money it's hard to imagine

645
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,610
people do that not just with art but any

646
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,289
type of valuable thing that someone

647
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:45,959
chooses to have that actually has the

648
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:48,210
means to get it I think it's somewhat

649
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,009
petty I would never go on a plane this

650
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,110
is the analogy I use often I would never

651
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:53,400
go on a plane and complain if I'm in

652
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:55,919
coach and there are people in

653
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,740
first-class I'm happy for them you know

654
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,450
I'm like right on like that sweet

655
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,279
first-class go I don't sit there going

656
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,870
why is first-class tickets so expensive

657
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,220
it's ridiculous why should they get to

658
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:07,319
set up there when we have to sit back

659
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,690
it's like oh my god dude listen just

660
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:11,460
take your place whatever wherever you

661
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,470
fit whatever you're you know wherever

662
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,600
you can afford and don't be too upset

663
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,370
about it you know sure there are

664
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,709
experiences where it might come in handy

665
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:21,719
to be upset that you know monetary

666
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,620
situations keep us out of certain areas

667
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,789
but really who [ __ ] cares

668
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,979
people are buying forty thousand dollar

669
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:31,230
rigs $50,000 rigs hundred thousand

670
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,920
dollar rigs of course they are crunk

671
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:36,049
sell for mad dough 100k plus to each

672
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,519
their own chilling like a villain

673
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:42,180
exactly you know someone wants to spend

674
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:44,759
400 K on a [ __ ] Lambo so be it for

675
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:47,670
them and someone wants to give away a

676
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:49,710
little 5 or $10 thing every day on their

677
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:51,570
wake-and-bake show well good for them to

678
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,940
do what you want don't be too upset

679
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:57,839
about other people I don't think I'm

680
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,529
very I don't know when someone asks me

681
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:00,839
if I'm

682
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:03,359
I think it comes with being humble it's

683
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,399
weird people like all your elite dude

684
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,019
your elite and I'm like I don't know man

685
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,390
I got a whole bunch of aspects of my

686
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:12,599
life baby I'm elite in the ability to

687
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:16,430
isolate glandular trichomes heads but

688
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:19,799
there are whole other parts of life that

689
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:22,350
that maybe I'm not so elite whatsoever

690
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:24,659
so I'm working on those parts and always

691
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:27,059
trying to maintain you know the the hash

692
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,470
knowledge as well but how you doing Rob

693
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:30,539
more I'm still waiting for those

694
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:33,180
cannabis cartoons of hashed Church you

695
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:37,379
know not necessarily funny joke ones but

696
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:39,420
like actual our voices and our faces put

697
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,800
in too much the way they've been doing

698
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,560
I've seen this guy do with the Joe Rogan

699
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,579
videos have Joey Diaz or Joe Rogan and

700
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,950
they're just sitting around the table

701
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:49,079
it's their real voices it's kind of cool

702
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:51,569
I think if some certain little knowledge

703
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:54,089
bombs little 30-second knowledge bombs

704
00:29:51,569 --> 00:29:59,399
minute-long knowledge bombs I think it

705
00:29:54,089 --> 00:30:05,009
would be a cool thing to animate and I

706
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:05,910
did see your one the other day don't

707

709

710

717
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:35,670

we got a couple more wake-and-bake

720
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:43,409
episodes before we have a hash Church

721
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:45,089
it's gonna be a [ __ ] stellar hash

722
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,920
Church I can promise you it'll be a hash

723
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:50,189
Church unlike any hash Church you have

724
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,570
ever seen so please help promote it let

725
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,450
people know that it's going to be one

726
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:57,149
worth catching and I'm real excited it's

727
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:59,880
it's got the the makings of being maybe

728
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:03,090
one of the best hash churches ever and I

729
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,010
don't say that lightly and yeah may the

730
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:09,589
full Mel bless you your bowls

731
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:09,589
sooner than later peace out everybody
