1
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:30,929
the madness of it all here at spannabis

2
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:33,030
2019 15 years have come in to Spain's

3
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,558
we've only been here for maybe an hour

4
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,018
and a half and we're already in a VIP

5
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,948
room at the old school super sativa seed

6
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:42,719
club the SSS seed club and yeah they've

7
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:45,420
got the fire hash they've got the fire

8
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,920
herb they got the old school genetics

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,448
that is a little bit more exotic than

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,429
what's available at most of the places

11
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:52,619
you'll see here so this is a very

12
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,929
special place to start in the beginning

13
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,780
these guys are the old G's in the game

14
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,369
and of course skunkman Sam helped this

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,600
company start off by supplying them with

16
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:02,280
a bunch of seeds that he had collected

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,289
in all the half producing countries in

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,030
the world we need people like stuntman

19
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:07,799
Sam doing that work because without that

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,019
we don't have the building blocks that

21
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,819
we need to continue on so very important

22
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,519
work that Sam did these guys help

23
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,379
continue it on and it is you know now

24
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,579
what it is in 2019 with so many

25
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:19,379
different people there's probably a

26
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,118
hundred seed companies here think of all

27
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,799
the love you've had for cannabis yes

28
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,530
right you've given this plant so much

29
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,189
love and then years later I don't know

30
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,820
if it's 30 or 40 years later cannabis

31
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,250
gives you

32
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:36,459
almost three years extra with your mama

33
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,140
