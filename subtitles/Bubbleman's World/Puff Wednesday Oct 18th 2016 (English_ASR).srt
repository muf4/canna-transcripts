untouched because it is fall yeah yeah

105

no absolutely we just looked at it and

106
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,038
the sand was perfect there was no

107
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,160
footprints on it it was basically like

108
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:33,680
an untouched Beach from the weather

109
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,080
exactly it was like one of those those

110
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,759
spots when you look at Fresh yeah kind

111
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:42,719

121
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:10,560
fun hey we did that uh ICBC

122
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,159
conference dude I loved the ICBC

123
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,038
conference ICBC conference I'm not going

124
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,520
to lie I really enjoyed that conference

125
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:19,038
it's the international cannabis business

126
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:20,599
conference put on by Alex Rogers uh he

127
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,279
does it in San Francisco he does it in

128
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,240
Berlin he does it in Vancouver and he

129
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,000
really organized a pretty pretty cool

130
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,000
event it was not what I would call an

131
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,279
expo uh there weren't a lot of people

132
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,800
there the tickets were extremely

133
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:35,079
expensive mainly due to the fact that

134
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,400
you know it was a business conference

135
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,120
this conference is for people to go and

136
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,239
do business got me on the like 30 now

137
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,240
yeah I think I'm going to you know go by

138
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,000
my hand right now it's not super duper

139
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,960
hot the nice thing about the XL is that

140
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,240
it takes a while to heat up and it has

141
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,038
more surface area to expand that heat

142
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,000
into so you don't get these tiny tiny

143
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,759
little blops of of extreme heat but I

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,879
think we're going to be good I'm going

145
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,280
to dab this here in a second well we're

146
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,519
not running the tower we're going by

147
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,519
feel and we're pretty much good at that

148
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,799
I know I'm better with quartz I have to

149
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,240
admit I'm brutal with that ceramic I it

150
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,160
just uh it doesn't work it's just hot

151
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,240
hot hot hot hot and then it's cool and

152
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,919
then it's cool so all right let's hit

153
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,598
this there you go so the best part about

154
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,038
that ICBC conference really the

155
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,038

157
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,598
all the talkers and speakers that came

158
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,800

159
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:28,399

160
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,360

the Cano in in the planet so it was

163
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,038

205
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,199
flow it's a nice flow and let's be

206
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,598
honest it's one of the things that we

207
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,800
love about cannabis and cannabis use is

208
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:15,680
that it's very much a flow of sharing

209
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,158
and of keeping it moving through

210
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,598
throughout the group it's never really a

211
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:21,759
well everyone knows what it feels like

212
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,399
to Bogart something and people generally

213
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,280
are like they feel it right away it's

214
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,519
it's like um like the economy when

215
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,679
people start bog guarding money and then

216
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:32,360
people around them start feeling that

217
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,120
because the money is no longer flowing

218
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,038
obviously the good thing to do is it's

219
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,278
okay to make money make sure you keep it

220
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:39,718
flowing when you do because that way it

221
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:40,918
gets around to everyone that needs it

222
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,600
you know what it's like puffing and

223
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,759
passing I dipped you right yeah you got

224
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,959
dipped that was the best thing about it

225
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,879
though but when when you when you're

226
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,559
dealing with cannabis like I always say

227
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,240
whenever I do that dab or let up a joint

228
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,799
you look for someone to share it with

229
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,159
yeah but you do of course they help one

230
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,838
another out it's that community that

231
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,278

you guys are a part of it's great to

251

00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,039
able to meet someone yeah you know that

253
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,759
you want that you know I felt the same

254
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:43,159
way going and seeing Paul stamitz the

255
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,639
other day doing his speak on the

256
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:47,120
mushrooms I felt like I got to go over

257
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:49,199
and just shake his hand and tell him

258
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,240
you're a huge inspiration and do the

259
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,759
same thing that I get people doing to me

260
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,000
I see them doing it to you and other

261
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:57,720
people in our community it's it's just

262
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,720
more of that flow that's the passing on

263
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,360
of the energy that's the sharing of the

264
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,959
energy cuz if you would never came up

265
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,200
and said that to me I might want to do

266
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,159
this all the time yeah right it's it's

267
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,360
it's you guys to come up and say hey and

268
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:11,480
and thank us that's the reason why we

269
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,560
keep doing this is because of you and we

270
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,000
want to share these beautiful

271
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,518
environments with you I know we don't

272
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,519
have the wide angle lens so you're not

273
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,959
getting as much of the view but before

274
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,560
we go to the beach after Johnny hits

275
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:24,759
this dab I'm going to get on the camera

276
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm going to pan it across the water so

277
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,720
you can get a real nice you know have a

278
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,399
couple of Puffs on your Dube or have a

279
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,519
dab while it kind of pans over and then

280
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,559
it's just going to change right into the

281
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,360
beach shot so I'm excited like that you

282
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,159
see that you see that little expansion

283
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,120
so Johnny B and I have been discussing

284
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:44,639
potential opportunities for puff

285
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,240
Wednesdays but if you have a puff

286
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,240
Wednesday in particularly that you want

287
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,519
to see done I have a couple of ideas

288
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,000
maybe us going around to a variety not

289
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,799
yet going around to a variety of

290
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,600
dispensaries and and testing some of the

291
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,039
higher quality stuff we could go up to

292
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,278
Whistler we could do the float plan

293
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,120
we could go to the Sunshine Coast

294
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,720
invisible we're doing a helicopter got

295
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,159
to do all these things dude we have to

296
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,480
take a helicopter they're fun all right

297
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,759
I suspect you're going to get a pretty

298
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,120
nice low temp dab the thing with dabbing

299
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:16,200
outside when it's much cooler as well is

300
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,159
that um I'm not sure where that little

301
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,920
unit went but you can dab with that if

302
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:24,480
you like I don't know if I put it in my

303
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:26,479
pocket I think I did I pulled a a faux P

304
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,680
but I hooked you up with the with the

305
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,159
Slinger jar this is actually a Slinger

306
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,799
Marvel as as well so I want to give a

307
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,159
shout out to Marble Slinger if for some

308
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,319
reason you've been living under a rock

309
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:39,159
and you don't know who Slinger is he is

310
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,200
responsible for the degenerate art uh

311
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:43,838
documentary but much more than that he

312
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,480
was uh you know he is a really good

313
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,720
friend and I was lucky enough to meet

314
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,240
him in the '90s while he was learning

315
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,720
how to to blow glass and was able to be

316
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,278
lucky enough for him to move up into my

317
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,240
neighborhood and live very close to me

318
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,159
while blowing glass and sell glass at my

319
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,278
gallery and throw the original

320
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:01,399
degenerate art glass show together with

321
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,039
with him that would become later on the

322
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,600
inspiration for his documentary shout

323
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:09,000
out to Slinger you can find him on shout

324
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,079
out and a half you can find him on

decision and that decision was to move

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,640
away from the Prairies and move to the

424

439
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,880
bit of a stain on the side here just a

440
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:35,719
very light one that the torch will uh

441
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,880
will remove for us that was my fault I

442
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,200
will have to admit I was trying to clean

443
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,640
but my eyes have gotten so bad I can't

444
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,960
see anymore oh no yeah I know it's like

445
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,520
things get blurry here damn well look at

446
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,360
this I don't know if you can see but the

447
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,839
thing that was left over is now

448
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:55,000
completely gone so please don't feel in

449
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:56,639
any way shape or form if you get rid of

450
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,679
most of it you'll be able to clean it

451
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,440
off no problem but if you

452
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,159
leave large amounts of it and you heat

453
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,080
it up too hot then you just end up

454
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,679
oxidizing your quartz nail and it's not

455
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,359
quite as and it goes white it's not

456
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,400
quite as wonderful as it was when it was

457
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:14,038
new like this kind of like the one that

458
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,798
I have yeah I don't know about that one

459
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:17,200
I well know I'm just telling you it is

460
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,639
cuz we actually hit it on the laugh puff

461
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,640
Wednesday right right right and I was

462
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,720
saying how I was the guy who let someone

463
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,280
use it and wasn't paying attention and

464
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,038
that's what happens well I hope you guys

465
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,240
can hear us because we are definitely

466
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,839
not close to the camera right now it is

467
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,679
my new camera and I'm suspecting that

468
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:34,079
it's uh it's kicking butt and us I'm

469
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,360
thinking it's up to par they're probably

470
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,599
think why are they screaming why are

471
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,759
those guys always screaming to it right

472
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,359
oh this is going to be nice I'm keeping

473
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:45,200
my hand over it so it doesn't oh this

474
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,359
can be you is this me sure wow I think

475
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,840
the last one was a little too light

476
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:50,279
though because it did cool a little too

477
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,879
much yeah well I was giving you the low

478
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:53,359
temp but if you want to go for the thing

479
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,960
with the low temp is it's easier to

480
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:58,599
clean if you burn it then you basically

481
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,319
that's where the oxidization happens

482
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:03,399
that's my problem that's the problem I

483
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,319
burn it yep you do hit H I'm a hot heavy

484
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,120
guy Johnny Beal hit the Dil cleaning

485
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,200
itself and not even be bummed out that

486
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:14,158

563
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:25,200
good people behind her I'm going to do

my part and go hang out and get my

565
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,600
little booth and do the tarpine thing I

566
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,639
know you're going to be there as well I

567
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:33,639
will be there I do not have a booth this

568
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,000
time just because of the way life is and

569
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,080
well you can hang out at my booth no

570
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,079
problem I'm definitely going to be

571
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:41,278
hanging out with this guy I don't know

572
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:43,119
what booth number I am I think it's 187

573
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,599
but you can look on I I speak a couple

574
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,558
of times as well I'm on a panel speaking

575
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,199
about craft cannabis which is kind of

576
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:50,759
cool I don't always speak about cannabis

577
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,000
I usually speak about extractions but

578
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,519
I've definitely no stranger to craft

579
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,798
cannabis and high-end small grow you

580
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,480
know smaller talk about the smaller grow

581
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:01,918
and then I do my own as well where it's

582
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,200
just me speaking and I I don't know

583
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,520
exactly what I'm going to talk about but

584
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,120
I think I'm going to try and talk about

585
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,200
a little bit of water hash a little bit

586
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,158
of dry sift the difference between oil

587
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,360
and hash you know different ways of

588
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,278
hitting it the turpine extraction the

589
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,759
modulating just sort of everything that

590
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,759
we've really been doing on hash church

591
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:21,000
and that I've been sort of building with

592
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:23,158
Tony and all these different people I

593
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,720
think that's what the talk will be about

594
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,720
I don't know I think I think he just

595
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,278
talked about it yeah see look forward to

596
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,120
that talk at the Karm I never planed

597
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,640
that's what he's talking about see he

598
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,759
already said it look forward to it I

599
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,320
want to go hit a bowl in that boat well

600
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:38,879
you know what he's got this beautiful

601
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,879
boat it's sitting up here it's a giant

602
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,520
house boat it has a slide on it I don't

603
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,399
think you can hear it it's got a couch

604
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:47,679
on the front oh they can hear me dab

605
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:50,079
trust me this is still hot wow so

606
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,759
actually when hitting the quartz and and

607
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,678
do he's actually hitting the back of the

608
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,919
quartz with it so then it drips into the

609
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,360
large so this that's a really good way

610
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,759
of what he was talking about when I

611
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,519
first did my hit

612
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:02,278
is being able to actually hold it to the

613
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:04,679
back so it drips into the ball and then

614
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:06,440
goes across that surface what a great

615
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,759
way of getting a really really good hit

616
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,440
I really like that just watching it drip

617
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:12,200
and go up like that it's actually pretty

618
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,759
cool it's it's kind of you know what it

619
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,120
it was a good way of explaining that cuz

620
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:18,278
how you showed me he said put to the

621
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:20,359
back so I was kind of explaining what he

622
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:22,640
said to me to you

623
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:25,278
guys I don't know what the [ __ ] this

624
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,799
guy's babbling on about but I am loving

625
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,000

626
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,839

628
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,480
what I'm here for I appreciate it I was

629
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,759
just hitting this bowl and getting lost

630
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,759
and I was telling them and I was telling

631
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,640
them explaining how you putting the tool

632
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,919
against the back of the B so it into the

633
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,840
B and then runs across that big surface

634
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,600
and vaporizes that's why that's such an

635
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,398
epic hit with that cuz I haven't had a

636
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,599
chance to well maybe I didn't I can't

637
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:51,199

638
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,158

639
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,558

669
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:13,319
you know what it's it's such a beautiful

670
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:15,000
time of year to be able to take it to to

671
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:16,879
the ocean when it's calm but yet the

672
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,960
storm's about ready to break don't

673
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,080
forget we just had this major hurricane

674
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,759
that almost hit the Pacific Northwest

675
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:25,359
that shut down all the all the boats

676
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:29,158
here and stuff like that the other day

677
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:31,158
so it's calm here right now

678
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,399
and now we're sitting on a boat the

679
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:36,080
night we were like floating you've seen

680
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:38,319
us floating on a boat before pulling

681
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,558
bags we going have to do that again one

682
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:43,079
day pull bags on Rivers we pulled bags

683
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:46,480
on oceans we haven't pulled bags on

684
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:48,319
lakes I pulled bags on legs man not not

685
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,319
on a puff Wednesday well not with you

686
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:53,678
you're right it's true so this this this

687
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:56,079
could be we got to how I would like to

688
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,840
we should do it in an ice cave you

689
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,038
talked about that one day we're going to

690
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:00,720
make ice cave and I never thought I'd

691
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,558
ever be able to make it to an ice cave

692
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,759
all right so you got a good 40 seconds

693
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:07,079
on that before I hit it in as long as I

694
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:08,200
can the exhale would be so delicate you

695
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,398
probably wouldn't even know an xil

696
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,919
because that would all be absorbed into

697
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:15,558
me and and the most important part was

698
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:18,360
that that carb cap that that we found

699
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:21,038
that I just put down there for you oh oh

700
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:24,240
you're still a little bit of ways um I'd

701
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:25,798
give it another 15 to 20 seconds I

702
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,000
probably won't I'll probably give it to

703
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:33,480
that says 40 it's cuz now actually x 50

704
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,480
okay here we go

705
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,399
try getting that all

706
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,720
in definitely need a Q-tip though I'll

707
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,879

708

779
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,278
we should do it during the storm season

780
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:04,199
so you get to see it like that's what

781
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:06,079
we're in right now I know this is the

782
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,120
storm season that's why I mentioned to

783
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,798

784
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,479

787
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:26,119
D but definitely a tasty and amazing if

788
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:28,519
you were like hitting a volcano that

789
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:31,558

790
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:35,038
like a level five or a level

791
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:39,158

river shop there is like a a a well I

896

897
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,838
it is thank you it heads down from the

898
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,838
from the top of the of the mountain it's

899
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:33,559
a creek more than anything okay but it's

900
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:37,318
up there some of these houses are on the

901
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:37,318
creek on the creek

902
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,119
yep good

903
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,800
old it's nice nice to be up here dabbing

904
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,280
on a puff Wednesday with Johnny B and

905
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,560
with you guys and with you guys and the

906
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:00,280
rain letting it happen you know good

907
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:03,599
good thanks I love this

908
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,119
behind is that Boer or or that one's

909
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,160
Anvil that's Anvil Bowen's over there

910
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:10,800
right behind you over on that side the

911
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:13,039
little one right behind us is Boer and

912
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,800
and right across the way is Gambier gamb

913
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,838
and then between gambir and Bowen you

914
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,440
have the Sunshine Coast which most

915
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:20,960
people mistake for also Islands cuz they

916
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,480
can't tell that those islands are

917
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,240
attached to the mainland so the problem

918
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,559
is with the Sunshine Coast is you can't

919
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:29,679
drive to it yet not yet not yet they're

920
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:31,000
talking about it I saw an article in the

921
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:32,559
paper the other day where they're

922
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,679
opening discussion in all of our

923
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,838
neighborhoods to see if we want them to

924
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:41,679
build a road from here to the Sunshine

925
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:45,078
Coast I have the put in a tunnel I don't

926
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:46,598
know Floating Bridge H or depending on

927
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:48,599
an area where they can get it down I

928
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:49,880
don't know yeah Floating Bridge I they

929
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:51,039
could with the Squamish winds that

930
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,559
happen here I don't think that would

931
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,159
happen well it's definitely something

932
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,199
they're thinking about and I think they

933
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,639
know they can do it I think it's just a

934
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:59,919
matter of will the Community want it and

935
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:01,440
will they let it happen and that's why

936
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,559
they're opening it up to discussion in

937
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,400
the community I don't think the

938
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,039
community is going to be too happy out

939
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,680
traffic and then I think some will be

940
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:09,358
happy and some won't because anyone that

941
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:11,598
lives on the Sunshine Coast a lot of

942
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,639
people move over there because it's much

943
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,680
more affordable to live in a beautiful

944
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:18,078
area because of the that fairy distance

945
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:19,358
and how you can't go in the middle of

946
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,079
the night and how you're stuck on the

947
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,358
island without a boat and you know

948
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:24,760
there's that aspect it makes the

949
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:27,480
property much more attainable to

950
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,880
purchase and now to be able to have a

951
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:33,240
road that goes there it could extend

952
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,838
this area into that area and raise and

953
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:36,679
prices would go up so so some people

954
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:38,358
will investment right now would be to

955
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:39,879
buy on the Sunshine Coast yeah and some

956
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:41,119
people are going to be happy about that

957
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,119
you're right some of the community

958
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,000
members that didn't buy their house to

959
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,760
uh for profit they're absolutely going

960
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,599
to be like yeah this is kind of a bummer

961
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,160
well you know what what access access to

962
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,720
more beautiful property more beautiful

963
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:56,519
land for

964
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:58,598
everyone and that's good we like that

965
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:02,759
it's really nice to able to share that's

966
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:02,760

no not too bad but definitely like a

1067
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:27,239
little bit like harder than usual to get

1068
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:29,960
off oh hey even that hot I'll torch it

1069

oh just D yeah we'll get it

1070
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,720
off I scraped most of it off there's

1071
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,599
just a little nice little Edge of

1072
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:41,639
Darkness that the Q-tip was unable to so

1073
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,119
that would would have been a hotter hit

1074
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,558
is what you're saying a little bit

1075
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,800
hotter yeah so that's what you leave

1076
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:46,920
that block in so we just learned

1077
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,519
something right there oh no no I've

1078
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,280
known that for a long time no no but but

1079
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:52,719
but we're showing jeez it's almost like

1080
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:57,640
I I shouldn't waste this

1081
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:59,199
uh nice hot bowl that I made

1082
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:00,400
we're going to stop this we're going to

1083
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:03,399
reset

1084
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,240
this I like it and he's doing one more

1085
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:09,880
dab as well well it's you it's kind of

1086
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:11,838
like getting it all ready for nothing

1087
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:15,280
exactly you can't be getting it all

1088
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:18,119
ready for nothing no you just can't do

1089
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,640
that he's watching us from over here

1090
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:23,358
over there everybody's like you know

1091
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:23,358
like there's nobody

1092
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:31,879
here okay

1093
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:33,640
here we go daber da M see M see guess

1094
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,440
I'll just do a repeat of that same old

1095
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:38,679
thing repeat let it cool down even

1096
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,480
longer than last time CU I want to get

1097
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:43,399
less of

1098
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,960
a I want to get a real puddle hit I'm

1099
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,519
quite accurate with my hand I have to

1100
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,559
say a puddle hit yeah I like when it

1101
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,759
puddles I like when it's uh when when it

1102
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:54,839
just kind of drips in there temp low

1103
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,200
temp puddling rip something to be said

1104
00:46:54,838 --> 00:47:00,318
for it and for me I'm I'm still the guy

1105
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:01,439
that likes a a really nice good hit

1106
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,159
there's something to be said for that

1107
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,679
too I think it works well for what I'm

1108
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:06,480
dealing with and at the same time these

1109
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:09,719
nice low temp tips well there's no doubt

1110
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:13,039
about this you get way more rocked off

1111
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:15,279
of one of those hard hot hits compared

1112
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,639
to a super nice low temp dab maybe

1113
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,480
people out there are are disagreeing but

1114
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:22,039
I'm telling you it's a fact no it's a

1115
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,719
total for sure but that's the way that

1116
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:26,279
goes and and what I'm looking and and

1117
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:28,118
explaining is is some people are dabbing

1118
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,079
hotter because it helps him relevate

1119
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:33,318
this so the temperatures also contribute

1120
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,318
to what works for you mhm so well see

1121
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:37,358
that's a minute and I'm still not

1122
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:39,440
hitting this thing dude see he's on a

1123
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,199
minute and 15 seconds it's an XL Banger

1124
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,960
it's a big thing yeah I remember people

1125
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:44,879
a few guys saying that a minute 30

1126
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,800
minute 25 and I think he's pretty much

1127
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,559
on par with the hand I'm feeling that

1128
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:53,880
right now he's feeling it yep it's 125
