is you can run any light cycle you wanna

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,079

go on when they go off how much water

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,920

whatever pot you wanna use then

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,480
autoflower needs to get to where it

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,399
needs to get within the first 22 days

23
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,319
the 25 day if they're not where you want

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,679

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,679

kind of your specialty huh autoflowers

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,878
yeah autoflowers are kind of where i

109
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,199
started

110
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:59,840
been growing now for about five years

111
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,000
full time and autoflowers were just kind

112
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,158
of where i felt like it was going to be

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,479
made for home growers and have the

114
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,719
ability to grow a bunch of different uh

115
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,399
different plants at the same time so

116
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,479
nice makes sense

117
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,640
so we'll get all into kind of how you

118
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,959
grow your oil flowers i know you like to

119
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,238
do things in a real simplistic manner i

120
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,680
mean that's one thing about your youtube

121
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,358
channel which i'll link his youtube

122
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,240
channel down in the description section

123
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,000
below

124
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,960
is there's a lot of

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,439
basic

126
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,918
good simple information which helps

127
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,360
beginners i thought and your video

128
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,039
quality your production is fantastic so

129
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,639
a really good job on that one and you

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,439
only have like i think coming up on like

131
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,918
six

132
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,839
600 subscribers yeah we haven't we

133
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,519
haven't broke the thousand yet man we're

134
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,399
working away we've got a few more over

135
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,560
on instagram um but uh right now i'm

136
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,120
starting to do it semi full-time so i

137
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,120
can stay consistent and put good content

138
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,639
out so i can really kind of build a

139
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,360
strong community over there so that's

140
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,319
the plan cool well i hope that after

141
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,319
this video that you'll exceed a thousand

142
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,000
you know hopefully

143
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,000
but before we get into the nitty-gritty

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,439
of things talking about autoflowers can

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,839
you tell us a little bit about yourself

146
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,279
and kind of how you got into gardening

147
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,758
absolutely man

148
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,439
gardening kind of became a passion right

149
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,919
away once

150
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,600
once medical plants became accessible in

151
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,519
my area

152
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,120
i started growing off with autoflowers

153
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,839
because those were kind of the only

154
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,800
creators online i started watching mr

155
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,638
canuck grow uh from seeds of stones and

156
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
guys like that and autoflowers are what

157
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,759
they were focusing on

158
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,159
so i figured you know what this is

159
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,639
simple enough i can start this process

160
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,800
try to dial it in so it'll work for me

161
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,759
um and it's been successful we've had

162
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,918
some uh big plans some small plants

163
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,080
some successful runs and unsuccessful

164
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,079
runs so it's it's been a it's been a

165
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,319
good time man and i'm just excited to

166
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,918
start sharing my information with people

167
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,240
because i know there's lots of creators

168
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,079
out here but like you said i try to keep

169
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,478
it simple and i want to make sure that

170
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,399
everyone can try to grow plants

171
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,399
whichever way they want to and the main

172
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,799
thing is just get them started that

173
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,478
makes sense now are you exclusively an

174
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,840
indoor grower or do you also grow

175
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,560
outdoors

176
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:15,918
um exclusively indoor for the majority

177
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,360
of my plants um i have ran a few runs

178
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,399
outdoors

179
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,960
with

180
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,959
different cultivars um but most of my

181
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,719
success has been in the basement

182
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,799
basement autoflowers i do everything

183
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,440
right down here in the basement um from

184
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,360
filming to growing um so it's it's

185
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,360
typically 100

186
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,000
indoor with a little bit of outdoor here

187
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,280
there if i get the edge nice nice

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,279
now

189
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,839
i gotta ask are you a type of grower

190
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:45,119
that chases after yield um do you grow

191
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,879
just for variety or what's your goal

192
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,038
um well that's a good question

193
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,199
originally it was it was yield i wanted

194
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,120
to make sure that i could get as much as

195
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
i i could off a plant

196
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,319
because i wanted to try to save money

197
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,639
like a lot of growers out there that are

198
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,840
growing plants um so initially it was

199
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,280
yield but then it kind of came down to

200
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,279
variety different flavors and things

201
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,598
like that that i wanted to try

202
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,038
um have a variety on standby so if i had

203
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:10,639
friends and family over that we could

204
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,959
kind of try a few different things here

205
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,478
or there and get a mix of everything and

206
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,560
not only that i think it's cool that

207
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,399
when you get different types and the

208
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,000
plants take off in different ways i

209
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,758
think that really helps us learn and we

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,519
kind of dial in our process so we know

211
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,439
how to do it with all different types of

212
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,719
plants and not just

213
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,240
the same ones that you're growing over

214
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,199
and over again so it's a bit of both

215
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,160
there

216
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,319
but mostly now it's variety great point

217
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,160
yeah i'm a variety grower myself it

218
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,400
seems like we're in a similar situation

219
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,560
i'm actually allowed to gift

220
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,120
in my state i can gift to whoever as

221
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,800
long as it's under an ounce and so

222
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,879
friends family

223
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,038
i do grow a variety and then i'm able to

224
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,639
to gift different varieties to others

225
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,639
which i thought was pretty cool

226
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,038
yeah 100 man i think it's important to

227
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,560
have variety because i get excited about

228
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,719
what i'm growing just like a lot of us

229
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,079
growers on here and you get pumped up

230
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,919
when you get different colors and

231
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,439
different flavors and to be able to

232
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,359
share those with your friends and family

233
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,439
and see them laugh and love it and just

234
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,360
be so passionate about it that they pick

235
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,639
up something and start growing and i

236
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,720
think that's probably the major thing

237
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,319
what reason why i like it actually it's

238
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,960
exciting for sure

239
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,639
so what size pots are you growing your

240
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,799
autoflowers in

241
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,639
um originally i started out with a five

242
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,280
gallon because that's what the guys i

243
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,720
followed used um and five gallon it

244
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,799
worked for me i mean you can you can

245
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,599
definitely dial it in with a five gallon

246
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,599
i found i wanted to get more variety and

247
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,080
have more plants so i moved it down to a

248
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,080
three gallon pot uh the three gallon i

249
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,759
find fills out perfectly they're not

250
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,200
necessarily getting root bound depending

251
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,599
on how big of a yield they're the

252
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,920
yielder they are sorry um so a three

253
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,240
gallon i run consistently uh now across

254
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,479
the board um and they're actually my own

255
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,080
grow bags that i run but we won't talk

256
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,080
about those we'll show those later on

257
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,560
maybe all right yeah so you're not using

258
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,519
the plastic pots using the fabric pots

259
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:02,239
right yeah so i go with uh a non oh

260
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,159
sorry a non-woven breathable fabric uh

261
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,039
three gallon low stress training grow

262
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,519
bag

263
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,199
um i go with a gray color instead of a

264
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,120
black that way there you can see your

265
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,040
water penetration so as i'm watering it

266
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,440
will actually show me how much water is

267
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,360
in the pot so i have less a chance of

268
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,600
over watering and more chance of

269
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,480
watering perfectly so i can get big and

270
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,159
beautiful girls in there right nice nice

271
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,039
some autoflower growers what they'll do

272
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:29,278
is they will plant their seed directly

273
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,360
into their final container the container

274
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,720
that the plant is going to be in for its

275
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,399
entire life other growers they will

276
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,759
start in a solo cup and then they'll

277
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,120
keep on up potting they'll keep on

278
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,360
transplanting up into their final

279
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,519
container as the plant grows

280
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,000
what do you do do you just plant your

281
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,159
seed directly into that final pot or do

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,399
you transplant up at all

283
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,319
um i've done both i've tried

284
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,519
a lot of different scenarios

285
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,839
um

286
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,080
the question can do your transplant no i

287
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,880
don't transplant anymore but in the past

288
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,440
i have and it can be successful some

289
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,600
some of these uh plants love it some of

290
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,279
them absolutely hate it

291
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,959
but if you do it at the right time and

292
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,639
you can time it perfectly i think you

293
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,958
can have great success

294
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,600
over here personally i only had maybe

295
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,078
one or two successful runs doing the

296
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,639
transplant situation starting in a solo

297
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:23,039
cup moving it up to a one gallon to a

298
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,679
three to a five this is back when i was

299
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,120
using the five gallon uh grow bags but

300
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,599
now i find

301
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,240
being uh being a seed i feel like it's

302
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,639
best to touch it as little as possible

303
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,799
let's put it in its last resting place

304
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,000
and try to get a successful run in that

305
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,759
place because

306
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,278
realistically if you're touching it

307
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,039
you're putting oil on it you're putting

308
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,480
dirt on it you're harming it right off

309
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,639
the bat when you put it in its final

310
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,079
place so now you're taking that root

311
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,919
system and you're moving it which is

312
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,359
going to stress it out and you only have

313
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,240
a certain period of time for these

314
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,720
autoflowers to veg flower until you're

315
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,879
ready to harvest so realistically based

316
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,399
on my experience i would say

317
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,559
don't don't

318
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,639
don't transplant just put them in their

319
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,799
final pot whether it be a three a five a

320
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,480
ten whatever pot you wanna use whatever

321
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,159
you have on standby

322
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,959
but i haven't had great success so i

323
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,159
would say no i do not do that chris

324
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,919
yeah i think there's pros and cons to

325
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,000
both ways i mean you bring up a great

326
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,679
point where you could come across that

327
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,519
stress right to where you're you're

328
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,359
transplanting it that transplant shock

329
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,360
as a lot of people call it when you're

330
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,360
disturbing the root zone and there is a

331
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,480
little bit slow of growth after you

332
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,159
transplant now some people swear by

333
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,240
doing the transplant specifically to

334
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,759
sprinkle some mycorrhizal fungi on the

335
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,039
root zone which is going to be an

336
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,039
extension of the root zone it helps with

337
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,719
nutrient uptake so there are some people

338
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,399
there it also depends on your situation

339
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,160
i feel like right if you have a lack of

340
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,759
space you need to start in smaller

341
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,439
containers all that stuff's going to be

342
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,000
fine but yeah there is all that overhaul

343
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,040
risk i think of transplant shock and

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,278
reducing your overall yield because any

345
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,958
stunt and growth throughout the life of

346
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,919
the plant for autoflowers since they're

347
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:02,799
on that kind of set time that it grows

348
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,399
could negatively impact yields so 100

349
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,559
some great points on that one but i

350
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,559
think i think you need to try each way

351
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,319
if you're starting try both to see what

352
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,319
works best for you because there's so

353
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,920
many variables that come into play and i

354
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,160
might do different techniques in my room

355
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,599
than you would do in yours so try it i

356
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,360
would try everything at least once or

357
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,360
twice and that that's not just growing

358
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,079
that's everything

359
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,879
absolutely now let me ask you this with

360
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,239
the

361
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,078
starting in this final container this is

362
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,720
that risk of over watering right do you

363
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,120
have any kind of tips for watering as

364
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,639
the ceiling is just sprouted or how do

365
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,720
you go about watering

366
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,399
in a large pot like that so i typically

367
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,160
think that an autoflower

368
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,360
needs to get to where it needs to get

369
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,719
within the first 22 days to 25 days if

370
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,560
they're not where you want them to be at

371
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,399
that point then chances are you're not

372
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,239
going to get much heal now yeah they'll

373
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,120
flower and you'll get some you'll get

374
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,560
some

375
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,480
some flowers from it and you'll get

376
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,159
tasty flowers and you'll get all kinds

377
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,079
of stuff out of it but at the end of the

378
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,600
day if you don't get it to that point

379
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,799
it's not really going to be worth your

380
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,040
while you're going to spend a lot of

381
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,278
time so the first 10 days are crucial to

382
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,439
me i plant my seed directly into a

383
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,439
spinal container and i dial in my

384
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,480
temperatures i try to be

385
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,000
right around 60 percent of 65 humidity

386
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,159
and i try to keep my temperatures around

387
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,159
23 degrees celsius that's canadian

388
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,159
you'll have to transfer that over

389
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,240
for you americans i apologize i don't

390
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,639
know what it is off the top my head

391
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,480
um once they're in those pots and my

392
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,959
temps are dialed in for the whole term

393
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,278
all i do is mist my surface with ph

394
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,278
water and i just want to keep my surface

395
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,039
nice and moist i'm not adding any water

396
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,879
to the pot at this point because

397
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,879
realistically the little amount of water

398
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,320
is going to suffocate that root system

399
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,559
and it's not going to be able to grow as

400
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,560
quickly as it needs to so just keep the

401
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,399
surface nice and moist go in there as

402
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,198
many times as you need to throughout the

403
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,039
day and just check if the surface is dry

404
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,799
quick little mist just saturate it you

405
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,240
don't want to soak it you don't want to

406
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,078
drench it it's just like almost like a

407
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,240
little dusting if it was the rain

408
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,759
outside and the concrete goes black

409
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,000
that's kind of the way that i describe

410
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,519
it so the first 10 days are crucial

411
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,639
after that you just want to add little

412
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,120
bits of water with the turkey baster

413
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,959
just around the uh the stem of the

414
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,198
system that looks awkward but the stem

415
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,439
of the system and you just want a turkey

416
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,039
baste around that just a little tiny bit

417
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,040
and make sure you're only doing it every

418
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,719
couple days don't want to over water

419
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,078
because it's crucial to stunt these

420
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,600
girls and you're not going to have

421
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,519
success and you're going to get

422
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,879
discouraged in the garden and we don't

423
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,879
want that we want you guys to keep

424
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,799
learning and keep growing so that's the

425
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,439
main thing and that's how i get success

426
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,599
in the first 22 days good tips some

427
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,600
really good tips there for sure now what

428
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,159
is what are you growing in what's your

429
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,040
media are you in soil are you in cocoa

430
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,799
yeah

431
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,240
the medium i use

432
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,559
when i started i just want it to be

433
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,159
affordable i want it to be really cheap

434
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,000
because i had to convince a lot of

435
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,399
people to let me do this right i had to

436
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,240
convince my wife which is one person but

437
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,600
they can mastiff out to a lot of people

438
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,680
right so i had to convince her to let me

439
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,199
do it so cost was the number one problem

440
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,319
right i wanted to make sure i could do

441
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:04,000
it affordable so i go with promix bx

442
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,839
um it's a bagged

443
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,039
medium that you can buy at any local

444
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,399
grow shop

445
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,278
it's got uh

446
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,519
um sorry michael rizzi in it which is

447
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:16,000
great for first-time growers and it's

448
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,078
cheap it's about 30 dollars for a bale

449
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,120
and it will fill up

450
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,638
about 15 to 23 gallon pots

451
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,120
so you're gonna get

452
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,159
number one a good medium that is easy to

453
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,440
grow in uh number two a cheap medium and

454
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,399
you're going to be able to do a lot of

455
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,800
plants

456
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,120
for us for a low low cost now that's 30

457
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,359
canadian it's probably even cheaper down

458
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,198
down in the states i imagine

459
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,278
the reason why i went with that medium

460
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,039
is because i wanted something that was

461
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,198
simple to use and a lot of growers on

462
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,360
youtube were using it too so i kind of

463
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,719
just fell into it had success with it

464
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,120
and i kind of been running it the whole

465
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,879
time but you probably will see me switch

466
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,360
over to coco in the near future to give

467
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,278
it a run i was over at one of my buddies

468
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,199
gardens and just the feel of it it just

469
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,639
feels so much cleaner

470
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,639
feels like it's just so much easier to

471
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,120
work with so you'll probably see me

472
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,959
transfer over to try that out i've been

473
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,039
growing with the same pro-mix bx for a

474
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,359
while now so it would be nice to get a

475
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,399
bit of a change i guess in the garden so

476
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,079
you're just taking straight from the

477
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,320
bale are you doing any additional

478
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:19,039
amending like some people they'll add in

479
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,680
like a perlite or some sort of aeration

480
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,039
additional aeration or instead of doing

481
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,159
additional aeration what they'll do is

482
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,919
they'll add in some additional

483
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,759
amendments whether it be like organic

484
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,919
amendments or whatever you're doing

485
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,680
anything or are you just taking the bail

486
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,599
and putting it right into the grill pots

487
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,278
ah the bail goes right out of my uh

488
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,879
right out of the bag into a tupperware

489
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,039
container i just want to make sure i'm

490
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,519
breaking it up nice and fine i do not

491
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,439
add anything to the medium whatsoever

492
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,480
it's store-bought and i run it right in

493
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,639
my pot

494
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,120
and then we introduce nutrients later on

495
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,959
in the grow cycle but nothing whatsoever

496
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,959
added it just whatever comes with it is

497
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,198
what you get and it's been working

498
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:57,119
pretty well so okay and then what are

499
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,879
you using for nutrients

500
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,879
um so the nutrient line that i rhyme

501
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,240
with uh been with a couple but the one

502
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:04,720
that i'm running with right now is

503
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,640
called crunk grow nutrients um they're a

504
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,959
new nutrient line um on instagram um on

505
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,319
amazon.com.ca

506
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,919
they're right behind me here if you want

507
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,838
to check them out

508
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,880
basically what they are is a liquid

509
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,198
nutrient

510
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,120
to give you kind of a

511
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,798
an idea of who they are they're very

512
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,359
similar to some of these top brands like

513
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,199
advanced nutrients green planet

514
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,240
they're canadian made they're clean

515
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,160
product

516
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,759
there is some salt residue but i'm not

517
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,160
noticing a whole lot compared to some of

518
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,839
the other brands i used and i'm getting

519
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,080
great success so

520
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,399
these guys are a sponsor of mine um but

521
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,759
they are a great product uh check out

522
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,120
what i'm doing over on my page and

523
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,599
there's lots of growers that are getting

524
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,279
in early trying these guys out um

525
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,359
they're ph balanced but they don't

526
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,678
actually advertise that but for me

527
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,199
perfectly they ph bang on right where i

528
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,880
want to see it

529
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,640
so i'm having great success i can't say

530
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,320
anything bad about them okay so those

531
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,559
are the base nutrients are there

532
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:04,798
additives in there as well and that line

533
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:05,839
that you're using yeah so i use calmagan

534
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,798
micro

535
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,639
i also use bloom you do not use grow

536
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,119
with my autoflowers grow is off the

537
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,280
table i've used it before but i i found

538
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,798
it was just raising up my ppm it wasn't

539
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,480
really giving me the growth that i

540
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,279
needed in the early stages so i pulled

541
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,880
that out um on top of that i add a bud

542
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:27,759
booster i add a microbial product called

543
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,480
monkey juice which is a new product here

544
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,160
so this is basically like microbial mass

545
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,839
it's going to uh

546
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,279
help your root system take off in the

547
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:36,558
early stages

548
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,639
and make sure that you're going to have

549
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,960
a better chance to get big and beautiful

550
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,720
flowers and then the only thing i add on

551
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,279
top of this that these guys don't have

552
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,640
for a product yet is resin from green

553
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,558
planet

554
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,440
it's a phenomenal product i've had great

555
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:54,160
success i've noticed tremendous amount

556
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,120
of difference from using it not using it

557
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,038
they're supposed to come out with a

558
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,759
product like that uh but we don't see it

559
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,200
yet so green planet still in my garden

560
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,038
um and they'll probably be there for a

561
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,880
very long time until something changes

562
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:05,919
because i'm super excited about that

563
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,919
nutrient

564
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,120
okay and a lot of people they'll get you

565
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,480
know especially beginners they get

566
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,639
caught up on the whole

567
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,599
feeding thing when to feed you know how

568
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,360
much to feed is there a feeding chart

569
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,678
that you're following that they put out

570
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,279
or what yeah so uh the nutrients come

571
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,440
with a feeding turret right on the back

572
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,599
of them uh but i do find that a lot of

573
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,919
nutrient companies they're not dialed in

574
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:30,319
to necessarily autoflowers even though

575
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,160
they're very similar to photo periods um

576
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,000
i do recommend doing a half dose

577
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,480
originally until you get into about week

578
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,798
three um you don't want to over feed

579
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,720
these girls and stress them out

580
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,079
um i i kind of

581
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,519
i kind of describe it almost like

582
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,519
parenting when you have a when you have

583
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,038
a child you have a certain period of

584
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,879
time until they're 18 and they're on

585
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,960
their own so if you make mistakes

586
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,400
throughout that grow chances are

587
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,640
something might go wrong it's the same

588
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,798
thing with an autoflower so i would do

589
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,038
half dose but once you get used to

590
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:01,440
things to get dialed in um they can take

591
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,759
full dose i've done full dose and and

592
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,279
had success it just all depends on what

593
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,879
kind of cultivar you got in there and

594
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,240
what you're kind of what you what you

595
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,080
have dialed in for temperatures and

596
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,519
everything there's so many variables but

597
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,038
if you're on the other side of this and

598
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,440
you're getting started with nutrients

599
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,599
and you're introducing them don't panic

600
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,400
just keep it simple follow the chart

601
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,839
half dose quarter dose move your way up

602
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,759
and once you get to the top you'll

603
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,678
realize what they can take

604
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,200
i find a lot of us as growers we're so

605
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,880
passionate about this because at the end

606
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,440
you see such a cool product that you're

607
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,960
like you just love it it's beautiful so

608
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,558
we over

609
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,400
complicate things and i think we're

610
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,720
scaring growers away from getting into

611
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,360
gardening and i and i that's why i like

612
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,640
to keep things simple um and that and a

613
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,279
lot of these words i can't even

614
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,360
pronounce them just like the rest is so

615
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,359
keep it simple at first and and move up

616
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,879
i guess is the right answer now when you

617
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,279
start the feeding

618
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,760
i start my feeding right in week two the

619
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,720
week two is when i start my feeding

620
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:01,839
that's when i introduce calmag micro and

621
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,880
the bloom very small amount of it um two

622
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:07,839
mils per gallon of cal meg two mils per

623
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,320
gallon of the micro and then one mil per

624
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,158
gallon of the bloom and i mixed it into

625
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,879
a five gallon jug that way there i got

626
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,760
water on standby and i'm watering every

627
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,720
other week increasing my nutrients as we

628
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:23,919
go i was going to ask if you monitor the

629
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,319
ppm or ec at all

630
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,159
um i don't monitor the ec but i do

631
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,839
monitor the ppm

632
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,600
for the ppm i'm just trying to keep it

633
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,158
dialed in throughout my stages of my

634
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,759
growth so as a seedling i want to be

635
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,200
anywhere from

636
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:42,079
500 to 600. then as we move into veg i

637
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,600
typically bring it up to 800 or 900

638
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,439
and then we're under flour i want to

639
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,839
keep that dialed in around a thousand to

640
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,080
eleven hundred i find if i go up any

641
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,558
higher than eleven hundred i have pushed

642
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,798
it to twelve twelve fifty before i just

643
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,200
find the girls really don't perform as

644
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,359
well in there they start burning your

645
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,279
finger and then if you do get a

646
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,719
a lockout or deficiency at that point

647
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,158
you've got a lot of nutrients in that

648
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,960
soil you're going to have to try to get

649
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,280
out

650
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,759
super hard with autoflowers so

651
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,158
um i monitor it now i did just have a

652
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,079
very unsuccessful run where i kind of

653
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,080
got away from everything i

654
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,319
i didn't really get back to the basics i

655
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,879
wasn't using my ph tester i wasn't using

656
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,960
my ppm i was just mixing my nutrients

657
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,720
the same way i normally did

658
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,600
and we lost a lot of girls so the main

659
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,360
thing is

660
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,719
monitor as much stuff as you can i

661
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,479
haven't got into

662
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,839
all of the monitoring systems that are

663
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,599
out there and all the tools that are out

664
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,918
there but if you can get your hands on

665
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,000
tools definitely advance as you become

666
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,280
more and more in tune with your growing

667
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,359
style

668
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,038
and get the proper tools because

669
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,119
sometimes we can get over cocky and

670
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,119
confident in the garden and then you

671
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,279
lose your plants and you don't realize

672
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,759
hey i gotta get back to the basics so

673
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,519
that's a major factor for sure

674
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,679
when you talk about the ppm readings

675
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,759
that you just mentioned is that the ppm

676
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,080
going of your nutrient mix

677
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,480
going in so before you feed your plant

678
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,558
or are you measuring a runoff

679
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,400
that's by letting the nutrient mix go

680
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,480
through the medium

681
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,000
run off that measurement or are you

682
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,919
doing a slurry test some people do a

683
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,038
slurry test for measuring that

684
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,640
so my my ppm um to be honest with you

685
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,599
i'd like to actually chat with you more

686
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,679
about that off air um i check mine

687
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,798
coming out maybe i should be checking it

688
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,919
going in

689
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:28,079
um i'm not 100 sure on that uh to be

690
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,480
honest with you i just got back into i

691
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:32,960
just got into the ppm about three runs

692
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,519
ago um and i'm kind of listening to your

693
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,319
podcast some other guys podcast i'm a

694
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,839
learner as well i'm an enthusiast and my

695
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,240
major thing is to try to keep this

696
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,158
simple to encourage people and to get

697
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,599
people into gardening i'm hoping that

698
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,000
they see one of my videos they get

699
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,038
excited they laugh they smile and

700
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,359
they're like you know what this seems

701
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,919
like a lot of fun this goofy guy can

702
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,359
grow the chances are i can grow and

703
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,400
that's the main thing i'm trying to get

704
00:23:55,359 --> 00:24:01,359
across you can get advanced but for that

705
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,960
answer i really couldn't tell you um

706
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,079
i really couldn't get into a technical

707
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,440
side of it it's something that i'm

708
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,639
definitely going to have to learn for

709
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,240
sure

710
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,559
yeah i mean i can touch on that right

711
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,120
now is you know i think it's good to

712
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:15,200
have the ppm measurements going in and

713
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,319
coming out because going in isn't always

714
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,759
going to be what's coming out you know

715
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:21,119
you can mix up a 500 ppm nutrient mix

716
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,119
and feed it through your medium then all

717
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,879
of a sudden you're at a thousand runoff

718
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,439
it's because well you already have

719
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,919
nutrients in the medium to begin right

720
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,320
so it's like it's an addition to it

721
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,159
so i recommend kind of monitoring both

722
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:35,439
and you'll get to that comfort level

723
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,278
like you mentioned where you don't have

724
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,320
to really do it as much you might know

725
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,400
like hey

726
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,319
on week four on the feeding chart you

727
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,960
know this i know comes out a half dose

728
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,558
comes out to 500 ppm and you can look at

729
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,919
i don't know if you track if you have

730
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:51,759
like a log of tracking ph and ppm i i do

731
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,278
i know not everybody does some people

732
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,319
get away with not doing it and there's

733
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:55,919
nothing wrong with that if you want to

734
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,519
keep it simple and stuff like that but i

735
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,278
kind of look at my last runoff

736
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,119
measurement you know whether it be from

737
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,798
a couple days ago um when i fed or

738
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,479
whatever and kind of get an idea and

739
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:05,918
guesstimate like hmm do what you might

740
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,519
think i'm going to need

741
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,600
there's no perfect system you know what

742
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,440
i mean so you got to kind of to guess

743
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,519
and wing it in some senses at least in

744
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,600
my experience so i didn't think of that

745
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,918
because i'm when i'm mixing my nutrients

746
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,839
all i'm checking is my ph

747
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,278
um i didn't think to check the ppm

748
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,038
because i'm going based on the

749
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,200
guidelines of the back of my nutrient

750
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,679
company to tell me what it needs

751
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,919
um but super cool because all i'm doing

752
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,400
is reading the runoff and basing it on

753
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,480
my last runoff and then doing an

754
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,480
equation in my mind and going okay i

755
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,720
think there's x amount in that in that

756
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,120
soil right now i need to dial back next

757
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,558
beating maybe just give water

758
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,479
you'll probably catch me looking over

759
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,558
here i've got two white boards here down

760
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,558
in the grow room so i try to track as

761
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,038
much as i possibly can so that if i do

762
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,119
make a mistake i can fix it for next run

763
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:55,038
or i can try to dial it in on that run

764
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,199
that's a huge thing and i think that's

765
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,119
super important for new growers track

766
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,600
everything even if it's the stupidest

767
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,918
thing when lights go on when they go off

768
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,759
how much water you give when you give it

769
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,799
because all that is just intel and it's

770
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,798
going to help you become a better

771
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,639
gardener at the end of the day great

772
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,639
points for sure one last thing to

773
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,240
mention for ppm before we move on would

774
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,440
be going in isn't always what's coming

775
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,679
out and there's going to be so many

776
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,840
variables as well like if you're in in

777
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,440
an enriched soil or a soil that's

778
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,038
already amended right fox farm ocean

779
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,120
forest oil is one that comes to mind

780
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,480
there's roots organic there's

781
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,000
a coast of maine there's so many

782
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,400
different of these soils that already

783
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,400
come amended with nutrients and when

784
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,679
they're organic nutrients you know a lot

785
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,480
of those they're not going to show up on

786
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,559
your ppm meter until the microbes break

787
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,640
them down so

788
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:42,399
oftentimes i have beginners reach out to

789
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,320
me and they'll say

790
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,480
oh what i'm putting in

791
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:47,918
it's way higher runoff coming out and

792
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,759
they're like and i didn't even feed like

793
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,679
maybe i just watered and they're like

794
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:53,759
and my runoff was higher than it was

795
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,440
when i fed last time well that's because

796
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,879
you probably have organic nutrients in

797
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,120
your medium being broken down by the

798
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,039
microbes so that's increasing that ppm

799
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,879
number so there's a lot of variables

800
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:04,319
when it comes to it really this whole

801
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,400
ppm thing is

802
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,519
is just kind of a tool that you can use

803
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,919
to kind of

804
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,519
give you an idea of what how many

805
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,960
nutrients

806
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:17,519
it's not perfect by any means so

807
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,038
um you touched a little bit on ph

808
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,359
now what i want to get a little bit

809
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,720
deeper into that what ph range do you

810
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:24,959
aim for

811
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,278
um during the first 10 days i don't ph

812
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,240
my water at all all i do is i buy

813
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:32,159
distilled uh baby water from

814
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,839
the supermarket and i don't know why i

815
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,840
used it i just started using it

816
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,278
originally i went and bought water

817
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:38,480
because i didn't know what my water was

818
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,278
in the tap

819
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,200
um but i used regular uh water sorry

820
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:46,000
baby water distilled for the first 10

821
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,399
days so don't ph at all after that once

822
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,839
i started introducing nutrients i ph it

823
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:54,639
anywhere from 6.0 to 6.5 but typically

824
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,798
it runs in right at 6.3 that's kind of

825
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,919
where the nutrients ph balance it

826
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:59,278
perfectly

827
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,038
but if it doesn't balance there

828
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:04,159
depending on what else i'm adding then

829
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:05,919
i'll use some ph or some ph down um to

830
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,360
kind of dial everything in but it's

831
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,720
typically right there 6.3 6.4

832
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:12,879
okay and that's throughout the entire

833
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,000
grow pretty much throughout the entire

834
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,520
grow

835
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,759
flower i will drop it down to around 6.0

836
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,679
if i can depending on what i'm adding i

837
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,679
find once i add the resin and it drops

838
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,880
it down anyways

839
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,399
now i know you can get a bit more

840
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,039
advanced and there's certain nutrients

841
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,959
that would take at different ph levels

842
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,119
i try not to really get into all that

843
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,079
i've had success with just php at those

844
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,158
numbers

845
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,480
um and they're producing good flowers

846
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,559
that taste good and do get the job done

847
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,798
for lack of better word so

848
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,038
um that's kind of how i've been doing it

849
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:47,038
over here gotcha

850
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,158
transitioning over let's talk about

851
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:49,679
lighting

852
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,960
actually i didn't talk to you about kind

853
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,798
of your gross space i know you're in a

854
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,480
basement but are you growing intense or

855
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,398
are you just kind of an open basement

856
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,278
and then what are you using for lighting

857
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:02,639
um so i've got a built room down here uh

858
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:04,640
built rooms out of 2x4 so it's uh 12 by

859
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,120
eight by eight feet high

860
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,159
um and then it's panda filmed

861
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,798
um with uh panda skin so it's a white

862
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,480
plastic with a black blocking uh to keep

863
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:15,519
the light out or keep the light in i

864
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,679
guess for

865
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,000
for whatever way you want to do there

866
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,080
and then i run three lights so i've got

867
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,679
two lights on each side which are crunk

868
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,079
row 4000

869
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,759
which are very similar to the spider

870
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,158
farm 4000

871
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:33,440
um they call it a 4000 but it actually

872
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:36,000
only pulls 450 true watts from the wall

873
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,640
so i got 450 watts on each side and then

874
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,440
i run a crunk row 2000 in the middle

875
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,759
which is 250 watts i only turn the

876
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,840
middle light on during flower i find

877
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,679
during flower i have to space my girls

878
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,439
out a bit more and i'm not getting

879
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,679
proper light penetration on all of them

880
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,240
so i put in a filler light just to kind

881
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,798
of help them out throw flower now i can

882
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,720
only run it around 50

883
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,398
um because of my temperatures down here

884
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,558
in the basement depending on which time

885
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,319
of the year i'm growing we're going into

886
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,480
fall now so i'll be good to run them at

887
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,639
full power once we're in flower but i

888
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,440
typically try to keep them right around

889
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,120
70 percent i find is the sweet point so

890
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,200
you don't burn them and you're not

891
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:17,119
getting too much heat in your grow room

892
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,759
now the energy admitted from grow lights

893
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,798
par photosynthetically active radiation

894
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,798
it's the

895
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,519
energy that the lights admit common

896
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,519
measurement is ppfd photosynthetic

897
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,359
photon flux density that's commonly

898
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,440
what's used some growers they'll give

899
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,558
their plants a certain amount of par

900
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,919
during the different stages of the

901
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:35,440
growth they'll go slowly kind of

902
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,399
increase the amount of power they give

903
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,278
their plants

904
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:41,038
are you measuring power at all do you

905
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,119
adjust through different stages of

906
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,440
growth or no

907
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,599
i'm not measuring power i don't have a

908
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,360
power reader or anything like that

909
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,759
but i am giving them different

910
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:54,079
intensities throughout the grow um in

911
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,879
different height so i started off around

912
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,558
24 inches above the uh above the pots

913
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,440
when they're seedlings and i'm only

914
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,038
running it about 24 25 so what i mean by

915
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,720
that it's got a dial on the outside of

916
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:08,000
the light i mean obviously you can

917
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,120
picture me turning it 25 50 100

918
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,440
i keep it about 25 value and then i just

919
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,479
gradually move it up and up and up and

920
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,000
your plants are going to tell you

921
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,919
they're going to show you signs of heat

922
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,519
stress if they're too hot and another

923
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,679
way to do it that's simple is just put

924
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,679
your plant or sorry your hand over top

925
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,519
of your plant and if your hand can stand

926
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,880
there for a long period of time and

927
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,640
chances are the plants are going to be

928
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,880
able to as well but if your hands

929
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,559
getting super hot and starting to burn

930
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,399
you're going to want to dial it down or

931
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,359
raise it up depending on what situation

932
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:36,879
you're in

933
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,599
but i do adjust it throughout the grow

934
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,600
but no power testing whatsoever i'd be

935
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,839
interested to see what these are pulling

936
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,959
for power to be honest with you

937
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:46,639
how much are those are they're

938
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,480
affordable are those things you can

939
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,759
order online where do you get those kind

940
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,200
of testers chris i recommend the apogee

941
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,720
either mq 500 or the mq-620 i think

942
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,440
there might be a different model now the

943
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:04,480
mq 500 is going to be good for both led

944
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,640
and hid lighting so hps mh cmh and then

945
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,640
the

946
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,919
mq620 it's an extended range and a lot

947
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,120
of these led grill lights these days

948
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,159
they're going to extend beyond the

949
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:17,918
normal 400 to 700 nanometer range so

950
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,760
that being said they're about the apogee

951
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,000
ones that i recommend they're over 500

952
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,679
unfortunately oh um i think it's like

953
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,759
525 for the

954
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,759
mq 500 and like 575 for the mq620 there

955
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:32,079
are cheaper power ranges out there

956
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,558
that i haven't used i heard there's some

957
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,558
inaccuracy issues with it so i've just

958
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,000
avoided it all together but yeah the

959
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:39,759
tips that you mentioned

960
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,119
you can kind of get away with not

961
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,640
spending that much money on a power

962
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,239
meter just to kind of get your light

963
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,480
distance dialed in you can also look at

964
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,558
the part chart on the actual grow light

965
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,000
listing usually any grow light these

966
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,079
days most good grow lights are going to

967
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,519
have a par chart on there and it'll show

968
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,439
you kind of like a top view it's like a

969
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,599
square and it shows you different ppfd

970
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,519
levels throughout the footprint and then

971
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,759
you can in different heights and you can

972
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,759
kind of use that as a guide to determine

973
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,558
what the light distance should be and i

974
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:09,519
feel like 98 of growers probably do it

975
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,918
that route and it's fine but yeah they

976
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,839
are super expensive but it's worth it to

977
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,840
some who want to kind of play around

978
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,359
with things you know that's a body tool

979
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,199
so that's the type of tool you talk your

980
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:20,398
body into buying so that you can borrow

981
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,880
it from

982
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,558
that's the smart move there

983
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,399
light cycle

984
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,960
let's talk about light cycle for

985
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:31,278
autoflowers so what do you run for light

986
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,600
cycle for autos so the cool thing with

987
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,919
autoflowers is you can run any light

988
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:38,000
cycle you want to run so you can run

989
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,799
them for six hours a day 10 hours a day

990
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,960
20 hours a day 24 hours a day you can

991
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,679
put them in your windowsill and still be

992
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,519
successful and grow a full flower

993
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,080
but over here basement autoflowers we

994
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,440
literally run them like slaves 24 hours

995
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,038
a day

996
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,120
and the reason why we run them 24 hours

997
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,278
a day is because when i started i didn't

998
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,879
have a timer so i didn't want to run

999
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:00,880
down and shut them off and not be

1000
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,960
consistent i thought that maybe that

1001
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,720
would mess them up so i ran them 24

1002
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,480
hours a day and then that's kind of how

1003
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,159
i dialed in my process

1004
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,079
um when you're running them 24 hours a

1005
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,919
day you can keep your temperatures

1006
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,839
consistent too you can keep your

1007
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,598
humidity consistent your temperatures in

1008
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,039
your room you can make sure everything's

1009
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,200
consistent because your lights are

1010
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:22,000
really the major factor of heat in your

1011
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,719
grow room so having that light off then

1012
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,639
you might have to introduce a heater and

1013
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,638
having that light on

1014
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,878
you can have a fan in there and exhaust

1015
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,800
fans to make sure that your heat is not

1016
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,799
getting too high so that's one of the

1017
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,519
major reasons why i run them 24 hours a

1018
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,560
day and and the other major reason is

1019
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,480
just

1020
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,799
i found that it worked the best i ran

1021
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,199
them 18 and six i've got great results

1022
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,879
but 24 hours a day seemed to be you know

1023
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,279
what these girls are doing okay they're

1024
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,358
having fun i can go in at any time so

1025
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,040
it'll work good for my schedule and i

1026
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:54,559
can garden at my own leisure i don't

1027
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,480
need to wait for the lights to come on

1028
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,519
or off to kind of get in there and do my

1029
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,960
thing so 24 hours a day we are grinding

1030
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,480
the mountain there

1031
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,159
makes sense yeah i feel like there are

1032
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,240
pros and cons to

1033
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,920
24 hour light cycle right you brought up

1034
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,159
a great pro which i think is a big pro

1035
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,920
in my opinion is the stability in your

1036
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,920
environment right because once the

1037
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,400
lights go off you could have a pretty

1038
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,920
significant temperature and humidity

1039
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,440
swing and too high of swings too often

1040
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,680
could stress out the plant to the point

1041
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,639
where it becomes hermaphrodite right so

1042
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:30,319
having that stable temperature humidity

1043
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:33,519
24 hours a day is is key the downside is

1044
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,200
during lights off is when plants send

1045
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,119
down those exudates down to the root

1046
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,559
zone the rhizosphere and then secondary

1047
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,480
metabolites are also produced during

1048
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,559
lights off one of the things major

1049
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,079
secondary metabolite is resin right the

1050
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,159
resin production so i feel like there

1051
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,880
are pros and cons i mean somebody will

1052
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:51,440
argue that way but if you feel like the

1053
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,800
24 hour a day is more beneficial for you

1054
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,838
the plant will still grow right i mean

1055
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,119
clearly you're still getting good

1056
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:56,719
results and it's keeping your

1057
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,960
temperature and humidity stable so

1058
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,480
either way will work and i'm really glad

1059
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,240
you brought that up because i think

1060
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,719
that's an excellent point and the

1061
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,239
biggest thing is being a new grower is

1062
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,000
your temperatures are super important

1063
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,759
right and they're they're going to be

1064
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,199
what stresses you out the most when your

1065
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,440
humidity is spiking and your

1066
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,960
temperatures dropping and raising

1067
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,280
and you can't dial that in you can't

1068
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,960
enjoy being a gardener you can't kind of

1069
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,560
enjoy watching these plants grow you're

1070
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,920
worried about everything you're either

1071
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:23,279
spraying the walls down to bringing

1072
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,358
humidity up or you're filling your

1073
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,200
humidifier every freaking day every

1074
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:29,838
second times the day two times three

1075
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,919
times so just to kind of relax

1076
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,679
maybe start out with 24 hours a day and

1077
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,280
if you find you're getting success and

1078
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,679
you start getting that confidence then

1079
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,880
go to 18 and six that way there you know

1080
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,879
what you need you've already got the

1081
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,720
right tools in place because there's

1082
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,720
nothing worse than starting to grow you

1083
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:47,439
spend your money on the seeds you plant

1084
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:49,199
them you get fully invested and then all

1085
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,400
of a sudden you don't have a successful

1086
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:52,319
run because you can't keep your

1087
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,800
temperatures dialed in that's one of the

1088
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,640
major mindset of why i went 24 hours a

1089
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,680
day but i kind of just stuck there

1090
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:01,838
because it works perfect for my schedule

1091
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,598
i've got young kids so i need to be in

1092
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,440
and out of that garden as quick as i can

1093
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,519
and do it at any time when i get a few

1094
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,800
minutes kind of get things done so and

1095
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,320
if you're a new grower just starting out

1096
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,599
right you might not have the money for

1097
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,400
the equipment right sometimes you might

1098
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,000
need a dehumidifier with your big bucks

1099
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,838
a humidifier right if you're trying to

1100
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,920
raise that humidity heater potentially

1101
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,920
right if you're just starting out and

1102
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,760
you don't have the funds for that well a

1103
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,680
24 hour light cycle may be better for

1104
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,280
you so you can keep that stable

1105
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,559
environment so yeah really really good

1106
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,560
points i'm glad you dove into that

1107
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,719
deeper so speaking of temperature what

1108
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,639
do you aim for for temperature

1109
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,358
um i don't like to i don't like to go

1110
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:41,039
below 18 degrees celsius and i don't

1111
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:42,719
like to go above 29 degrees 30 degrees

1112
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,480
now there are going to be situations

1113
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,759
where you have no control over the

1114
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,199
temperature

1115
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,280
mother nature is right outside of a

1116
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:52,239
basement and a basement is known to

1117
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,560
retain moisture and heat and cooling

1118
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,639
depending on what time of year right so

1119
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,480
it's very difficult to keep it in those

1120
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,920
ranges but as long as you got the proper

1121
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,199
tools to do it then you're going to be

1122
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,599
okay so we've got ac infiniti fans in

1123
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,679
there for both intake and outtake we've

1124
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,680
got power fans in each corner to make

1125
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,679
sure that the move the the air is

1126
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,159
constantly moving around we've got

1127
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,598
humidifiers in each corner as well to

1128
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,598
make sure that our humidity can be

1129
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,320
dialed in and we've got a heater on

1130
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,320
standby and air conditioning on standby

1131
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,119
depending on which way those fluctuate

1132
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,000
so

1133
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:29,680
realistically 18 degrees don't go below

1134
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,599
it and 29 degrees don't go above it

1135
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:34,159
but typically what i find is seedlings

1136
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,359
are going to like that higher heat

1137
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,440
to try to get them through in that

1138
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:39,519
higher humidity and then flowers are

1139
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,679
going to like those lower temps with

1140
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,199
that lower humidity

1141
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:44,319
finishing them out to make sure that you

1142
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,719
can get

1143
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,359
perfect flowers without causing any rot

1144
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,919
or any problems whatsoever um due to

1145
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:54,639
temperature problem and that's 64

1146
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,599
degrees to 84 degrees fahrenheit for

1147
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:59,920
those of you working in fahrenheit

1148
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,680
the very few people right the very few

1149
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,800
americans right is it america's the only

1150
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,399
ones that use

1151
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,000
i think it's america i'm not sure

1152
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,200
there's a few things i use fahrenheit

1153
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,719
for but celsius is uh how we kind of do

1154
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,480
all of our temps over here in canada and

1155
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,159
maybe you too i'm not sure

1156
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,920
humidity what do you aim for for

1157
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:17,440
humidity throughout some people do

1158
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,760
different stages of growth what do you

1159
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,000
do yep so stages of growth during the

1160
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,040
seedling stage i've got my humidifiers

1161
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,920
running 24 hours a day um we're trying

1162
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:30,239
to keep our humidity 65 60

1163
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,320
70 in that range i don't want to go

1164
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,239
higher than 70 and i don't want to go

1165
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,559
lower than 60 during the seedling stage

1166
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,919
now if you don't have a humidifier some

1167
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,159
cool little tricks that you can do to

1168
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,079
keep your humidity up are spraying the

1169
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,000
walls of your tent now this can be

1170
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,640
harmful because you can obviously get

1171
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,358
mold in that situation another way is

1172
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,799
wetting a rag or a towel hanging it from

1173
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:52,719
the top of the tent

1174
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,880
um and a few other ways that you can do

1175
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,959
it is just clear cups so buy clear cups

1176
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,960
from the dollar store place it over top

1177
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,440
of your seedling it's going to help keep

1178
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,920
the humidity high by the seedling

1179
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,639
but my humidifiers help me dial it into

1180
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,800
60 to 70 percent during seedling stage

1181
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,400
and then i gradually dial that down once

1182
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,920
we're in the vegetative stage

1183
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,760
and we know that they're really healthy

1184
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,920
and they're doing well we usually drop

1185
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,599
it right around 55

1186
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,119
and then in the end

1187
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,800
flowering stage anywhere from 45 to 50

1188
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,400
and then we like to cure

1189
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,920
45 to 50

1190
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,400
with a 7 to 10 day hang so humidity is

1191
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,159
crucial if i was to tell anybody what

1192
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,160
tools you should buy first

1193
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,879
number one obviously you need a light

1194
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,559
number two i would say get a humidifier

1195
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,000
chances are you're going to have a

1196
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:41,920
humidifier before you have a

1197
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,358
dehumidifier depending on where you're

1198
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,440
growing but if you're in a basement like

1199
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,838
me you're going to need both humidifier

1200
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,280
and dehumidifier make sure that you keep

1201
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,679
stuff dialed in

1202
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,640
how about co2 are you supplementing co2

1203
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:54,318
at all

1204
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,440
um the only way that i'm supplementing

1205
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,800
co2 is with co2 enhancers from tmb

1206
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,639
naturals

1207
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,000
so i've got a few canisters around my

1208
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,639
room

1209
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,800
some people introduce them early stages

1210
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:09,358
but a lot of people would argue that uh

1211
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,240
seedlings don't need a whole lot of co2

1212
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,440
um i introduced mine around week three

1213
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:15,759
that's when i start bringing the

1214
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,079
canisters into the room uh shaking them

1215
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,960
on a daily basis trying to bring my my

1216
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,760
co2 up in the room they don't last very

1217
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,599
long they last about a week to two weeks

1218
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,079
but i do notice a huge difference i've

1219
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:31,039
never tested it to see if it's spiking

1220
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,920
on my co2 but based on just my eye

1221
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:35,519
appeal how my plants are performing and

1222
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,358
how well they're doing i would

1223
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,679
definitely recommend trying it out

1224
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:42,000
there's a few different uh manufacturers

1225
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:44,318
out there that are making co2 products

1226
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,760
uh but tmb naturals has been a fantastic

1227
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:48,480
product for me

1228
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,240
they've also got uh ph shop and ph down

1229
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,679
that i used as well so if you want to

1230
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,318
check them out i would definitely check

1231
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,960
out them for a nice affordable way to

1232
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:59,838
introduce co2 in your room i use those

1233
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,599
same canisters they sent me over a box

1234
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:03,039
of goodies and i actually did measure it

1235
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,480
and i can speak about that here real

1236
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:09,199
quick is my natural co2 ppm as measured

1237
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,760
in ppm was like 450

1238
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,919
in my grow space and then i added in the

1239
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,400
canister and i would often bring it up

1240
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,159
800 000 i think the most i've seen is

1241
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,240
1200 ppm so it definitely works i've

1242
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,318
hung it over the plants as well because

1243
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,000
they say co2 is heavy and it kind of

1244
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,239
sinks down so you can either hang it

1245
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,760
above the plants or

1246
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:32,318
play the lazy card just put it on the

1247
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,560
ground and have a fan blowing it off the

1248
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,639
ground into your grow space so i've done

1249
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,159
it both ways and honestly i measured it

1250
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,838
both ways and i didn't see much of a

1251
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:41,759
difference as long as you don't have too

1252
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,559
big of a space you could usually get

1253
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,440
away with one or two canisters which are

1254
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,119
going to run you anywhere from 30 to 35

1255
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,318
dollars i believe depending on where you

1256
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,240
live

1257
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,559
but that's awesome results i'm excited

1258
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,239
that you uh tested it because chances

1259
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,599
are in my room with with the four

1260
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,118
canisters

1261
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,440
i imagine i'm getting up around those

1262
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,160
levels as well and you touched upon how

1263
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,358
seedlings don't need as much co2 and i

1264
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,559
kind of just want to go a little bit

1265
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:09,119
deeper into this because this is a very

1266
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:10,639
common question there's a general rule

1267
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,800
out there and it's actually in my book

1268
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:14,400
as well is like you want air exchange

1269
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,800
every one to three minutes one to five

1270
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,960
minutes if the air is being changed in

1271
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,800
your growth space you're in a safe

1272
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,400
position now if your plants are just

1273
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,560
seedlings they're tiny right they don't

1274
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,639
have many leaves in order to intake that

1275
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,318
co2 right so if you're in a four foot by

1276
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:29,598
four foot grow space with some seedlings

1277
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:31,358
you're not going to need to change the

1278
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,280
air that frequently you can get away

1279
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,440
with just opening up your grow tent and

1280
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,720
waving there in and out once a day you

1281
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,880
know when it's seedlings i've gotten

1282
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,519
away with that little amount now when

1283
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,440
your plants grow bigger has more leaves

1284
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,440
maybe it's a 4x4 tent where it's

1285
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,599
wall-to-wall with plants

1286
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,920
at that point you want to have much more

1287
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,480
frequent air exchange right because

1288
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,000
they'll eat up that co2 a lot more

1289
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,358
quicker some people out there beginners

1290
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,960
you might have heard that general rule

1291
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:58,719
between one and five minutes change out

1292
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,000
the growth space but just keep your

1293
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:03,519
plant size in mind as well right 100

1294
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,920
no those are good points for sure

1295
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,440
because a lot of people uh don't

1296
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,440
understand that you need a fan to

1297
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,159
exchange the air in your grow room grow

1298
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,400
tent it's super important um but the

1299
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,559
major thing is just get started if you

1300
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,760
don't have a fan to get started at first

1301
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,440
just get in there and start getting

1302
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,960
everything going right so that's a good

1303
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,800
point i like that

1304
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,159
how about plant training what plant

1305
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,599
training techniques do you do for

1306
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:27,440
autoflowers

1307
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,318
um so believe it or not a lot of people

1308
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,480
think i'm crazy for this but uh i top

1309
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,480
every single one of my autoflowers i top

1310
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,880
them every single time

1311
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,280
one top typically around the fifth or

1312
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,559
sixth node is when i top them and that's

1313
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,280
typically right around day 13 14 15

1314
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:48,318
right in that range depending on which

1315
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,680
kind of uh plant i got going on so i top

1316
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:51,358
them and then i start low stress

1317
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,239
draining them so as soon as i top and

1318
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,239
that main stem splits all i do is take

1319
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,078
each node and tie them to the outsides

1320
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,000
of the bags so i've got the nice

1321
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,839
grommets around the grow bags and these

1322
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
tie the plants down perfectly and all

1323
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:06,078
i'm doing is adjusting them accordingly

1324
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,719
now if you don't top i still recommend

1325
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,880
using low stress training it's one very

1326
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,919
easy way to produce the higher yield in

1327
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,519
your plant and get big and better better

1328
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,358
flowers realistically at the end of the

1329
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:19,599
day if you don't want to top all i

1330
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:21,440
recommend doing is taking that main node

1331
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,599
tying it down and you just want to go

1332
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,760
clockwise or counterclockwise and start

1333
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,920
moving it around your pot on a daily

1334
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,560
basis once it ties down and comes right

1335
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,400
back up just move over a node and tire

1336
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:34,159
down and keep moving it around it's

1337
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,318
going to allow those bottom branches to

1338
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:39,118
kind of kind come up and give you a nice

1339
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:40,318
even canopy so you get more tops

1340
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,559
bigger buds

1341
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:45,759
and more product at the end of the day

1342
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:47,358
gotcha gotcha yep good stuff there

1343
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,640
do you do anything particular to prevent

1344
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:49,598
pests

1345
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,879
um

1346
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:56,160
i don't uh but my wife does for sure um

1347
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,838
my wife is uh is a cleaner um so number

1348
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:00,159
one there's two ways you can get past

1349
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,480
number one would be having a dirty grow

1350
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:04,239
room so you really need to make sure

1351
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,559
that you're you're cleaning these tents

1352
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:08,399
out or cleaning your grow room out um

1353
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,279
and come up the solution that works best

1354
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,358
for you now over here we clean it we mop

1355
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,119
it we wipe it down with soap and water

1356
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:17,358
and then we come back with a peroxide

1357
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,358
water mix we spray our walls all down to

1358
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,960
try to kill anything that's still in

1359
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:22,719
there i know there's some people out

1360
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,400
there that use bleach

1361
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,000
and things along those lines i don't

1362
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,079
bring anything like that into my grow

1363
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,559
room and then the major thing is when

1364
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,720
you're using soil you don't want to over

1365
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,239
water over watering is definitely going

1366
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,639
to stunt the growth of your plants but

1367
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,358
it's also going to invite pests in to

1368
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:42,078
lay eggs in your soil and you don't want

1369
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:44,400
pests now knock on wood i've only had

1370
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,079
them a few times over here my wife is

1371
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,039
very due diligent and she makes sure

1372
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,720
that the grow room is thick and span um

1373
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,159
i made a couple videos where i had like

1374
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:53,759
a little bit of dirt on the ground and

1375
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:55,759
she's like can't be showing dirt like

1376
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,040
that she's the type of mom that like you

1377
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,319
need to make the beds if people are

1378
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:00,800
coming over because they're going to run

1379
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,880
upstairs and see if your bed's unmade so

1380
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,200
pests are definitely an issue you need

1381
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,559
if you need to take precautions having a

1382
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:10,399
clean room having dry soil um

1383
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,920
well not all dry all the time but just

1384
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,760
make sure that it's not staying wet for

1385
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,318
too long that way there your pests don't

1386
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,319
come in and take over your grow room

1387
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:20,239
as for uh sprays and things like that i

1388
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:23,440
have a few things on standby but knock

1389
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:24,558
on wood i've had pretty good runs with

1390
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,000
no pest

1391
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:29,839
i hope you didn't jinx me on this one

1392
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
yeah just blame it on me if you get past

1393
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,409
right yeah we'll be making a video to

1394
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,880
blame it on you for sure

1395
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:36,639
[Laughter]

1396
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,160
yeah you actually have a video on

1397
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:41,199
cleaning your grow room i watched that

1398
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:44,078
one and just to reiterate your mixture

1399
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:46,239
here you had one part is it hydrogen

1400
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,318
peroxide to three parts water is that

1401
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:50,399
right that's right okay and that'll kill

1402
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:52,719
all the bad bacteria bad and good

1403
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,720
bacteria actually kind of sterilizes the

1404
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:57,439
growth it's basically a cheap affordable

1405
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,679
way to sterilize your grow room and make

1406
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,440
sure that there is any residue or any

1407
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,440
mold or anything sticking around that

1408
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,880
it's going to try to kill it

1409
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,720
the other thing is just make sure when

1410
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,358
you're watering or you're in there with

1411
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:10,719
water wipe up your water immediately i

1412
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:12,719
know sometimes we can get in there and

1413
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:14,159
get lazy and we spill a bit of water or

1414
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:15,679
we're mixing our nutrients and they'll

1415
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,239
spill in the tent

1416
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:20,000
just clean it up take the time to really

1417
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:22,239
kind of clean all your products clean

1418
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,760
your gear and get ready for a new run

1419
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,439
because there's nothing worse being

1420
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,040
halfway through a grow and then you're

1421
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,318
wondering what's going on and you look

1422
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,480
underneath your leaves and you've got

1423
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:33,199
bugs or you've got bugs moving around in

1424
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,159
your soil and it's very discouraging and

1425
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:38,639
really ruin a gardener's experience so

1426
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:41,118
cleanliness is number one over here for

1427
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,400
sure all right a couple more things so

1428
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,920
when you're growing your plants you're

1429
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,280
feeding your your autoflowers all the

1430
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,920
way up until what point are you giving

1431
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,160
your plant a period of like a flush

1432
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,079
period or leaching some people will stop

1433
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,519
nutrients two weeks prior to harvest for

1434
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,359
example some people will feed all the

1435
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:59,599
way up at the end what do you do

1436
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:01,759
um so what i try to do so it all depends

1437
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,760
on when i think the the autoflower is

1438
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,240
going to finish so based on what what

1439
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,240
kind of brand uh you're growing you're

1440
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:09,519
going to find that certain autoflowers

1441
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:11,439
are going to be nine weeks some are

1442
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:14,159
going to be 10 some are going to be 12.

1443
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,920
i try to stop typically two weeks before

1444
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,598
i think they're going to be finished i

1445
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,880
dial back all nutrients and get rid of

1446
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,800
them completely

1447
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,599
and i just start to flush with ph

1448
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:26,480
balanced water now i'm ph in this water

1449
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,400
at 6.0 to 6.3 as well

1450
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,039
um and i've got a table set up in there

1451
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,200
with a mesh top on it so i take my plant

1452
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:35,119
i put it on top of the mat the the mesh

1453
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:37,759
stand i put a five gallon bucket under

1454
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,519
it and i'm soaking it until the runoff

1455
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,960
is completely running through and i'm

1456
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:43,519
getting enough to test down at the

1457
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,440
bottom i want to get my ppm down i want

1458
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,199
to come back down to that to that

1459
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,880
seedling stage around four or five

1460
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:51,919
hundred and if i can even get it lower

1461
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,519
than that if i have ro water sorry on

1462
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,480
standby then i'll even try to get it

1463
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:56,400
lower

1464
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,280
but i definitely think a flush makes a

1465
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,000
huge difference i've ran a test over

1466
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,880
here where i ran the exact same

1467
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,960
strain and tested them so one was

1468
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,119
flushed one wasn't and you notice a

1469
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,358
major difference when you try these

1470
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,039
later on so i do flush and i do

1471
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:15,199
recommend it it's just a matter of

1472
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:17,279
timing it perfectly so you can get all

1473
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:19,279
those nutrients out uh before they're

1474
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,599
not taken up anymore and you gotta chop

1475
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,079
and trim and dry and all that terrible

1476
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:27,440
stuff that we all hate doing so a common

1477
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,880
practice before harvesting is to give

1478
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,838
some folks will give their plants a

1479
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,039
period of darkness before harvest do you

1480
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:35,920
do that at all

1481
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:37,599
um to be honest with you i'm i have and

1482
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,400
i haven't there's all kinds of crazy

1483
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,559
things out there and speculations i'm

1484
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,358
not quite sure if it works i've done it

1485
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,040
before i've also taken ice and put ice

1486
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,679
on my pot

1487
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:51,279
ice the water down so that i i guess

1488
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,480
what some people say is that it makes

1489
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,160
the plant

1490
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,760
think that it's fall and it starts

1491
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:58,399
changing the colors and bringing out

1492
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,640
color content um and making the plant

1493
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,880
think that it's done it's dying so i

1494
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:04,318
have done that too um i've done the

1495
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,240
darkness i've done all kinds of

1496
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:08,639
craziness in there i'm actually thinking

1497
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,318
about putting a spoof video together um

1498
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,480
about absolutely ridiculous things that

1499
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:14,480
you do to your dance your plants before

1500
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,920
harvest i think it'd be funny because we

1501
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,719
all have so many

1502
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,159
ridiculous con ridiculous ideas of what

1503
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:22,000
works and what doesn't work but i don't

1504
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,318
think there's any science background on

1505
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
it so we'll have to see maybe eventually

1506
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:27,679
they'll come out and tell us if it works

1507
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,760
maybe it does maybe you know

1508
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:32,000
uh something chris yeah i mean that the

1509
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,440
thought process behind it is you know i

1510
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,760
touched on this earlier secondary

1511
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,119
metabolites are happen during lights off

1512
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,359
right that resin production happens

1513
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,358
during lights off so the theory behind

1514
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,598
it is that it's going to provide more

1515
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:45,039
resin on your plants trichomes on your

1516
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,280
plants yeah so

1517
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,960
do we do we know if it works or is it is

1518
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,200
it opening some people have done studies

1519
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,679
if you look at uh if you search lost

1520
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:56,318
leaf i believe it is he did a study i

1521
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:57,838
think he measured thc i'm not sure if he

1522
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:00,639
measured the

1523
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:02,719
terpene profile or not i can't remember

1524
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,719
but he does some into his own individual

1525
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:06,959
studies i don't think there's been any

1526
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:08,480
large studies that have been repeatable

1527
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,920
that show that so

1528
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,920
yeah i think it's still up in the air

1529
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,000
right now for sure you see everyone

1530
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,800
posting this two hours a day or two days

1531
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,639
of darkness 48 hours of darkness and uh

1532
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,000
everyone's getting excited right so

1533
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,440
we definitely do it i don't know if it

1534
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,280
makes a difference but in my heart it

1535
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,159
doesn't hurt in my heart it does it

1536
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,359
makes a difference in my heart

1537
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:28,799
i don't think it will hurt the plan at

1538
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:30,480
all right it's not no it's not gonna

1539
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,920
harm rental at all all right so is there

1540
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,719
any other advice you can think of that

1541
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,960
you

1542
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:37,039
would give people who are new to growing

1543
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,280
autoflowers um if you're new to growing

1544
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,480
autoflowers just stick with it you're

1545
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,640
definitely going to get little

1546
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,639
itty-bitty babies at first

1547
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:46,400
but the more you dial in your process

1548
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,078
the better you're going to get and keep

1549
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,079
in mind there's a lot of people on these

1550
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,000
platforms that are growing and they're

1551
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,079
all doing a fantastic job but there's so

1552
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,039
many variables that come into play so

1553
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,640
you can't take a cookie cutter gardening

1554
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,639
experience and put it into your room and

1555
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:02,960
expect it to work you're gonna have to

1556
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:04,558
change it up so the main thing is find a

1557
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,240
medium that you think you might like

1558
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,319
find a light that you're gonna like

1559
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:10,639
start picking away your gear as you get

1560
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:12,239
going you're gonna save money eventually

1561
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,558
so the main thing is to get started

1562
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:16,719
growing so you can have some fun grow

1563
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,680
some product and save some money and at

1564
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:20,000
the end of the day you're going to get

1565
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:21,598
better product than you're buying

1566
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,358
realistically chris the main thing is

1567
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,680
just get started man

1568
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:27,838
don't be discouraged by all these

1569
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:29,519
awesome growers on these platforms at

1570
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,199
the end of the day we all make mistakes

1571
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:33,119
and we just don't show them on our

1572
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:35,919
platforms because well no one wants to

1573
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,960
look at a shitty plant right well said

1574
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,039
for sure

1575
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,480
so wrapping things up how can listeners

1576
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:42,800

gallon available and they come with the

1592
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:15,358
built-in low stress training grommets
