into the topic uh today what we're going

74
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,759
to talk about is maximizing yield with

75
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,560
auto flowers so you are an expert when

76
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:53,359
it comes to autos and you do techniques

77
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,360
that are proven to work so want to hear

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,440
all about it in this episode but first

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,400
can you tell us a little bit about

80
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:00,479
yourself and how you got into gardening

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,640
well I'm Sebastian I call myself

82
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,479
Sebastian good don't ask me why I just

83
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,559
needed another like I didn't want to go

84
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:10,158
with my real last name you know like

85
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,439
still living in a somewhat prohibition

86
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,000
country in uh Spain right now even

87
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,280
though we might change we might move

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,239
move away we have been on the road for a

89
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:23,560
little while um I've been in contact

90
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:27,120
with the plan for like 25 years you know

91
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,080
it's like I I consumed it when I was

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,640
young teenager and I realized this is

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,280
something for me I'm into it um I've

94
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:39,679
been gardening

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,640
like you know this plan for like

96
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,519
seriously for a good 10 years something

97
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:48,958
like that um in between of course I like

98
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,319
through us a few seeds like AA style in

99
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,719
the woods or something like that but

100
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,238
like I don't really want to count that

101
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:58,039
because that's not like when I really

102
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,759
started fully emerging trying to really

103
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:04,318
get better and better you know let's say

104
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:06,798
doing it indoors kind of and a few years

105
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:10,078
back maybe about four four and a half

106
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,280
years back something like that I wanted

107
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,599
to change in my life I wanted

108
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,079
to and I pitched a podcast to fast buds

109
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,599
you know and talking about you know

110
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,240
their because I love their products I

111
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,960
love their strains and um and I pitched

112
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,759
it to them and they said yes we don't

113
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:28,918
wanted audio we wanted video so I added

114
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,319
the video to it and the rest is history

115
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:31,680
let's put it that way

116
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,918
that's so cool yeah that's how I know

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,280
you from Fast buds I met you over at the

118
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:39,918
booth at MJ biscon and uh man it was

119
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,799
such a good time there it was amazing I

120
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:45,399
mean and like you know meeting each

121
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,199
other because we all do similar things

122
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:52,519
you know we are full on 100% in for this

123
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,879
plan you know I think uh we probably all

124
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:58,639
got some uh bad talks from our wives

125
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,879
sometimes before because they were like

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,560
this is too much dude you know like you

127
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,079
now you have a family this is just too

128
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,319
much you know you have to like you know

129
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:10,319

of course Joe and all coming together is

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,199
just like it it's like a a field trip

135
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,560
kind of but with people you kind of know

136
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,919
but you don't really know in person so

137
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,000
it's just like fantastic you know just

138
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:38,359
like good good times it was a memorable

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,918
week for sure and I'm looking forward to

140
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,000
MJ bcon this year in 2024 so it's

141
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:47,198
exciting so let's get into Auto flowers

142
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,360
I want to start with the basics can you

143
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,720
start by explaining the basics of autof

144
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,919
flowers and why they're so popular

145
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,319
amongst Growers that are looking to

146
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,038
maximize yields well I mean all the

147
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,280
flowers

148
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:03,240
are rudal

149
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:05,119
that's the gene right so they're not

150
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,439
they have some Indica they have some

151
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,598
sativa rarely only one or the other you

152
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:14,680
know there and they have some rales and

153
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:17,719
the special thing about rales is that it

154
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,439
is not photo photodependent

155
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,960
like doesn't need light to flower it

156
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,839
needs Darkness to flower so if we have

157
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,758
um photoperiodic strengths they need a

158
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:32,959
certain Darkness period and that is like

159
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:37,520
to go into flower that's why we shift

160
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:41,638
our light cycle to 1212 um

161
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:47,279
rales doesn't need that right because it

162
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:50,680
basically is an skp into it became feral

163
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,439
um it's most likely uh is a descendant

164
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,319
of

165
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:58,439
sativa and it grew in these very

166
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,039
Northern regions like in in Russia and

167
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,079
in Eastern Europe

168
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:06,038
and it had very very very short Summers

169
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:09,359
so it to survive it basically through

170
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:11,918
through mutation it developed this

171
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,598
ability to flower

172
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,598
without with not caring because they

173
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:18,319
Summers they are have very very very

174
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:21,199
long sunlights but they're very very

175
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,879
very short so

176
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,160
and many people experimented with this

177
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,840
ditch you know this ditch plant some

178
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,240
people call it and

179
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,038
they a lot of people gave up on it

180
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,000
because they didn't really see that it

181
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,199
they didn't really see it going like for

182
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,478
for example Neville shmaker I don't know

183
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,919
if it if if that rings a bell you know

184
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:49,719
he is like a um a breeder of the very

185
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:52,000
very first like he collected uh genetics

186
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,840
from all over the world and in Amsterdam

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,720
bred like stuff like the original Haze

188
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,359
and stuff like that so really iconic

189
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,000
things basically building Stones he

190
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:07,158
already um experimented with this rales

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,680
in the' 70s but he didn't see it going

192
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:11,478
anywhere because it's it is a recessive

193
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,918
trade and it makes everything in the

194
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:16,038
beginning smaller that's why when we go

195
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,598
then a few steps further like you know

196
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:21,759
in the 2000s more or less when Sasha

197
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,560
from Doctor's Choice also called the

198
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,158
joint doctor he came out with low rider

199
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,519
which was the first commercially

200
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:31,759
available Autoflower in the world and

201
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,639
when he came out with it he basically

202
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,278
bred for this he was a student at that

203
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:38,360
time and he wanted to have a strain

204
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:41,200
which is stay small and is quick and a

205
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,399
stealth you know but it only got like ye

206
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,680
big you know like only like a foot tall

207
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,559
something like that but it also was done

208
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:51,559
after like 8 n weeks you know full full

209
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,079
circle not just flower

210
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:56,359
and I think a lot of people in that

211
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,360
point were just thinking it's like a

212
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,360
novelty kind of thing and didn't think

213
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,839
it through because the positive thing

214
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,839
why breeding with it took off so fast in

215
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:10,279
only 20 years is because the life cyle

216
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,480
cycle is so short right if I have other

217
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:13,759
varieties I need so much more time I can

218
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,959
maybe have

219
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:19,519
two two different uh you know

220
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,479
Generations per year and that's a Max I

221
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,078
mean who am I talking to you know how

222
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,360
long it it takes to develop a strain you

223
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:30,359
know you did it yourself um just imagine

224
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,360
now you have an 8we life cycle like you

225
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,680
have you can speed this whole whole

226
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,159
process up so

227
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:43,078
much and that's why we are got so fast

228
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:45,159
so far with Autos you know because

229
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,319
everybody is just looking for that one

230
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:49,278
one one single trade and if you have a

231
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,399
big enough populations if you like you

232
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,159
know go on bigger feno Huns and you

233
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,399
really pick the ones oh I want the big

234
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,879
ones and I want the ones which are yummy

235
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,559
but they all still had need to have that

236
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,799
UT flowering trade and you really do

237
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:06,479
selective breeding that's how we are at

238
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:10,799
this amazing positions that we are have

239
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:14,360
regular varieties which can compete

240
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:18,078
against photo periodic strains but much

241
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,519
faster end with this special trade of

242
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,958
not needing to change the photo period

243
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,799
that's pretty cool I didn't know a lot

244
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,199
about a lot of that history that you

245
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:28,039
just mentioned that that's really really

246
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,839
cool to hear and yeah as far as them

247
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:33,919
being real short flowering period I mean

248
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,440
you can add in a whole another cycle for

249
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,679
that year if you're going just Autos

250
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,600
right to it's so fast I mean some of the

251
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,919
Autos I've I've grown are like 75 days

252
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,560
from Sprout to harvest you know I mean

253
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,399
there are some they even quicker than

254
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:51,638
that right I mean you're looking at what

255
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:55,120
55 60 days from Sprout to harvest like

256
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:57,039
that's super fast exactly I just needed

257
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,679
to prove it I will come out with a video

258
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,759
very very soon on the fast buds YouTube

259
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:04,919
which will be how to grow Autos fast and

260
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,360
that does not include it's the exact

261
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:08,278
opposite of what we're talking about

262
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,600
maximize yield right I did something

263
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:14,360
completely different I wanted to prove

264
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:17,680
that I can grow an OT flow from seed to

265
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,159
harvest and under 8 weeks and in 55 days

266
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,958
I grew our Lemon Cherry cookies in my

267
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,958
Caravan right now that's why it looks so

268
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,719
funny here behind me and stuff I'm

269
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:28,399
sitting actually in a caravan I've been

270
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,440
touring all through Europe 8,000 kilm

271
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:35,320
what's that like ,000 Mi something like

272
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:37,120
that 5,000 Mi and I grew a plant in like

273
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,839
a little grow boox touring through

274
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,039
Europe and within 55 days I grew her

275
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,680
from sea to harvest as I said of course

276
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,159
you can't expect them to um have the

277
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,519
highest yeld if you want to be the

278
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:53,679
fastest not you can't have everything

279
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:56,879
you know but I did it and I am happy

280
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,879
because I can now talk with people about

281
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,838
even more I learned even more about it

282
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,919
you know I mean every time when we when

283
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,000
we grow we learn more every day that

284
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:08,838
otherwise we're doing something wrong

285
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,240
but yeah I did it I did it I did I'm I'm

286
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,720
a bit I'm I'm a little bit proud of

287
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,680
myself for doing that because I only had

288
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,720
one single plant and I could have missed

289
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,120
that messed that up you know and I made

290
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,320
updates about that plant on social media

291
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,039
every week there wasn't like not like

292
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
the possibility to have something in the

293
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:27,319
background to just like come on let's

294
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,399
switch that one you know or this one

295
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,720
doesn't look so good you know so um I'm

296
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,000
happy about

297
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,278
it that's awesome I'm looking forward to

298
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,679
seeing that so I know a lot of people

299
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:42,639
who are wondering growing medium

300
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,239
certainly has a big impact on yield

301
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,198
container size that's another thing that

302
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,720
kind of goes hand inand and you can

303
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:50,838
certainly yield can certainly be

304
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,360
impacted by that choice what are your

305
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,839
recommendations for what growing medium

306
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,800
and what container size and type to use

307
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,160
when growing Autos I mean you know like

308
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,000
let's put myself aside we're talking

309
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:06,519
about maximizing yield and if you want

310
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,958
to have a uh always maximizing yield and

311
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,320
you want to bank on that I mean that

312
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:13,399
doesn't matter what you grow you got to

313
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,160
most likely go dwc because you will have

314
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,919
bigger yields and it doesn't matter if

315
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:20,278
you have photos or AOS it just doesn't

316
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:23,278
matter at all I personally don't I'm

317
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:25,519
like the nature kind of guy but let's so

318
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,838
let's come from the perspective soil

319
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:32,879
right like I would always and I that's

320
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:36,320
one very very important thing um Autos

321
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,399
need a very very airy soil right they

322
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,079
need to

323
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:42,278
have when any even if you have a light

324
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:45,479
mix or something throw some extra peite

325
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:47,159
in it me personally promise you know um

326
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,800
or whatever you can get your fingers on

327
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:53,120
they need that extra air on their Roots

328
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:57,639
just to be able to spread and fill out

329
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,480
the entire entire planter and then we

330
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:02,039
come to The Container sizes the other

331
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,278
thing of course container Size Matters

332
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:08,480
and nowhere else does it matter as much

333
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:11,320
as UT flowers because if you want to

334
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,159
have huge Autos you will need to give

335
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:18,079
her oversized pots right I mean you can

336
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:20,958
grow in smaller parts too but it will go

337
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,599
down and as long as goes down it will

338
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,559
just you know it knows it basically like

339
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,680
figures out oh this is how much space I

340
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,159
have this is how big I can get because

341
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,599
that's

342
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:36,519
one of the main factors which will uh

343
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,000
determine on how big it gets because if

344
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,440
you just put it in a tiny container

345
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,519
that's by the by the way one of the

346
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,079
tricks how I grew it so fast I put it in

347
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,679
a just not in a tiny container that

348
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:49,679
doesn't matter how wide it is it could

349
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:52,559
be super wide if it is only very short

350
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:55,278
it shallow right that is the key it you

351
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,559
needs to be a deep not a shallow the

352
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:00,120
exact opposite a deep container so that

353
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:03,439
the tap route can go really far down

354
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:09,679
really far down and then you have

355
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:13,160
Airy soil or Airy medium and a deep

356
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:15,519
container and that are the two huge

357
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:18,360
factors which you which will help you

358
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,919
grow and maximize your yield in a of

359
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,600
flour big of the roots biger the fruits

360
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:25,078
is what a lot of people say and uh that

361
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,879
definitely holds true I know a lot of

362
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:30,359
folks that grow autos and they say 5

363
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:32,799
gallon container orar ler you know or

364
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,159
some people say s gon container or

365
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,159
larger so they're going after these

366
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,799
larger containers and uh they're often

367
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:40,519
just planting the seed directly in there

368
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,838
and not doing any transplanting which

369
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:43,318
we're going to talk about transplanting

370
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,319
here in a little bit but first I want to

371
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:48,679
ask about nutrient lineups so when

372
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:50,639
growing Autos in particular what

373
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:53,838
specific nutrient lineups or additives

374
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,399
are most effective to me look I'm a I'm

375
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,759
a I'm a living soil grower for me I'm

376
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,958
trying to feed my soil and if my soil is

377
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,480
is is healthy and happy then I don't

378
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:06,039
have to pour so much on the top right I

379
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,839
rather have everything in my amended in

380
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:13,958
my soil already and then my microbes and

381
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:17,199
my fungi and my um you know bacteria

382
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:20,679
they will help to feed my plant and my

383
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:23,399
plant will just take whatever it needs

384
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:26,159
right um there are people and now we're

385
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,759
coming back a little bit to this this

386
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:32,559
container size there are people I know

387
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,000
they I want to use them as an example

388
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,919
because these are the people who I know

389
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
who grew grow some of the biggest OT

390
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,838
flowers I've ever seen anywhere and that

391
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,879
is kanos I don't know if you have heard

392
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:47,079
of him he's in Canada and auto grows

393
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:48,679
whales obviously somewhere in Wales and

394
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:52,159
they have this

395
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:56,439
system and it is I think they use monkey

396
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:59,958
nutrients it's a it's a mineral based

397
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,720
line but what they do is they have these

398
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:05,399
giant pots I don't even know how big

399
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,120
they are like 15 gallon or something

400
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,000
like really big relatively deep they

401
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:13,000
stand on the self watering basis and

402
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,679
they're not autopots but the other one

403
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,640
Mega pots I think they call themselves

404
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,000
and then they add an additional Air Base

405
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,360
because as I said a flowers love this

406
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,558
Airy soil right so if you add an extra

407
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:31,918
boost of oxygen in it will help

408
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:34,480
the plant to uptake not only the water

409
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,280
but also the nutrients and these guys

410
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,880
have grown with this setup Mega pots

411
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,759
with monkey

412
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,320
nutrients multiple times reproducible um

413
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:48,160
OT flowers which yield more than a pound

414
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,720
one plant that's a pretty good yield

415
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,480
there yeah I've actually never heard of

416
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,400
monkey nutrients I have to look into

417
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,038
them not sure if they're think it might

418
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,840
be British I think it might be British I

419
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:02,038
I'm sure I'm sure you can do that with a

420
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,199
lot of nutrient lines what I would

421
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:07,759
always suggest is don't start

422
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:11,759
overfeeding your Autos right less is

423
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:14,400
more especially in the beginning because

424
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,440
if you overfeed them you might burn them

425
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,440
when you have a photo periodic plan ah

426
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,759
no problem just give her two weeks extra

427
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:24,720
uh-uh the uto will say no ah stress ah

428
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,440
flow and then you have a foot tall PL

429
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,120
and you're you know and you're not going

430
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:33,000
to maximize your yield so in in that

431
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,798
sense less is more don't overdo it and

432
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,119
for me and I think we talked about this

433
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:42,639
before and um when you were on fastbuds

434
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:47,759
talks for me adding microbes

435
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:50,919
adding fungi adding all this to my soil

436
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:53,558
even if you are feeding mineral-based

437
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,200
nutrients it certainly won't hurt your

438
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:59,399
plant you know it will certainly just

439
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,319
help your plants uptake more food and

440
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,798
more

441
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,200
food more Bud good to know yeah I mostly

442
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:06,798
use when growing Autos I'm trying to

443
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,240
think say I've only grown about two

444
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:12,359
dozen Auto flower plants total I'm a

445
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,200
photo guy but for my little bit of

446
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,119
experience growing Autos I I've grown

447
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,279
with Fox Farm Trio had some really good

448
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:20,879
results with them blue planet nutrients

449
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,359
I've grown them organically so I've

450
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,600
grown them a wide different ways

451
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:26,599
Advanced Nutrients great people with

452
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,279
Athena have great results like I mean we

453
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:31,079
could we could keep on keep on going and

454
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,678
if you want to have like the more Bo

455
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:36,519
kind of line I know people who grow fire

456
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,240
bud with with with Bob Biz you know and

457
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:41,720
for me personally I'm not there I don't

458
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,599
have my nutrient line I and I think we

459
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,839
talked about this before it's like it's

460
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,759
you experience with experiment with

461
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:52,079
things back and forth back and forth you

462
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,960
know and no I I I mean I'm not set I I

463
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,038
don't really want to mess with

464
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,640
mineral-based nutrients so much it's not

465
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:01,919
like me cuz I think we didn't talk about

466
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,960
this in the beginning like I grew up

467
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,159
planting like my family has Gardens my

468
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,240
great-grandfather was a gardener like he

469
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:11,679
was growing flowers you know he had a

470
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:16,880
flower shop and so on so it's kind of

471
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:20,240
with me in my blood I want to say and

472
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,919
for that it's I think I understood very

473
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,720
early on that like if I'm good if I have

474
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,440
good soil and if I make sure that my

475
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,640
soil is alive and has everything

476
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,038
everybody needs then I don't have to

477
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,080
worry so much about like force feeding

478
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:35,839
anybody yeah with the Organics a lot of

479
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,678
people swear by the flavor as well which

480
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,519
is a different conversation here we

481
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,919
won't get into that but uh you can

482
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,879
certainly get some really good good

483
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,038
results on The Organic side of things I

484
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,440
want to get into light schedules so you

485
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:50,359
already talked about how autoflowers can

486
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,840
stay on the same light schedule what is

487
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,079
the ideal light schedule though a lot of

488
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,279
people doing 18 hours will Lights On 6

489
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,759
hours off some people 20 hours will

490
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,599
lights on 4 hours off some people people

491
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:04,720
doing continuous 24 hours with the

492
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:06,079
lights on zero off is that better what

493
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,480
light schedule do you personally

494
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,119
recommend and also if you can get into

495
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,319
types of light right are you talking

496
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:13,439
about like a full spectrum LED light is

497
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,119
that going to be better than your

498
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,840
traditional HPS like the MH HPS combo or

499
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:22,798
what yeah that's now a

500
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:25,759
philosophy with Auto RS and lights like

501
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,879
those right so when I like back in the

502
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,240
day I was I was just because they really

503
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,440
don't give it damn that much really like

504
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,759
I mean I I used to have fantastic

505
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,919
results with having a 71 schedule isn't

506
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,960
that funny because they were

507
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,000
recommending my light to be turned off

508
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,400
every never on longer than 8 hours so I

509
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,440
only let it run 7 hours haded an hour

510
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:51,120
off S hours haded an hour off seven

511
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,120
hours I'm away from that I'm away from

512
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:58,119
that but yeah it's hard to say it's

513
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:59,519
really really hard to say um Autos love

514
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:03,199
life

515
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:06,519
but everybody needs some sleep sometimes

516
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:10,278
so no matter what schedule you

517
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:13,038
go I would give them just out of

518
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:15,359
kindness give them some rest sometimes

519
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:18,720
right so but

520
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:21,119
then again I'm talking about kenos he

521
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,759
runs 24/7 I'm pretty sure and he's

522
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:30,158
growing pound Autos there so like um not

523
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:32,759
true I would suggest to run if you don't

524
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,400
care about electricity bill I would not

525
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:38,558
just run an 186 light schedule I

526
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:42,240
personally but the amount you get more

527
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:44,359
out of it or better the amount you the

528
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,240
time you will be faster with running

529
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:50,119
like a 24 or even a 222 or something

530
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,679
like that or even a

531
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:57,199
240 is not it is not justified by

532
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,480
spending that money and we all know how

533
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,319
expensive you know you know electricity

534
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,679
is by now and if we already talking

535
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,759
about maximizing yield we probably want

536
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,880
to try to keep the ratio of the amount

537
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:13,319
of money we spend to what will we get

538
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,440
out in the end at a reasonable level so

539
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:20,720
my last run for the Autoflower World Cup

540
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:23,640
was uh I was running um them 24/7

541
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,759
for 6 weeks or something like that and

542
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,919
after 6 weeks I got got them down to

543
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:33,158
like I think like 195 something like

544
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:35,799
that so you see I prefer towards the end

545
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:38,240
of flower to amp up the light to really

546
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:40,519
give them even maybe hang an extra light

547
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,720
in there what you said like maybe even

548
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:48,879
hang an HPS on top of it right basically

549
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,798
just fry them with light but to give

550
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,840
them some breaks in between you know

551
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:56,480
while in the vegetative face they really

552
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:59,158
don't give a damn in the end to be

553
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,720
honest with you you know and unless you

554
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:07,720
start going less than 186 you know don't

555
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:09,558
go like you know like 1212 or 1410 or we

556
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,679
can keep on doing that I wouldn't go

557
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:15,879
under the 186 ever for no reason other

558
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,798
than if you believe in this Theory you

559
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,520
want to shut them the lights off the

560
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:20,599
last two days before you know you

561
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,480
harvest

562
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:25,879
them but I've never really seen any much

563
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,519
of a difference in that I actually was

564
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,320
forced to put autos on a 1212 before

565
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:33,480
just cuz my whole 10 I had some photos

566
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:35,480
in in Autos mixed so I had to do it and

567
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,240
I didn't get as good as a result as I

568
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,000
would have if I kept it on an 186 light

569
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,079
cycle or or something longer than that

570
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,558
so I'm you right there yeah 100% like

571
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,359
but it's doesn't mean you can't grow

572
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:50,038
Autos in between like there for example

573
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,759
like where you are for example right you

574
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:53,720
have really humidity issues like you

575
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,519
have very low humidity right so it's

576
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,839
probably very you probably have a

577
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:01,960
humidifier running 24/7 basically in

578
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,639
your in your setup so it won't hurt if

579
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,759
you have the extra space and you're not

580
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,520
worried about that you have issues with

581
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:11,759
light with air circulation or something

582
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:14,720
adding a few extra Autos in your 10 just

583
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:17,558
for the fun of it and the transpiration

584
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,360
you know but the more soil you have in

585
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:22,278
there the more plants you have in there

586
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,678
the more humidity automatically comes

587
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:26,519
comes in there so that doesn't that

588
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:28,360
doesn't hurt you know just to amp up the

589
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,480
humidity and then if you have to switch

590
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:34,319
to 1212 I mean I mean you'll you know

591
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:37,360
you just won't have the that big of a

592
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:39,398
yield but you know that before you start

593
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,558
good point how about environment

594
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:43,719
conditions I'm talking temperature

595
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:47,879
relative humidity what do you typically

596
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:52,519
aim for when trying to maximize yield

597
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,840
cold big big when it's hot Autos won't

598
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:56,558
grow as

599
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,879
tall you know when they see hey summer

600
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:02,759
is here yay let's go you know

601
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,039
super intense light super uh uh um uh uh

602
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:07,240
warm temperatures you know doesn't let

603
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,440
let's talk about the humidity in in a

604
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,679
minute but just these factors together

605
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:18,720
they will make Auto flowers grow less

606
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:20,679
tall therefore faster right and so I

607
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,360
would always try to suggest keep your

608
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:26,120
temperatures like so now we're going to

609
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:29,798
go I have to uh do the math um because

610
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:32,678
I'm back for too long back in Europe I

611
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:35,720
don't have the Fahrenheits on my things

612
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:38,080
I would try to keep my keep my uh grow

613
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,600
especially in the first 5 weeks under

614
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:44,398
25° Celsius so what's that 70 something

615
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:47,359
77 degrees Fahrenheit yeah so like let

616
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:51,519
say 70 rather keep him by 75 you know

617
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:54,519
and I wouldn't go obviously under like

618
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,639
68 I mean like really I wouldn't try to

619
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:59,038
try keep it in that range in the

620
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,440
beginning especially

621
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:05,079
and you will just have taller

622
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,798
plans also don't necessarily if you want

623
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:10,558
to maximize your yield amp your light up

624
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:12,158
in the very beginning right they if they

625
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,639
search a little bit for the light they

626
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,840
stretch more they stretch more stretch

627
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,480
more and then if they're a bit more

628
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:18,759
stretch if they're taller obviously in

629
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,599
the end there will be bigger plants you

630
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:22,720
know what was the rain we have a lot of

631
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:24,678
people that do Celsius what was the rain

632
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,640
you said 25 as the high what was the low

633
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:30,080
for Celsius no let's let's say 21 22

634
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,159
let's say 20 to 25 especially in the

635
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:35,558
beginning once we come more towards

636
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,799
flower I don't mind so much I mean you

637
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:42,440
can go up higher you can go up to like

638
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:44,759
27 28 but one eventually once we go

639
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,558
higher than that we're going to fry our

640
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:49,359
tarps out right and we want something

641
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:53,599
delicious so we need to The Sweet Spot

642
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:55,879
is between 20 and 27° I'd say and then

643
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:59,639
obviously the humidity depends very much

644
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:02,000
in in what part of the grow Stadium you

645
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,759
are right just like it is with photo

646
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,798
periodic I don't think that the actual

647
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:08,879
humidity is that different from photo

648
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:11,200
periodic

649
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,880
strengths just keep them very in the

650
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,440
first week or so like I keep them at 70%

651
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,080
something like that so just like you

652
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,720
know you have the and there you also

653
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,599
have to be but this is the same again

654
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,038
with photo periodic St they need enough

655
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,839
light they can stress them with the

656
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:28,200
light on top of that you if you make a

657
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,079
way too hot they will just stretch like

658
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,080
crazy you know and you have like these

659
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:35,439
like asparagus standing around got it so

660
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,319
you hear a lot of people say genetics

661
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,360
genetics genetics it's all about

662
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:42,439
genetics how important is the choice of

663
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:44,479
strain when aiming for high yields with

664
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,159
auto flowers and can you recommend some

665
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,038
top performing strains but I always love

666
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:53,559
to say you

667
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:56,919
can you can mess up any genetics but you

668
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:58,678
can't grow something fantastic out of

669
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:02,000
trash genetics

670
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:04,919
right I mean if the if the if the if the

671
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,278
if the information isn't there no matter

672
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,720
if it's you or anybody who is like you

673
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:13,519
know the most Pro grower if you have

674
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:18,519
have not good genetics it will just not

675
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:21,960
it will just not work as well and um in

676
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:26,359
terms of genetics high yield it always

677
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:30,240
helps with Autos if you if they have at

678
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:34,079
least like 50% sativa at least right

679
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,679
because we know sativas are just not as

680
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:40,359
fast

681
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:42,840
as as indicas and fast is in this sense

682
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:46,359
our enemy because we do not have that

683
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:48,839
control of he yeah just let her V

684
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:50,879
another two or 3 weeks and scrog her out

685
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:52,639
and stuff like that it's just like you

686
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,840
need to go with the life cycle of the

687
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:59,278
plant and sativa dominant autoflowers

688
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:02,959
tend to have high heals than Inda

689
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:05,200
dominant autoflowers because they just

690
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,319
need more time and therefore they will

691
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,759
have a little bit more of a time period

692
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:15,038
to actually grow bigger taller you know

693
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:17,599
and therefore will yield more and I know

694
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:19,119
you work for fast Buds and you've grown

695
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:22,038
out so much of their stuff do you have

696
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:24,558
maybe like a top two or three strains

697
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:26,599
that you can kind of recommend here I

698
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,918
mean everything with the word gorilla

699
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:31,599
will be uh will be very satisfying you

700
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:34,720
know like there has a gg4 cut in in the

701
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:37,519
Holy Hall somewhere of fast buds which

702
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,079
uh did some Miracles and it worked

703
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,319
really well with it doesn't matter if

704
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:44,918
it's strawberry gorilla gorilla cookies

705
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:47,240
or um gorilla Skittles it just these

706
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:50,519
genetics they grow big they grow tall

707
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:53,359
they grow fat nuggets they they're turpy

708
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:55,079
they're strong like they're like our

709
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,959
flagships if you want to you know so

710
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:58,678
when I went to visit the breeding

711
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,159
facilities that were literally rooms

712
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:06,159
with 200 300 plans just for breeding so

713
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:08,360
like because we know that is what a lot

714
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,720
of customers ask for you know especially

715
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:13,319
if you go in a commercial production

716
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,558
then which really is the thing by now

717
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:19,038
like there is really uh commercial

718
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:21,158
Autoflower production and they just want

719
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,240
they need to go for yield of course you

720
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:26,799
know and

721
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,000
then like stuff like our purple lemonade

722
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:31,319
as I said like if you C start looking a

723
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,398
little bit more into into the into the

724
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:35,720
genetics you know the orange sherbet

725
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:38,158
wedding cheesecake all these varieties

726
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,278
will be having at least

727
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:44,600
50% uh sativa Heritage and that will

728
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:47,759
just help to you know just make the

729
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:50,519
plant that much bigger you know and that

730
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:53,759
just helps because if the plant's ready

731
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:56,159
in 8 weeks there big plans in 8 weeks

732
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,480
but it's just a little less time

733
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,360
understood I want to Circle back to

734
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,440
transplanting now this is something that

735
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,759
when it comes to transplanting Autos the

736
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,200
community is kind of divided on this you

737
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:08,759
have some people that say never

738
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,200
transplant Auto always plant your Autos

739
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:12,839
directly into the final container don't

740
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,480
transplant at all you have other people

741
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,798
that say yo transplant it's completely

742
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,440
fine it's not going to slow down the

743
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:20,158
plan at all and some people say it

744
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,440
actually increases yield and I'll hold

745
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,240
off on my thoughts until after you

746
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,399
answer but give us your thoughts on

747
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,519
transplanting Autos when to do it so on

748
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,798
and so forth I mean

749
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,359
when we

750
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:35,599
transplant you know our medicinal plants

751
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:38,158
we like so much in general we usually

752
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:40,480
wait for the root Bowl to really like

753
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,559
you know we love this like root porn I

754
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,000
guess we call it you know just take the

755
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:48,440
container off and you look and it's just

756
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,359
white everything you do that with Autos

757
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,038
you might have already flowering so

758
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:54,199
that's like a little bit like I would

759
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:57,599
not wait that long and like that would

760
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:00,440
not not do that I personally also would

761
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:03,319
always always always definitely try to

762
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,759
hit her with some you know Michael rise

763
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:10,638
so she just like minimum intervention

764
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:13,319
I'd say I mean I very successfully PL

765
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:18,798
transplanted UT flowers many many times

766
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:22,398
it's just like don't wait too long right

767
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:26,200
and but generally speaking the people

768
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:29,518
who grew the biggest Autos I have seen

769
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,399
so far follow me me with this they just

770
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,638
throw it in the final container and

771
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:36,158
that's it you know

772
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:37,879
so of course there will be people out

773
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,480
there and saying you're crazy you don't

774
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,120
know what you're talking about I'm

775
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,599
always people do it I know people do it

776
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:46,678
very very successfully but if you're

777
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:48,558
just starting this out and stuff and you

778
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,080
don't have these like issues that you

779
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:54,720
need to transer that you like have that

780
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:57,398
you don't have the have the final you

781
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,519
know that you don't have the a space

782
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:03,959
issue then nah don't don't do it you

783
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:07,839
know I just talked to somebody in North

784
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:11,639
ma Macedonia who's growing some of our

785
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:14,078
gorilla cookies like I think 3600 or

786
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:17,159
something like that at a time and he's

787
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,039
like he was asking me ah I have of my

788
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,838
plants started flowering yeah because

789
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:25,398
you left them like for I don't know like

790
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:27,679
five weeks in like three liter like less

791
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:29,598
than a gallon containers you know which

792
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,599
which aren't super super deep and then

793
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,359
just you know they just hit the ground

794
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,200
they just like the conditions they were

795
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:38,559
like yeah I'm done here basically you

796
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:41,319
know let's wrap this up like four more

797
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:43,279
weeks and I'm done that is a common

798
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,079
thought that people say and I don't know

799
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,599
if that's it's true or not but is it

800
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,280
true that when the if it's in a small

801
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,039
container The Roots hit the bottom of

802
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,879
pot and start circling that's going to

803
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:56,320
induce flowering faster than if the

804
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,039
plant were in a larger container and The

805
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,880
Roots were kind of spreading out more as

806
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:03,159
is there truth to that at all or no if

807
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,119
you ask me yes yes there's a truth truth

808
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,519
to it because you will grow the biggest

809
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,680
biggest Autos like by by by by by she

810
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:11,519
size not necessarily healed if you do

811
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,960
them outdoors and if you do it in the

812
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,480
right climate outdoors and this the

813
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,800
plant can stretch and can go wherever it

814
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,199
wants to you know so but of course if

815
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,839
you have a giant container and you're

816
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:26,078
over water you know then it like you

817
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,440
have this like tiny little ball which is

818
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,560
like full of water and basically it's

819
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,200
all almost like you have an extra pot

820
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:34,279
inside of that pot right where the the

821
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:36,799
plant doesn't want to go out and then it

822
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:41,599
can happen to you in a big container too

823
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:43,240
so in general I would uh I believe as we

824
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,880
said in the very beginning the bigger

825
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:48,479
the roots the bigger the fruits and if

826
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,519
you give that auto flow enough space it

827
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,280
will it will thank you with a big yield

828
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:55,639
okay and then you mentioned micro Asal

829
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,839
fungi during transplanting which is what

830
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:59,799
I was going to talk about that's a key

831
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:01,279
that a lot of people do is they they

832
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,960
expose The Roots during that

833
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,760
transmitting process that gives them the

834
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,358
opportunity to sprinkle that micro oal

835
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,920
fungi onto the roots which is super

836
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:10,400
beneficial in so many different ways

837
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,000
right another thing I like to do

838
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,480
actually for not just Autos but for

839
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,280
photos as well is dump a little bit of

840
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,838
worm castings in the bottom of the hole

841
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,200
during transplant so I usually do like

842
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,440
quarter cup dump that down in there

843
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:23,879
that's going to help with uh give it a

844
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,440
little bit more nutrition and beneficial

845
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,318
microbes as well down by the root Zone

846
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,519
where you sprinkled the micro R fungi on

847
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:33,358
there as well so those are a couple tips

848
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:36,440
for people to do if they do decide to do

849
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:38,199
the transplanting process and for me for

850
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,440
example now with my like tiny grow

851
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:46,199
because I still with you know with my

852
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:49,280
with my 55 Day plant um I still used

853
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:52,759
living soil which was really hard in a

854
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,720
like two and a half gallon container

855
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:59,720
kind of thing so to keep that

856
00:36:55,719 --> 00:37:02,118
alive I made sure to always add very

857
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:06,519
very with every watering right very

858
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:09,838
Trace Amounts of either fungi or

859
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:12,358
bacteria microbes just to keep that life

860
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:15,279
in that soil cuz otherwise you know

861
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:18,000
you'll with these tiny containers it's

862
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,960
it's very hard and I had still and I

863
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,838
have to this day I moved the container

864
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,800
after I cut her I moved it Outdoors it's

865
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,119
in front of my Caravan now with some

866
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,800
ornamental plants in it and a tiny

867
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:31,960
little baby and there's still living

868
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,318
worms in there so it it gives me it

869
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:37,400
proves me that it it did work out that's

870
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:39,119
awesome let's move on to plant training

871
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,838
so there are several different plant

872
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,119
training techniques that you can do on

873
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:45,880
your Autos some people do low stress

874
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,079
training some do topping super cropping

875
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,400
the list goes on what training do you

876
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:53,839
recommend for folks that are looking to

877
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,720
increase yields when growing

878
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:59,799
Autos you can top Autos this is some not

879
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:01,719
you Cann it's not that you can't top

880
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,680
them you just have to do it right right

881
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:06,959
so you have to I would like do it at the

882
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:08,919
third or four fourth note like early

883
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,559
early early you know don't go wait too

884
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,000
long because what if you wait too long

885
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,039
then you might just tress your back into

886
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,199
flower really quick in the beginning it

887
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:18,920
won't be that it won't be that crazy for

888
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:22,480
her you know so if you do it early on

889
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,960
it's possible and then yeah you can of

890
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,440
course these guys who yield these crazy

891
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,760
amounts of um

892
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:34,200
with Autos they they they train they

893
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:37,319
like train they're in the all the time

894
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:38,919
you know to you have to expose the bud

895
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:41,559
sides to make it to

896
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:45,440
make to make it possible otherwise it's

897
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:48,239
not it's not going to happen is

898
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,280
it for me personally I don't do it so

899
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,039
much but I'm also coming from a often

900
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,040
from a different perspective right I

901
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:56,318
need to take photos of these plants I

902
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:58,000
need to you know I need to move them

903
00:38:56,318 --> 00:38:59,838
around I can't just like tie them

904
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,599
somewhere here and somewhere there in my

905
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:04,838
in my tent you know it has to be all

906
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:08,200
movable and also when you photograph a

907
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:10,440
lot like or video a lot you want to show

908
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:13,118
the people of how does this plant grow

909
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:17,079
naturally not how does this plant look

910
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:19,559
after I bend bend it in all different

911
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:22,280
directions but all the things which work

912
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:24,559
for for the periodic strains work for a

913
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,400
flowers fantastic and I've trained the

914
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,400
heck out of them before and it's great

915
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,720
it just maximizes the yield it's that

916
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,039
simple it just takes longer right I mean

917
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,480
you can see it with any plan it needs

918
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,759
time to bounce to bounce back and the

919
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:44,119
same thing for an Autoflower so every

920
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,800
time you will train an auto it will

921
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:47,240
depending on how heavy you train it but

922
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,519
it's probably going to set her back like

923
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:54,399
a week or so so that will make it make

924
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:56,960
it take longer so if you do it you might

925
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,800
as well make it worthwhile because you

926
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,800
need to have that much more of a yield

927
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,599
other than you know finishing up quickly

928
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,480
got it yeah the best result I've ever

929
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:09,519
gotten growing in Auto was just low

930
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,800
stress training and I grew carolicious

931
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:15,719
by msnl this was had to have been 10

932
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,160
years ago now and wow I had 10 different

933
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:20,159
seeds and some of the plants I let grow

934
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:23,199
naturally think two or three I let grow

935
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:25,559
naturally two or three I did the low

936
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:27,919
stress training on I did some topping

937
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:30,039
and compared everything right so the

938
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,400
topping ones didn't do as good as just

939
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:33,639
the low stress training ones and they

940
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,039
actually didn't do good as the one

941
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,239
growing naturally as well so the

942
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:41,719
naturally grown ones with with no

943
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:44,118
training was about 5 to 6 ounces and

944
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:46,759
then the trained ones with low stress

945
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,920
training was 7 to 8 ounces and then the

946
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,319
topping was I think it was 4 to 5 ounces

947
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,039
so you know it was all from seed right

948
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:58,358
so there's differences in the phenotype

949
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:59,920
expression so you know this is I'm not a

950
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:01,279
scientist this is me just doing

951
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,119
experiment my home and stuff like that

952
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,760
but this is what I observe oh no but I

953
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,680
mean that's how we can figure out figure

954
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,880
out what what what works best for us I

955
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:13,039
mean I would say if you don't if you are

956
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,160
depending on this plan on the on these

957
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:18,199
plans like so meaning you don't want to

958
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:20,799
just test it out you probably have good

959
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:23,399
chances if you top the auto ride you do

960
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,119
it right you train her over a long time

961
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,160
you probably have high chances that that

962
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:31,960
plan might be the biggest dealer but we

963
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:35,078
don't really need it anymore so much

964
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:38,679
because we can train without the topping

965
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:40,480
with low stress training and you know

966
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:42,838
doesn't matter if it's butt Clips or if

967
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,400
you tie her down just make sure that

968
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:46,880
you're you know that you have an even

969
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,400
canopy in the end of the day everywhere

970
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,000
gets the light and most likely if you

971
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,920
just perform some decent amounts of low

972
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,920
stress training you will have the

973
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,240
highest yeld per plant but now let me

974
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,480
challenge that for one second because

975
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:05,279
what if I instead of trying to find an

976
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:08,039
Autoflower which is taking 10 11 weeks

977
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,280
12 weeks like a sativa dominant one what

978
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,920
if I take one of my Lemon Cherry cookies

979
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:16,839
or banana purple punch heavy indicas

980
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:20,119
right which can be ready in only 8 weeks

981
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:24,799
from SE to harvest now if I space that

982
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:28,838
out over the time right so I can just I

983
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,599
have within I can you know run her one

984
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:33,078
more time within three grow Cycles I can

985
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,000
have her in three grow Cycles while I

986
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:38,280
have the others only two grow Cycles bam

987
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,760
I'm back at the heel you know so like

988
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,599
that is really a Phil philosophy in that

989
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,920
moment I wouldn't even train her just

990
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,000
let them go do their thing you know do

991
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,920
some light

992
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,800
defoliation minimum intervention finish

993
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,639
them in eight maximum 9 weeks be done

994
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,880
with them and can grow new instead of

995
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,400
growing won 12 weeks or something like

996
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,358
that so and this is just you know good

997
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,639
point yeah there's so many different

998
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:07,199
ways you can go about it for sure let's

999
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:10,358
transition over to problems right so

1000
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,838
there can be problems with autof flowers

1001
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:14,880
what would you say are the top three

1002
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:17,599
problems that growers face when growing

1003
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,720
Auto flowers and give us a solution to

1004
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,680
those problems what's the top number one

1005
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:27,358
um problem everybody uh especially

1006
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:29,399
beginners will have with any any plann I

1007
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:31,598
need to give her more water I need to

1008
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,559
give more water you know so you have

1009
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,519
pockets of where that all that water is

1010
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:38,519
at and basically the plant will just

1011
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:40,759
think this is and this is a real real

1012
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:43,719
issue with with autoflowers the the

1013
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:46,520
plant will just basically be have no

1014
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:48,639
more air we just talked in the beginning

1015
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:51,880
about it how important for UT flowers it

1016
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:54,838
is to have very you know air soil

1017
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,119
because they need a lot of air and you

1018
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:58,960
basically suffocate the roots she's gone

1019
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,400
stress she's going to start flowering as

1020
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,159
a baby and basically you're going to

1021
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,838
have a tiny little plant you know so

1022
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:09,399
there we definitely have our number one

1023
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,759
issue but I guess it's it's more

1024
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,280
forgiving if you go for the periotic

1025
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,079
Spence but like you know

1026
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:20,880
so but yes it's in that sense it's I

1027
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,559
guess a bit more specific to Autos the

1028
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,559
next

1029
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:28,079
issue probably nutrients overfeeding

1030
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:29,960
because once you overfeed you can't let

1031
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,519
them bounce back you know like they're

1032
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,519
most likely will just you know you can

1033
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:38,880
flush them but then in the end of the

1034
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,400
day they will just not get as big and

1035
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,480
everything because they will eventually

1036
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,280
go shift into flowering especially if

1037
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,318
they're

1038
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,160
stressed and that means again I messed

1039
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:51,159
it up in a sense that I will just have a

1040
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:56,118
smaller plant in the

1041
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:58,239
end and I guess environmental issues so

1042
00:44:56,119 --> 00:45:00,240
we think a lot of times what people

1043
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,439
would like tell you why autof flowers

1044
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,279
are not as good as photop periodic

1045
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:08,480
strains is because

1046
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,480
they often have like fluffy buds you

1047
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,079
ever noticed that

1048
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,199
yeah so in my opinion these fluffy buds

1049
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,119
come

1050
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:20,318
from a few a few little factors so in

1051
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:22,838
the end of the day an Autoflower will

1052
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:24,599
need very very much light and very

1053
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:27,880
intense light towards the end of the

1054
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,838
life cycle to really develop these

1055
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:33,680
these nuggets we all like

1056
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:36,159
right and humidity issues like you have

1057
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:38,239
to be so careful and I don't even say

1058
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:40,519
powdery mildo or all these kind of

1059
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,358
issues or Bud rot we get so easily if

1060
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:45,280
our humidities are too high during

1061
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:46,920
flowering you get you have less of that

1062
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,160
problem with autoflowers because they

1063
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,599
are just more resistant they're just

1064
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:55,239
tough [ __ ] if you want so because you

1065
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,240
know these these ladies where they the

1066
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:59,239
they come from

1067
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:02,118
much worse conditions right in like

1068
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:05,199
Siberia and stuff

1069
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:08,079
but to get this density if you have too

1070
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:10,480
much humidity in your air these these

1071
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,839
buds will not get very dense they will

1072
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,358
just stay more fluffy so even if you

1073
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:19,558
want to end up with

1074
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:22,400
nice like harder rocks you just have to

1075
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:25,359
try to try to keep the humidity down

1076
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,440
towards the last two weeks of flowering

1077
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:30,318
especially and I

1078
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,280
say even you know in the last two weeks

1079
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:34,558
you don't have to have a plant which

1080
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,519
looks like the healthiest plant in the

1081
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:39,599
world anymore because we're not want to

1082
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:41,679
keep her alive for forever you know we

1083
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,480
want her to put everything she got into

1084
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:46,358
these beautiful nuggets because that's

1085
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,358
what we want in the end and I think that

1086
00:46:46,358 --> 00:46:51,199
is

1087
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:53,598
a that's a big big issue not too many

1088
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:55,759
people know about all right there we go

1089
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,680
top three good list right there I like

1090
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,240
that so if you were to meet a new grower

1091
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:01,960
in person and they're saying hey I'm

1092
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,078
brand new and I'm about to start growing

1093
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,318
Autos what advice would you have for

1094
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:09,039
them don't overthink it I mean you mean

1095
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:11,239
brand new grower let's respecify it like

1096
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,199
brand new grower period or brand new

1097
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:15,759
grower to others like somebody who might

1098
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:18,480
have already brand new Autos okay so

1099
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,920
somebody who already uh already grows

1100
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:25,000
other like Photo periodic strengths yeah

1101
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,760
don't overthink it and don't you know

1102
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,719
what let her grow let her grow let her

1103
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:35,119
grow you know let her grow to find out

1104
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:37,159
what it's all about you know mess around

1105
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:40,039
here and there a little bit but let her

1106
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:43,759
grow like learn the life cycle of an

1107
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:45,599
autoflowering plant learn how to how to

1108
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,240
determine you

1109
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,960
know and then all these tips we've said

1110
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:53,239
before Airy soil for sure you know if

1111
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,920
you want her to be big big containers

1112
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:58,558
you know and if you want her and don't

1113
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,519
overfeed her because she will not have

1114
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,359
the chance to bounce back like any other

1115
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:04,838
plant you know

1116
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:06,639
because the stress is the worst thing

1117
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:09,558
for for for an Autoflower like you

1118
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:11,759
stress them too much they they will just

1119
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:14,319
go into flower that's just how simple it

1120
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,000
is you know like you stress her too much

1121
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:18,599
I mean obviously you can stress her to

1122
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,599
death but like that's that's would be

1123
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:24,280
dramatic but you know if you just stress

1124
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,920
her enough she'll just say okay I'm

1125
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:29,200
going to the flower

1126
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:32,000
good advice the future of aof flowers

1127
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:34,118
let's talk about that so do you foresee

1128
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,039
any Innovations in the cultivation of

1129
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:38,200
utof flowers that could help Growers

1130
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:40,440
potentially achieve even higher yields

1131
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:42,759
in the future I think it's

1132
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,800
more

1133
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,040
genetics I mean of course there will be

1134
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,839
always Innovations in cultivation you

1135
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:52,039
know like I'm just like visited some

1136
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:53,920
facility of aquaponics are just like it

1137
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:56,798
fascinates me absolutely and all then

1138
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,119
then hey yeah now I can have my fish

1139
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:03,559
fish take care of my nutrition and it's

1140
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:05,480
a whole cycle especially you know in

1141
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:08,240
areas where you live where you just

1142
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,838
don't have as much water technically

1143
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,798
available you know what I mean like when

1144
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:14,000
a very dry areas you know closed systems

1145
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:18,519
like that are

1146
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,559
fantastic I think that we will there is

1147
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:23,838
already something called like super

1148
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:27,119
Autos you know like very few which

1149
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:30,279
are they take a lot longer but they

1150
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,838
still do the shift by themselves

1151
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,400
so I actually just had an interview and

1152
00:49:32,838 --> 00:49:36,519
I just talked with Sasha the joint

1153
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,160
doctor the person who really developed

1154
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:41,838
them like 30 years ago and they went to

1155
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:45,279
the market over 20 years ago with the

1156
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:47,239
First autoflowers with low rider and he

1157
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:51,599
says we probably just scratch the

1158
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:54,959
surface you know we will figure out much

1159
00:49:51,599 --> 00:50:00,440
more you know how

1160
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:03,599
to manipulate that and maybe have you

1161
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:06,599
know these varieties nowadays I mean

1162
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,798
they're so specific in terms of that

1163
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:14,880
they're targeting to so in such a high

1164
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:16,880
percentage the the hom Growers Market

1165
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,280
but there's so much more to that in the

1166
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,358
end of the day like you can save so much

1167
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:25,760
plastic if you instead of do live depth

1168
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:28,558
you know in in all the humbled and

1169
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,920
mosino and so on you know where all the

1170
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,839
the a lot of fires grown if you have

1171
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,280
fire Autos you know you don't have to do

1172
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:39,880
that anymore you know

1173
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:43,119
and I think we are coming to a point

1174
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:46,039
where UT flowers can compete with photo

1175
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:47,318
periodic strains and we have cups which

1176
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:51,599
are being

1177
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:55,318
won slowly but steady with autof

1178
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:57,359
flowers against photo periodic strains

1179
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:59,639
and once we come there

1180
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:01,798
like we need to get a little bit higher

1181
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:03,519
with the turp still we have really

1182
00:51:01,798 --> 00:51:06,679
really tppy Autos don't Mis

1183
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:10,159
misunderstand me but there is

1184
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:12,440
still there is the most room for

1185
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:15,679
improvement in my opinion is in the in

1186
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:17,519
the in the tpin in like when we think

1187
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:21,118
about the final

1188
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:23,960
product that once we're there in a few

1189
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,838
years I think that we have a good chance

1190
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,838
that people will take it more serious

1191
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:30,400
and that there will do much more

1192
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:32,920
scientific based

1193
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,358
breeding and we will get other flowers

1194
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:39,000
which can work for specific climates

1195
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:41,920
which just you know where it's very hard

1196
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,880
to grow you know and and so on and so on

1197
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,079
so I think there's much much much much

1198
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,920
much room for improvement we just

1199
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,200
started that's cool to hear yeah it'll

1200
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,599
be interesting to see where the future

1201
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:54,118
what holds in the future for autos for

1202
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:55,318
sure cool well this was a great

1203
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:56,680
conversation I think a lot of people

1204
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:58,719
going to like this one I know a lot

1205
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:00,598
people are interested in growing Autos

1206
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:01,919
or they grow Auto now or plan to grow

1207
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:03,599
Autos in the future so this is

1208
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,760
definitely some good information here

1209
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,400
can you tell listeners how they could

1210
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,400
