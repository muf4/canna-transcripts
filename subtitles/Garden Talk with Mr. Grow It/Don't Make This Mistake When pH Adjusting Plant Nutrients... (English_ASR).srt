1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,539
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:05,040
me my name is Chris aka mr. Griffith and

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,859
I just mixed up a batch of nutrients

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,530
here this is Blue Planet nutrient - Blue

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,289
Max two-part feed schedule so I have it

6
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:17,100
all mixed up stir it up and checking the

7
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:18,689
pH at the moment and the pH was at 5.8

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,179
that's willing I actually like about

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,730
Blue Planet nutrients as the ph ends up

10
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,009
being 5.8 with that if it's a half dose

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,170
which is the ph level I like to give my

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,210
plants growing in Cocoa but I am growing

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,390
in soil this round so I do have to

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,759
increase the pH using pH up alright now

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,890
I got up to 6.2 and I decided to film

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,349
this video so we're gonna get it up a

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,140
little bit more than that the pH I'm

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:47,640
using is by blue playing nutrients their

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,759
pH up I also have a small cup some RO

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,370
water here this is a jug that washed out

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,189
it needs to be melted and I have one of

22
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,509
these what are these called again so

23
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,909
what you're not supposed to do is you're

24
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:01,858
not supposed to take this P up pH up and

25
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,509
put it directly into there I'm going to

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,329
show you I'm gonna do it here for

27
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:08,658
example purposes I want to show you what

28
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:08,658
happens

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,560
see that gray cloud a little bit more

30
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,590
hopefully the camera can pick it up it's

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,030
a great cloud swirling around there um

32
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,790
so it's actually a chemical reaction

33
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,439
happening I actually learned this from

34
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,820
Everest Fernandes he has a YouTube

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,489
channel oh I'm gonna actually link the

36
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:30,659
video below where I learned this from

37
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:33,899
basically this chemical erection is bad

38
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,489
this is not useful for plants if you

39
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,530
want that full description on why that's

40
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:39,509
the case I will link his video in the

41
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,159
description section below but instead of

42
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,560
doing that what you are supposed to do

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,689
is actually dilute it first a lot of

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,400
people aren't doing this I noticed so I

45
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,670
figured I'd make a quick video on how to

46
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,310
dilute it so really just all you need is

47
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,109
a small cup of water you know this is

48
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,210
the size that I use which is fine

49
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,010
pour a decent amount up because you

50
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:00,299
really want to when you're diluting it

51
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,760
you don't want to have like a too small

52
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:07,310
of a glass like a small shot glass isn't

53
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,310
really gonna be enough to dilute it down

54
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:15,250
put a little bit more in there and I

55
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,870
kind of just kind of guesstimate on how

56
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,990
much I'm going to need it's really

57
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:23,409
adjusts depending on how much you're

58
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,719
trying to bring your pH up or down what

59
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:28,689
are you supposed to dilute it here like

60
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:29,800
I'm doing here and then from there well

61
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,659
actually let me get rid of this other

62
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,410
cloud first mix that end what did this

63
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:38,259
go up to so that went from six point to

64
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:40,780
up to six point four and now let's say

65
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:43,689
if this small container that just mixed

66
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,789
up is going to increase it up to about

67
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:47,199
six point five is fine if it goes up a

68
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:50,289
little bit more than that I'm okay with

69
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,139
that but you don't see the gray cloud oh

70
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:54,969
crap I stirred it before to show you

71
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:59,500
there was no great cloud because it was

72
00:02:54,969 --> 00:03:02,020
diluted and now I am up to about six

73
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,840
point four six point five we'll see if

74
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,730
that goes up any more but it got me up

75
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,960
to where I need to be but more of the

76
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:12,310
story just want to make a quick video

77
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:15,010
today urge you guys to dilute your pH up

78
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,229
pH down before mixing it with your

79
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:19,479
nutrient solution because the chemical

80
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:20,500
reaction happens and that is about it's

81
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,759
pretty much it for this video guys if

82
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,129
you enjoyed it please click that thumbs

83
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,429
up and that will leave it that thank you

84
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:29,430
so much for watching and until next time

85
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,430
