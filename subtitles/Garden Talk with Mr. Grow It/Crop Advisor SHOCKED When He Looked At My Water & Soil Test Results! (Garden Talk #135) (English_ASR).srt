Mason also known as the soil doctor he

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,519
was on the podcast once before episode

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,960
26 back in 2021 we talked all about soil

14
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,039
testing he did a soil audit walk through

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,320
and also talked about some of the

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,960
elements of a plant growth and got into

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,119
heavy metals this time around he talks

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,079
about water testing I got my local water

19
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,799
tested here and he breaks down the

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,719
results I also got the soil in my

21
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,198
backyard tested and he goes over those

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,879

when the last episode dropped wow and

67
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:29,399
another thing I like to look at and talk

68
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,679
about is the number of views it got so

69
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,640
30 th000 views on that episode which is

70
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,640
pretty crazy it always surprises me that

71
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,719
there are so many people out there that

72
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,719
are tuning into these and it just shows

73
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,719
that there are a lot of people

74
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,598

their Garden excited to have you back on

76
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,158

77
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,319
absolutely and it was fun to meet you

78
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:53,439

what you do yeah thank you so the last

87
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:13,598
episode we when we got together we went

88
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:16,319
over a soil test but it was a soil test

89
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,000
from soil that I had Outdoors but it was

90
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,318
originally bag soil so it was like

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,120
reused soil and I was growing medicinal

92
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,399
plants in there we also did a soil audit

93
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,360
walkthrough so you actually walked

94
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,480
through the entire soil report talked

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,319
about some of the different elements for

96
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,238
growth and we got into heavy m

97
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,280
this time around we're going to go over

98
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,759
another soil report but we're also going

99
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,959
to go over a Water Analysis report too

100
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:42,239
so I'm kind of laughing a little bit

101
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,640
because the water report is my tap water

102
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,719
I live in Las Vegas and we're known to

103
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:50,359
have very hard water I measure it at 485

104
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:53,318
PPM which is like very high uh I think

105
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,879
EPA guidelines is like no more than 500

106
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:56,878
or else it's considered unsafe or

107
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,000
something like that but so it's very

108
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,039
high uh as far as PPM and then the

109
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,919
report we're going to go over is from my

110
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,878
backyard and I live in Las Vegas and

111
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:10,759
it's just a lot of rock and desert and

112
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:12,359
so I'm looking to revive that soil and

113
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,759
uh grow some vegetables I've got some

114
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,879
trees out there that I'm going to be

115
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,079
growing and um so looking to see how you

116
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,519
know your analysis of it and just

117
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,000
suggestions for proving it great fun and

118
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:27,000
I I glanced at your water report before

119
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,800
and it's going to be a fun one awesome

120
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,160
well before we get too deep into it can

121
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
you introduce your yourself for the

122
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,600
folks that didn't catch the first

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,199
episode we did together yeah sure I'm

124
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,960
Bryant Mason um I'm a certified crop

125
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:42,120
adviser and I focus on organic nutrient

126
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:45,279
management so I work in various crop

127
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,038
types helping Growers improve their soil

128
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,959
fertility with Precision nutrient

129
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:54,560
applications so the process typically

130
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,680
looks um like you know with a with a

131
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,319
grower it's pretty simple Growers test

132
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,160
their soil and then I do the agronomic

133
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:04,959
math and write organic um Amendment

134
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,080
recommendations I also analyze water

135
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:11,038
tests and tissue tests quite extensively

136
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,599
um and then I also have an online course

137
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,519
for people who really want to deepen

138
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,720
their understanding of nutrient

139
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:21,000
management and spend you know 15 hours

140
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,160
just becoming more self-sufficient so if

141
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,959
anyone's interested in that they can

142
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,120
find that everything I offer on my

143
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:29,279
website um but mostly as a as a crop

144
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,160
adviser I'm just focusing on nutrient

145
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,679
management not necessarily

146
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,479
IPM um or environmental controls or

147
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,840
anything like that so um yeah that's

148
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:42,199
that's the brief introduction I also

149
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:48,439
have a a farm of my own in western

150
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:51,639
Colorado um I have I grow vegetables and

151
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:54,600
medicinal plants like you um but my cash

152
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,360
crop I have a th000 peach trees so I'm

153
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,199
an orchardist um and so I'm I'm really

154
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,720
interested in Fruit production as well

155
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,038
so this this year is going to be my

156
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,039
first Peach crop um I planted the trees

157
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,000
three seasons ago three summers ago and

158
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,399
they're like thriving and huge and

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,079
there's a bunch of peaches on the trees

160
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,000
so that'll be fun that's exciting and

161
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,839
and some folks might recognize your name

162
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,120
from my book my second book that I just

163
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,959
released January 1st this year I gave

164
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,879
you a mention I talked about kind of

165
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,198
soil testing how you get to soil tested

166
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,598
and then you can also link up with

167
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,080
somebody like you who's going to be able

168
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:31,879
to give you advice on what you can do

169
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,120
for the soil and really this episode

170
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:35,478
you're going to kind of get a glimpse of

171
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,199
that so where would you like to start

172
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,478
would you want to start with the water

173
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,319
yeah let's start with the water I know

174
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,240
that was your your primary your your

175
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,720
main priority so let's start with that

176
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,478
the water report I just want to say

177
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,560
before we dive into this I think this is

178
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:51,800
the most underutilized underrated single

179
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,918
test that people can do and the reason

180
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,960
for that is is sort of twofold the first

181
00:06:53,918 --> 00:07:00,079
is that if you think about inputs to

182
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:03,878
your to your system to your soil water

183
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:06,639
is the biggest input so over multiple

184
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:10,319
irrigation Cycles over multiple years

185
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,160
whatever's in your water is going to

186
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,800
influence the soil solution more than

187
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,599
anything else and the soil solution is

188
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
essentially the the water that's

189
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:20,918
available for roots in the pore space of

190
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,720
the soil and so whatever the chemistry

191
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:24,680
of your water is that's really what's

192
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,840
going to define the chemistry of your

193
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,478
soil solution over the long term so it's

194
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:31,079
your biggest input from a heavy metal

195
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:33,478
standpoint from a salt standpoint from a

196
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,519
nutrient standpoint often times um and

197
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:39,079
then the other thing is water does

198
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:41,399
change obviously um you know like Wells

199
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:45,878
for example can fluctuate a little bit

200
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:48,839
from Fall to Spring but by and large

201
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,280
water uh a single water test will tell

202
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,878
you exactly what your water is going to

203
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,478
look like or the pattern that it's going

204
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,520
to

205
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,158
um exhibit over the long term so really

206
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,318
in my opinion you only need to get one

207
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:02,800
water test and then you know your water

208
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,000
forever more or less um if you really

209
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,720
want to double check things you can but

210
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,639
if you get three water tests they're all

211
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,639
going to look pretty similar so the

212
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,720
reason I like that is you only have to

213
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,000
pay for one water test um it's very

214
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,960
inexpensive and you get a really good

215
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,918
sense of the chemistry of your of your

216
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,758
water so let's dive into it so the first

217
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,799
thing that people often look at and it's

218
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:30,800
the first metric on the soil test is pH

219
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,000
um most Growers are familiar with phing

220
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,360
their water up or down generally it's

221
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,158
going to be down

222
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:44,320
um and pH is important but it doesn't

223
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:46,120
tell the full story of whether or not

224
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,040
you should acidify your water and we'll

225
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,399
get to why that is with a second metric

226
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,120
a little bit further down the Water

227
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,879
Report the next metric on the soil

228
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,320
report is hardness you mentioned this

229
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:00,600
hardness is really just a summation or

230
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,839
an or an aggregate uh calculation of the

231
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,360
calcium and the Magnesium content in the

232
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,040
water so it's really just telling you

233
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,919
the mineralization of calcium and

234
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,679
magnesium it's a pretty simple equation

235
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:16,479
you can look up online um and in your

236
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:18,759
case you have 338 parts per million of

237
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,560
hardness which is a lot like you

238
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:25,039
mentioned that's a lot of hardness um so

239
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,919
you have a lot of calcium and or

240
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,559
magnesium in your water and we'll get to

241
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,879
that and just to back up I didn't

242
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,639
actually mention what your water PH was

243
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,278
for listeners it's

244
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,679
7.7

245
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:38,480
so right away you think oh that's pretty

246
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:41,559
high maybe you should PH down well let's

247
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,159
wait on that conclusion until we see uh

248
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:46,518
another reading closer to the bottom of

249
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,799
the report called alkalinity so your pH

250
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,240
is 77 your hardness is

251
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,439
338 and again that probably fluctuates

252
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,879
depending on um you know the Las Vegas

253
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,200
Supply and things like that but it

254
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:00,439
doesn't really matter the hardness is

255
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,640
always going to be high

256
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,120
um I'm going to jump down to there's

257
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,720
there's another three things hardness

258
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,839
grains which is just another way to

259
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,360
measure hardness conductivity which is a

260
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:15,720
salt reading it's an EC reading and then

261
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:19,079
sodium absorption ratio which matters in

262
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,800
agronomic Top Soil field production but

263
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:22,759
for the purposes of this conversation we

264
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,799
can skip it um because it's really just

265
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:29,838
a computed calculated number um that's

266
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:32,240
getting at how much sodium there is in

267
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,600
your water do you have any initial

268
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,159
thoughts or questions before we keep

269
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,639
going yeah couple just to back up a

270
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,319
little bit you mentioned one water test

271
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,919
should be fine they're really not going

272
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,519
to change I heard it may be Chang like

273
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:46,719
over the years like shouldn't it be you

274
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,679
know maybe this year get a test next

275
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,200
year you could see a different result or

276
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,559
are you saying no that wouldn't be the

277
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,519
case I mean you'll always see

278
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:55,599
fluctuations even if you took a test

279
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,799
tomorrow you would see the numbers just

280
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,519
slightly different but my

281
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,519
believe

282
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,360
is the pattern of what we're going to

283
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:08,879
see here on this report isn't going to

284
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,278
change so yeah the pH might fluctuate a

285
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:14,200
couple tenths of a you know point the

286
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:17,799
hardness may go up or down even 20 or 50

287
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,600
parts per million the but the but the

288
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,879
underlying pattern of the water is going

289
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,480
to be the same which is that you have

290
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:28,278
hard water with you know high pH high

291
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,720
sodium low Etc so as a consultant I

292
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:32,480
think there are tests that you should

293
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,000
take frequently but I'm constantly aware

294
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,959
that you're trying to save money as a

295
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
grower so I don't think the loow hanging

296
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,199
fruit is to continually water test

297
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,120
because you're pretty much going to come

298
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,399
to the same conclusion even though it

299
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,720
will fluctuate a little bit now of

300
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,919
course there's going to be parts of the

301
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,000
country where the water fluctuates a lot

302
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,479
so that's not a universal statement but

303
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,720
by and large you only need to take one

304
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,560
water test in my opinion okay I do have

305
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,600
a few more questions but I'll I'll

306
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,479
gather some more questions and ask them

307
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,480
when we're done with the water section

308
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,759
okay sure so so the the what's always

309
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,278
most interesting to me when I see a high

310
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,120
pH is the next five or six things I'm

311
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:12,759
going to talk about so calcium magnesium

312
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,360
potassium and sodium those are cations I

313
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:17,720
um they're the dominant cations in soil

314
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,000
and they are the dominant cations in

315
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,759
water too and they're going to really

316
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,399
Define the cation balance in your soil

317
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,879
solution so all of three out of the four

318
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,519
of these are nutrients to the plant

319
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,198
sodium is not a nutrient but calcium

320
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,159
magnesium and pottassium are extremely

321
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:34,319
important beneficial nutrients so the

322
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:36,838
balance of those three really matters um

323
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,720
so calcium is 107 parts per million

324
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,199
that's a lot so that's what's creating

325
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,320
all that hardness in your water you're

326
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:44,000
in this Aid environment in the Western

327
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,639
United States that doesn't get tons of

328
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
rainfall and so it's very natural for

329
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,759
there to be really high calcium levels

330
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,120
uh in the parent material and in the

331
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,078
rock formations in the geology and so

332
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,399
when the water moves across the surface

333
00:12:54,078 --> 00:13:00,879
of the the land or or underground it

334
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:03,440
picks up those calcium ions um and

335
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,399
that's why your calcium is high now

336
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,320
luckily calcium is a nutrient for plants

337
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,159
and it's a very important maybe

338
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,320
underrated nutrient and so it's

339
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:17,159
fantastic in certain ways that the

340
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,079
calcium is so high however it's the

341
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,838
calcium is coming with other things that

342
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,838
usually aren't as beneficial so hardness

343
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,199
in and of itself is not a problem that

344
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,480
high calcium is in my opinion a good

345
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:32,359
thing the Magnesium is 17 parts per

346
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,759
million um

347
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,079
which is slightly elevated but compared

348
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,879
to the calcium is not very high so that

349
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,919
calcium to magnesium ratio in your water

350
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:44,399
is just fine

351
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,958
um the potassium is three parts per

352
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,480
million it's very rare to see high

353
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:51,000
potassium in in natural sources of water

354
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,639
um and by the way is this Municipal

355
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,399
Water from from Las Vegas yep okay okay

356
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,320
so here's the kicker I'm going to jump

357
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,519
to sodium this is in my opinion the

358
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,120
greatest weakness of this water it's not

359
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:08,679
pH it's not salts it's not hardness it's

360
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,799
sodium your sodium is a whopping 48

361
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:14,758
parts per million

362
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:17,240
and um there there could be a number of

363
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:21,120
reasons why this is It's hard to know

364
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,560
the first is uh the the city of Las

365
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:28,679
Vegas could be trying to soften the

366
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:30,559
water and when you when you soften water

367
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,519
you essentially there's a number of

368
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:36,239
different ways to to soften water but

369
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:40,278
one of the most cost-effective ways is

370
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,039
to uh exchange sodium and so you're

371
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:44,480
essentially removing the calcium and the

372
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:48,000
magnesium and in doing so you're sort of

373
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,039
replacing it with sodium salts um so

374
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,399
it's possible that just through water

375
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:54,439
softening they're increasing the sodium

376
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,679
content of the water trying to get below

377
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,519
the you know the EPA limits or whatever

378
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:00,278
regulations they're trying to follow

379
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,759
maybe trying to take make it taste

380
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:05,078
better um I know hard water can be tough

381
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:08,639
on plumbing and so they they could be

382
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:10,679
essentially creating elevated sodium the

383
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,278
other possibility is again there's just

384
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:16,078
high sodium in in the source of the

385
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,078
water um and as it runs across the

386
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,000
surface of the desert or

387
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,919
underground uh maybe it's coming from

388
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,240
Lake Powell maybe it's just

389
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,639
grabbing uh sodium from the environment

390
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,000
from the aid

391
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,079
environment so in any case uh

392
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,879
unfortunately these are these are the

393
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,958
cards you've been dealt but it's really

394
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,360
not optimal and the this will be

395
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,439
something that you'll need to manage

396
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:45,360
over time is this high

397
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,920
sodium um I'll okay I I guess I'll pause

398
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,759
and get your reaction or your thoughts

399
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,759
or questions about about the sodium or

400
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,079
about any of these cations yeah high

401
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,839
sodium I mean you mentioned they appear

402
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,519
to be softening the water kind of

403
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,240
unrelated question does that mean I I

404
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,519
don't need a water softener I was

405
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,000
looking at potentially getting one of

406
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,198
those when it comes to your drinking

407
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,039
water your shower not you know like

408
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:09,159
shower glass not showing stains water

409
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,559
softeners work but when it comes to

410
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:12,958
plant production I am not a fan of water

411
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:14,879
softeners I think they're a horrible

412
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,559
idea because they're removing calcium

413
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,600
and magnesium which are plant nutrients

414
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,559
and and they're adding sodium which is a

415
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,480
not a plant nutrient and in fact is very

416
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:26,679
antagonistic and problematic in plant

417
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,440
production so I have never recommended a

418
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:29,439
water softener and in fact I'm

419
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,680
frequently

420
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,079
recommending to scrap the water softener

421
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,879
when it comes to irrigation yeah I was I

422
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:39,719
was kind of leaning towards the whole uh

423
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:42,039
you know dishwashing and uh cleaning

424
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,079
clothes and stuff like that unrelated

425
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:45,679
like I mentioned because the the fiance

426
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:47,239
wants a water softener and if I can come

427
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,679
to her and say hey you know what we

428
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,560
already got sodium in there it's not

429
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,519
going to you know we don't need one you

430
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,039
might you might for your dishwasher and

431
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,639
for clean dishes you may want to soften

432
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,240
it further got it okay but your plants

433
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,680
won't appreciate it I mean there other

434
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,680
way there's other salts that can be used

435
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:04,038
in water softeners like potassium salts

436
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:07,558
but still I wouldn't want to crank my

437
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:10,160
potassium up necessarily um there might

438
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:12,119
be a balance there but I would never use

439
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,160
a sodium salt in water softeners and

440
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,078
usually you don't have control you just

441
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,519
plug them in and you kind of buy what

442
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:20,798
the what's manufactured so okay and then

443
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:22,199
I'm assuming that at the end recommend

444
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,879
some sort of filtration so I was going

445
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,839
to ask what options are there to filter

446
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,760
this and I'm not sure if I'm getting

447
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,359
ahead of the conversation here or not

448
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,400
well so no let's talk about that so when

449
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,678
it comes to

450
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,960
sodium um really the only solution is to

451
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,200
filter it out because you don't have

452
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,840
control over that if there is a water

453
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,400
softening process from the city of Las

454
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:46,079
Vegas you don't have control over that

455
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,000
um you get what comes out of the tap so

456
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:51,159
so there's really only one filter that I

457
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,839
know of that removes sodium effectively

458
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:57,919
and it's Ro filtration which is really

459
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,720
uh unfortunate for small scale Growers

460
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,280
because of the economics just how much

461
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,279
they cost um and you know Aro really is

462
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,158
unfortunate because it produces a lot of

463
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,960
waste water and if you think about it

464
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:12,200
that waste water that produces is even

465
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,679
higher in concentration than uh the

466
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:18,720
Water going in so you have to do

467
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,600
something with that waste waterer and so

468
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,440
it's a it's it's not a

469
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,839
very you you you have to think about

470
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,720
what to do with the Wastewater before

471
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:30,639
you install Ro filtration there are

472
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,519
other filters out there um Growers all

473
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,679
the time when I analyze water tests say

474
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,200
oh I'm using a hydrologic filter I think

475
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,440
they're called tall boys or something

476
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,038
I've seen dozens of tests and these just

477
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,080
they don't they don't work that you know

478
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,158
we've taken tests of the water before

479
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,439
and the water after and so inexpensive

480
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:50,159
filters just don't tend to remove they

481
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,960
might remove like five parts per million

482
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,520
or something of sodium but they really

483
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,038
don't clean the water like they need to

484
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:01,158
so there's the one option is you know

485
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:03,440
you filter the the second option is um

486
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:05,760
you actually can manage without

487
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,798
filtration and essentially what that

488
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,319
looks like is you irrigate and you

489
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:12,240
balance the other cat ions with nutrient

490
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,798
applications and you water with your

491
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,960
high sodium water and then every once in

492
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,480
a while you flush so what what will

493
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,759
happen is you you irrigate with high

494
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,240
sodium water and over time that sodium

495
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:26,720
accumulates in your soil um because the

496
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,319
plants well let's just say a lot of that

497
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,880
water evaporates into the air

498
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:33,839
but the sodium doesn't evaporate with

499
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,360
the water the sodium stays so the water

500
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,399
comes in with the Sodium the the H2O

501
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,798
evaporates but the sodium stays so over

502
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,120
time it starts to accumulate in the soil

503
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,839
and that's where you really start to see

504
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:49,038
issues with nutrient antagonisms or what

505
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,519
people call lockouts um maybe even salt

506
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,720
stress on your plants because your

507
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,918
sodium's getting too high and so you can

508
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,600
flush that sodium out so you can

509
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:58,759
irrigate with your high sodium water and

510
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:01,119
then when it accumulates you just do a

511
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:04,079
big flushing or leeching event and you

512
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,759
kind of um just run tons of water

513
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,599
through your so soil profile and that

514
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,679
all that excess sodium will essentially

515
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:13,240
get flushed out now if you add gypsum in

516
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,000
during that that leeching event it'll

517
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,798
actually be more effective in reducing

518
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,679
sodium and and so you're never getting

519
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:21,679
the sodium to zero you're just reverting

520
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,280
your soil back to that 48 parts per

521
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,600
million because that's what your is in

522
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,000
your water but what's going to happen

523
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:31,199
over time is it's going to go from 48 to

524
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,640
you know 75 to 100 to you know as high

525
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,919
as who who knows how high and so if you

526
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,679
leech it it kind of brings it back to

527
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:41,200
50 does that make sense yeah even if

528
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,798
you're planting in ground you would do a

529
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,080
flush like that yeah so it's very common

530
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:50,119
ergonomically in what's called sodic

531
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:53,918
soils which are high sodium soils to to

532
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:57,319
leech the the sodium out now that

533
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,360
assumes that your soil drains well and

534
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:01,879
that you have enough water to do this

535
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,879
kind of flush you're not like water

536
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:08,440
scarce um and it's not perfectly

537
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,880
effective by any means but it's this is

538
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,278
how like people in Arizona grow all the

539
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,320
time in Top Soil so now if you had like

540
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:18,519
a really poor draining soil a really

541
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,319
clay soil like for whatever reason you

542
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:21,679
just couldn't do that then it's not

543
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,918
going to be as good of an option you

544
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,679
really want your soil to to to drain

545
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,600
well um and it takes a lot of water you

546
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,840
really got to just like leave the

547
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,798
sprinklers on for a couple days type

548
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,798
thing and it's it's also something you

549
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:38,558
don't have to worry about yet so you can

550
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:42,200
sort of ignore this problem for a while

551
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,639
um in a high precipitation Place places

552
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,679
that get more than about 30 Ines of

553
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,120
rainfall per year which isn't Nevada

554
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,278
unfortunately but for listeners who have

555
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:56,038
maybe high sodium water um but live in a

556
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,960
place where it rains a lot that process

557
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:59,879
happens naturally so you're never seeing

558
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,400
elevated sodium because the water the

559
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,880
rainfall just keeps moving through the

560
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,679
soil profile and sodium luckily is very

561
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,120
Mobile in the soil so it moves through

562
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,360
the soil profile and out of the root

563
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:13,038
Zone pretty easily okay and then the

564
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,558
sodium listed here you 48 parts per

565
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,839
million he said it it competes with the

566
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,359
other cat ions potassium magnesium

567
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:21,798
calcium and calcium's higher at

568
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:25,639
107 magnesium's at 17 and then

569
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:27,519
potassium's at 3.4 so is that enough

570
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,200
calcium I guess another enough of the

571
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,759
other cat I to kind of compete with the

572
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,278
Sodium that's a good question so yeah I

573
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,000
mean to to the there's two issues with

574
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:37,679
sodium one is that it competes with the

575
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,960
uptake of other cat ions and the other

576
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:45,200
is that it increases the the um osmotic

577
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,120
stress or let's just call it salt stress

578
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,880
on the plants so at high levels it it

579
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,199
just adds more salt stress um and so it

580
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:57,760
makes it's harder for the plant to

581
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:00,080
uptake water and at these levels it um

582
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:03,679
technically what the plant is seeing is

583
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:05,240
Milla equivalence which is a it's not

584
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,320
it's a little bit more accurate way to

585
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,079
look at cations is like mill equivalence

586
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:16,038
looks at the the size of the ions in

587
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:17,678
addition to the quantity um and so yeah

588
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:21,640
I wouldn't worry about it I I would

589
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,880
worry about it antagonizing potassium

590
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,919
first and then

591
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,520
magnesium um it will reduce the uptake

592
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,200
of calcium but but the the what's going

593
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,759
to really hold your plants back is going

594
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,880
to be potassium and magnesium and we're

595
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:39,720
g we can see that on the the saturated

596
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,200
paste report which is a soil report um

597
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,960
if you look at

598
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,720
percentages we we let's let's wait on

599
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,960
jumping over there for now but that

600
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,440
would be the place to see if it's going

601
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,278
to really create like nutrient

602
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,360
deficiencies of other cant would be on

603
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,480
the paste

604
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,038
analysis but you got it I mean it's

605
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,079
mostly potassium

606
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,480
where there's going to be issues

607
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:06,558
understood okay what else do we need to

608
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,640
know about this okay so so I mentioned

609
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,599
high pH so you might think oh well can

610
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,159
you can you acidify the water well you

611
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:15,278
could you could drop the pH of your

612
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,039
water with acid um

613
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,960
but

614
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:24,038
there's you know some some

615
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:27,600
Waters have a pH of 7.7 and they just

616
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:29,440
need a tiny tiny bit of acid to drop the

617
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,959
ph and there's other Waters with a pH of

618
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,519
7.7 where you need quite a bit maybe a

619
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:38,720
whole handful um in a drum of water or

620
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,879
something so why is it that a water one

621
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,600
water with the same pH as another water

622
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,360
might need a little versus a lot of acid

623
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:46,519
to drop the ph and it's something called

624
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:51,000
alkalinity which is the the water's

625
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:53,359
resistance to pH change and with water

626
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,359
that has low alkalinity what that means

627
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,839
is that the the soil is going to buffer

628
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:01,719
the pH very easily so if you have low

629
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:04,038
alkalinity in your water uh your soil

630
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,880
it'll just very quickly reflect the soil

631
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:10,158
PH um or another way to say is it's not

632
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,159
going to change the soil PH very easily

633
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,840
now a water with a lot of alkalinity

634
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,399
means there's a lot of minerals that are

635
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:20,240
all putting upward pressure on the pH

636
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:22,719
that is a water that should be acidified

637
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,240
because it will influence the soil

638
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,960
solution pH quite significantly so

639
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,599
luckily even though your pH is 7.7 your

640
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:34,200
alkal alinity is relatively low and so

641
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,519
the the kind of arbitrary number I use

642
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,080
for alkalinity when to acidify versus

643
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:43,119
when to not is 120 parts per million and

644
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:46,918
you're at 70 so um yeah you know the

645
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:49,798
high pH isn't ideal it's not optimal but

646
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:53,038
it it shouldn't dramatically affect your

647
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:54,759
soil PH and just giving a little

648
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,240
foreshadowing to your soil your soil is

649
00:25:54,759 --> 00:26:00,319
a very mineral Rich calcarius high

650
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,159
calcium very high PH soil so this water

651
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,879
is not going to affect the soil PH your

652
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,000
soil pH is like it's like an ocean liner

653
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,120
you're not going to be able to move it

654
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,919
very easily

655
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:12,719
um so I would not acidify this water I

656
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,919
don't think that's the right use of time

657
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,240
money effort energy and then there's

658
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:17,919
some other stuff on this test that we

659
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,440
can just Breeze through bicarbonate

660
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,880
bicarbonate is the most common ion that

661
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,240
that creates high pH in high alkalinity

662
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,480
and you're at 85 parts per million um so

663
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,200
essentially what you're doing when you

664
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,640
add acid is you're neutralizing that

665
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,038
bicarbonate and that drops the

666
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:37,919
alkalinity in the pH so you're probably

667
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:40,319
you know there's probably sodium

668
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:45,080
bicarbonate in your water essentially

669
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:46,678
baking soda so that's just another uh

670
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:49,278
mineral that's in your water and then

671
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,240
chloride and sulfate so chloride at 94

672
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,798
parts per million is slightly elevated

673
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,240
but the best way to manage chloride is

674
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:56,879
not to freak out about how much is in

675
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,240
your water but rather to just keep an

676
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,159
eye on chloride levels on the saturated

677
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,440
paste report and when that starts

678
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:05,760
getting elevated then you know you

679
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,600
should do a leeching event um similar to

680
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,599
what I discuss with

681
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,640
sodium um and then sulfate so sulfur is

682
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,919
a beneficial plant nutrient it's very

683
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,038
high in the Aid West in soil often times

684
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,240
and oftentimes in water and sure enough

685
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:24,798
you have high sulfate so a lot of the

686
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,679
salt concentration of your water is

687
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:29,558
coming from the calcium some of it's

688
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,480
coming from the sodium but you have a

689
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:35,798
whopping 235 parts per million of of

690
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,880
sulfate in the water so not only do you

691
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:39,879
have sodium bicarbonate but you also

692
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:43,799
probably have gypsum which is calcium

693
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:46,919
sulfate in your water so not a bad thing

694
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:49,918
but um you know that's that's also

695
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:52,519
adding to the the salinity of your water

696
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,320
the good news there is you know you you

697
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:55,679
may not need to apply as much Gypsum to

698
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,240
your soil because you're just getting

699
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,200
free calcium and sulfur now

700
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,558
unfortunately it's coming with sodium

701
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,558
and chloride and things like that as

702
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:07,319
well so that so the reading on this you

703
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:10,918
know this salt concentration is showing

704
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:12,960
618 PPM so it's high like you mentioned

705
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,480
you're you're reading 400 something like

706
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,519
that point is it's it's elevated you

707
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,079
have salty water some of those salts are

708
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,919
good some of them are bad um but the the

709
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,759
limitation really on this test is is

710
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,840
sodium and then the final four things

711
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,679
that you added this isn't included on

712
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:31,038
all Logan tests I usually don't get them

713
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:35,320
tested is nitrate um

714
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:37,278
phosphorus and uh so nitrate is 1.8 PPM

715
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:38,839
honestly a little more than I'd want but

716
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:42,319
it's not a problem I wouldn't worry

717
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:45,839
about it it's fine for drinking

718
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:47,639
um and then no phosphorus essentially

719
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,480
which is really good that would be very

720
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,038
strange if you saw phosphorus in your

721
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,640
drinking water um and then there's two

722
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,480
other metrics phc which just says like

723
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,360
is the water going to be depositing

724
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,960
minerals stripping minerals from your

725
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:05,398
soil and yours is 7.6 so that's a

726
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,679
resounding deposition water it's going

727
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:11,558
to be providing minerals to the soil

728
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,480
because it's so high in salts um if you

729
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:16,158
AR filtered it it would drop to like

730
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,278
below one and that would be a water

731
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,039
that's that's essentially um you know

732
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:24,159
water is polar so it wants to like

733
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:27,679
consume it wants to pull minerals into

734
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,039
solution so when it's less than like one

735
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,919
it'll be pulling minerals I don't like

736
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:33,759
the word stripping that sort of has a

737
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,840
negative connotation even though that is

738
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,278
sort of what's Happening um and then the

739
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,798
adjusted SAR sodium absorption ratio

740
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:42,558
that just means you have kind of that

741
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,839
that's a that's a very relevant

742
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,319
measurement agronomically for your soil

743
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:49,519
because it's speaking to the sodium um

744
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:53,240
but it's more of a it's not really

745
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:55,399
helpful for for Growers it's more it's

746
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,399
helpful for people like me to determine

747
00:29:55,398 --> 00:30:00,599
when to suggest leeching soil in this

748
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,959
case I would so that's kind of that's a

749
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,439
lot so that's everything on the Water

750
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,960
Report there I do have a few questions

751
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,200
in regards to it you talked about

752
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,919
adjusting the pH you wouldn't really

753
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,399
have to adjust the pH in my particular

754
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,159
case but just for the folks listening

755
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,798
what are some general recommendations as

756
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,760
far as how to adjust the pH now you

757
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,000
mentioned for down it would be some sort

758
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:24,319
of acid right you're talking phosphoric

759
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,798
acid or you're talking something else

760
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,599
and then also what would you generally

761
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:30,119
use to adjust the pH upward

762
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:33,519
it really depends on if you're an

763
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:36,439
organic grower or not in organic

764
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:41,200
production the only two products that

765
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:43,759
are allowed to lower water PH are citric

766
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,600
acid or I'm sorry organic acids but

767
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,759
generally that's citric acid so any

768
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,519
organic acid could reduce water PH and

769
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,480
that's allowed um organic acids have you

770
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,798
know

771
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,480
Carbon and the most common and the least

772
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,798
expensive is citric

773
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,519
acid um

774
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:07,158
and the other option that's more even

775
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,359
more economic and really the only viable

776
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:13,559
option for Growers that are growing at

777
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:16,278
scale is sulfuric acid um sulfuric acid

778
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:18,200
is pretty uh CTIC you got to be careful

779
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:22,558
working with it you just be careful with

780
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,558
the PPE and um if you're you know for

781
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,000
Growers like around me who are reducing

782
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,599
their water PH they use sulfur burners

783
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,398
which is a tech think that used to be

784
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:33,480
used in indoor um

785
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:34,798
cultivation often times you're like

786
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,440
essentially sterilizing a room with a

787
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,158
sulfur burner this is different you're

788
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,519
you're burning sulfur and injecting it

789
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,080
into your irrigation water and it

790
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,079
reduces the pH but for small Growers

791
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,359
Organic acids are generally the best

792
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:49,638
option

793
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:51,000
um so yeah that's that's I guess what I

794
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:53,038
could say there you know some people get

795
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,798
creative with like different

796
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:58,638
ferments um you know really acidic

797
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:01,000
ferments or you know Theory you could do

798
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:03,079
it with a with like a humic substance

799
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,960
but it doesn't make sense because you're

800
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:08,678
you're really trying to do this in on an

801
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,558
ongoing basis so to continually reduce

802
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:14,120
water PH with the humic acid would be

803
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:18,638
overdoing it

804
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:21,278
um and then ph up I rarely am increasing

805
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:25,000
pH because generally an easier way to do

806
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:27,119
it is just put just push your soil PH up

807
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,119
a little bit and then when you water

808
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:34,359
with an acidic water in a and you water

809
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:36,959
a high pH soil they combine and create a

810
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:40,519
really good optimal pH so in my opinion

811
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:43,440
you just want to lime your soil up um

812
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:47,079
and it's okay to use a slightly acidic

813
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,399
water now sometimes occasionally if I

814
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:51,000
like over pH you know if I'm if I'm

815
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:52,798
reducing the pH of my water and I overdo

816
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,398
it I'll just throw in a little bit of

817
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:58,519
powdered lime calcium carbonate um the

818
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,079
bottled products that are are more

819
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:02,278
common would be like potassium

820
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,798
bicarbonate and things like that but

821
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:06,519
again I can't there's just not many

822
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:09,879
instances when I'm recommending an

823
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:11,798
increase in the water PH um usually I'm

824
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,679
decreasing pH and really I'm just

825
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:15,440
personally I decrease pH most often when

826
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,759
I'm doing foler sprays I like to

827
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,600
decrease my foler spray solution um it

828
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:24,158
improves the efficiency of the foler and

829
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,398
I always just use citric acid got it

830
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,159
okay a couple more questions here on the

831
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,638
Water Report there's a couple things

832
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,559
here that this report doesn't show that

833
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:35,959
are big concerns for Growers which is

834
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:38,240
chlorine and chloramine can you talk to

835
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,880
us a little bit about those two things

836
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:45,720
yeah that's a good question um I'm

837
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,039
curious how the lab tests chloride and

838
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:52,319
if chlorine and chloramine are included

839
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:53,359
in the chloride number um I should know

840
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,079
but I would need to think about the

841
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:56,479
chemistry there and have to look look at

842
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:59,319
the molecules and

843
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,720
things but no even if it was included in

844
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:03,439
the chloride number you don't

845
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,720
necessarily know the difference

846
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,838
between uh chloride chloramine and

847
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:14,800
chlorine the if I had to sort

848
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:18,119
of my my guess is those two are are

849
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,960
concerns of Growers not necessarily from

850
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:22,679
a chemistry standpoint but from a

851
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,800
biological standpoint yes because

852
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,760
they're natural sterilizing agents in

853
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,399
our water um to clean up our water and

854
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,599
so nobody gets you know lethally

855
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:35,078
ill but you

856
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:36,359
know yeah it's I guess it's a it's a

857
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:38,480
question of what weather we should be

858
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:40,679
drinking it too so those numbers aren't

859
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,519
reported I guess is the short answer

860
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:46,358
personally my general view of biology is

861
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:49,079
that there's not enough of those two

862
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:50,759
chemicals in the water to like smoke the

863
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:54,119
biology in your soil the concentrations

864
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:57,760
are low soil biology is very resilient

865
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:59,519
um and so I've never seen or heard of a

866
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,160
reduction in biological activity

867
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,320
abundance or diversity because someone's

868
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,559
using a water treated with chlorine or

869
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,599
chloramine of course if you went high

870
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:11,239
enough with those you could absolutely

871
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,880
kill everything but generally speaking I

872
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:17,519
don't think municipalities are are

873
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:20,680
pushing them um high enough to to Really

874
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:22,079
you know kill everything now are they

875
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:23,559
killing some things I don't know it's a

876
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,720
good it's it's I guess that's an open

877
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:28,719
question um no one's ever presented

878
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:31,199
evidence to me that reducing crop

879
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:33,919
quality or production or yield or even

880
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,399
biological numbers but that's not to say

881
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,960
it's not I would just question that

882
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,880
assumption a little bit and just I'd

883
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,280
love to see like someone who um I mean I

884
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,559
guess the the best way to to to answer

885
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,119
that question would be there's something

886
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,920
called DNA sequencing where you can

887
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:49,559
actually sequence the entire Genome of

888
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,400
the soil every single organism in the

889
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:53,679
soil it'd be interesting to see to

890
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,039
sequence a soil before and then after

891
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:58,239
like a season of chlorine and chloramine

892
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:00,880
application to see if um

893
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,479
the the total numbers of of organisms

894
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,000
decreases that would be really

895
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,719
interesting to see yeah because

896
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,358
generally you know for chloramine for

897
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,519
example it's generally said that there's

898
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:13,318
nothing that can be done in order to

899
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:14,960
eliminate chloramine but for chlorine a

900
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:16,639
lot of Growers they're doing a couple

901
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,760
things they're either letting their

902
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:21,799
water sit out for a period of 24 hours

903
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,160
some say that if you if you have light

904
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,280
on it that helps reduce the amount of

905
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,078
chlorine and then also some people

906
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,760
saying that it sticks to your skin so

907
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,160
some people actually stick their hand in

908
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,520
the bucket of water swirl it around and

909
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,118
they're saying that's reducing the

910
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:38,960
amount of chlorine is there any truth to

911
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,240
either one of those things well I can

912
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,960
definitely speak to the first thing and

913
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:44,679
say yes if you leave it out it

914
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:48,519
volatilizes off

915
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:50,159
um the sunlight I don't know I I just

916
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:54,000
don't know it might it might degrade the

917
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:58,159
molecule or something um the

918
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,280
arm don't I don't know but my tells me

919
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,960
no my gut tells me you just smell it on

920
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,000
your it's you know you're just smelling

921
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,720
the water on your arm but I don't know

922
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,599
um it could be there could be some kind

923
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:10,239
of

924
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,680
like light electrical charge that you

925
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:15,559
know grabs the molecules a little bit

926
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:18,358
that's possible

927
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:19,920
um in any case I wouldn't be too worried

928
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:22,358
about it unless you're using like a

929
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,599
really strong like you know it was pool

930
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:25,838
water I'd be worried about it but yeah I

931
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:27,519
mean everyone has a different style I

932
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:31,000
would say that that's generally not the

933
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:33,358
low hanging fruit in in you know yield

934
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,679
and crop quality as for in my experience

935
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:36,960
but it's not to say you shouldn't be

936
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:40,039
thinking about it okay and then last

937
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,519
question on the water side from me is I

938
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:42,880
want to get your overall thoughts on

939
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,000
kind of some of the water treatment

940
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,838
options out there that neutralize

941
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,039
contaminants for example there's the

942
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:50,880
product out there I won't name the

943
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:52,719
product but it says it neutralizes and

944
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,880
assists in reduction over 250

945
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:57,639
contaminants it reduces lead chlorine

946
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:01,440
fluoride

947
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:04,159
and uh 99% of industrial chemicals and

948
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,159
99% of pharmaceuticals it also

949
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,279
remineralizes those adds in like calcium

950
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,960
phosphorus potassium so I think there

951
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,960
are numerous products out there that do

952
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,679
something like this generally are these

953
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,199
products something that you recommend or

954
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,440
recommend that you avoid that people

955
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,919
avoid or what yeah so there's sort of

956
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,760
two categories of products I can think

957
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,760
of there's filtration products and then

958
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,200
there's like additives generally with

959
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,960
any kind of

960
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:33,118
filtration my my recommendation is take

961
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,838
a water test before the filter install

962
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,920
the filter take a water test after the

963
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:38,440
filter obviously it's not showing

964
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,318
everything definitely not

965
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,159
Pharmaceuticals and hormones and

966
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,800
chloramine and stuff like that but if

967
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:47,078
you see the numbers decrease of the

968
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,480
things you are testing for then you know

969
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:50,039
the filter is working and if these

970
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,639
things don't decrease well I could bet

971
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:53,000
you they're not taking anything else out

972
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:54,239
either so there's a lot of filters that

973
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,800
don't work and there's a really simple

974
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:59,078
solution you just test before and after

975
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,920
um and determine if your filters working

976
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:04,599
I do think filters work I think some of

977
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,200
them are extremely effective and some of

978
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:07,599
them are not very effective and there's

979
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:09,919
a whole spectrum and usually that's

980
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,559
correlated with the price of the filter

981
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,599
um so in general I believe in fil

982
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:15,279
filters I don't believe in additives

983
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,280
like things you add to the water that

984
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,400
tie up because here's what happens um

985
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,040
similar to what I was explaining with

986
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,760
sodium that water goes into the soil and

987
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:28,199
it may tie up things so it's not plant

988
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,760
available or it's you you know sort of

989
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:32,519
enclosed in a molecule and so the

990
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,520
microbes and the soil and the plants

991
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,480
can't access that thing but over time

992
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:39,199
those degrade and biology you know

993
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,639
there's a whole cycling process that

994
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:44,279
happens in the soil so if you put an ion

995
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:46,960
of lead in The Soil well it may be you

996
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,280
know complexed or chelated somehow but

997
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,639
over time eventually that's going to

998
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,359
become available because it's going to

999
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,480
cycle into availability and out of

1000
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:57,039
availability a thousand times and so

1001
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,760
when it comes to heavy metals and really

1002
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:01,400
anything in my opinion tying it up is a

1003
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,680
short-term solution but longterm you're

1004
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,960
not solving anything um and so you

1005
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:09,480
really just want to

1006
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,159
avoid the addition of heavy metals to

1007
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,358
begin with um because they're going to

1008
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,759
they're going to just like sodium

1009
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:16,759
they're going to accumulate as the water

1010
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,839
evaporates and they stay and just

1011
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,079
because they're tied up now doesn't mean

1012
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,159
they're going to be tied up later

1013
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:25,318
nothing is permanent okay yeah the

1014
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:27,480
product I was mentioning is in your

1015
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:31,079
definition an additive it's a a liquid

1016
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,800
bottle that you would add to your yeah

1017
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,800
that seems fishy to me I mean it's

1018
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,880
probably like a carbon based thing and

1019
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,119
then if it's not carbon based it's like

1020
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,280
definitely not organic and you might be

1021
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,559
creating other contamination issues you

1022
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,800
know like keates aren't the the kindest

1023
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:49,679
thing either synthetic key lades so um I

1024
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,599
don't like those I would not recommend

1025
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,399
that there's a lot unfortunately in the

1026
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,720
world of water there's sort of like a

1027
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,920
lot of snake oil um and there's a lot of

1028
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,279
things that I don't even want to call

1029
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,720
them snake oil I just want to say like

1030
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,640
they're unproven or they're sort of

1031
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:07,000
questionable and for some reason this I

1032
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:10,639
mean all the way from like structured

1033
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,440
water to mag magnified and electrified

1034
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:15,679
water there's just like this whole

1035
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,960
Rabbit Hole of water I've gone down it

1036
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:21,358
unfortunately and gotten like you know

1037
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,199
sold on things and then had to sort of

1038
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,199
come back out and realize like wait what

1039
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,439
am I doing like I should stop obsessing

1040
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:30,078
about the quality of water I haven't

1041
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,838
seen and I haven't seen any improvements

1042
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,359
in crop health and yield um if you are

1043
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:36,880
going to invest in something that's

1044
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:40,318
you're not sure about or that you think

1045
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,640
could be you know kind of bogus what I

1046
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:46,400
always recommend is do a split test so

1047
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:50,960
like if possible break your farm your

1048
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:53,599
garden your grow into into in half and

1049
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,159
do no treatment on half and do the

1050
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,680
treatment on the other half and just

1051
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:58,279
observe if you see a difference like

1052
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:59,799
make the result speak for themselves I

1053
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,760
think every product should have to prove

1054
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,039
itself so that's often difficult with

1055
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,200
water because you're installing

1056
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:06,960
something and that's the source of your

1057
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:09,000
water so how are you going to like you

1058
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,358
know go back and forth but in general

1059
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,440
that's the concept I think All Growers

1060
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:13,719
should always be thinking about is like

1061
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,200
if you're going to invest money try to

1062
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:17,039
figure out a way to like prove it to

1063
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,598
yourself that it's going to work okay

1064
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,880
good to know should we move on to the so

1065
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,880
test now sure let's do it what do we

1066
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,039
need to know about the soil test there's

1067
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,280
two different ones from Logan Labs there

1068
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,719
one that's labeled soil report and then

1069
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,319
there's one labeled as saturated paste

1070
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,000
report yeah so in general my

1071
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:39,159
recommendation to Growers is to get a

1072
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,880
complete soil test from Logan um Logan's

1073
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:42,679
my go-to lab it's the only lab I use

1074
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,400
I've calibrated I've seen you know tens

1075
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:45,960
of thousands of these tests so I can't

1076
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,079
really switch Labs because all labs are

1077
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,440
a little bit different um and I really

1078
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,800
recommend Logan Labs partially because

1079
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,240
they do what's called a saturated Pace

1080
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,240
test as part of their complete analysis

1081
00:42:55,239 --> 00:43:00,118
and so a standard soil tast test

1082
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,279
generally uses a strong acid and they

1083
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,480
extract all these theoretically

1084
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,359
available nutrients with a acid with a

1085
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,639
pH of

1086
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:10,558
2.5 and it's supposed to show you what's

1087
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,318
your bank account of nutrients looks

1088
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,319
like and so that's what you see on kind

1089
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,960
of like any normal soil report and they

1090
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:19,599
have different acid extractions and

1091
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,480
different techniques but what Logan does

1092
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,680
is they then take your soil and they

1093
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,760
combine it with your irrigation water

1094
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:28,279
and they do a water extract it's called

1095
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,920
a saturated paste test T so on the one

1096
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,839
hand you see the standard soil test

1097
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,720
that's like all the nutrients that may

1098
00:43:32,838 --> 00:43:37,838
be available over decades in your soil

1099
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:39,558
and then you see the saturated past test

1100
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:42,000
which is okay what are the nutrients

1101
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:43,720
that are available today that are

1102
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,239
soluble that

1103
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:49,799
are available to your roots right now

1104
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:51,519
and the reality is not one or the other

1105
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,640
but it's really helpful to see both of

1106
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:56,358
those tests to be able to to sort of see

1107
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:58,519
what's happening real time as well as

1108
00:43:56,358 --> 00:44:00,480
the general chemical pattern of your

1109
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:02,800
soil and so that's why I recommend

1110
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,719
getting both of these

1111
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,519
um so I guess like the first thing just

1112
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:09,759
kind of like I'm just instead of going

1113
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:11,480
through it all in in great detail which

1114
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,880
you know I cover in my course and it

1115
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,039
takes hours let me just point let me

1116
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,440
just kind of point out a couple things

1117
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,119
about your soil that I feel like are

1118
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,440
relevant the first thing on the standard

1119
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:21,720
test that I see is you have a organic

1120
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,400
matter of

1121
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:27,558
1% um which is is unfortunately quite

1122
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,400
low and what this means is yeah you

1123
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:33,960
probably have a grally rocky sandy soil

1124
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,880
that just doesn't um hold organic matter

1125
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,800
like a clay soil would and that's just

1126
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,519
so it's partially just a function of the

1127
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,640
soil texture um but it also is a

1128
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,039
function of where you live in the

1129
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:45,960
country you know generally organic

1130
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:48,440
matter levels aren't super high in Aid

1131
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,440
environments because there hasn't been

1132
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,039
eons of tropical jungles and plant

1133
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,280
growth and forests and things like that

1134
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:55,800
you're in the desert there's just not a

1135
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,079
lot of vegetation that's gone into that

1136
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:01,000
soil over the long term so the best

1137
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,440
solution for you in my opinion for your

1138
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,358
nutrient management

1139
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,240
is is simply large amounts of biomass of

1140
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:11,318
composts

1141
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:14,558
manure uh

1142
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:17,838
mulch um small amounts of wood chips and

1143
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:20,280
biochar I mean anything any carbon based

1144
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:22,400
input and specifically just compost I

1145
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,160
mean large applications of compost I

1146
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,400
think

1147
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:32,598
will um work wonders in combination with

1148
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,440
uh just Garden it cover cropping I mean

1149
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:36,359
whether it's your vegetables and your

1150
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,920
trees or if it's a cover crop like a

1151
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:41,719
living cover crop over time that will

1152
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,519
really start to raise organic matter and

1153
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:45,000
just start pushing carbon into the soil

1154
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:47,000
it's a longterm process but the

1155
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,800
combination of carbon based inputs and

1156
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,880
and actually like cover cropping is the

1157
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,839
best solution for the soil and you know

1158
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,640
mineralization through organic

1159
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:58,159
amendments will help but at the end of

1160
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:00,279
the day over the long term you just want

1161
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,639
to get more organic matter in the soil

1162
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:05,119
that's sort of your like your insurance

1163
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,799
policy against all nutrients so that's

1164
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,960
the first thing would worm castings be

1165
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,000
in that category totally I forgot worm

1166
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:16,159
castings worm castings are great um you

1167
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:20,559
know the problem with being in Nevada or

1168
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:22,440
Arizona or Colorado is the same problems

1169
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,440
with the water that we're looking at and

1170
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,599
the same problems with the soil that you

1171
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,240
have are also going to be seen in the

1172
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:30,559
comp post that you buy commercially

1173
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:31,959
around you it's probably going to be

1174
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,040
high in sodium it's probably going to be

1175
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,240
high in you know calcium and sulfur and

1176
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:38,358
so it's

1177
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:40,399
like there's not a perfect antidote from

1178
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:42,440
a compost standpoint generally because

1179
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,838
it's it's going to have the same sort of

1180
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:48,440
underlying pattern as these other things

1181
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:52,799
in the environment um but still castings

1182
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:56,599
if you can make them um just carbon of

1183
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,559
all kinds I mean like heavy mulch leaves

1184
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:59,200
just

1185
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:00,640
and I would personally in an AED

1186
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:03,078
environment with low organic matter I

1187
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:04,239
actually like tillage only because I'm

1188
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:06,599
able to

1189
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,879
incorporate this these carbon sources

1190
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:12,640
easier you can get them deep I mean you

1191
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,760
can like just broad fork or double dig

1192
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,558
organic matter is you know as deep as

1193
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,079
you can go and then over time you can

1194
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,160
back off on the disturbance on the

1195
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,960
tillage um but for right now I would

1196
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:25,480
just try to get tons of organic matter

1197
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,599
in that so okay yeah it's Rocky out here

1198
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:30,639
I have to use a jackhammer order to get

1199
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,760
down low oh man so yeah it's uh it's

1200
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:35,199
pretty brutal I mean so yeah so that's

1201
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,400
the other thing that soil test won't

1202
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:39,000
show you is rocks I mean rocks are like

1203
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,838
obviously everyone knows rocks are not

1204
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,400
good for for plants but so sometimes the

1205
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:46,279
best investment you can make in a field

1206
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,680
or a garden is is Rock picking which is

1207
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,720
extraordinarily time and energy

1208
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:52,239
intensive but like the the you know

1209
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:54,558
there's these old farms around here

1210
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:58,679
where the entire edge of the farm is

1211
00:47:54,559 --> 00:48:01,760
like a giant pile of Rock rocks so some

1212
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:03,919
Oldtimer some Pioneer literally like

1213
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,800
picked the rocks out and and that was

1214
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,159
the best in that was the best long-term

1215
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,760
investment they could have made in that

1216
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:12,078
field because to this day like people

1217
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,440
can grow in it and they're not you know

1218
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,160
and I know you're in a garden scale but

1219
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,920
there's implements on tractors that can

1220
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:19,759
like they're called Rock Pickers that

1221
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,760
can remove rocks from Fields so anyway

1222
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,000
that's

1223
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,160
interesting yeah get the rocks out Jack

1224
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,880
hammeron go as deep as you can go and in

1225
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:28,879
the process is you're disturbing it

1226
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,039
getting the rocks out try to get

1227
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,160
castings organic matter mulch anything

1228
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:36,318
in there will do um so the other things

1229
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:38,440
I'm seeing on here is like your

1230
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:40,639
phosphorus is particularly low so I like

1231
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:43,280
to look at phosphorus on this serer test

1232
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,318
you have 28 pound per acre of phosphate

1233
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,760
which is

1234
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:48,838
p205 um for really heavy feeding

1235
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,720
vegetables let's just say Tomatoes I

1236
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:54,838
like that to be a thousand so heavy

1237
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:57,719
applications of bone meal I think would

1238
00:48:54,838 --> 00:48:59,759
serve you very well um and bone meal or

1239
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:03,679
fish bone meal whatever your preference

1240
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:07,839
is also brings in uh 3 to 4% nitrogen 3%

1241
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:09,879
on bone meal 4% on fishbone meal so uh I

1242
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:12,239
would be thinking about like in year one

1243
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,000
and two like my primary nitrogen Source

1244
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,358
in addition to the compost would be

1245
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,920
would be some kind of bone meal um and

1246
00:49:16,358 --> 00:49:20,838
that'll just really push your phosphorus

1247
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,680
levels way up and provide quite a bit of

1248
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:27,358
available nitrogen as well fishbone meal

1249
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:28,838
also has nice micronutrients in it the

1250
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:30,920
downside of fishbone meal is it's from

1251
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:33,199
the ocean so it also has high sodium and

1252
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,079
chloride which you already have an

1253
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:38,199
excess of so personally I'd go with bone

1254
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:40,680
meal and so between the the bone meals

1255
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:42,838
and the heavy compost SL castings

1256
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:45,318
application I think that will probably

1257
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:47,519
get you the nitrogen that you need your

1258
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:49,599
nitrogen your available nitrogen which

1259
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,199
is tested on that soil test as in

1260
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:55,519
inorganic forms um of ammonium and

1261
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:57,798
nitrate are both like less than one PPM

1262
00:49:55,519 --> 00:50:00,000
depending on the crop and depending on

1263
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:03,960
the production system you want that

1264
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,199
quite a bit higher like 25 to 125 parts

1265
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,519
per million of nitrate depending on what

1266
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:11,439
you're growing how long it's in the

1267
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:13,079
ground uh top soil versus you know pee

1268
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,838
based engineered media there's a number

1269
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:17,359
of variables but for your for you

1270
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:19,759
perennial trees and vegetables I would

1271
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:22,598
want that at 30 to 50 parts per million

1272
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,400
of nitrate so heavy compost and bone

1273
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:25,880
meal should get you there but the best

1274
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,079
thing to do is incorporate those things

1275
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,160
and then retest and see where see where

1276
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,599
things fall because compost is highly

1277
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:34,558
variable um so there's it's it's hard to

1278
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:36,798
be precise with compost the best thing

1279
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:39,440
to do is just get it in there and then

1280
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:41,798
retest and see where you're at um but in

1281
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,599
general I mean uh just to give you a

1282
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:47,880
rate on compost uh or castings let's

1283
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:50,200
just say it's a 1% nitrogen compost

1284
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:54,000
which is pretty typical like a rich

1285
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:57,480
compost uh castings yeah let's just say

1286
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,159
1% I would apply

1287
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:05,159
20 tons per acre which

1288
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:08,598
is like 440 lb per th square feet but

1289
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:10,879
quite a bit um when you spread that

1290
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:13,798
though it spreads out pretty quick I

1291
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,358
mean that's like probably only a quarter

1292
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:17,239
inch or something but you could easily

1293
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:21,078
go with like a half an inch deep and

1294
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:23,279
then and then work it in um and people

1295
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:24,480
with a with a more mellow compost you go

1296
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,640
way heavier than that you could do two

1297
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,440
inches and just really work it in heavy

1298
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,279
I never recommend applying more than two

1299
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,440
inches of compost in a single

1300
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:35,359
application and I would want that to be

1301
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:37,960
like a a mellow yard waist sort of

1302
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:40,279
compost not a manure based

1303
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:42,880
compost castings tend to be rich

1304
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:44,880
depending on how they're made um do you

1305
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,760
make them yourself yeah I do have a worm

1306
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,838
bin so I do have but it's real small

1307
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,760
scale it's a small bin in my garage

1308
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:52,599
actually so yeah so in your case you're

1309
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,200
just applying everything you can make

1310
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:56,720
yeah exactly yeah I would just make it

1311
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,719
as much as you can as fast as you can

1312
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:01,078
and just get it out there I do have a

1313
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:03,879
local source that has worm castings but

1314
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:05,599
they also add in kelp and rock dust

1315
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,599
which I thought was kind of interesting

1316
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,359
yeah both great products for trace

1317
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,079
minerals non- essential but highly

1318
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:12,798
beneficial and bios stimulating trace

1319
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:14,880
minerals I use I've always used rock

1320
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:17,440
dust and kelp I've backed off recently

1321
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,838
if you're getting tested for arsenic in

1322
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:23,000
your you know cash crop I would not use

1323
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:26,599
those but um or heavy metals just in

1324
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,280
general but I've always used them in my

1325
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:30,599
vegetable garden because I'm trying to

1326
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:33,280
sort of increase the mineralization of

1327
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:37,318
my food

1328
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,720
um yeah so a a a well-made compost just

1329
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:42,838
apply it liberally as as much as you can

1330
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:45,000
afford up to 2 in um and if you

1331
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:47,318
overshoot and it's a little too rich and

1332
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,079
your your nutrients get a little too

1333
00:52:47,318 --> 00:52:52,318
high that's generally okay when it's a

1334
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,000
compost-based nutrient if you're using

1335
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:57,960
synthetic nutrients it's a lot more

1336
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,480
risky um but over a flying compost is in

1337
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,280
your case probably not the end of the

1338
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,159
world let's see let me just jump to a

1339
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,400
couple other things um your your soil

1340
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:08,000
has a pach of

1341
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:11,079
8.6 which

1342
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,880
is probably shockingly high for a lot of

1343
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:19,000
listeners um and it is quite High way

1344
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:23,358
above optimal and um yet I'll make the

1345
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,519
point that an excessively high pH is not

1346
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:28,199
nearly as much of a problem as an

1347
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:30,639
excessively low ph pH so if you put a

1348
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:31,919
plant in a pH of 8 versus a plant in a

1349
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:34,759
pH of

1350
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,960
4.5 the plant that goes into the the

1351
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:40,000
soil with a pH of 4.5 is going to be

1352
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:43,400
much worse off much much worse off my

1353
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,679
soil pH is 8.2 and you should see the

1354
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:49,639
explosive growth on my peach

1355
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:52,199
trees so um in the west again the Arid

1356
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:54,078
West that hasn't had you know thousands

1357
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:56,239
of inches tens of thousands millions of

1358
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,920
inches of rainfall over the last several

1359
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:01,639
thousand th years those minerals levels

1360
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:04,880
are just so high that it pushes the the

1361
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:07,440
ph up and it's we can't unfortunately

1362
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,400
adjust the pH of our soil very easily

1363
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,200
because there's just huge amounts of

1364
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,280
Free lime in the so in the parent

1365
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,118
material of the soil so I would not

1366
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,720
recommend trying to reduce your soil PH

1367
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,440
I would simply um try to balance the

1368
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:22,078
nutrients as well as possible and let

1369
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,760
the the plant RIS asphere acidify just

1370
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,519
that tiny little area next to the root

1371
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,559
to make nutrients available in instead

1372
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:30,559
of trying to acidify the bulk soil that

1373
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:33,880
makes sense and and I noticed you

1374
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:35,880
mentioned the pH on the soil report

1375
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,760
versus it also shows a pH on the

1376
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:41,200
saturated paste report yeah so this is

1377
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,359
okay let There great great point so like

1378
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:45,399
I said the soil pH is 8.6 but then when

1379
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:47,598
you combine the soil with your

1380
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,639
irrigation water which is what the lab

1381
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,240
you submitted some irrigation water

1382
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:53,078
obviously for the water tests but then

1383
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:54,358
the lab used your irrigation water for

1384
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:55,920
the pace test so they're trying to

1385
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:59,279
replicate what the soil solution looks

1386
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:02,240
like after you irrigate and so even

1387
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,559
though your your water pH is high it

1388
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:08,358
actually dropped the soil solution pH

1389
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:11,680
because the soil is 8.6 the water was

1390
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:15,159
7.7 and the combination of the two is

1391
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:16,879
7.9 so believe it or not your water your

1392
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:19,318
high pH water is actually slightly

1393
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,318
acidifying the soil solution which is a

1394
00:55:19,318 --> 00:55:23,199
good thing it's bringing that down so

1395
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:27,239
the the plant roots don't actually see

1396
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:29,318
8.6 they see 7.9

1397
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:31,118
um so I guess I said I wouldn't

1398
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:35,119
recommend acidifying your water I still

1399
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,880
wouldn't but if you did it would help

1400
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:39,200
theoretically um if you were really

1401
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:43,039
trying to optimize if you were like if

1402
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:45,798
you had like 100 acres of Premium Fruit

1403
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:49,000
or medicinal plants or something and you

1404
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:50,880
were really trying to optimize your your

1405
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,239
growth I would say you yeah

1406
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,760
acidification with a sulfur burner would

1407
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:58,118
totally help but on a small scale I

1408
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,640
don't think there would be much of a

1409
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:01,318
difference and I think it would be a

1410
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:04,358
huge pain in the

1411
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:07,838
butt um so yeah your plant roots are

1412
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:10,279
swimming in 7.9 otherwise the TR the

1413
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:13,000
because you're they combine the the

1414
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,200
irrigation water with your soil the

1415
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,400
other thing that's high on the pace

1416
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:18,480
report is sodium unfortunately because

1417
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,480
again you're the it's it's sort of

1418
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,599
reflecting that high sodium in the in

1419
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:26,280
the water so your sodium in the SL in on

1420
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,920
the past report is 56 parts per million

1421
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:32,079
and unfortunately your potassium is only

1422
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:35,960
six parts per million so I would expect

1423
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:38,559
if you didn't amend your soil your plant

1424
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,358
your plants would show pretty acute

1425
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,480
potassium deficiency and potentially

1426
00:56:40,358 --> 00:56:44,199
magnesium deficiency magnesium is

1427
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,920
actually I think magnesium is okay it's

1428
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:48,679
30 parts per million and the reason I

1429
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,599
say that is because if you jump down on

1430
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:55,000
the pce report to the percentages

1431
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:59,119
calcium is 43% of the soil solution

1432
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,798
pretty good I like 40 to 60% generally

1433
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:04,079
higher is better but um I don't think

1434
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:05,880
your plants are going to have calcium

1435
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:09,318
accute Calcium

1436
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:11,240
deficiency the Magnesium is 28% that's

1437
00:57:09,318 --> 00:57:13,480
actually pretty high I like magnesium to

1438
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:16,000
be like 20% of the soil solution and

1439
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,920
you're at 28% so the magnesium in the

1440
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,760
soil and the Magnesium from the water

1441
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:23,480
from a balance standpoint is sufficient

1442
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:27,799
but then the next two are where the

1443
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:30,000
problem lies potassium is 1.7 % on the

1444
00:57:27,798 --> 00:57:34,719
pace test so 1.7% of the solil solution

1445
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,760
is potassium and 27% is sodium medicinal

1446
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:39,358
plants that we've talked about before I

1447
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:41,760
generally see potassium but Growers call

1448
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:44,519
lock out but what I call

1449
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:47,119
antagonisms essentially potassium

1450
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:49,159
nutrient deficiency visually manifests

1451
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:53,160
when that percentage of sodium goes

1452
00:57:49,159 --> 00:57:54,960
above the perc potassium so in this case

1453
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:56,719
you're not even close like that sodium

1454
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,880
is so much higher than the potass that I

1455
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:01,078
could I would bet money that those

1456
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,119
plants would struggle and you would see

1457
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:04,760
weird symptoms that maybe look like

1458
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,318
potassium deficiency but often times

1459
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,440
just look hard to identify visually and

1460
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:12,920
that's that sodium blocking the uptake

1461
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:15,240
of potassium so in your case I think

1462
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,838
this a large compost application will

1463
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:19,000
really push potassium up because there's

1464
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:20,078
a lot of potassium in compost but I

1465
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,599
would

1466
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:25,798
also um be ready to feed potassium and I

1467
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,160
like uh organically there's a product

1468
00:58:25,798 --> 00:58:30,318
called pottassium sulfate it's not

1469
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:32,000
carbon based but it is allowed in

1470
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:34,199
organic production and that'll really

1471
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,920
push up soluble potassium it'll move

1472
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:38,639
that percentage toward potassium and

1473
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:40,280
away from sodium so you're not removing

1474
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:43,798
sodium you're just adding more potassium

1475
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:45,400
to try to U kind of balance the scale so

1476
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:47,400
yeah I mean I guess the takeaway here is

1477
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,960
just apply huge amounts of compost and

1478
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,599
retest because it's hard to be precise

1479
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:54,240
and then I think what you need to be

1480
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,640
aware of is having a an additional

1481
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,719
nitrogen Source on hand if that compost

1482
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,759
doesn't provide the nitrogen you need

1483
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:03,439
and your plants are hungry or you retest

1484
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:06,559
and it's still low I think having any

1485
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:10,358
kind of nitrogen meal so aala meal

1486
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:12,160
soybean meal um blood meal feather meal

1487
00:59:10,358 --> 00:59:14,960
and just whatever you want to use

1488
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:17,399
whatever your preference is um or you

1489
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,798
could use like a liquid nitrogen like uh

1490
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:25,400
liquid fish hydrate or

1491
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:27,639
um you know any kind of powdered soluble

1492
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,000
nitrogen

1493
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:31,159
so that's I would I would just have that

1494
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,639
ready I think that's an important tool

1495
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:34,598
in the toolbox for you and I would also

1496
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:37,759
have a small amount of potassium sulfate

1497
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:40,760
ready um because if that compost doesn't

1498
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,599
provide enough potassium or the sodium

1499
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,680
keeps keeps accumulating over time you

1500
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:46,119
might need to keep chasing balance by

1501
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:48,598
applying

1502
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:50,480
potassium um and otherwise I I wouldn't

1503
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:51,599
necessarily oh and the bone meals that's

1504
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,760
right that's

1505
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:56,359
pre-plant and otherwise I'd say like see

1506
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,319
with the compost a large comp compost

1507
00:59:56,358 --> 01:00:00,480
application does for you I mean zinc and

1508
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:03,038
copper are both low iron's low manganese

1509
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:06,318
is low a balanced micronutrient blend

1510
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:07,920
might really benefit you um but I think

1511
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:10,558
those again you might get that through

1512
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,159
the compost so I would wait and see okay

1513
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,960
one of the things on here that we didn't

1514
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:17,879
talk about is silicon and you know

1515
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,440
silica is non-essential element for

1516
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,920
medicinal plants I know it's essential

1517
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,960
in some plants I believe it's horse

1518
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,318
tailes if I remember correctly it is an

1519
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,280
essential element but generally for a

1520
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:30,440
lot of plants I believe it's a

1521
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:34,880
non-essential element now this percent

1522
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:36,679
here say well it says 29.3 on the report

1523
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,160
is that a high number is that a low

1524
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:41,598
number yeah so silica is interesting

1525
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:43,519
it's yes technically it's nonessential

1526
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,079
but it's so

1527
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:47,440
beneficial

1528
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:50,039
that it should be thought of as an

1529
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,358
essential nutrient um from for all the

1530
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:54,240
plants we're talking about because it

1531
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:57,000
just it increases abiotic stress

1532
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:59,679
resistance um it strengthens cell walls

1533
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,318
it just has like a weird almost

1534
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:03,399
biostimulating effect on yield and plant

1535
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:06,000
growth and

1536
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:08,519
health so

1537
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,599
uh generally speaking silica

1538
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:13,358
applications are always going to be

1539
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:15,119
beneficial the the reason I don't love

1540
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:18,199
the Silicon number on a standard soil

1541
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:20,760
test is I'm not sure that silicon is

1542
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:23,558
plants available so essentially that

1543
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:26,839
that acidic uh soil extractant is just

1544
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:28,599
kind of dissolving some of the soil and

1545
01:01:26,838 --> 01:01:30,960
the silica I mean rocks are made out of

1546
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:32,960
silica so a lot of a lot of that's just

1547
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,960
kind of like it's hard to know if it's

1548
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,679
actually plant available or not but to

1549
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:40,400
answer your question 29 PPM is a quite

1550
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:42,639
High number um so you have really good

1551
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,639
silica in your soil whether or not it's

1552
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:46,598
plant available hard to know uh

1553
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:49,358
especially at your high pH level if the

1554
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:50,798
pH was a little lower um I do think a

1555
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:53,078
lot of it a lot more of it would be

1556
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:56,318
available I also think that in theory

1557
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:59,400
biology over time um soil micro should

1558
01:01:56,318 --> 01:02:01,278
be mineralizing that into availability

1559
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:04,358
so personally I wouldn't apply any more

1560
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:07,199
silica cuz it's there and I think it's

1561
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:09,679
important for commercial cultivators to

1562
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:11,318
think about and I think the best way I

1563
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:12,038
guess I'll add one more thing Chris in

1564
01:02:11,318 --> 01:02:15,159
your

1565
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:17,799
soil like my soil the numbers are kind

1566
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:20,480
of crazy I mean extremely high pH the

1567
01:02:17,798 --> 01:02:21,759
total exchange capacity is like false

1568
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,798
because what it's doing is it's just

1569
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,119
looking at all that Free lime in the

1570
01:02:23,798 --> 01:02:27,960
soil profile so you have this h huge

1571
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:30,798
amount of calcium in the soil tons in

1572
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:32,278
the water large amounts of sodium really

1573
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:35,038
low micronutrients everything is just

1574
01:02:32,278 --> 01:02:37,519
like wonky so the best thing you can do

1575
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,880
in my opinion is you're never going to

1576
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:41,759
get a balanced soil you're never going

1577
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,798
to like have the picture perfect soil

1578
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,440
report which is okay because that's not

1579
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:49,400
the goal the goal is healthy plants so

1580
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:51,880
the best thing you can do is tissue test

1581
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,880
a plant whatever your highest value

1582
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:55,960
plant is maybe you're like you're going

1583
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,920
to focus on tomatoes this year I would

1584
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:01,119
send a tissue test of the leaves of the

1585
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:03,798
tomato plant to the lab you can order

1586
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:05,119
these on my website and see what the

1587
01:03:03,798 --> 01:03:07,278
plant is actually

1588
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:10,200
uptaking and see if it's getting enough

1589
01:03:07,278 --> 01:03:13,119
calcium and enough magnesium and um

1590
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:15,278
nitrogen and so and just I would I would

1591
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:17,119
manage your nutrients more based on what

1592
01:03:15,278 --> 01:03:19,039
you're seeing on tissue tests rather

1593
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,680
than soil tests so I always think it's

1594
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,799
good to pre do pre-plant amendments

1595
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:24,318
based on a soil test but then it's often

1596
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:27,400
helpful to just ask the plant what it

1597
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:29,798
needs more of and sort of guide your

1598
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:33,599
your amendments your top dressing your

1599
01:03:29,798 --> 01:03:35,920
feeds based on on tissue testing um and

1600
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:37,880
that's you know soil tests and tissue

1601
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,798
tests are generally pretty well

1602
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:43,160
correlated in let me just say normal

1603
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:46,880
soils but in our soils that you and I

1604
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:49,199
are growing in it gets weird um like for

1605
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,960
example last year my plants didn't have

1606
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:52,960
enough calcium even though like your

1607
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,318
soil test has showed enormous amounts of

1608
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,000
calcium in the soil and that's just cuz

1609
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:58,358
we're dealing with these very strange

1610
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,480
desert soils so I I don't want to negate

1611
01:03:58,358 --> 01:04:03,838
the the the power of soil testing and I

1612
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:06,159
don't want to Discount the the

1613
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:09,358
usefulness of this test in particular

1614
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:12,159
but at the same time um when things get

1615
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:14,278
weird test the plant good advice I have

1616
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:16,440
one more question here now I know some

1617
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:18,000
people will actually add in when they're

1618
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:21,079
trying to revive their soil they add in

1619
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,838
like a Pete or cocoa some people add in

1620
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:24,160
like

1621
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:26,000
Iration uh and then other folks will

1622
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:27,838
actually also inoculate with micro Gres

1623
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,318
I notic we didn't talk about any of that

1624
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:32,159
here in this particular case so you

1625
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:34,558
would you advise against adding in Pete

1626
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:37,159
for example or some form of variation

1627
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:39,160
whether it be perite or or any of the

1628
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:40,440
other ariation points and then inocula

1629
01:04:39,159 --> 01:04:43,118
with microbes I know she didn't talk

1630
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,559
about that at all yeah great so um those

1631
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,880
are two other yeah so I mean the reason

1632
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:49,760
we haven't talked about it is because

1633
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:52,079
we're looking at uh a soil nutrients

1634
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,400
analysis and none of those things will

1635
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,960
change the nutrients or balance the

1636
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:59,240
nutrients um but that's not to say that

1637
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:02,119
they're not important or recommended I

1638
01:04:59,239 --> 01:05:05,439
would let me let's talk about Pete and

1639
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:07,720
Aggregates first those change the

1640
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,960
physical properties of the soil not that

1641
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:11,598
they're they're inert so chemically they

1642
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:13,358
they have very little influence on the

1643
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:16,960
soil chemistry especially when you're

1644
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:20,519
applying on to Top Soil um they're not

1645
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,639
providing nutrients and um Pete might

1646
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:26,159
have a light downward pressure on the pH

1647
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:28,118
but in your soil won't do anything um

1648
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,960
the purpose of them is to improve the

1649
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:33,200
the structure the ation capabilities of

1650
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,159
the soil and the drainage capacity and

1651
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:38,278
things like that so in certain instances

1652
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:41,480
in your case this may it may be one like

1653
01:05:38,278 --> 01:05:43,000
just getting a better physical tilth may

1654
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:46,639
be

1655
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,960
very nice and it may benefit the plants

1656
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:51,759
tremendously I mean Pete Moss uh it's

1657
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:54,278
kind of a a double-edged sword because

1658
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,240
on the one hand we don't Pete bogs are a

1659
01:05:54,278 --> 01:05:57,798
big impact so when we use use Pete Moss

1660
01:05:56,239 --> 01:05:59,558
we just need to be aware that like

1661
01:05:57,798 --> 01:06:02,000
that's a resource in someone else's

1662
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:05,160
backyard that we're Mining and it has an

1663
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,679
impact but it performs extremely well so

1664
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:10,239
I I love Pete Moss I think it's great um

1665
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,199
it's going to loosen the soil Pete Moss

1666
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:14,759
has this interesting characteristic

1667
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:17,000
where it both kind of loosens and arates

1668
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:19,278
the soil but it also holds water well so

1669
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,559
that's why Pete Moss works so well so

1670
01:06:19,278 --> 01:06:24,798
incorporating things like that in a in a

1671
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:27,240
top soil um really in a small

1672
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:28,880
environment can work once you get larger

1673
01:06:27,239 --> 01:06:30,719
than even a few hundred square feet it

1674
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,240
gets very expensive for the benefit you

1675
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:35,919
get I don't generally recommend adding

1676
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:38,199
aggregate to a top soil I would say

1677
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,039
carbon based Iration sources so cocoa

1678
01:06:38,199 --> 01:06:41,598
and Pete are much better the only time

1679
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:43,359
I'm ever thinking about Iration is in an

1680
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:46,599
engineered media like a Peete based

1681
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:48,119
potting soil um for indoor production or

1682
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:50,880
you know when you're growing in pots or

1683
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:53,079
raised beds I think that's fine when it

1684
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,838
comes to microbes so microbes what

1685
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:57,039
they're the role of microbes is to cycle

1686
01:06:54,838 --> 01:07:01,558
nutrients that are already in the soil

1687
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:04,359
so personally I have a philosophy that

1688
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:06,119
if you use carbon based

1689
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:09,558
inputs and

1690
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:11,519
you grow living roots and you irrigate

1691
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:14,839
really well you keeps consistent soil

1692
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:17,759
moisture and you feed you have a

1693
01:07:14,838 --> 01:07:20,880
consistent flow of carbon through your

1694
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:24,520
soil system in all different forms from

1695
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:28,720
molasses to wood chips and everything in

1696
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:32,159
between over time the microbial

1697
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:35,719
Community can get very healthy and so I

1698
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:39,078
inoculate at planting I every plant I

1699
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:41,480
put in the the ground I do a dry

1700
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:43,798
pelleted micro isal inoculant and a root

1701
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:46,240
dip in a full spectrum bacterial

1702
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:48,079
inoculant and that's and then I just

1703
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:50,399
like you know let the indigenous

1704
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:53,640
microorganism sort of run their course

1705
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,559
and I just try to feed cover crop I

1706
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:57,078
irrigate I do all the things I can to

1707
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:59,599
just feed the microbes and that's my

1708
01:07:57,079 --> 01:08:03,920
only inoculation but people do it

1709
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:06,318
different people Brew teas um people

1710
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:08,278
will create ferments which is really

1711
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:10,358
sort of you're getting the microbial

1712
01:08:08,278 --> 01:08:13,599
byproducts more than the microbes

1713
01:08:10,358 --> 01:08:15,480
themselves um so yeah I mean you can

1714
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:17,199
kind of be pushing microbes through the

1715
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:21,600
season and that's that's definitely

1716
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:22,879
going to help but long term I think the

1717
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,000
best thing you can do is just treat your

1718
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:27,239
soil well and and constantly be feeding

1719
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,439
carbon ources into your soil okay

1720
01:08:27,238 --> 01:08:31,639
awesome good advice I appreciate you

1721
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:34,399
taking the time today to go over the

1722
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:36,000
water test and soil test and can you

1723
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:37,158
tell the listeners how they can find you

1724
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,119
and is there anything upcoming in the

1725
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:41,039
future that you want to talk about yeah

1726
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:43,399
sure so people can find me first and

1727
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:45,000
foremost on my website which is soyd

1728
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:47,639
consulting.com

1729
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,238
um everything I offer is on there

1730
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:53,759
testing online courses things like that

1731
01:08:51,238 --> 01:08:57,039
uh I'm on and off of Instagram so

1732
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:59,000
Instagram handle is soil doctor where I

1733
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:01,399
put out short nerdy videos about soil

1734
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
and different farming practices and

1735
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:05,399
things um during the busy growing season

1736
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,880
I don't really produce much but in the

1737
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:12,039
winter I generally put out a lot of my

1738
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:13,640
learnings for the year on Instagram and

1739
01:09:12,039 --> 01:09:15,600
I would just recommend no matter the

1740
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,400
size uh if anyone's interested in

1741
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,520
getting a soil test it's like get your

1742
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:21,838
soil tested or get a single tissue test

1743
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,719
or a water test after this conversation

1744
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:26,079
you can order them all on my website and

1745
01:09:23,719 --> 01:09:28,880
I work with Growers of all sizes

1746
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:31,439
so um I'd recommend it I mean it's it's

1747
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,880
a pretty low investment to really

1748
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:36,439
understand the the most important thing

1749
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,838
about your your production in your

1750
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:41,719
garden so um I would just push people to

1751
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:43,960
my website to check out the offerings

1752
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:45,039
and and if they're interested reach out

1753
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,560
awesome all right well I'll definitely

into that previous episode we did

1758
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,039
together definitely tune into that I'll

1759
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,719
have that link down in the YouTube

1760
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:58,640
description section below as well or you

1761
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:01,679
can just search for it on YouTube just

1762
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:02,960
type in soil doctor and Mr Grow it and

1763
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,920
it should pop right up should be the

1764
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,239
first result or so Brian thanks so much

1765

once again for coming on here this has

1766
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:10,039
been very insightful I've learned so

1767
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:11,480
much from this and have a feeling a lot

1768
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:13,039
of my audience has learned from this as

1769
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:14,879
well so appreciate you taking the time

1770
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:17,880
today yeah Chris thanks for inviting me

on um I appreciate it and it's it's fun

1772
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,279
to look your soil and your water over in

1773
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:26,198
Nevada awesome all right peace out

1774
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:26,198
everyone catch you in the next episode
