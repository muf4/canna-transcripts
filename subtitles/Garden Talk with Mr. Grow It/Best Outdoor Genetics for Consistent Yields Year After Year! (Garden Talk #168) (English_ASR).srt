This should be an exciting one today.

55
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,399
Today we're going to talk about some of

56
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,560
the best outdoor genetics. Let's get

57
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,280
into some that can give big harvests,

58
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,439
consistent yields, and high quality. We

59
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,680
also may get into some tips for growing

60
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,959
them outdoors. But first, can you tell

61
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,680
us a little bit about yourself and how

62
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,839
you got into gardening? Yeah, I'm you

63
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,520
I'm from Italy. You know, I work uh in

64
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,920
the for the company for dash patient

65
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,680
from 10 years already and uh I started

66
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,000
growing uh when I was more or less 16.

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,840
So I started quite early uh because

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,800
there uh where where I born you know

69
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,479
like when I grown up uh was difficult to

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,520
find a good products around you know to

71
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,759
to consume. So uh I come from from a

72
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,400
small village uh close to the mountains

73
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:33,519
in in the north of Italy. Uh so what we

74
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,800
did is that we start collecting seeds.

75
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:41,039
The first seats that were sell sold by

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,719
by by resellers in uh in Italy uh from

77
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,400
Amsterdam were the seeds. So actually my

78
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,039
my first plants my first sister that I

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,760
bought uh were were dash patient you

80
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,318
know then uh years later I I I start

81
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,878
working with the with the company and uh

82
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,719
and we were growing guerillas. So we

83
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:00,159
were growing in the mountains up to the

84
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,680
mountains uh outdoor and and from that

85
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,158
on you know I start to be really

86
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,760
passionate on growing because uh you you

87
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,679
never forget your first harvest you know

88
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,239
and your first plant and then you get

89
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,400
really really enthusiastic to uh to the

90
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,759
crop to the plant you know and that's uh

91
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,280
that's that's where where where

92
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,959
everything started for me. That's

93
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,439
awesome. Yeah. It's so exciting.

94
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,598
Exactly. And when you see the size the

95
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,598
size just the way it grows when the

96
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,359
flowers get on there it's just it's

97
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,039
incredible. Even to this day, I still

98
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,760
get excited growing out different

99
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,158
genetics cuz there's there's a variety

100
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,399
in these genetics and some grow better

101
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,679
in some areas than other areas, which

102
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,680
we're going to get into here in a

103
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,159
minute. So, overall your growth style,

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,560
are you 100% outdoors or do you do some

105
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,878
indoor growing as well? No, I started as

106
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,598
an outdoor grower, you know, like uh for

107
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,039
necessity, let's say. And and I keep for

108
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,639
me it's quite romantic, you know, like

109
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,400
to grow outdoor, you know, to see the

110
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,000
plants with the wind, you know, outside,

111
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,120
you know, kissed by the sun, you know,

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,199
like and and also growing like with a

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,080
huge sites, you know, like you can

114
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,399
really reach a big yielding outside uh

115
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,799
growing outdoor uh and it's also really

116
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,640
clean products. But uh uh then I started

117
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,920
you know to to to to do my my

118
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,679
experiments indoor uh and and and then I

119
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,679
I I became also really passionate about

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,639
indoor growing because you can really

121
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,798
control well uh the condition indoor.

122
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,040
You can really you can keep mothers you

123
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,519
can keep the genetics you know you can

124
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,960
uh you can you can start breeding you

125
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,240
know like you can start playing with the

126
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,719
genetics. So, uh I I I I I still grow

127
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,478
both uh you know like uh and more than

128
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,960
outdoor uh I became like more a

129
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:41,839
greenhouse uh glass house uh grower. Um

130
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,879
but uh yeah I'm I'm I'm both you know

131
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:47,119
like uh still uh still mainly growing

132
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,279
indoor uh lately you know like uh for

133
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,439
necessity and also because I moved to

134
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,638
Netherland to to Amsterdam where the

135
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,360
company is based uh and also here uh

136
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,759
there is not such a big space to grow

137
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,560
outside and uh and also the climate the

138
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,960
weather we can see later uh why also the

139
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,600
varieties are really really strong the

140
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:10,239
outdoor varieties breed in in in in in

141
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,720
uh in in Netherland uh the climate the

142
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,199
weather is not so easy uh to grow

143
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,600
outside in here around I can only

144
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,319
imagine how crazy it can be growing

145
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,960
outdoors in that environment are you

146
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,599
soil or cocoa and do you grow with

147
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:29,758
organic inputs or synthetic inputs yeah

148
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,120
that's um I mostly do cocoa like uh my

149
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:36,639
favorite mix is between 50% light mix

150
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,160
soil and 50% cocoa that's I really like

151
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,960
because I find benefit from both. So I

152
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,240
can find really nice development of the

153
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,799
roots uh fast development oxygen from

154
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,519
from the from the cocoa but still the

155
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,639
performing wise of the uh of the soil.

156
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,719
Then uh I became really a cocoa lover

157
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,120
you know like if I can say you know like

158
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,720
in indoor uh because also I can control

159
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:06,000
well my irrigation and watering. Uh but

160
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,160
um yeah, 50% mix. It's my it's my

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,038
favorite uh way to to grow. I see my

162
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,720
plants really healthy and um and I'm

163
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:16,240
more organic growers, you know. I start

164
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,319
with with more synthetics because I had

165
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,038
the feeling that was easier. But

166
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,319
actually then when you start testing and

167
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,519
trying you know you see also that

168
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,720
organic growing it's it's quite easy and

169
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:31,279
the beneficial from my point of view uh

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,919
from my harvest the quality that I got

171
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,719
from from organics uh it's really like a

172
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,478
uh top top notch you know like uh tarpin

173
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,880
wise especially I know a handful of

174
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,719
growers that do just about exactly what

175
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,719
you do where they mix up that soil like

176
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,400
that and getting more oxygen down in the

177
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,800
root zone being a little bit more area

178
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,198
of a medium they can get some really big

179
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,879
yields from it. Now, there's one

180
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,600
question I wanted to ask you up front

181
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,199
here. I want to get your input on. You

182
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,639
working for Dutch Passion, you I know

183
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,400
you have a lot of knowledge in regards

184
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,960
to what people are actually striving

185
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,038
for. It seems like more growers care

186
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,198
less about yield these days and are

187
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,959
really focusing more on quality. What's

188
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,240
your take on that? Yeah, that's that's

189
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,159
really true. depends uh you know like uh

190
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,240
also on the goal that the grower have

191
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,960
you know like uh there are many

192
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,759
commercial grower that sometimes care

193
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,638
more uh on the on the on the quantity

194
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,960
over the quality over the quality but

195
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,759
main you know like step by step the the

196
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:32,000
culture and the knowledge about if we

197
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,280
see the last 15 years you know grown up

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,519
a lot and really fast you know so uh uh

199
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,159
uh uh the the you know the the smoke the

200
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,478
users you know like medical users is not

201
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,800
uh uh is looking for quality you know

202
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,120
like if you do something do it well you

203
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,680
know like consume good products you know

204
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,120
like safe products clean products you

205
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,918
know like uh also because we we all came

206
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,478
from a black market you know so uh

207
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,318
people living in US or many many

208
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,560
countries or Canada where where now it's

209
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,280
in many countries is legalized you know

210
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,918
we come from black market and and and

211
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,478
you know we smoked and we consumed some

212
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,560
really bad bad quality with so people is

213
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,639
going more for the quality than for the

214
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,720
quantity. Then depends also in which

215
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,519
countries because uh in the countries

216
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,560
where is still illegal. So the

217
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,560
commercial grower take a risk to you

218
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,199
know to grow big quantities and then and

219
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,038
then sell uh uh normally they go more

220
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,199
for the for the quantity over the

221
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,838
quality. But the home grower the bical

222
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,000
home growers it's looking for mainly for

223
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,399
the quality than than for the quantity.

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Lately we have knowledges and

225
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,320
technologies that can bring us uh to

226
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,559
produce quite high quantity with with

227
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,839
high quality you know so there is like a

228
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:52,559
good a good mix on on that. So uh but

229
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,839
definitely you know people are really uh

230
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:58,239
getting high culture on that and uh it's

231
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,240
looking for the top top quality top

232
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,360
quality and clean product. That's really

233
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,200
also like in organic way uh uh they they

234
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,680
look for for for really clean uh clean

235
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,720
products and that's really good. I'm the

236
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:13,599
same way where I really strive more for

237
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,040
quality versus yield. And back in the

238
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,480
day when I first started growing I was

239
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,399
striving for yield. one of the biggest

240
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,879
plants I can get and get the most yield

241
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,799
that I possibly can, right? But me being

242
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,600
a small home grower only growing for

243
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,199
myself and I can gift here legally, I

244
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,440
can gift to friends and family and stuff

245
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,160
like that. I don't need to grow pounds

246
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,720
and pounds and pounds per cycle. I can

247
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,360
get away with growing really less than a

248
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,879
pound per cycle and that's still enough

249
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,879
for me to consume between when I finish

250
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,120
growing and when I complete my next

251
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,399
grow. So yeah, I totally understand what

252
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,759
you mean how you saying that mostly home

253
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,039
growers are going for that quality side

254
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:54,480
of things because it's kind of easy to

255
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,399
get the yield in order to last to you.

256
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,000
Exactly. And that depends also on the

257
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,879
genetics you know like there are

258
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,120
genetics that are are are really well

259
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,679
known to be like low yielding but you

260
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,480
know high quality but also some genetics

261
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,399
can give you bigger yielding but still

262
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,560
good quality you know like top quality.

263
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,120
So it depends also on the selection on

264
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,199
how you grow it where you grow it. So

265
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,278
condition is almost really it's it's

266
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,839
really it's really really important on

267
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:25,200
that. But uh yeah quality quality over

268
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,880
quantity that's been the the the the

269
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,399
tantra in the last in the last years for

270
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:32,159
sure. Agreed. Now you working for Dutch

271
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,759
Passion one of the things you had

272
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,159
mentioned kind of behind the scenes as

273
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,720
we were exchanging emails is that their

274
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,240
genetics are bred in Holland. Can you

275
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,079
talk to us about kind of what the

276
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,959
climate is there? You know, what those

277
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,759
genetics really get put through? Yeah.

278
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:51,119
Yeah. We are um you know, Dash was just

279
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,958
to briefly introduce the company for who

280
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,759
uh don't know them. It's it's one of the

281
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,599
pioneer seed bank uh in one of the

282
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,720
oldest seed bankank in the world still

283
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,839
active on on producing seeds. Uh was

284
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,600
founded by Hank Vanalen, a biologist

285
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,640
from from Amsterdam in the 1987.

286
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,399
Uh so he started actually he start his

287
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,639
breathing project started before the

288
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,039
foundation of the of the company. So he

289
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,799
started to travel around in the in the

290
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:24,958
late '7s uh in places like Afghanistan

291
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:27,199
uh Colombia, Thailand collecting uh uh

292
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,518
original land race seeds from the land

293
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,519
race of of that countries and then

294
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,440
coming back to to Netherland and

295
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,278
starting you know his breeding project

296
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,800
you know the first experiment you know

297
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,480
because uh there were

298
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,958
already sold by the coffee shops in the

299
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,519
city centers and in the cities of of

300
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,679
Netherland but not so much produced in

301
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,000
Netherland. Main of the product that was

302
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,000
sold in the coffee shops around was

303
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,240
imported by Thailand. They were the

304
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,759
sticky tie. They were we call it like

305
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,240
that because because you know that the

306
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:01,278
the sides of the of the body were closed

307
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,320
in a in a iron in iron uh to transport

308
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:06,799
them in the boat like charas from India

309
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,839
uh you know like uh some some extraction

310
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:13,519
and also flowers from uh from

311
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,519
Afghanistan. So was in South Africa. Uh

312
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,278
uh so he started also with with a with

313
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,639
with with some friends with a group of

314
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,240
friends that are people some of them are

315
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,480
really well known in the in in the

316
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,240
international industry uh because they

317
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,639
they started their own project or

318
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,200
breeding or fertilizers. Anyway, they're

319
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,639
still uh many of them active in in the

320
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,120
industry. So he start to produce uh uh

321
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,600
uh uh uh flowers for the coffee shops.

322
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,480
He he founded a coffee shop that was

323
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,480
called Homegrown Fantasy. homegrown

324
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,120
because was one of the first coffee shop

325
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,959
in the city center selling only Dutch

326
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,200
flowers. So not imported uh uh flowers

327
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,679
and then you know like with with the

328
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,240
knowledge of the uh with the biologist

329
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,439
uh school you know like he started to to

330
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,919
do some testing and breeding and and he

331
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,399
he became like well known in the in the

332
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:09,120
first network of of Amsterdam. So the

333
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,278
other coffee shop started to ask to Hank

334
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,480
uh like if they can get some seeds

335
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,879
because there were many people in the

336
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,519
coffee shop asking for for the seeds. So

337
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,399
then he realized that could be exist in

338
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,399
a market about seeds you know like so

339
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,559
it's time to to produce seeds to

340
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,600
reproduce and to select the first the

341
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:30,000
first v and then I connect to uh to to

342
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,879
the main topic that is the the Dutch the

343
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,919
Dutch varieties. So that vis arrives

344
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:39,759
from old school land races crossed and

345
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:41,879
selected outdoor in Netherland. That

346
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:46,240
what it mean that generation after

347
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:50,000
generation that plants become stronger

348
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,759
to the uh to survive and flower in the

349
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Dutch weather. The Dutch weather for who

350
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:57,360
don't know it's it's like a really cold

351
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,519
weather. It's a short summertime with a

352
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,079
lot of hours of of of lights during the

353
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,759
day. But in September, so normally when

354
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,159
you you in Europe, you know, in this

355
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,240
atmosphere, you you you harvest in the

356
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,480
late September, beginning of October,

357
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,519
you already have really low temperature,

358
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,240
so cold climate with wet uh wet climate.

359
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,759
So it's really hard to grow outdoor you

360
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,519
know up there you know and it's

361
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,120
Netherland it's all the Nordic country

362
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,879
of of you know also north of

363
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,320
Germany Danish you know like Sweden so

364
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,078
it's all these kind of Nordic countries

365
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,879
uh

366
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:37,679
so they special create a full family

367
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:42,000
call it the out the Dutch outdoor family

368
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:44,559
that are varieties are really vigorous

369
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,639
and strong for the for the extreme

370
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,039
outdoor

371
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:51,680
weathers as the Dutch the Dutch weather.

372
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,078
So they are more resistant to the mold

373
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,399
for the high temperature for the high

374
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,078
high humidity. Uh they can stand more

375
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,639
for the and they can flower really well

376
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,719
in the also in a cold climate. Of

377
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,759
course, there is some it's not it's not

378
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,160
going to go to to grow strong and well

379
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,360
below zero degrees for example, but they

380
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:14,958
can really stand on low low temperature

381
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,480
compared to the south of Europe or uh

382
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:22,399
other like tropical or subtropical uh uh

383
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,680
climates. uh inside of this family there

384
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:29,120
are some of of the legendary varieties

385
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:31,759
of dutial like as a durban poison one is

386
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,240
worldwide well known as a nice sativa

387
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,879
from South Africa from the Durban city

388
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,720
uh freezing dew that was at the time was

389
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,278
called in the 80s this v was called

390
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,519
purple star and that was back crossing

391
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,000
with a with a skunk number one so it's a

392
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,159
it's a purple star with um with with a

393
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,440
skunk number one so really old school

394
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,519
and strong uh plant like also with

395
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,720
strange color with nice color like

396
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,720
purple color in that pink purple then

397
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,959
the passion number one that have a cool

398
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,720
story because it's a really fast v

399
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:07,119
variety you can harvest it in six seven

400
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,320
weeks of flower time for outdoor it's

401
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,639
really suitable and at time was called

402
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,399
in our collection was called this variet

403
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:19,120
gold uh but then Amstel it's also like a

404
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,958
a brand of a beer the brand of the beer,

405
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,159
you know, like call it Hank say, "Hey,

406
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:26,239
you cannot call a variety like like our

407
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,958
beer." So he had to call the name,

408
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,198
change the name and he called it Passion

409
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:34,559
One because was the first variety

410
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,719
developed by Hank in the in the 80s and

411
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,719
still is still available in our in our

412
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,000
catalog. And then we have a Holland

413
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,800
soap. Uh, and a really cool variety that

414
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,919
I always mention is a freezing duck was

415
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,319
the first project of an outdoor variety.

416
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,159
Uh, but

417
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,639
camouflage. So, it's a variety that

418
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,879
until the the the middle of flower time

419
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,240
you don't see and you you don't

420
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:02,720
recognize the plant as as

421
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,359
as have this duck foot. So, the leaf

422
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,558
looks like a duck only only three point

423
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,240
and it's like a duck foot. uh uh leaf,

424
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,000
you know, like the the sides of the

425
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,480
leaf. And it's really cool. It's it's a

426
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,038
cross between freezing dew and a duck

427
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,279
foot duck foot var like a mutant was the

428
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:21,679
first project of mutant. So that

429
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:25,038
varieties can really stand well in the

430
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,038
outdoor growing uh in in good condition

431
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,200
you know like with nice weather and nice

432
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,640
climate condition can grow really

433
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,600
vigorous really strong with high

434
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,280
yielding but can really stand well and

435
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,519
and perform also in a kind of extreme

436
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,119
extreme weather extreme condition. Yeah,

437
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,440
those conditions that you mentioned

438
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,678
there seem like it's very taking the

439
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,679
place through a rigorous time there and

440
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,960
uh I'm sure they're going to be very

441
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,798
vigorous growth comes from being bred in

442
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,160
those type of conditions. Now I got to

443
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:58,639
imagine since it's being cold, wet, real

444
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,000
high humidity, you mentioned there's got

445
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,640
to be resistance to pathogens like mold,

446
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,160
britis, powdery mildew. That's got to be

447
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,240
what? like your number one thing that

448
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,558
you guys look at when it comes to

449
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,359
selecting genetics. Is that correct?

450
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,798
Exactly. also because outdoor growing

451
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,119
you know like we always say you know

452
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,960
like it's not a science you know like

453
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,959
it's there is many ways you know like we

454
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,600
always say like there's thousand rods to

455
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,480
go to Rome you know like uh there is

456
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:29,279
many many ways to to grow outdoor to

457
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,079
grow indoor like uh of course but there

458
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,960
are some some common fact you know some

459
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,119
some common conditions that make you uh

460
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,440
uh make you you know to give you the

461
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,839
possibility to harvest a nice quality

462
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,320
weed and and to harvest high quantity

463
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:47,119
also from from outdoor from outdoor

464
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,759
plant. And one of these is choose

465
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:52,558
properly the genetics. Not every genetic

466
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,839
is suitable for the for every climate

467
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,279
you know especially in the outdoor

468
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,678
because outdoor is not only growing you

469
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,000
are kind of depending a lot on the

470
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,080
weather and in your climate on the

471
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,519
condition that you are growing. So this

472
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,759
is affect a lot because in in the indoor

473
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,558
you can control your climate you can

474
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,960
control the the weeks of of vegetative

475
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:18,319
stage or or flower stage. you can

476
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,000
control almost everything in the outdoor

477
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,159
you can control till a point you're

478
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,038
depending a lot you know on on the

479
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,720
external conditions and that's uh uh

480
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,319
that's the challenge that's the

481
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,400
challenge outdoor growing is a whole

482
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:33,038
different battlefield compared to indoor

483
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,360
growing that is for sure I mean you

484
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:38,400
pests is another thing where it's like

485
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,918
you have completely different pest

486
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,600
prevention methods that you can take

487
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,000
indoors versus outdoors you kind of be a

488
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,240
little bit more hands-off indoors

489
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,079
versus outdoors. Yeah, it's a good

490
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,079
point, this one. It's a good point. Now,

491
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:53,599
you mentioned Holland's Hope, buddy of

492
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:55,839
mine, Pigeons 420. He raves about that

493
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,599
strain. He absolutely loves it. Nothing

494
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,720
but positive things to say about it. So,

495
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,558
eventually I think I'm going to get that

496
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,400
in my garden. Now, if people are growing

497
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,879
in the same climate or they have a

498
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,200
similar conditions to that and they are

499
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,200
striving after yield, for example, what

500
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,440
are some particular strains that you

501
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,279
recommend that they grow out in the

502
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,400
tropical environment? suitable the

503
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,678
mostly sativas we're talking about like

504
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,600
Mexico or the jungle in Colombia or

505
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,400
Thailand you know like close to the

506
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:28,079
Mechong Meong River for example you know

507
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,960
like all these all these uh uh varieties

508
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:33,759
uh are mostly sativas with long period

509
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,319
of flower time and not so compact PS you

510
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,400
know that's that's why it's because you

511
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,879
know there is normally high humidity so

512
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,519
it's really wet the air uh and and and

513
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,880
and you know like the mold get inside

514
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:50,158
easier if your your your your body of

515
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,000
flour is super super compact compact. Uh

516
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,960
then you have the the mostly let's say

517
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,919
indiga. So we bred some varieties like

518
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,840
mazar and master kush for example or

519
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:04,799
night queen uh that are all coming from

520
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:08,000
of agony. So we are talking about a

521
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:10,720
really high temperature so really warm

522
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,159
uh climate and normally especially

523
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,720
during the day dry climate. So these var

524
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,799
varieties are suitable for like more

525
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:24,319
warmer climate you know like but but

526
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:26,798
with low uh constantly low uh humidity.

527
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:30,720
That's also something that uh can help

528
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:33,279
to the grower you know to choose the

529
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,759
right the right the right variety. Uh

530
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,960
then we have really an interesting

531
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,798
family that it's called the high

532
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,440
altitude varieties that are actually in

533
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:46,519
our catalog are two it's pomeier gold

534
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,798
and snow bad. Both of them

535
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:54,480
are breed and and and and producing uh

536
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:57,119
up to 1,500 mters. So it's for the

537
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,599
mountains for the high altitude. We we

538
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,239
you know we selected that in the Alps of

539
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:05,519
Switzerland because Netherland doesn't

540
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,640
have um high mountains. Uh so we we did

541
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:11,599
a a project of breeding uh years ago in

542
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,038
in the Alps of Switzerland and uh we

543
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,959
produced these two var we stabilized

544
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,879
these two varieties really really strong

545
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,240
for the for the high altitude the

546
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,000
growing. So that's to say that I if you

547
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,919
are if if you grow in the mountain

548
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,440
really up to the mountain if if you

549
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,440
don't have certain condition like in

550
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,600
Himalaya or in Nepal you know that you

551
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,720
have some condition where the sativas

552
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:34,798
the Indian sativas can can grow really

553
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,640
well if you put a strong indica in the

554
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,279
mountain you you you can harvest that

555
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,799
but it's it's it's the hardest you know

556
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,599
like to to you to get a really nice

557
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,679
resin. So the palm gold is not but we're

558
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,798
bred for that. So that that's to to say

559
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:52,240
that it's not that you cannot give a

560
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:55,279
chance to this variety in in not in

561
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,720
their in in in in their comfort zone,

562
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,639
but it's always better to choose

563
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,240
something that it's select for for that,

564
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,440
especially for outdoor. And that's

565
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,240
something I don't think we talk about

566
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,400
enough is, hey, when you're selecting

567
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,480
genetics, select genetics that are good

568
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,240
for your climate that you live in. You

569
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,759
mentioned as an indoor grower, sure you

570
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,759
can control those conditions a little

571
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,000
bit more, but it's going to be super

572
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,919
beneficial to really do the research and

573
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
figure out what the background is of

574
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,080
those genetics and whether or not it's

575
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,558
applicable to where you're currently

576
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,480
living. Now, I personally live in Las

577
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:30,480
Vegas, I mentioned before we started

578
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,279
recording, and it's very hot, very dry,

579
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,720
and so you have genetics. Dutch passion

580
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,720
has some genetics that are good for this

581
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,079
particular climate, right? Can you name

582
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,279
off some genetics that are good for

583
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:44,319
those really warm dry climates? Yeah,

584
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,399
absolutely. Like uh banana blaze is one

585
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:50,399
of these. It's a banana kush cross with

586
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:53,120
mazar. The mazar it's our queen of the

587
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,559
indicas bar varieties. really strong

588
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:58,319
plant uh that the name it's also come

589
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,279
from a village in Afghanistan called

590
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:04,240
Mazari Sharif you know and that plant

591
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,519
was a land race there in that area that

592
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,519
now it's really hard to get there

593
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,599
because there is a riots there there's

594
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,798
like a fights between different tribus

595
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,399
you know like uh the different

596
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:16,558
oppositions uh so Hank was there in the

597
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,038
in the 80s collecting that seats and

598
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,839
this is a variety that really can stand

599
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:24,798
uh like like really in a in a desertic

600
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:27,199
almost dessert 30 let's say area. So

601
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,839
it's really nice uh it's a good plant

602
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,159
with with a toe leaf you know so really

603
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,798
really fat leaves you know that uh you

604
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,440
know so it can transform easily the

605
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,278
light in the CO2 so uh doing the

606
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,278
photosynthesis so it's it's a plant that

607
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,359
can stand really well on the on the high

608
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:46,079
temperature then of course as before

609
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,158
there is some there are some extreme

610
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,399
condition that the plants cannot stand

611
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,200
on that you know like if there is 60°

612
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,880
and the plants don't see water for for

613
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,319
for two weeks

614
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,799
plants is going to die for sure, you

615
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,200
know, like but on the category on the

616
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,599
families of this genetics that we offer

617
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,200
that once also the night queen it's

618
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,959
really nice and the master cush it's

619
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,200
it's another really nice plant that can

620
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,600
stand on this kind of uh of condition

621
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,400
course I want to say something that it's

622
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:18,480
also like uh it's it's a point that we I

623
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,720
think we have to touch because it's it's

624
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,720
the first phase of the plant you know so

625
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,720
it's the the germination and vegetative

626
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,880
stage is a a phase where the plant

627
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,720
uh uh can can suffer more because it's

628
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,799
quite weak at the beginning you know

629
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,558
when when when the roots system it's

630
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,278
already developed you know like and you

631
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,440
put it in the soil on the ground outside

632
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,720
you know then then the plants can can be

633
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,440
strong and can survive also to some uh

634
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,038
disease or or or bad bad condition in

635
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,919
the climate. But when the plant is

636
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,158
small, normally we always recommend to

637
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,278
start growing, germinate and growing,

638
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,320
you know, like indoor or in a in a in a

639
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:01,359
in a small greenhouse, you know, like

640
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:03,599
just to get more control in the first

641
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,879
phase of the plant of the vegetative

642
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,119
stage. Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned

643
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,960
that. I know a lot of folks, they start

644
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:10,158
growing indoors, they'll veg for a

645
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,079
certain period of time and then they'll

646
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,320
transition outdoors for the exact reason

647
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:16,558
that you mentioned. Now, how long

648
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:19,200
indoors do you recommend that people veg

649
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:22,399
for before transitioning those plants to

650
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,600
outdoors? Well, that's depends a little

651
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,320
bit of where and you're going to grow it

652
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,918
and and which residue you want to to

653
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:33,200
get, you know, like which sides of

654
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,880
plants you want to get. But normally one

655
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,759
month at least, you know, what we

656
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,679
recommend for a a boost the vegetative

657
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,879
stage and we saw co, you know, like

658
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,919
really consistent uh better results and

659
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,720
vigorous plants. It's uh uh uh to

660
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,120
transplant that. So you germinate you

661
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,319
know like in a small pot then after 3

662
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:58,719
weeks maximum you transplant the plant

663
00:26:54,319 --> 00:27:00,639
in in a 3 lit 4 lit pot and then you

664
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,038
wait a little bit that the that the root

665
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,759
system start to develop a a bit more and

666
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:08,400
then you can start putting outside the

667
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,720
plants. That's something that really can

668
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,880
help you to have a a stronger plant when

669
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,440
you when when you put them outdoor. That

670
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,120
makes sense. Yeah. I feel like the

671
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,038
longer the plant has been growing, the

672
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,798
more chances it has of survival. Right?

673
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,640
If you're taking a plant and you're you

674
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,480
you have it growing, it sprouts and you

675
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,240
got seven days, it's a little seedling

676
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,360
and you transfer it to outside, it's

677
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,278
going to be a lot less chance that

678
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,359
that's going to survive, especially in

679
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,679
extreme conditions. Exactly. You depend

680
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:36,240
on the wind, you depend on the weather,

681
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,080
you know, they are like really really

682
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,240
weak at the beginning, you know, like

683
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:43,038
especially. So also we're not talking

684
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,038
just of course an LED indoor would be

685
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:48,079
the top notchotch you know like uh

686
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:50,240
starting point uh but also like a small

687
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:53,199
greenhouse with some control with some

688
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,599
extra light like simple light like quite

689
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,120
quite cold light like 6,000 Kelvin you

690
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:01,759
know like nothing special you know like

691
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:04,000
a without so many vats you know like you

692
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:06,398
don't need a super technology LED but

693
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,159
just to get the plants used and to be

694
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,398
covered you know to be safe you know to

695
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,080
start to start the process of of of

696
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:13,439
growing. That's a really good point. I'm

697
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,319
glad you brought that up. Now,

698
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,480
transitioning from the indoors to the

699
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,798
outdoors, some folks will do a hardening

700
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,399
off process, right? They either take

701
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,000
their plant indoors, bring it outdoors

702
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:25,278
for a certain period of time, then bring

703
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,759
it back indoors. So, they'll be going

704
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:29,440
back and forth, or some folks will take

705
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,359
it indoors, put it outdoors, but they'll

706
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,840
put it in the shade for a certain period

707
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,759
of time versus full sun. What's your

708
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,678
process for hardening off plants from

709
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,720
going from indoors to outdoors?

710
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,480
essentially our best res that we saw and

711
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,440
it's always I'm going to back that

712
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,519
depends on on on the conditions and the

713
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:51,360
climates but a temporary you know

714
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:53,519
like putting from indoor to outdoor and

715
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,519
then outdoor to indoor it's better

716
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,519
because then the plants get used

717
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,918
normally we recommend to put outside in

718
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,679
the middle of the morning till more or

719
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,559
less the middle of the afternoon and

720
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,399
then put it back in indoor you know to

721
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:09,038
take especially because we are normally

722
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:11,278
we are talking this phase it's in the

723
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,278
beginning of the springtime and at the

724
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,519
beginning of the springtime the sun is

725
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:18,640
not too strong you know there is like

726
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,558
some some condition that let you let you

727
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,640
put the plants outside to get used it a

728
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,558
little bit and then and then put inside

729
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,120
you know so it's not too too too strong

730
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:29,440
the sun to hide the temperature so it's

731
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,959
it's a medium climate you know like uh

732
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,519
and that's help a lot the plant to get

733
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,840
used then you can do that for 10 days

734
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,000
then the plants start to to get used and

735
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,759
you see that you Got it. That makes

736
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,440
sense. I think one of the big concerns

737
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:42,798
for folks that are growing outdoors, and

738
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,720
we kind of talked about it a little bit

739
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,879
earlier, at least mentioned it, was

740
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,038
pests. When you're taking these plants

741
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,039
from indoors to outdoors, one of the

742
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:54,240
things you're exposing to is potentially

743
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,440
a lot more pests invading that that area

744
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,000
that you're growing in and that

745
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,919
attacking that plant. What tips do you

746
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,759
have for preventing pests or any major

747
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,679
infestations if it happens? How do you

748
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,879
go about battling these pests? Well,

749
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,360
this is a good question because in

750
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,278
indoor you can as we spoke before, you

751
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,199
know, like can control better, you know,

752
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,359
like with your filters from outside, you

753
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,919
know, like you can you you have always

754
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:20,959
to be really clean where you work in

755
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,520
your station, you know, because mites

756
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,759
are are are there at the door, you know.

757
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,319
So and also if you for example if you

758
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:30,319
work with clones and you buy clones or

759
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,158
you take loans for friends to be sure to

760
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:34,439
to sterilize them you know like because

761
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,640
otherwise you can bring it inside

762
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,640
outside mostly you know we always say

763
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,679
it's better safe than sorry so it's

764
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,520
better to work in advance you know like

765
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,519
and uh first of all it's the companion

766
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,599
planting you know so what is it mean so

767
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,759
you know plant you know like put some

768
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,918
different kind of plants close to your

769
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,079
plants that attract

770
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,200
pests, you know, like a spider mites or

771
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:01,199
the whitefly uh or the the trips, you

772
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,558
know. So, first thing that that this

773
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,200
this this insect do its coin on that

774
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,960
plants before your attack your your

775
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,840
medical plants, you know. So, that's

776
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,240
that's a first nice prevent uh to

777
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,079
mention some of them like coriander.

778
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,038
That's really good that something that

779
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:24,000
also in in US you can find easily it's

780
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:25,519
like the uh uh the merry gold plant. I

781
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,038
don't know if you know that but it's

782
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,519
merry gold. It's really nice for the

783
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:33,200
white fly because attract the white fly.

784
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,879
Uh then the salvia uh uh the lemongrass

785
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,960
also it's really good to attract you

786
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,960
know like and that's already in this way

787
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:44,079
you you create like a kind of protection

788
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,480
you know around your plant. Okay. Then

789
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:48,960
uh something that we also use quite a

790
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,919
lot and it's uh uh it's it's considered

791
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,600
biologic in in the biological growing is

792
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,360
the neem oil. Then em oil sprayed in the

793
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:00,639
in the in the in the vegetative stage

794
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,959
create a little bit kind of a layer you

795
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,200
know on on the leaf to protect them you

796
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,519
know like it's it's really nice not too

797
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,759
much like we recommend once every two

798
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,200
weeks as maximum never in the flower

799
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:16,319
time but this is can can can help also

800
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,319
to to prevent uh and then you know

801
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:20,798
always talking about organic growing so

802
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:23,678
biological growing it's the predators

803
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:27,839
that uh this you you have to use the

804
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,919
predator in case. It's like not the late

805
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,599
the late move, but you you you don't

806
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,679
need the predators if you don't have the

807
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:36,240
problem because the predators survive

808
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,360
eating uh the spider mites or you know

809
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,759
like the the fly. So if if you start

810
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:45,519
seeing you know like a development on

811
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:47,919
this disease uh of this you know like a

812
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,079
problem. So you can you can use the the

813
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,360
predator. So it's like a biological

814
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:56,798
fight. Normally, it's like ladybugs. Uh

815
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:58,918
that you can find it in in packs of 500

816
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,679
uh 1,000, you know, and you start to

817
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,720
spread this this this bugs, you know,

818
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,919
like around and they start to to, you

819
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,640
know, as a predator to eat the, you

820
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,759
know, like the the the spiders or the

821
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,640
fly or or the trips in general. So, this

822
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:18,798
is the the this is the organic way,

823
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,840
let's say, the the biological way to to

824
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:23,440
to prevent that. and and or or or to

825
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:27,240
fight with that otherwise you know there

826
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,600
is always chemical solutions to to that

827
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,319
but we never recommend that you know

828
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:35,359
like it's for normally these products is

829
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:38,158
for user consumption so we always try to

830
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,398
push the people to to be as natural as

831
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,640
possible you know oh absolutely I'm the

832
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,319
same way now training plants I want to

833
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,880
get into that next this is something

834
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,960
that can be drastically differently if

835
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,640
you're growing indoors versus outdoors

836
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,880
narrowing it down to outdoors in

837
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,200
particular. What type of plant training

838
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,399
do you do? Depends on the resident who

839
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,159
you want to get because there are many

840
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:01,678
different types of out growers. You

841
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,720
know, there are out growers that they

842
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,798
don't have any problems on the sides of

843
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,838
the plants that they're going to grow or

844
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:12,320
others because many of our customers,

845
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:15,199
the growers that grow our seeds in the

846
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,159
cities inside the city centers, they use

847
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:22,078
balconies or they use teras to grow

848
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,480
outdoor. So, you know, for for for for a

849
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:29,679
a grower that it's in the countryside or

850
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,760
can grow big plants topping and feming,

851
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,039
it's always recommended, you know,

852
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,839
because you can boost drastically your

853
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,918
your your your your healthy, you know,

854
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:41,759
like your your harvest quantity of

855
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,319
flowers, you know, because topic and

856
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,440
female are really two nice techniques to

857
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,960
to get more to to to boost and power at

858
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,240
the the the beside

859
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,599
the beside the branches and then uh uh

860
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:57,598
have way more top colas than then don't

861
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,838
do that. So we really really recommend

862
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,320
that uh to do that uh especially the

863
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:05,199
feming with a really nice feming you can

864
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,599
get really many many many top callers

865
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:10,559
you know. So that's that's that's really

866
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:13,838
uh useful uh uh for who is growing like

867
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:16,000
in a in a in a in a in a in a balcony in

868
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,559
places where you don't want to attract

869
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,199
attention from outside that and show

870
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,199
that he's growing cannabis in the

871
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:24,559
balconies low stress training LST is

872
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:28,319
really good because you can train your

873
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:31,440
plant and keep it short keep it low so

874
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:35,200
under the radar let's say of of the

875
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:38,320
people uh uh it's also a a really good a

876
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:41,118
really good um uh training, you know,

877
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,440
training uh uh technique to to grow to

878
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,920
grow a door. The scrog also, you know,

879
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,400
in the balcony and and the LSD. That's

880
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,400
uh that's not that's not bad. Yeah, I

881
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,760
know some outdoor growers the only

882
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,039
training they'll do is they'll do I

883
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,839
think it's a 45 degree bend of that main

884
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,519
stem and then the rest is just those

885
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,960
side branches come up and it just grows

886
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,639
out to this one big ball of of a tree.

887
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,000
So that seems to be a common thing that

888
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,598
people do. Yeah. And the and the and the

889
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,239
first part of the plant you really see

890
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,838
the when when you turn when you turn at

891
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,759
40° you know the plant you really see

892
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:16,400
like a node you know like it's say wow

893
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,560
you know this plant it's really powerful

894
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,960
and on that I want to say that our

895
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,559
outdoor varieties are really you know

896
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,320
enjoyable on that you know because you

897
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,159
can

898
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:29,280
really try and test you know different

899
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:31,519
kind of of of techniques because you see

900
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,839
that if they have good good climates you

901
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,440
know you see them that are unstoppable

902
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,920
you know you can you know you can grab

903
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,280
them and and turn, you know, like a

904
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,838
little bit and everything, you know,

905
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,280
like uh 40 50° too and they keep on they

906
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:48,239
keep on growing, you know, they they

907
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,800
they don't stop, you know, like uh you

908
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:53,279
know, that's the that's really nice from

909
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,079
the outdoor. They recover quite quickly

910
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,160
from the from, you know, the the

911
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,760
techniques and the stress. Yeah. Like

912
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:01,440
from the cropping, too. I like the

913
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,119
cropping. So, one question that I wanted

914
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,880
to ask you, a little bit of controversy,

915
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,039
I guess you could say, it has to do with

916
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,680
flowering time and when you actually

917
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,519
start counting flowering time. So, as an

918
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,319
indoor grower, and a lot of my audience

919
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:16,800
are indoor growers, they count flowering

920
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,320
days in order to kind of get an idea of

921
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,760
when they need to harvest the plant,

922
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,079
right? Different varieties have

923
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,079
different flowering times. Typically,

924
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,480
when they flip that light cycle to

925
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,000
either a 1212 light cycle or 1113,

926
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,920
whatever flowering light cycle they're

927
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,320
flipping to, they'll start to count

928
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,320
flowering days from there. Now,

929
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,200
outdoors, when you're growing outdoors,

930
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,800
there is no grow light to turn on to

931
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,319
initiate flowering, right? It naturally

932
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,560
happens. When do outdoor growers

933
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,838
typically start to count flowering days?

934
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:48,400
Is it something that they look at the

935
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,400
plant and see flowers start to occur and

936
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,119
then they start to count flowering days

937
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,039
or do they actually look and see

938
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,519
sunlight how how much sunlight they're

939
00:37:55,039 --> 00:38:00,079
getting per day? It's a really good

940
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,079
question like uh yeah as you as you just

941
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,560
mentioned like

942
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,400
uh when also we we we we write down the

943
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:10,799
characteristic of a genetic of a variety

944
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,440
or a new variety

945
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,440
um we you we test indoor outdoor

946
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,599
greenhouse we have different testing uh

947
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,679
uh spots but normally we we count the

948
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,920
flower time from the indoor the moment

949
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:26,480
that we turn

950
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,159
1212 that's what we do you know also to

951
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,559
uh put the characteristic you know and

952
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:33,039
and and then do analysis on our variety

953
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:35,519
on outdoor that change a bit because the

954
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:38,800
time of reaction of the plants on the

955
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:41,920
changing of the hours of lights depends

956
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,920
on the varieties. It's not all the same.

957
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,480
We have varieties that already like from

958
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,440
uh like I mentioned one like freezing as

959
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,719
an example or dura poison already with

960
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,119
14 hours and a half of lights they start

961
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:59,838
flowering and there are others like

962
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,400
destron that is a pure sativa across

963
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:05,119
between trillion races

964
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:09,039
sativas that start flowering in 2 weeks

965
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:12,079
from when the the time is 1212. So the

966
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:14,079
time when when when it start it's really

967
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,760
because and the plants already started

968
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,079
flowering actually we don't see the

969
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,640
pieces we don't see the pre flowers but

970
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,240
the plants it's in pre flowering so it's

971
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,118
really in the outdoor it's a little bit

972
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:28,879
more difficult normally personally I

973
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:32,480
count that from when the first you know

974
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,039
flower hairs uh so the first pisil uh go

975
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,920
you know are visible on on the plants

976
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:40,960
then I start counting from that you But

977
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,119
it's approximately because depends a lot

978
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,440
on the variety. That's uh that's for

979
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,240
sure. Got it. We got to ask that one.

980
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,838
We've got uh there's quite a few folks

981
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:51,759
that will debate particularly as

982
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,440
indoors. Some people don't actually

983
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,640
start counting the flowering days when

984
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,920
they flip the light cycle. They wait

985
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:57,759
till they start to see the plant

986
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,920
flowering. And then you got the outdoor

987
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,680
growers chiming in that say, "Hey, we

988
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,000
don't even have a light cycle to change

989
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,358
over." So, you know, we just start

990
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,119
counting flowering days once we see the

991
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:08,639
plant start flowering. So it seems like

992
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,880
there's an ongoing debate and a lot of

993
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,879
confusion on on who counts it when and

994
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,320
and so on and so forth. So just want to

995
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,680
throw that question at you and see how

996
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,160
you answer it. It's a nice question.

997
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:20,000
It's also true everybody because between

998
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,719
the vegetative stage and the flower time

999
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,119
there is a a short period where normally

1000
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:28,239
the plants stretch a lot that it's

1001
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,240
between 10 days that is pre flowering

1002
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,679
you know. So you you we we should talk

1003
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,039
about also pre flowering you know

1004
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,199
because it's not really full flowering

1005
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:37,119
but it's pre flowering. It's a middle

1006
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,879
point between the vegetative stage and

1007
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,160
and the plants. The plants start get

1008
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,720
used uh to the change of of of of hours

1009
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,639
of of lights, you know. So, they start

1010
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:49,439
uh changing the hormones also and and

1011
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:52,078
and put them, you know, like in in the

1012
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,838
flower in the flower stage. So it's a

1013
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,480
it's a good the bad but I think it's

1014
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:58,239
it's a middle point you know everybody

1015
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,480
can can see a different ways you know

1016
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:03,759
like in this way but indoor for us it's

1017
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,000
when we turn 1212 for our point and

1018
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,880
outdoor you really depends on the on the

1019
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,800
genetics and and the climate and and and

1020
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,280
where you are too you know that makes

1021
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,079
total sense so moving along here the

1022
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,760
plant has been flowering let's just get

1023
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,880
up towards harvest here now there are

1024
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,720
different varieties that are going to

1025
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,559
flower for different lengths like we

1026
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,239
talked about, but determining when to

1027
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:25,679
harvest. I think there's this is another

1028
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:27,279
thing that some folks will have

1029
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,358
different methods on. Yeah. Some will

1030
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,640
look at the tricoms, some will look at

1031
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:32,639
just the plant, looking at the the

1032
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,480
pistols or stigmas that are there to

1033
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,000
make sure they change colors. What do

1034
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,039
you typically look for to determine when

1035
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,480
to harvest the plant? Well, it's a good

1036
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:42,800
um that there are many schools on that,

1037
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,838
you know, like and there is many

1038
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,160
different situations, you know. First of

1039
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:51,119
all, in the outdoor growing, you depend

1040
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:53,199
a lot on the weather. So, always look

1041
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,358
the weather. Try to understand, you

1042
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,399
know, like we say, okay, my plants is

1043
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:00,880
full flower. I can keep her couple of

1044
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,960
extra weeks, but it's going to get 10

1045
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,800
days of

1046
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,358
rain, you know, like then we always

1047
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,640
recommend an early harvest. It's better

1048
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:14,159
to harvest a bit earlier than keep the

1049
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:16,639
plants for 10 15 days or a full week of

1050
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,159
full rain or harvest under the rain

1051
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,400
because we tried everything you know

1052
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:22,719
like in Netherland happen you know like

1053
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,318
uh you know like the days sometimes have

1054
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,078
three different season from the morning

1055
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:29,039
to the evening. So you have to get

1056
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,960
prepared on everything and uh so first

1057
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,480
of all like look the weather of course

1058
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,199
you know like you have to see the bats

1059
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,079
already structured you know like give it

1060
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,838
time to flower but the the the wedding

1061
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,000
the weather changing it's it's really

1062
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,639
important so look at the weather and

1063
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,400
then of course you know like depends a

1064
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:51,118
little bit of the characteristic of of

1065
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,240
the plant so the sativas the ibrid the

1066
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,318
indicas um normally you know like the

1067
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:59,679
first The second step on the weather is

1068
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:01,838
to look this the pistols. So the color

1069
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,799
uh there are and then also depend on the

1070
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:07,920
variety there are genetics that become

1071
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:09,839
100% on on on on like orange uh brown

1072
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,000
pistols you know like orange bud. It's

1073
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:14,559
famous to be like when you harvest it

1074
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,559
it's 90% like really orange pistons on

1075
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:21,838
that uh or you know like um you get like

1076
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:23,358
60 70% on on the on the on the color red

1077
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:25,279
pistons. And then we have to remember

1078
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:27,440
also that when we cut it and when we

1079
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,319
harvest it and then we lay you know we

1080
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,720
put it down side in a in a black envir

1081
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:35,358
you know in a dark environment uh the

1082
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:37,439
plant still for a few days have liquids

1083
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:40,559
inside so still to mature a little bit.

1084
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,000
So the process doesn't doesn't end uh in

1085
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,000
the in the in the day in the moment that

1086
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
you cut the plants but it's still going

1087
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,280
a little bit. So the the don't don't be

1088
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,358
scared, you know, to uh to to to to to

1089
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,880
harvest a little bit earlier than than

1090
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:55,358
what you expect if the weather is not

1091
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,200
great. And then the third the third

1092
00:43:55,358 --> 00:44:00,719
option, you know, the third wave is to

1093
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:04,879
check uh uh the tricoms. So if are

1094
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:09,279
transparent or milky or hamburger uh and

1095
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:11,599
on that depends also what you want to to

1096
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,880
get as as as as an effect from your

1097
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,720
plants because if you if people look for

1098
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,640
growers look for sativa's dominant

1099
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:23,919
normally they look for an ephoric effect

1100
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:26,838
uplifting energetic effect then normally

1101
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,318
you get this effect with a little bit of

1102
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:32,000
early harvest you know Like I don't want

1103
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:36,719
to say like too early but a early

1104
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,280
harvest get you a fresh fresh flowers

1105
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:42,639
you know a little bit like freshy tasty

1106
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,680
you know like that you don't get too

1107
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:49,679
much tarpines that that you can get with

1108
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:52,919
a a perfect or a little bit late harvest

1109
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:56,318
but you're going to get a a really

1110
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,039
uplifting many of the time uplifting and

1111
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:01,279
energetic effect. So what you're looking

1112
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:04,079
for a sativa, you know what I mean? Like

1113
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,920
uh uh then you have also a late harvest,

1114
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,359
you know, like a little bit late when

1115
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,599
maybe already like 40 50% of your trions

1116
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,759
are already hamburger. Maybe you're

1117
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:17,519
looking for that because it's like more

1118
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:20,160
a body stone, like more a couch, you

1119
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:22,079
know, like couch situation where, you

1120
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,559
know, talking, you know, like a more

1121
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,800
more strong effect on on the on the body

1122
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:29,119
too, you know, more relaxing, you know,

1123
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,400
more more powerful, you know, like. So,

1124
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,400
depends also what you're looking for.

1125
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,760
And that's normally the effect that

1126
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,440
you're looking for the indicas dominant

1127
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,200
like the or the pure indicas, the

1128
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,358
indicas dominant.

1129
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:44,078
depends also a little bit what what you

1130
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:46,159
want to get on that you know like uh

1131
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,800
regarding the effect I want to mention

1132
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:51,358
that because it's not a science on that

1133
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,039
but it's quite quite clear from from the

1134
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,679
test that we get and from the many

1135
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:57,199
feedbacks and reports that we we have

1136
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,000
you know like that uh that's that's

1137
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,000
that's a principle point on on the

1138
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,519
effort too I hear you yeah I think a lot

1139
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,679
of people would say personal preference

1140
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,759
I know some folks who well me in

1141
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:09,519
particular I like mostly cloudy tricoms

1142
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,720
with a little sprinkle of amber. I know

1143
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:12,800
some people are like, "Oh, I'm looking

1144
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:14,959
for about 50% amber cuz I want more of a

1145
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,160
laidback coach lock effect." So, yeah,

1146
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,599
personal preference. I'm glad you

1147
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:19,279
mentioned that. I'm also glad you

1148
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,559
mentioned that the weather as being an

1149
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,000
indicator on when to harvest because

1150
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:23,519
that's something we don't us indoor

1151
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,119
growers, we don't really hear about. We

1152
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:26,400
don't even consider because we're

1153
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,599
indoors. We don't have to worry about

1154
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,880
the weather. But yeah, when you're

1155
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,039
outdoors, you have to pay attention to

1156
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,519
that. I know there's so many growers who

1157
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:35,759
have lost harvests because they had

1158
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:38,239
rainy days towards the end and then they

1159
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,119
had bud rot. So if they had harvested a

1160
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,598
little bit early, they could have

1161
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,680
avoided that bud rot from infiltrating

1162
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,760
their their plants there. So yeah,

1163
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,279
really glad you brought up weather as a

1164
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,720
uh an indication of when to harvest.

1165
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,160
Yeah, it's it's really a principle

1166
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:52,000
point, you know, like also because if

1167
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:55,440
you harvest under the rain, then you

1168
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,679
have to get your products inside uh turn

1169
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,639
down the humidity to to take off the

1170
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,879
water and then you don't going to have

1171
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:04,719
really good turpps on on that on that on

1172
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,800
that flowers, you know, like uh you can

1173
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:08,399
still have good products, but um it's

1174
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,560
not going to be top top notch, you know,

1175
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,639
like a product. Yeah. Sounds like a lot

1176
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:14,559
more labor, too, in order to do that.

1177
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,719
So, exactly. Okay. Okay. Well, I want to

1178
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,318
get back into strains a little bit and I

1179
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:20,239
want to know your personal preference.

1180
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:21,920
Really? Can you name off the top three

1181
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:25,679
strains that you've grown outdoors that

1182
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:28,800
you really like? Yeah. Yeah. It's uh as

1183
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:31,519
as a really fanatic out grow, I really

1184
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,920
enjoy the the the the growing outside

1185
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:36,480
and give me a lot of uh happiness at the

1186
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,519
end of uh of of every circle because

1187
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,920
it's also, you know, follow the the the

1188
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,920
the season time, you know. So when you

1189
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,159
know when you harvesting you get in

1190
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,079
September, October you know Europe was

1191
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:50,879
always autumn so more rainy you know

1192
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,119
like and you have the the your new

1193
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,760
flowers you know from the harvest. So I

1194
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,838
really like that and as I mentioned I

1195
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,119
started as gua grower so in in the

1196
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:01,838
middle of the woods you know like

1197
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:04,280
putting nets to protect them from the

1198
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:07,838
animals and you know like it was really

1199
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:10,640
like not not easy to to get to harvest

1200
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:14,078
the plants. Uh I'm I'm really I really

1201
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:16,239
love the Skywalker Dutch Pion. It's a

1202
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,200
it's an old school variety that is a

1203
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:21,598
cross between blueberry and mazar. It's

1204
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,159
a monster plant. It's called like that

1205
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,079
because the branch so that the the the

1206
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:28,078
top butts, you know, like are really

1207
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:32,519
like alpha meter size, you know, like

1208
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:35,599
really huge yielding and super fruity uh

1209
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:38,480
sweet smell come from blueberry. So it's

1210
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:41,280
really like a nice combination with a

1211
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,719
tough and strong effect like a indica

1212
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,960
effect you like a really couch looking

1213
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:49,118
for at least for me for the evening I

1214
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,119
really enjoy more this kind of effect

1215
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:55,119
when when I relax myself when I finish

1216
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:57,039
my day. Um then I have the mazar that is

1217
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:00,160
also one of the my top three for the

1218
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:03,838
outdoor I enjoy that plant. It's it's

1219
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:06,000
fresh fresh uh smell and and and you

1220
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:08,880
know like it's really minty fresh. It's

1221
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,119
a particular variety. It's it's really

1222
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,680
strong to grow. So it's really like it

1223
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,119
can suffer a lot but you you you get

1224
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,838
something from that you know. So it's

1225
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:20,559
always the rivery uh the the mazar it's

1226
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:22,558
it's also a really nice a really nice

1227
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:26,160
effect. And and the third one is a

1228
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:28,319
freeze and new that actually I like it

1229
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:30,639
and I still really enjoy that because

1230
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:34,000
it's it's a beautiful plants with a

1231
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,920
beautiful color, a fresh uh tasty, you

1232
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,358
know, like

1233
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:41,760
a incense uh uh uh uh taste and smell.

1234
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:44,159
So, it's like a fruity incense, you

1235
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:47,280
know, like it's a good mix of the old

1236
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:49,838
school uh Dutch uh you know, like a

1237
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,400
coffee shop smell, you know, like uh the

1238
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:54,400
flowers. And I really enjoy also the

1239
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,559
effect because it's a uplift in the

1240
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:01,039
effect. It's not too strong. We're

1241
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:04,319
talking about around 12 and 16% of THC.

1242
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:05,759
So we put it in a medium low THC

1243
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,800
average, you know, like and I really

1244
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,680
enjoy for my daily smoke, you know, like

1245
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,200
uh it's it's enjoyable because I can be

1246
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:16,318
super functional with that, you know,

1247
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:17,838
like motivate me, focus me when I have

1248
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:20,719
to do something that maybe I don't want

1249
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:22,799
to do that or you know like if I'm too

1250
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:25,439
lazy at the moment, you know, like so

1251
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,519
it's it's really like um uplifting for

1252
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,760
me. So it's I would put on the top three

1253
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:31,119
these three and then I may many others

1254
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,599
you know to select only three it's

1255
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,000
difficult but uh if I were to pick

1256
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,800
without you all blind I would pick these

1257
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,280
trees for sure. All three of those sound

1258
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,800
incredible. Now you mentioned outdoors

1259
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,280
the folks that are tuning in that grow

1260
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,880
indoors would you recommend it to grow

1261
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,599
indoors as well or would you only say

1262
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:52,079
outdoors only for those three?

1263
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:55,039
Skywalker and Mazar also indoor but

1264
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:57,839
freezing dew is not really for indoor

1265
00:50:55,039 --> 00:51:00,800
you know you can grow it indoor but you

1266
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:02,480
enjoy you can enjoy better indoor

1267
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,280
varieties growing indoor you know what I

1268
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,280
mean like it's really a typical outdoor

1269
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,760
it's it's really a good outdoor variety

1270
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,280
you know like that you enjoy the maximum

1271
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,000
point that you enjoy this outdoor

1272
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,400
greenhouse glass indoor I would pick

1273
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,880
other other varieties yeah yeah but

1274
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,800
skywalk and mazar you can really enjoy

1275
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,119
that also indoor. Yeah, no doubt on

1276
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,720
that. Good to know. I actually just got

1277
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,838
my hands on, well, recently got my hands

1278
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:30,558
on Skunk number one by Dutch Passion and

1279
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:32,318
I haven't grown it out yet, but I got it

1280
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,559
through Seedsmen. I know you guys have a

1281
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:36,159
partnership with Seedsmen and uh yeah,

1282
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,440
got skunk number one. Super excited for

1283
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:41,920
that. I mean, that's a iconic legendary

1284
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:45,519
strain there. And you will see the sides

1285
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:48,159
of the B of of that plant. It's it's

1286
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:50,079
unbelievable, you know. It's wow. You

1287
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:52,639
know, lately we see like really nice

1288
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,960
genetics as we said it before, but also

1289
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:56,480
the size of the buds is decreasing, you

1290
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,079
know, in general, you know, like you are

1291
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:02,719
super frosty and really nice colors and

1292
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,760
fantastic flavors and turns, but that

1293
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:07,598
old school stuff like skunk number one

1294
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,200
or the the the white widow, you know,

1295
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,640
you see the size of the body and you

1296
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,118
say, "Wow." Wow. You know, like it's

1297
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:14,799
like a tin of Coca-Cola, you know, like

1298
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,838
it's really like the old one. I had the

1299
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:20,480
fat one, you know. I said, "Wow, it's a

1300
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:22,400
like uh it's really really nice." Yeah,

1301
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,000
I can't wait to grow that one out. I

1302
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,000
when I first started growing, my buddy

1303
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,880
had skunk number one and so I grew out

1304
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,239
one of his cuts and u I'm curious to see

1305
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,079
if it's going to be similar to what I

1306
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:33,519
grew out back then cuz I know there are

1307
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,359
a bunch of different skunk number ones.

1308
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:37,679
Different breeders have their own

1309
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:39,039
version of it and stuff like that. But

1310
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:40,799
uh yeah, really looking forward to that.

1311
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:43,358
probably get that hopefully get that in

1312
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,119
the ground this year. Amazing. Now,

1313
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:47,199
we're looking forward for your your

1314
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,720
feedback too. You know, like uh we hope

1315
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:52,558
you enjoy this legendary variety. So, we

1316
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:54,558
are getting up towards the end of the

1317
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,920
episode here and want to give you a

1318
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,200
chance to tell the listeners how they

1319
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,720
could find you and is there anything

1320
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:00,239
upcoming in the future that you have

1321
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:02,159
going on that you want to talk about?

1322
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:04,799
Yeah, we've yeah, we're working you know

1323
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:06,879
like yeah the genetics um you know like

1324
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,280
environment and industry it's it's it's

1325
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,960
growing fast and we are studying you

1326
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,160
know like and and testing a lot of new

1327
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,559
varieties we uh we breed and and and

1328
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:20,239
stabilize one of the first variety uh

1329
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:22,559
with eye contact of THCV it's called THC

1330
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:27,039
victory uh it's really interesting

1331
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:29,040
medical for medical users um we are also

1332
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,719
testing and study something really

1333
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,838
interesting that could another chapter,

1334
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:35,279
you know, like that it's the triploid

1335
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:37,519
varieties. Uh that it's still at the

1336
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,400
beginning of the of the of the of the

1337
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:43,039
development. Uh but we see quite a lot

1338
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,240
of potential on the on the triploid uh

1339
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,960
genetics uh uh you know talking about

1340
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:52,479
turppins and quantity of of of

1341
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,079
canabonoids and and as as a strong plant

1342
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,559
you know like really stable stable

1343
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,960
variety. So we are working we're working

1344
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,119
really hard you know like uh uh with our

1345
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,280
our our breeding team you know here in

1346
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,119
Amsterdam and also with collaboration

1347
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,359
around the world in different countries.

1348
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,200
So uh we really love what's happening

1349
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:10,880
with the plants because it's becoming

1350
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:12,799
really like a huge international

1351
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,039
community always been but with the

1352
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:18,000
legalization and with the technology

1353
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:20,880
that is coming in uh we are improving a

1354
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,039
lot of aspect of source of our of our

1355
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:26,318
job you know in general we improving the

1356
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:28,800
quality uh the testing and that's uh

1357
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:30,880
also because big you know like a

1358
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,440
companies normally was always involved

1359
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,838
in agricultural industry the normal one

1360
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,519
the corn and all the rest now they're

1361
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:40,719
get interesting and they're putting some

1362
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:44,239
technology uh to us you know like to use

1363
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:45,879
uh on on the plants uh uh um you know

1364
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:48,799
testing and analyzing. So we are

1365
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:51,920
discovering a lot of potential on on on

1366
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:54,000
using these new technologies. Uh so yeah

1367

from from the beginners till like the

1373
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:13,519
pro you know like the breeding process

1374
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,159
that we use. So uh you can you can stay

1375

00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,960
offer the best genetics you know like

1394
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:03,519
that we can to the growers because of

1395

1396
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,039
you know what I mean like when a grower

1397
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:10,720
choose for your seed your genetic is not

1398
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:13,279
just you know like a plant you know like

1399
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:15,919
growing it's it's it's four months five

1400
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,000
months it's you know it's time investing

1401

money investing, you know, like uh so

1402

that's for us the best motivation and

1409
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,480
the expo for us is opportunities uh to

supported through Patreon goes right

1424
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,960
back on the podcast. You keep this

1425
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,480
podcast going. So, thank you so much.

1426
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,639
The folks being scrolled on the screen

1427
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,480
right now on the producer tier. Special

1428
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,838
thanks to you, Francisco. Once again,

1429
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,440
thank you so much for coming on that

1430
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,759
podcast. This was awesome. We don't do

1431
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,760
enough talk about genetics on this

1432
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,160
podcast. That's something I want to do

1433
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,520
more often. And so hearing about not

1434
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:29,039
only outdoors, which is something we

1435
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:30,880
don't talk about much, but outdoor

1436
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:32,558
genetics, I think is going to add a lot

1437
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,318
of value to the folks that are listening

1438
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,160
into. So, thanks so much for your time

1439
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:38,000
today and hope you enjoy the rest of

1440
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:40,719
your day. Thank you very much. Chris,
