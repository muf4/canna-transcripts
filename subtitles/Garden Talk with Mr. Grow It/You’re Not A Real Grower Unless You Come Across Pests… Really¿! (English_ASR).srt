1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,318
I want to get into pests next let's

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,200
start with IPM things you could do to

3
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:09,879
prevent pests what do you do in that

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,839
case I've had problems in the past and I

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,360
had a bad bag of Coco in the past that I

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,480
had to deal with fungus

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:19,118
nuts and to get rid of that I had to use

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,518
a mosquito bits so something that I had

9
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:25,000
to water into into the into the Coco

10
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:27,678
every day for at least about a week till

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,518
I got rid of that but I normally keep uh

12
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:33,119
sticky traps around now so that's always

13
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:34,920
a good monitor like just to keep an eye

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,799
on things it's not going to stop you

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,640
from getting them but it's going to tell

16
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,759
you if you have a problem or not [ __ ]

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,239
SNS are such a pain man I battle them so

18
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,079
much they seem to come and go so often

19
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,558
it can be certainly be frustrating when

20
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,558
you have a a crazy outbreak it doesn't

21
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,238
sound like they have been too crazy for

22
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:55,399
you though have you come across any

23
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:57,599
major pest infestations whether it be

24
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,399
spider mice thrips anything like that at

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,879
all no just the fungus luckily that's

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,480
all I had I guess you know they say

27
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:05,280
you're not a real girl until you get

28
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:09,158
spider Ms and stuff so I guess I'm not a

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,519
real girl yet I'm still learning yeah

30
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,719
I've never heard that

31
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:14,959
before yeah I heard somebody say that at

32
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,640
the girl shop the other day okay I guess

33
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,559
I'm not a real girl yet I don't know

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,040
what I'm do I guess I guess agree to

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,759
disagree on that one I know people who

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,960
have been growing for five plus years

37
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,118
and they've never come across pest so

38
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,359
that's great call them not a grower

39
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,640
exactly right like come on man uh that's

40
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,640
funny I'm glad to hear that you haven't

41
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,159
come across any major infestations it

42
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,239
could be such a pain man I had uh I had

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,479
aphids Outdoors one time and it was so

44
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,399
disheartening it was on actually my bok

45
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:45,478
choy and I went in there it was Harvest

46
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,718
day and I was like ah going to harvest

47
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,679
some bok choy the first time growing it

48
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:51,199
I was super excited it was purple lady

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
bok choy so it was like completely

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,680
purple and then I went to go Harvest it

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,600
and I'm just just loaded with aphids

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,280
kind of like borrowed in and it was just

53
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:02,798
H it was disgusting I was like oh no how

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,320
the heck am I going to eat this stuff

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,360
you know well that's one of the things

56
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,959
about growing outside right is like you

57
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,520
can't really control too too much what's

58
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,239
going on out there Outdoors is a whole

59
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,000
different Battlefield now are you doing

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,599
anything as a preventative like sprays a

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,159
lot of people use sprays particularly

62
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,359
like in the veg stage in order to kind

63
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,519
of deter pest or prevent pest from

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,440
coming in do you do those at all or no

65
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,640
no no I haven't had so yet so I mean I

66
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,239
know everybody everybody's telling me to

67
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,639
go ahead and just get some preventative

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,319
maintenance going on before it happens

69
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,958
but I haven't had the chance to

70
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,158
experiment with any different type of

71
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,479
phray yet but I'm always willing to try

72
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:45,479
something all right pretty

00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,840
straightforward there I'll keep my

74
