even count the podcast platforms because

74
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,159
expected and I actually had someone from

75
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,639
my hometown come up to me when I was

76

00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,919
connected and you wanted to do a

84
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,158
sponsorship through me and you were one

85
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,280
of the first ones I had you and then

86
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,239

165
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,840
throughout the years about how to keep

166
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,120
your grow on the on the down low um cuz

167
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,758
even if it is legal you know some

168
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,079
landlords don't like it your neighbors

169
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,479
might not like it it's super smelly it's

170
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,279
not like it's not like just drinking a

171
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,680
couple beers you know you don't smell

172
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:51,000
beers Three Doors Down so I think it's

173
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,879
important even though um even if you are

174
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,918
in a legal State just to be respectable

175
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,639
uh to your neighbors and and just you

176
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,079
know landlords whatever everyone it's

177
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,720
it's an important thing to know I think

178
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,878
absolutely absolutely and you not only

179
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,520
have experienced growing medicinal

180
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,960
plants but you also have a vegetable

181
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:07,918
garden cck my from wrong which you have

182
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:10,719
a pretty extensive vegetable garden you

183
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,478
do I think it's mostly Outdoors youve

184
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,120
probably doubled indoors I'm assuming

185
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,478
can you kind of break down what you've

186
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,800
got growing on a little bit yeah um so

187
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,279
right now I have a 4x8 Grassroots fabric

188
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,800
pot in my backyard with a blue mat

189
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,918
watering system it's the uh soaker hose

190
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,120
uh blue soak system so basically it's

191
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,839
just hooked up to my hes um the fabric

192
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,038
back

193
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,758
has uh it's like a plastic liner in the

194
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:38,918
middle of it so it keeps the the

195
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,479
moisture content a little higher inside

196
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:43,799
of the um inside of the bed than a

197
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:46,519
typical fabric pot paired with the um

198
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,000
paired with the blue mats that are just

199
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:52,560
constantly releasing just the tiniest

200
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,319
bit of moisture um I've got a ton of

201
00:07:52,560 --> 00:08:00,399
living soil and compost and top soil and

202
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:03,080
perlite um in there and and man dude

203
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,560
things just you're talking 8ot tall

204
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:07,158
tomato plants at the end of the year

205
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,598
it's just insane like unlimited amounts

206
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:12,478
of zucchini um and I really don't have

207
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,800
to do anything you just you set the blue

208
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,439
mat up you plant the seeds in the

209
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,400
beginning and it's just go time uh a

210
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,519
little bit of weeding but not much being

211
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,318
in the 4x8 bed so um I've actually

212
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:27,038
really enjoyed I've really enjoyed

213
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:30,158
growing in that for bed and growing um

214
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:32,639
Tomatoes cherry tomatoes

215
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:34,879
um I'm a huge fan of zucchini and squash

216
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:38,038
uh we do basil and carrots my son he's

217
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,679
two and a half he loves the carrots um

218
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,319
he'll dig them up three times and I'll

219
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,799
have to replant them and they'll come

220
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,160
out all like kind of mangled at the end

221
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,399
of the year but he's still stoked so I'm

222
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm

223
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:56,039
happy and uh and yeah and then my wife

224
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,399
um she grew up on a farm and uh so she

225
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,838
has a ton of

226
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,879
experience uh growing flowers and just

227
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,399
being in green houses and stuff so it's

228
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:07,240
just like you know it's nostalgic it's

229
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,519
fun and I really can't wait to teach my

230
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,720
son how to you know Garden on his own

231
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,200
and and and just continue like I could

232
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,879
see myself adding more and more uh

233
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,519
raised beds and uh you know I'll sneak a

234
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:23,039
medicinal plant in that raised bed every

235
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,959
every once in a while nice nice yeah you

236
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,039
mention your son and and being able to

237
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,679
teach him to Garden in the future and as

238
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,879
you know I have a daughter now and I

239
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:33,239
same way I cannot wait till I can start

240
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,919
teaching her how to garden as far as

241
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,360
hiding those things from your son right

242
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,039
are you going to be kind of stealth

243
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,278
around him or you going to eventually

244
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:44,360
introduce your plants to your your

245
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:47,399
children at some point early on or what

246
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,959
so if I had it if I was um growing in

247
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:54,440
the house I would be very um cognizant

248
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:56,399
of odors uh mostly just odors you know

249
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,680
noise and everything else not a big deal

250
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,720
um but my philosophy really is to treat

251
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:05,199
it just like a beer or

252
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,079
alcohol um it's not for kids it's for

253
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,399
grown-ups and

254
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:12,479
so you know I don't really feel the need

255
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,519
to hide it but if I if I were growing

256
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,360
indoors just for the respect of my whole

257
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:20,519
family I would make sure that you know

258
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,120
odor is controlled all the time and um

259
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,278
which can be difficult especially when

260
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,720
you're opening your tent um you know you

261
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,320
could have your odor perfectly fine and

262
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,079
then you open the tent for 20 minutes

263
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,519
and now your whole house is is stinky so

264
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:37,319
there's some tricks that we can talk

265
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,759
about to um to kind of combat that

266
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,959
and and to kind of set yourself up in a

267
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:45,399
way that you can still work in your

268
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:48,119
garden but also have uh control over o

269
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,559
odors and and and to be stealthy yeah

270
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,200
let's get into that we can probably get

271
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,679
into that first but one thing I did want

272
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,800
to comment on just a followup is yeah I

273
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:59,199
feel the same way about as far as not

274
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,599
really hiding it from the kid but

275
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,040
teaching them that this is for adults

276
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,320
right it's something for adults maybe

277
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,000
keep them distance right you don't want

278
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,360
them be in contact with the the TR

279
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,720
tricomes or anything all of a sudden

280
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,360
they get all over the hands or anything

281
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,560
like that so all the toy all the toys

282
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,600
are sticking to their hands what are you

283
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,719
doing yeah you walking there they're

284
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,000
hanging all the things all over the plan

285
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,360
like a Christmas tree or something that

286
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,200
be pretty but no I I I totally get what

287
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,759
you mean by that and um I think that's

288
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,480
kind of a separate conversation is kids

289
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,759
and medicinal plants and when you

290
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,759
introduce to them and and teach them and

291
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,159
so on and so forth we actually had that

292
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,360
conversation on the from the stash

293
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,039
podcast I know you know Rob and pigeons

294
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,639
long time ago we talked about that I

295
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,799
thought that was a great conversation

296
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,320
but a whole different SE separate

297
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,679
conversation there let's get into

298
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,120
stealth growing and I think you brought

299
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:46,359
up the smell first let's talk about that

300
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,159
and then we could probably get into some

301
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,079
other things like how to get equipment

302
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,559
in and out of the house how you hide it

303
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,399
from roommates or your landlord and how

304
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,078
to hide light and so on and so forth so

305
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,958
for smell when you've got the smell

306
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:00,199
there right these plants do smell

307
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,679
particularly in the flowering stage

308
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,399
right even in veg you're going to have

309
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,479
some plant smell happen how do you go

310
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,720
about hiding the smell I'll start with

311
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,440
like the easiest kind of quickest but

312
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,278
laziest way and um and that is you know

313
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,720
say say the smell is just kind of out of

314
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:16,078
control you know you haven't been taken

315
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,199
care of it whatever and you got someone

316
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,638
coming

317
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:22,039
over and uh you know you just don't want

318
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,560
them you don't want them to know about

319
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,919
it you know maybe they maybe they know

320
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,679
that you consume but you don't want them

321
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:30,919
to know about light one up just light

322
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,078
one up clouded up and now they're just

323
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,559
going to smell that and they're not

324
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,039
going to know that you've uh you've got

325
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,719
a garden in the in the back bedroom so I

326
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:40,599
guess that's like number one easiest

327
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:44,040
laziest kind of

328
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,278
just but really it's uh it's tough It's

329
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:49,919
Not Easy because you know like I said

330
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:52,240
you open up the tent smell leaks out uh

331
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,679
you harvest how do you trim a plant

332
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,959
without stinking up the whole house I

333
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:58,000
mean it's not easy um but there are some

334
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,278
things that that you can do um but

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,360
before we get into those I think the

336
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,519
first thing we should talk about is um

337
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,919
negative

338
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,679
pressure so um negative

339
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,039
pressure is when uh you're say you're

340
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:12,120
looking at your grow tent and you have

341
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,958
your your fan it's sitting on top of the

342
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,519
carbon filter or maybe the carbon filter

343
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:18,559
is mounted and the Fan's uh beside it

344
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,720
and it's pumping air out um through the

345
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,599
ducting you'll notice that the sides of

346
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,320
the tent start to squeeze

347
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,600
in and when those sides of the tent are

348
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,720
squeezing in that means that no air is

349
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,839
leaking out through your zipper holes

350
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,079
through um the holes in the bottom of

351
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,760
the tent uh in the bottom of the tent

352
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,879
the mesh holes basically any hole um

353
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,838
because no matter how well a tent is

354
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:44,439
built there's always going to be a hole

355
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,000
whether you can see it or not that odors

356
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,959
can get out

357
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,759
so negative

358
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:52,958
pressure basically makes it so the

359
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,360
stinky air that's in the tent only has

360
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,439
one way out and that's through the

361
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,600
carbon filter where it's scrubbed of

362
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,839
odors and then out the tube

363
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,000
um you got to check that tubing for

364
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,639
holes if there's a hole in your ducting

365
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,958
um your whole your carbon filter will be

366
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,600
useless you got to check your

367
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:14,198
connections um where your ducting

368
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,480
connects to the carbon filter uh where

369
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:17,519
it connects to the fan you got to make

370
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,199
sure all those are tight and sealed uh

371
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,799
you can use um tape you make a special

372
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,719
duct tape um not like your traditional

373
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:28,958
duct tape but like the foil duct tape

374
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,079
that can that is heat resistant that you

375
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,359
can seal it up with but then it's like

376
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,919
you know say you do all that and you got

377
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,759
your negative pressure and everything's

378
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,958
good but you got to work on your plant

379
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,839
you got to open up the tent you open up

380
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,319
that tent there's not going to unless

381
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:47,000
your fan is you know a 12in monster

382
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,959
vortx vanan and a 2x4 tent you're not

383
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,399
going to be able to keep negative

384
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,559
pressure with a with the door open it's

385
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:58,440
it's not going to happen so there's ways

386
00:14:53,559 --> 00:15:00,958
around that um one way is a lung room so

387
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,120
you you utilize either the closet or the

388
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,239
bedroom that your grow tent is in as a

389
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,959
quote unquote lung room so what you

390
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,360
could do is you could have a a 4in

391
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,838
carbon fan and filter inside of the tent

392
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,560
that is creating negative pressure in

393
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,360
the tent at all times and then inside of

394
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:20,838
the bedroom or closet that you're in you

395
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,560
can have a bigger fan That's rated for

396
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:27,800
whatever size the room is with a carbon

397
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:29,599
filter um exhausting out the window so

398
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,559
now you've got you've got negative

399
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,639
pressure twice you've got it in the

400
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,799
tent and then you also have it in the

401
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,480
room and you want to make sure that the

402
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,838
door is closed to the room uh when

403
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,519
you're working in there obviously but

404
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,120
that that should protect you right so if

405
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,519
you open up the tent you still have

406
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,240
negative pressure in the room so the

407
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,240
smell isn't going to leak out under the

408
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,639
door and you can work in there and then

409
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,560
you can close it up and you know once

410
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,159
you know a half hour after you close it

411
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,479
up if if you want you could turn off the

412
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,679
um carbon filter in the big room you

413
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,000
know you know and only uh run it in the

414
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:06,679
small room so I think that is really

415
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,600
kind of the biggest thing that uh that

416
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:12,919
people can do to really like have it

417
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,480
under control for for most of the time

418
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:16,879
um you have a little bit of experience

419
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,600
with this so is that something that you

420
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,439
ever tried yeah carbon filters are

421
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,680
definitely key I ran carbon filters for

422
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,319
many years now I don't even bother to

423
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,519
run them anymore to be honest with you

424
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,198
cuz I'm just pumping it out up into my

425
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,799
attic and it's being ventilated it out

426
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,078
my roof but I'm not really hiding the

427
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,519
smell I don't really need to hide the

428
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,359
smell much anymore what about aren't

429
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,039
there like gel products or something

430
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,199
that you can that come in containers

431
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,599
that people use have you used any of

432
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:44,758
those are those effective or incense

433
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,278
some people burn incense I've never used

434
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,079
incense for that I mean I've used

435
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:51,559
incense to cover up uh when I was

436
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:52,838
lighting up when I was 16 in my bedroom

437
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:55,159
but I don't think it I don't think it

438
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:56,959
tricked my mom to be honest with you

439
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:59,879
they don't smell that bad in the veg

440
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:02,679
stage um they do a little bit you know

441
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:06,000
what I mean like it's still it's it's

442
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:10,000
it's enough but it's not as nearly uh as

443
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,959
potent as the bloom stage and also uh

444
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,558
when I was doing a little bit of

445
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,919
research on this just to kind of recap

446
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:18,838
before the podcast I I found that there

447
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:20,880
are some um varieties out there that are

448
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,240
uh have lower odors like they're just

449
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,319
known for having lower odors and so

450
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,400
that's also something that if people are

451
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:29,759
concerned about they can look into

452
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,240
but the um the gel blocks that you're

453
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:36,440
referring to um Ona blocks is one of the

454
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,679
um this is basically the top brand and

455
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,679
they work fantastic they've got

456
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,679
thousands of reviews four and a half

457
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:45,120
stars um we sell them on Happy Hydro so

458
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,798
if anyone wants to look for them they

459
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,719
can take a look but um mostly if you

460
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,960
have your carbon filter set up properly

461
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,720
and you have uh some sort of lung room

462
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:00,360
kind of set up properly too you don't

463
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,880
need them um really until like your

464
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:05,199
Harvest and your trimming and and just

465
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,520
when it gets to a point where you know

466
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,880
it gets a little out of control when

467
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:10,400
you're harvesting and trimming um so

468
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,679
that's when you can you might want to

469
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,720
introduce something like these Ona

470
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:19,840
blocks that just basically overpower the

471
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:22,519
the odor with its own odor it's like for

472
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,918
breeze on steroids almost yeah I haven't

473
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,599
personally tried that stuff but uh I've

474
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:28,559
heard some good things about it what

475
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:30,119
about hiding the light something people

476
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,918
may say oh what are you talking about

477
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,359
light it's sealed up in the grow tent so

478
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,159
you're not really it's going to not

479
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,839
really be exposed but what about like

480
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:38,799
people just growing in a bed room for

481
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:40,359
example the window there might be light

482
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,798
leakage to the window there might be le

483
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,678
leage underneath the door and they try

484
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:45,839
to hide it from their roommates or

485
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,720
family members talk to us about hiding

486
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,359
the light one of the best tricks for

487
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,880
hiding the light uh from escaping

488
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:55,678
outside of the window um is to just have

489
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,000
like you know normal curtains in front

490
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,880
of the window and then you can build a

491
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,798
box out a 2x4 and plywood that just

492
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,360
comes out and around the curtain and

493
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:07,839
just install

494
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,359
that over top of the curtain that way

495
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,798
whoever is looking into the house you

496
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,119
know it just looks like normal curtains

497
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,879
there's no uh there's no black garbage

498
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,599
bag taped over the window or just

499
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,400
there's no nothing weird like that it's

500
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,839
just you know normal curtains so that's

501
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,200
one of the best tricks um otherwise yeah

502
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,240
you're pretty much stuck to just using

503
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,840
like some 7 mil uh Panda film you know

504
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,880
black and white to to uh to to to block

505
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,480
the light out or something of the sort

506
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,720
those are kind of those are mostly the

507
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,038
only options um and then even with grow

508
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,798
tents you know if you're you're growing

509
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,919
in a grow tent and you're having people

510
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,879
over grow tents leak

511
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,159
light um pretty much all of them leak a

512
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:50,760
little bit of light whether it's through

513
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:52,360
a stitch and a zipper or whatever um so

514
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:55,919
a lot of grow lights and a lot of this

515
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:57,558
equipment nowadays you can um control

516
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,759
from your phone with these automation

517
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:03,399
apps so if you know someone's coming

518
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:05,359
over or whatever and uh you can shut the

519
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,440
light off for a little while uh you can

520
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,240
turn your turn your fan down to its

521
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,840
lowest setting you don't want to turn

522
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,558
your fan uh off completely because then

523
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,879
your odors you you'll lose your negative

524
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:16,678
pressure and your odors will leak out

525
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,400
but uh you turn your fan down to its

526
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,798
lowest setting quiet it down turn the

527
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,038
light off

528
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,400
um and those are those are some tricks

529
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:25,798
you know yeah for me I use polyfilm that

530
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,000
you mentioned I have them covering my

531
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:30,158
window so it really does look black on

532
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,440
the outside but I have sunscreens as

533
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,440
well I'm in the desert and sunscreens

534
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,880
are very valuable out here during the

535
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,038
daytime you can't really see that it's

536
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,120
like a black sheet you know and during

537
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:40,679
night time you'd have to actually be

538
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,839
shining light through it in order to

539
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,038
kind of see that uh that black polyfilm

540
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,279
on the windows so that's what I use it

541
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:50,319
mostly use it for keeping the light out

542
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,399
of the room you know what I mean but

543
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,519
certainly it's it's good for for keeping

544
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,679
light from escaping the room as well and

545
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,918
for my doors uh what I use is on the

546
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,320
bottom there there right there's that

547
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,960
spacing I use draft guards so if you

548
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,678
search on Amazon twin draft guard it

549
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,600
basically is like a piece of Styrofoam

550
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,200
and plastic circular and it's the length

551
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,399
of the door and you basically just slide

552
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,400
it underneath the door so uh it prevents

553
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,240
any light or anything really from coming

554
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,080
into that bottom part of the door and

555
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,679
then what I did was cut up polyfilm

556
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,720
because the cracks of the door all

557
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,759
around the the edges there light was

558
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,240
coming in that way and so I would cut up

559
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,400
a piece of the polyfilm and just

560
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,880
basically cover cover it that way and so

561
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,440
when I'm opening up and closing the door

562
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,480
sure there's like a flap of polyfilm but

563
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,159
that prevents light from coming in and

564
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,400
it would work well for preventing life

565
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,240
from going out too so forg I'd mention

566
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,600
those things yeah no that's great and

567
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,798
that's that's kind of a good segue into

568
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:49,759
um into how taking this adventure and

569
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:52,679
starting to grow on your own can really

570
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:57,599
teach you a lot about

571
00:21:52,679 --> 00:22:00,519
DIY um you can learn I mean Farmers

572
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,759
farmers are are plumbers farmers are

573
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:05,158
carpenters farmers are

574
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:06,720
electricians um they're everything you

575
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,440
know they learn how to do it all I

576
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:14,200
learned how to do a lot myself um

577
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,159
gardening and being a renter because

578
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,440
yeah can't just call your landlord if

579
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,360
something goes wrong you know so I

580
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,919
learned a lot of stuff uh on my own and

581
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,319
it's kind of a blessing and disguise

582
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,038
like in the in that time I was you know

583
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:31,519
stressing out like oh no my basement's

584
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:34,158
floating what do I do oh there's soil in

585
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,519
the Su pump okay I got to like clean

586
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,440
this out oh I got it work in you know

587
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:41,960
awesome or uh you know learning how to

588
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,120
deal with electricity and just

589
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:48,960
everything um it's been so valuable you

590
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:51,918
know cuz now I'm I'm renovating my attic

591
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,880
and I'm using these skills that I

592
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,120
learned um that I that I never learned

593
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,120
previously so so that's kind of cool but

594
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:01,839
I wanted to I wanted to reverse back to

595
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:04,639
odor because there's kind of like a

596
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,918
controversial thing uh that we didn't

597
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,559
talk about and that's ozone

598
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,559
generators ah okay so I never I didn't

599
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,480
even put those in our notes but ozone

600
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:19,119
generators we don't sell them on Happy

601
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,880
Hydro frankly I don't really know what

602
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,558
if they're dangerous if they're not

603
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,600
dangerous I don't know the interest I've

604
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:28,558
never done a deep dive on on ozone

605
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,918
generators I know you may have or you

606
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,200
may have a little bit of Noe I'm not

607
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,000
never used one not very familiar with it

608
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,480
just search for it on Amazon I see

609
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,480
there's one for 65 bucks the word ozone

610
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,120
generator sounds kind of scary you know

611
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,759
like is it generating ozone in my house

612
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,158
like should I be breathing it I don't

613
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,960
know I don't um I don't really know but

614
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,480
I know that people I have been in a

615
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,759
house where people have been using them

616
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,000
they do cover up odors but I think uh

617
00:23:54,759 --> 00:24:00,558
before anybody goes and and uses those

618
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,319
they should kind of look into the you

619
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:05,440
know whether or not they're safe I guess

620
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:08,119
you know if they're selling them on

621
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,600
Amazon you would assume like that Amazon

622
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:12,359
would do their due diligence but you

623
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:13,959
know I don't really know I know there's

624
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,000
a debate and that's why I don't list

625
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,000
them on our website because I don't want

626
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,798
to you know Steer clear of any

627
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,880
controversy sounds like a good question

628
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:25,720
for the audience ozone generators has

629
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,159
anybody used them any experience with it

630
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,880
let us know down in the comment section

631
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:30,880
below go back to light real quick I

632
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,600
think you had a good story in regards to

633
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,600

00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,038
just less internet you know the grow

651
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:13,278
stores where you hung out and shared all

652
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,759
your stories had to keep things on the

653
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,159
low this guy's telling a story about how

654
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,879
him and his buddy rented a house and

655
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,559
they're growing in the basement and they

656
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,440
get it all set up and they they're using

657
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,000
some thousand watt HPS lights maybe a

658
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,679
couple of them they finish up you know

659
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,599
it's like one in the morning they're

660
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,320
exhausted they just spent you know six

661
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,158
seven8 hours building this grow room

662
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:36,839
they got you know the plants in

663
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,960
everything they go

664
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,558
outside and they go to get in their cars

665
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,038
to leave and they look back at the house

666
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:45,798
and there's light just pouring out of

667
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:47,839
the foundation through every single

668
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:49,359
cracken hole just bright yellow light

669
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,879
pouring out of the

670
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:55,240
foundation and I was like dude what did

671
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:58,520
you do he's like well I didn't sleep

672
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:01,079
that night for one um

673
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:03,558
luckily there was like a 24/7 Walmart or

674
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:06,319
whatever and uh they went and they

675
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:09,519
bought you know 10 cans of great stuff

676
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:11,398
that like foam spray and they went

677
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,278
around the whole thing and just had to

678
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:16,439
basically fill in the whole found the

679
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:19,038
whole uh fouret of foundation sticking

680
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,000
out from the ground to where the first

681
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,480
floor of the house starts they had to

682
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,319
seal it all up in the middle of the

683
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,480
night and uh I was just like wow man

684
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,200
that is just imagine that imagine like

685
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,360
putting in all those hours getting

686
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,319
everything set up you're getting in your

687
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,759
car you're like you're feeling like yeah

688
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:39,359
dude we're done and then you just look

689
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:41,158
overing coming out of the that's crazy

690
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,558
that's got to be a rare thing though

691
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,240
right cuz he said it was cracking in the

692
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,038
foundation I imagine that there bigger

693
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,679
problems there like what if water water

694
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:50,119
leaking in there too like flood in the

695
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,360
basement right if this cracks or what

696
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:54,959
probably you know I mean um I I think uh

697
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,398
I think when he I think when this guy

698
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,960
was looking for a house to rent he was

699
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:59,158
looking for cheap rent and he wasn't

700
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,558
really thinking

701
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,440
about you know the quality of the

702
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:05,879
foundation or you know obviously he

703
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,200
didn't even he didn't even line the

704
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,600
walls with poly or anything he just GW

705
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,798
it you

706
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:17,158
know which a lot of people would say is

707
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:19,119
a big no no um but everyone's a beginner

708
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,919
at some point so you make mistakes you

709
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:24,359
figure it out hopefully um hopefully you

710
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,038
learn fast and yeah so they went around

711
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:29,398
and they spray spray foamed it all in

712
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:30,919
and got all sealed up but yeah that was

713
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:33,359
that was a funny one so definitely

714
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,559
something to keep your eye on that's

715
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,719
somewhat unexpected you know yeah

716
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:40,440
checking for your light leaks going

717
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,038
outside just pretending pretending you

718
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,720
are your neighbor you know what are your

719
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,398
thoughts when you look at the house does

720
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,000

721
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:51,319

722

730
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:09,839
the country so the neighbors weren't on

731

little bit of trouble actually um

746
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,959
because of that reason there were no he

747
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:50,159
didn't use any carbon filters and um so

748
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,919
yeah kind of a bummer that's brutal now

749
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,360
that reminds me of a story when you were

750
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,200
over my house and we were trimming you

751
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:58,240
help trimming I appreciate your your

752
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:02,278
help there that was I I love trimming

753
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,798
dude I just I want to sit down for 16

754
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:07,200
hours but we were sitting down trimming

755
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:09,000
and we got we actually live streaming

756
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,240
this too this is back when I I live

757
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,038
streamed trimming and I had my Mr Grow

758
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,640
shirt on and I get a knock on the door

759
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:20,158
and we're trimming probably 15 ft from

760
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,640
the door and uh obviously the whole

761
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,278
house stinks right because there a Fresh

762
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,640
Harvest um well the dry we're actually

763
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:27,000
trimming at that point but this it still

764
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,000
stinks right the whole house stinks like

765
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,038
you mentioned before I open up the door

766
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,880
and I quickly exit the door because I

767
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,119
know it stinks on the inside and the

768
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,200
FedEx guy is there and he's like oh here

769
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,839
sign for this package and then he looks

770
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,200
at my shirt he notices my shirt he's

771
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:44,480
like oh that's what that smell

772
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,240
is like what does that mean like does he

773
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,440
does that mean he knew who you were from

774
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,919
YouTube or no no I think he just like my

775
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,240
logo has like the leaf on it and grow it

776
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,120
and so like he put two and two together

777
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,599
there anyways it was kind of awkward I

778
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:01,199
signed for the package then went went in

779
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:03,278
there and I was like man H smells

780
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,558
escaping and I've had friends and stuff

781
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,359
come over before and like dude I can

782
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,558
smell it from the street like oh God you

783
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:11,240
know so it's like sometimes I feel like

784
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,480
I do need to do a better job of of

785
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,278
hiding the smell I think that's only

786
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,558
really been though Harvest you know when

787
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,359
I'm drying things are harvested things

788
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:21,678
are hanging for dry I think that's when

789
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,519
it really really stinks because it's in

790
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,320
when it's in flower I do have the

791
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,599
exhaust going up into my attic and out

792
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:30,119
the roof so you can't really smell it

793
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:32,158
down at street level but hey when I'm

794
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,599
harvesting I'm trimming on on floor

795
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,159
level well then um yeah unfortunately it

796
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:38,319
escapes all the way to the roll Road for

797
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,399
me dude next time we're just we'll have

798
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:43,319
to go on your

799
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:45,959
attic be crumped up in there

800
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:48,480
yeah um no I'm glad you brought that up

801
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,919
cuz I I one of my notes Here was um you

802
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,798
know if you're if you're in a place and

803
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,278
you're you're kind of tone align and and

804
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:55,839
you're you got your smell under control

805
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:57,759
and it's all good and you're you got it

806
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:59,638
under control while you're you're uh

807
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,679
opening the tent whatever but you know

808
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:03,479
when it comes to that trimming and

809
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,159
harvesting it's really hard to to to

810
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,319
control it and so sometimes the best

811
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,600
move is to just take it somewhere else

812
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:15,519
trim it somewhere else you know um

813
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:16,839
because it's it's tough uh you can you

814
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,120
can keep your negative pressure and you

815
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:19,959
can keep your car filter going and

816
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:21,719
everything but you know one small

817
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,759
mistake you open the door whatever and

818
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,079
it's

819
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:28,119
just so if you can take it somewhere

820
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,439
else to trim and Harvest and stuff

821
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:32,439
that's safe and secure and everything um

822
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,200
that's an option too good point yeah

823
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,200
because at that point it's really hard

824
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,319
to hide it from your roommates or family

825
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,798
members and and maybe we talk about that

826
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:43,918
next you know how do you hide it from

827
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:46,558
your roommates or family members people

828
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,159
living in the same house as you how

829
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,960
would you go about hiding it so this is

830
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:52,679
tough right this is a good time for one

831
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,360
of my one of my friends Ryan has this

832
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,320
really good quote and the quote is

833
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:58,479
there's nothing sketchier than a sketchy

834
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:01,879
guy acting

835
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,558
sketchy so the number one thing is to

836
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,600
don't act sketchy the number two thing

837
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,558
is if you're living with people who are

838
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:13,599
like aware you're probably going to have

839
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:16,519
a really tough time to to hide it I

840
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:19,480
mean I I don't want to say it's

841
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,919
impossible it's not impossible but it's

842
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,120
going to be really tough um and one of

843
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,919
the one of the ways that people are

844
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,918
doing it and I kind of just discovered

845
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:30,038
this when I was um refresh in for this

846
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,799
this podcast was they got these things

847
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:33,679
called space buckets did you end up

848
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:35,679
checking that website out yep I've heard

849
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,919
of space buckets and I saw that website

850
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,080
you sent me I never I never heard of

851
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,240
those and I was looking at them and

852
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:43,759
there's a whole radit Community about

853
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,319
space buckets and people are taking five

854
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,079
gallon buckets and they're just growing

855
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:49,359
like one little plant in this 5 gallon

856
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:51,599
bucket and they've got uh they'll hook

857
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,199
up a a fan and a carbon filter to it and

858
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:57,959
everything and so I think that's an

859
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,278
actual realistic way um to grow at home

860
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,519
without people you're living with

861
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,440
noticing if you're going to if you're

862
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:05,000
going to take a stab at it but still you

863
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,600
know you might have you might just have

864
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,960
to trim and harvest somewhere else

865
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:11,278
unless you can really figure out the

866
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,600
carbon filter negative pressure lung

867
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:15,159
room type strategy for the odors other

868
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,158
than the space buckets you know back in

869
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,840
the day there were there were these like

870
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:21,799
uh fake computer boxes they used to sell

871
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,678
you remember those oh yeah yeah they

872
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:26,000
didn't even come with a carbon filter

873
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,600
there was just like a there's just like

874
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,839
a a regular computer fan on the back you

875
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:32,759
know and they just can't even imagine

876
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,319
how many of those sold uh back in the

877
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:37,638
day but like even with something like

878
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:40,439
that like it's just going to leak smell

879
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:43,959
right out the back and it's tough to

880
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,000
control odors with a quiet fan too right

881
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,360
because the reason you got to use those

882
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,798
inline fans uh with the carbon filters

883
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:53,158
is because a a regular like booster fan

884
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:56,638
a small quiet fan doesn't have enough

885
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:59,120
power to get the air through the carbon

886
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:00,519
um the the carbon restricts the air flow

887
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,000
so much that's why you got to use one of

888
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:05,638
those powerful fans so so I would say I

889
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,919
would say this if you know

890
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:10,239
when someone at your house is going to

891
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,358
be home those are the times where you

892
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,598
want your light off um you want your fan

893
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:17,799
on a low

894
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,039
setting uh and those things go hand in

895
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,000
hand right because your when your lights

896
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:23,279
on your fan usually has to be on at a

897
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,918
higher setting to control the heat when

898
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,280
the lights off you can keep the fan at a

899
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:28,799
lower setting so you're getting a you're

900
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,560
solving the light problem by just having

901
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,919
it off during those period during that

902
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:37,719
time uh you get the lower noise from the

903
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:40,878
fan but it's obviously it's still on so

904
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:44,000
you get your negative pressure um if

905
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,639
you're not using a uh a space bucket or

906
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,280
kind of some little homemade hidden

907
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,919
thing you know they've got like stealth

908
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,919
closets and all this stuff

909
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:55,319
that some of it's pretty gimmicky um but

910
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,279
you know if you're going to use a

911
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,079
regular like 2x4 grow tent you know

912
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,440
maybe you can play it off as a clothing

913
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:03,000
just a it's just a a portable closet

914
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,519
Clothing Closet I don't know I don't

915
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,679
know how long you get away with that for

916
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:09,280
but you know you can try the Ona blocks

917
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:11,279
and stuff like that but even that might

918
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,519
be a little weird like you know hey why

919
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,040
is uh why is our one roommate's room

920
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:20,519
always smell like

921
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:22,119
this weird block odor like or like so

922
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:28,199
it's tough those are some things that

923
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:29,240
you can do to make it easier um reducing

924
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:31,639
the amount of things that you're

925
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:34,319
bringing in and out of the house so like

926
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:36,679
trying to reuse your soil or cocoa

927
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,838
buying things keeping it small buying

928
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:43,039
things in small quantities you know re

929
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:44,440
reusing your your uh delivery boxes um

930
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,079
to put things in so you can just you

931
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,599
know Walt them in and and and it's not

932
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:51,359
some like you know sketchy black garbage

933
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,720
bag or whatever things like that you

934
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,880
know you're not going to be able to or

935
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,879
you're going to have a really tough time

936
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:00,400
trying to Lug a CO2 tank by when you got

937
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,200
roommates um so just keeping it small

938
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,160
and maybe maybe this doesn't have to do

939
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:06,279
with roommates but you really have to be

940
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:08,440
careful about who you tell and who you

941
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,359
trust right every friend has a friend

942
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,800
that they tell your secrets to I'm sure

943
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:13,318
there's like a few friends in everyone's

944
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,760
life where they can like absolutely

945
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:19,759
trust but for the most part every best

946
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,720
friend has a best friend and secrets

947
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,119
just get shared so you really have

948
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:27,358
to uh choose who you're who you're

949
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,318
telling about it that's about it and and

950
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:32,559
and I guess like I guess the final kind

951
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:35,358
of thing to talk about when it comes to

952
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:37,639
roommates is is is are you a good

953
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:40,239
roommate are you being a good roommate

954
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:43,239
to your roommates do you uh clean up

955
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:46,598
after yourself do you respect them

956
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:48,799
between with not having it stinky and

957
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:51,559
not being noisy or whatever like it can

958
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,039
go a long way especially you

959
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,519
know say you are growing and your

960
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:58,159
roommate eventually finds it and you may

961
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:00,280
not want to even do that without talking

962
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,318
to them first but if you already did and

963
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,800
then they find out later and they're mad

964
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:08,639
at you that it it it might not be as bad

965
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,119
if you were a good roommate beforehand

966
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:11,879
but if you're if you're a pain in the

967
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:14,160
butt and and you don't have a good

968
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,760
relationship with your roommates and

969
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:19,358
then and then they find out that you're

970
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,319
growing in the closet well you're going

971
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:22,759
to be in

972
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:25,199
trouble so uh my my note was the

973
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,160
Compromise right um I think that's the

974
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,039
best thing if you can compromise

975
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:30,639
with your roommates ahead of time and be

976
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,119
honest and upfront with them so you just

977
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:36,039
don't have to hide it uh it might be

978
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:39,200
harder to do that with your mom or your

979
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:41,279
family but that's kind of that's kind of

980
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,639
my thought process on that and same with

981
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,160
neighbors right like if you're a good

982
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,440
neighbor and you're nice and you're

983
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,358
friendly and something goes wrong or or

984
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,720
whatever they get annoyed maybe they're

985
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:51,679
going to come and knock on your door and

986
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:55,318
give you a heads up before they do

987
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:58,199
anything crazy or you know good point I

988
00:37:55,318 --> 00:38:01,318
know when it comes to keeping it stealth

989
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:03,559
from family friends roommates you know

990
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:05,960
people living with you I know plenty of

991
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,358
people have kind of built out sections

992
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,880
in their closet they built sections in

993
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:13,559
their basement in their attic to where

994
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,599
they've kind of boxed off areas a garage

995
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:18,519
as well but they've really boxed off an

996
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,559
area and made it so you can't really see

997
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:23,039
there's a door anywhere right so like a

998
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,679
Stealth door that they they're able to

999
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,159
kind of open up and then get in there

1000
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:27,919
and of course hiding the smell and light

1001
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,559
and all that stuff but yeah finding a

1002
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,440
section in the home to where you can

1003
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,279
kind of box off and prevent anybody from

1004
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,599
even realizing that there's a an area

1005
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,560
there I think that's probably one of the

1006
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:41,400
most common ways to hide it from family

1007
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:43,880
or or roommates yeah and that actually

1008
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,880
reminds me of a of a guy um a different

1009
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,240
guy from The Girl shop who's I had the

1010
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,160
pleasure of going to his house and he

1011
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:52,000
had a um he had a workbench that he had

1012
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,000
built you know and it had a big giant

1013
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,920
back on it that he hung all his tools on

1014
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,239
but it was on caster wheels but the

1015
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,159
Caster wheel were hidden with a with

1016
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:01,639
like a 2x6 in front of them so you don't

1017
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,920
you looking at it you don't even know

1018
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:07,838
it's on Wheels but then he he goes up to

1019
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,318
it he pulls it it opens up behind it is

1020
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:14,000
a poly zipper door and boom you walk in

1021
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:16,480
and it's just like whoa dude it was it

1022
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,639
was really cool man it's like some 07

1023
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,440
that's awesome yeah I've seen so many

1024
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:21,400
creative things I'm sure there's a whole

1025
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,519
there's probably a whole Reddit section

1026
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,720
on keeping it stealth gardening I

1027
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,318
imagine because people get creative and

1028
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:29,480
it comes down to the DIY thing like you

1029
00:39:27,318 --> 00:39:32,559
mentioned before kind of learning how to

1030
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,519
do things yourself it's fun it's fun man

1031
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,719
you know like when I saw that door I was

1032
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:39,838
like uh are we going to Harry Potter

1033
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:42,759
land like am I going to end up

1034
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:45,078
at what's on the other side here that's

1035
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,640
funny so is there any other tips for

1036
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:49,640
keeping it stealth when growing indoors

1037
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:51,838
don't forget about the smell of your um

1038
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:53,400
nutrients and soil and stuff anyone

1039
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,279
who's walked in a grow store you know

1040
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,000
you know that smell those are organic

1041
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,599
nutrients and soils like like they might

1042
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:04,079
not smell like a medicinal plants but

1043
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:06,480
it's it's got a strong odor and so

1044
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,960
keeping those things in your tent if you

1045
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,240
have room or just in a place that has uh

1046
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,559
Odor Control it's definitely a good idea

1047
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:17,439
having one of your buddies come over who

1048
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:19,000
knows uh what you're doing and just

1049
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,280
having them like hey I want you to just

1050
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,960
walk into my house and just like just

1051
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,880
pretend like you just don't know that

1052
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,358
I'm growing anything and I just want you

1053
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,960
to to let me know like is there anything

1054
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:31,759
do you smell anything do you hear

1055
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,800
anything do you see anything it's always

1056
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,400
good to get the the input of of someone

1057
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,800
else because if you're hanging out there

1058
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,880
all the time you know it might not smell

1059
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,560
to you but it might smell to someone uh

1060
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,000
who's not hanging out in an indoor

1061
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:47,838
garden all day so yeah the being aware

1062
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,838
of the nutrients and the smell

1063
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,759
particularly with the organic inputs I

1064
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:54,239
thought that was a good one there I've

1065
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,960
used build AOL craft blend for many many

1066
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:59,159
years and um one of the things in there

1067
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,639
I think it's the it's see the fish meal

1068
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:03,159
I believe is in there man it stinks it's

1069
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:05,318
like really like once I do that top

1070
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:08,440
dressing those first couple days it

1071
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:10,480
really really stinks and so that can

1072
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,880
kind of cause a red flag so yeah I like

1073
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,519
that one good point there yeah totally

1074
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,318
and it's often overlooked you know you

1075
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:18,880
don't even think about it um cuz there's

1076
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:20,838
so many different moving parts and stuff

1077
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,920
that you are thinking about so it's easy

1078
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:24,880
to overlook that one but another one I

1079
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,240
have here is

1080
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,960
traffic you really really don't want

1081
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:31,879
people coming in and out of your house

1082
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,480
uh all day long if that's where you're

1083
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,440
gardening uh for many many different

1084
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,440
reasons you know there's a there's a

1085
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,358
another good quote don't poop where you

1086
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,240
eat and I think that that kind of

1087
00:41:40,358 --> 00:41:46,239
applies to that really well so uh that's

1088
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:48,078
another one and then something else uh

1089
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:50,118
emergencies right we didn't really talk

1090
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,200
about emergencies yet

1091
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:54,800
and you know oh no the water meter guy

1092
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,879
wants to come in and take a reading off

1093
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,839
my water meter and I'm 7 weeks into

1094
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,400
flower what do I do um you got to have a

1095
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:04,519
plan for that uh you should have a you

1096
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,358
should have an emergency plan uh written

1097
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:11,838
out and and uh everyone who lives with

1098
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:14,519
you should should know what the plan is

1099
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:17,719
um so you can enact it if the Water Guy

1100
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:20,119
does have to come in or uh you know

1101
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:22,000
whatever and that's and sometimes you

1102
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:24,079
know that's when you just light up and

1103
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,920
the whole place just smells like a cloud

1104
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,480
instead of a instead of an active

1105
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,039
growing plant and oh maybe your plan

1106
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,960
includes getting everything out of the

1107
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:36,318
house you know a guy told me a story

1108
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:37,960
once that um I forget what happened but

1109
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:39,759
you know his landlord or whatever like

1110
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,720
had to come to the house he took all the

1111
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,800
plants out of the basement put them on

1112
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:45,598
the roof and just had him on the roof of

1113
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,400
the house while the guy was working in

1114
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,160
the basement I was like that seems risky

1115
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,240
but it

1116
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:54,719
worked so that was a funny one um

1117
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:56,759
another thing in related to emergencies

1118
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,639
is if you're using like any type of

1119
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,400
automated watering systems or you have

1120
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:03,440
like a a reservoir of water going or

1121
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,240
anything like that um making sure that

1122
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,599
you're protected from

1123
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:09,639
floods the last thing you want to do is

1124
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,720
have uh a flood from your irrigation

1125
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:15,358
system or whatever you know ruin the

1126
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:17,318
floor or just you know create any

1127
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,440
problem that you may have to deal with

1128
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:21,358
your your landlord or or whatever just

1129
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,400
anyone most grow tents come with a flood

1130
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,000
tray which is pretty suitable I mean I

1131
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,318
think they come up what four to 6 Ines

1132
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,519
on each Edge um um I mean they can hold

1133
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:30,960
a lot of water uh but if you're doing

1134
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,440
like a whole bedroom or something you

1135
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,679
can get giant tarps fold them in half

1136
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,920
run them up the walls a little bit uh

1137
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:42,159
nail 2x4s to the walls around to hold it

1138
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,440
up you know and then you just have a big

1139
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:48,358
giant flood barrier essentially and it's

1140
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,920
uh it's really just an insurance policy

1141
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:52,119
dehumidifiers

1142
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,240
so obviously we know like there's a lot

1143
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:58,318
of humidity that comes with gardening um

1144
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:59,439
your water in the plants they're it can

1145
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:01,519
just you can get a real human

1146
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,880
environment real easily and and that can

1147
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:06,199
damage drywall it can damage paint um if

1148
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,519
it's not under

1149
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:09,639
control and if you're uh renting a place

1150
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:10,719
and you want to get your security

1151
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:12,920
deposit

1152
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,519
back you're not going to want to ruin

1153
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,639
the paint in the drywall and stuff so

1154
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:20,719
having a dehumidifier and just keeping

1155
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:23,440
you know keeping that on your mind um is

1156
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:25,279
another is another big thing and and on

1157
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,960
that topic say you got to screw a bunch

1158
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,400
of stuff to the seat ceing and and you

1159
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,079
don't want to damage the ceiling or or

1160
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,838
you got to screw a bunch of the wall you

1161
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,359
can just screw a

1162
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:36,799
2x4 that way you're putting one two

1163
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:39,759
three four screws in maybe five six

1164
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:43,079
screws in to the 2x4 and then you can

1165
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,240
screw things to the 2x4 without damaging

1166
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,960
uh the wall behind as much you maybe it

1167
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:48,679
doesn't have anything with stealth

1168
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,838
growing but for getting your security

1169
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:52,719
deposit back and just having less you

1170
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:55,078
know cleanup work to do lots of great

1171
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:57,399
points there on keeping things stealth

1172
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:59,039

1184
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:19,759
mention the electric bill we didn't

1185
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,240
mention that oh yeah we didn't talk

1186
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,200
about electricity people who are worried

1187
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:24,519
about the electric bill um we don't have

1188
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,099
to go into it but I can tell you one

1189
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:28,480
thing don't steal power

1190
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:30,039
[Laughter]

1191
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,440
well these days with the lights being so

1192
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:35,480
efficient I mean if you're doing a I

1193
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,318
think my bill when I'm running 210 is

1194
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,679
like 30 bucks a month you know so it's

1195
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,679
not too brutal back in the day when

1196
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:44,318
you're running th watts and you're

1197
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:45,879
running four five six lights well that

1198
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:48,000
adds up right then it's hundreds of

1199
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,720
dollars per month easily yeah those old

1200
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,920
ballasts use more amps than the LED um

1201
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:56,719
ball are using nowadays too so not as as

1202
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,960
