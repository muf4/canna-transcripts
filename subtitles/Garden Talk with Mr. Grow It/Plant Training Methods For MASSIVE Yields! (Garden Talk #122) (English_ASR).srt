salabim that's an old Johnny Carson

74
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,840
reference I don't know where that came

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,598
from but if you're over 45 you may

76
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,800

that yeah I have no idea what that

78
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,560
is Johnny Carson used to do a bit called

79

the Great carnap back where you might

80
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,239
remember this where he wore a a gold

81
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,040
lame turban and uh he would give you the

82
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,480
answer to the question before the

83
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,919
question was read and he would he would

84
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,119
hold the question up and he would tell

85
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:16,238
you what the answer was and then he

86
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,878
would open the envelope and reverse

87
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,120

section below but I finally got you on

104
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,359
my podcast and we're going to talk about

105
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,719
I was trying to figure out what we would

106
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,200
talk about there's there so many

107
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:59,158
different Avenues we can go we're going

108
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,598
to go plant training but you know we can

109
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,759
also go PL old I have such a legacy just

110
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,119
way too much to choose from exactly no

111
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,598
there was so many different Avenues we

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,360
could go I mean breeding was one of the

113
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:09,399
ones I really thought about but I was

114
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,920
like you know what let's keep it with

115
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,760
the training first you have do a variety

116
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,199
of training techniques you have your own

117
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,639
really signature training technique

118
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,399
which we'll get into but we're going to

119
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,359
keep things very Elementary this time

120
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,519
around right so very beginner focused

121
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,879
we're going to talk about plant training

122
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,800
methods and the focus on really much

123
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,240
increasing yield I know not all plant

124
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,319
training methods are done to increase

125
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,160
yield but you can certainly get a larger

126
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,199
yield from doing some of these plant

127
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,360
training methods but before we get too

128
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,720
deep into the episode can you do an

129
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,680
introduction tell us a little bit about

130
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,080
yourself and how you got into gardening

131
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,439
oh that's good I'm glad you focused that

132
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,800
question like you were GNA ask me about

133
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,399
tell me about yourself and I was like

134
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,120
you know I was born in a little Shack in

135
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:54,758
soset long you know yes how did I get

136
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,319
into growing that's a good question um

137
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:01,319
it's really a good question so this was

138
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:04,279
about uh 19

139
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:07,519
87 this is about uh three years after I

140
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:10,879
would have graduated high school and um

141
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,839
I had a pod I was I was a pod dealer and

142
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,360
um I had a job and I was a pod I was a

143
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,918
pod dealer like you know you're you're a

144
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,439
local pod dealer you know that you know

145
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:19,918
you went over to his house and you hung

146
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:23,680
out and you smoked a joint you picked up

147
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:26,478
a bag of and you went away and uh the

148
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,439
guy who supplied to

149
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,038
me I had just moved into a new uh I got

150
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,519
a really cool apartment it was actually

151
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,439
a condo with a walk-in closet he comes

152
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:40,439
over to visit me and I show him around

153
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:42,319
my house and he says yo if you let me

154
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,240
grow in your closet I'll split it with

155
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:49,400
you and literally at this point I had

156
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,600
never even like I had never even uh

157
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:54,439
visualized that you could grow indoors

158
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,639

00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,478
every PL food and fiber plant and I just

163
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,359

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,280
a couple of containers of powders and a

167
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:20,560
little pH test kit and a

168
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:22,719
light and and I grew and so so now the

169
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,918
whole idea was to produce the product

170
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,560
rather than have to like get it from

171
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:30,000
Mexico or

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,079
Colombia and that was how I got into

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,319
growing because my dealer was

174
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:36,758
unsuccessful in his attempts he tried

175
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,280
several times he got caught by I believe

176
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,879
his mother growing in his house and then

177
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,038
he grow at his brother's house and his

178
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,959
wife caught them and then he came to me

179
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,719
and he was like and and yeah that's

180
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,879
that's how I was introduced to grow

181
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,680
that's awesome and you come so far since

182
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,000
then I mean you've been a writer for

183
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,400
High Times magazine for over 20 years

184
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,759
I'm Oak University you've got a place

185
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,839
there you've won several cup Awards can

186
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,439
you kind of get into some of those

187
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,079
things no it was just a it was just a

188
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,399
journey of really just putting one foot

189
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:11,279
in front of the other you know um it

190
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:13,758
really wasn't until um I met High Times

191
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,598
which was a complete accident uh not

192
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,800
that I met well yeah it wasn't until I

193
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,120
met High Times that I thought that

194
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,560
anything was ever going to come of this

195
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,160
except I was going to end up in jail one

196
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,240
day eventually you're going to get

197
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,879
caught selling or now growing or dealing

198
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,439
or eventually you're going to end up in

199
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,240
jail one day and uh that's what my mom

200
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,199
thought and it was never happy thought

201
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,918
and then one day I walked into a head

202
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:38,598
shop a tie-dye shop called Not Fade Away

203
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,878
tie-dye in News New York and uh the

204
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:41,680
owner there asked he said I'm going to

205
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,680
close up for lunch you want to smoke a

206
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,800
joint with

207
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,519
me sure and then I went to reciprocate

208
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,478
and I pulled out my weed I showed him my

209
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,959
weed and he was like oh my God he's like

210
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,758
you ever wanted thought about wanting to

211
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,918
be in High Times magazine my girlfriend

212
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,280
knows somebody there and there he goes

213
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,120
then I met High Times magazine that's a

214
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,439
long that that's a long story right

215
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:07,038
there I mean I I dropped out of high

216
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:09,598
school and um I got my GED and joined

217
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,598
the army and I I really literally like

218
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,719
loathed reading and writing it wasn't

219
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:18,000
something that I ever did for pleasure

220
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,080
but then when somebody offered me a

221
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,519
job all of a sudden I was

222
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:25,038
like I'm G to try to kick this in the

223
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,240
ass and that's what I did I kicked it in

224
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:31,519
the ass and the first 12 months I had 13

225
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,000
features I had 13 pieces in 12 issues in

226
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,079
the first year and that secured my job

227
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,559
there and and then I just continued to

228
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,120
learn more you know about the whole the

229
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,199
culture all of a sudden I was an

230
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,240
advocate you know I like I took a job as

231
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,920
a journalist which I was really proud

232
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,278
and honored to have and I figured and I

233
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,559
found out that I could do that and then

234
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,039
along with that which I'd never realized

235
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:55,439
came this

236
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,799
advocacy

237
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,880
which I'm a very intentioned person I'm

238
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:04,559
a very purposeful person I don't do

239
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:06,278
things incidentally and and then I

240
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:10,639
realized that this was another great

241
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:12,519
intention and I I took that on

242
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,958
wholeheartedly and then started

243
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:18,600
traveling the country first and the

244
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:21,359
world and meeting all these amazing

245
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,959
illuminaries you know from Keith stra

246
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,278
from the the director of normal and and

247
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,559
the early days of the Hempfest Vivian MC

248
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,240
PE and the peace heathens and and all of

249
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,039
a sudden I'm in the plan rooms with all

250
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,959
these people these amazing events and

251
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:39,599
I'm just

252
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:43,439
like I was I was I had never felt

253
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,959
anything similar to how honored and

254
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,279
overwhelmed I was with um a feeling of

255
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:54,479
purpose when all of

256
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:56,799
this just evolved I mean like it it I

257
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,120
could write a movie or a book about that

258
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,439
subject

259
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,240
about me that's it's pretty much the

260
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,200
whole ball of wax it's like why am I

261
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,720
still here why are we talking to Kyle

262
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,079
kushman right it's it's all wrapped up

263
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:15,399
in that um not just the fact that I the

264
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:18,519
door opened I put my foot in it and and

265
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:22,759
gave it my all but then that I took

266
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:25,519
on Happily the whole advocacy thing and

267
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:28,240
this the normalization and the

268
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,360
legalization and it's just it's just a

269

289
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:20,679
your style are you indoor outdoor

290
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:23,759
organic synthetic soil cocoa so I am a

291
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:26,159
homeg growner you know um I don't have a

commercial company I don't have a

293
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:33,799
commercial branded line um of course I

294
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:37,919
represent homegrown go very happily um

295
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:40,759
but I'm just a homeg grower and I put my

296
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:44,639
my hom grow online on my Instagram and I

297
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:46,159
share it with people and um and and yeah

298
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,680
that's where I'm at you know I've I've

299
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:51,039
done I've done and seen it all pretty

300
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,559
much from the the containers the 40 foot

301
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,838
containers buried in the ground up in

302
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:58,879
spyrock and meno with the

303
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:02,920
generators and you know garages and

304
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:05,679
bedro rooms and warehouses with 250

305
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,399
lights but now I'm I'm lucky I've ruined

306
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,559
my home for a 10x10 so I have a nice

307
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:14,759
10x10 with four LEDs all adjustable and

308
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:18,039
all climate controlled and uh I try to

309
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,720
keep it as non-consuming as possible

310
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:22,278
yeah I'm just like you homeg grower I

311
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,519
can max out of 12 plants here so pretty

312
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:25,159
fortunate I know some of the states are

313
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,720
can only max out at six so I feel

314
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:30,679
fortunate that I can do up to 12 and um

315
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,320
yeah really fun so I think we relate a

316
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:34,879
lot on that we're indoor homeg grower so

317
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,760
on and so forth now you are you in soil

318
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,879
or coco primarily what do you do there

319
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:44,319
you know I only gave soil a couple of

320
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:46,799
runs and I just I I I was I was never

321
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:52,399
ready to make the transformation the

322
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:55,078
whole shift in my head to it um I'm um

323
00:12:52,399 --> 00:13:00,078
the only thing I can say about Coco

324
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:03,278
versus uh swagnum Coco Blends or you

325
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:05,638
know predominantly swagnum soiless is I

326
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,759
find that um they're more consistent

327
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,680
throughout in other words it doesn't the

328
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,519
I find Coco changes its properties a

329
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,958
little bit at some point when all of a

330
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,759
sudden it breaks down now that might

331
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,039
have

332
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:20,159
been old cocoa like you know not your

333
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:23,198
grandpa's cocoa and maybe theyve uh but

334
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:25,600
I always found that it was a little uh

335
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:29,919
less consistent as far as the uptake and

336
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,920
the release of actual nutrients um

337
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:35,399
so I've always just stuck with soil

338
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:39,319
soiless um and um I like using a higher

339
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,839
pH I like a pH closer to seven than six

340
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,360
got it so pretty straightforward there

341
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,639
all right let's uh let's get into the

342
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,639
meat and potatoes of this what

343
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,839
everybody's been waiting for training

344
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,480
plants so like I mentioned earlier we're

345
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,320
going to keep it pretty Elementary here

346
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,240
let's start from the beginning what does

347
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,800
it mean to train plants and what are the

348
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,879
benefits well basically you know there's

349
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:03,198
very few um agriculture natural crops

350
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,679
just as a comparison that in the in in

351
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,559
performing their duties that they don't

352
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,319
train in some aspect uh a good thing to

353
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,799
look at is when I moved to meno I

354
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,800
noticed all the grape Vines and every

355
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,879
year they harvest the grapes and then

356
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:18,719
they literally cut the vines back to

357
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:21,000
vert to nothing to the stump and they

358
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,199
regrow all the vines every from the

359
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,120
spring through the summer and uh that's

360
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,838
because they're directing the energy to

361
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,000
the fruits they know how much fruit they

362
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,079
want to get

363
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,559
versus you know you can control the

364
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:39,479
cluster of the grapes by how much

365
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,679
vegetation is ends up at the end of the

366
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,039
time when the fruit set happens it's the

367
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:47,319
same kind of thing

368
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:50,679
with and so if you just left a plant

369
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,278
under its own devices you would have

370
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:55,559
less

371
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:57,679
nodes and uh less flowering sites and

372
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:02,919
they'd be more spread out over different

373
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:06,359
various Heights and so by training or

374
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:07,919
supercropping uh whether it's um low

375
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,680
stress training or whether it's high

376
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,559
stress training you're you're taking the

377
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:16,599
opportunity to manipulate the plant

378
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:19,000
and uh decide on the number of flowering

379
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,800
sites you want in relation to the plant

380
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,159
size and also you know how long your

381
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:29,799
whole crop cycle is so it gives you the

382
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:32,679
ultimate control um and um you know it's

383
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:34,919
not as complicated as I just made it

384
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:37,318
sound now I think another good example

385
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,000
is fruit trees right so like uh fruit

386
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:40,399
trees you can let them grow wild right

387
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,039
but a lot of people have that one main

388
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,120
trunk that comes up right and then the

389
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:47,439
top branches are all fruits it's pruned

390
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,159
that way it's trained that way in order

391
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,399
to try to get the highest health

392
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:53,039
possible of fruit so uh we do the same

393
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,039
thing with these medicinal plants The

394
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:58,198
Orchards you'll see they they harvest

395
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:00,360
them and then within a month or so they

396
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:01,599
go back and they trim them all down so

397
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,800
they look like they've all got a pretty

398
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,319
little haircut so that they roughly get

399
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:10,159
the same number same size of fruit you

400
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:12,360
know maybe add per for growth but uh

401
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:16,240
yeah it's very important to uh to

402
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:19,720
maximize growth and to minimize vertical

403
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,159
height and to maximize we usually most

404
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,920
people will run out of horizontal height

405
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,120
before uh vertical height I'm sorry

406
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,479
vertical height before they run out of

407
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,159
horizontal height in a home

408
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,120
oh yeah absolutely so when it comes to

409
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,039
these medicinal plants talking about

410
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,120
yield how much higher of a yield can you

411
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,679
get from a trained plant versus an

412
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,440
untrained plant that just grows

413
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:47,519
naturally um another analogy so you know

414
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,480
if you have a plant

415
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,480
that is

416
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,240
leaning maybe you look at it you can

417
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,399
tell it needs a steak or something like

418
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,360
that right a plant that is staked rather

419
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:03,639
than a plant that is leaning will always

420
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,639
grow faster okay

421
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:11,918
so by providing certain um support and

422
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:15,480
uh and uh

423
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,759
limiting the growth underneath uh nodes

424
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,199
that are never going to get developed

425
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,959
branches that are never going to see the

426
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,240
light of day you're increasing your

427
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,078
yield right

428
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,798
there okay that's that's uh Far and

429
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,798
Beyond when you get into even just um

430
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:35,679
the

431
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:37,639
exposure of the nodes or increasing the

432
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,679
uh uh capacity for the plant to uptake

433
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,280
nutrients and or water by bending and

434
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,798
breaking and things like that real you

435
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:52,879
know severe things so um it's really um

436
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:54,720
it's exponential you can do one uh

437
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,080
technique and it's going to help some

438
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,319
you can do two techniques it's going to

439
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,960
help a little more you do three

440
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:02,798
techniques all of a sudden you're going

441
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,759
to see a substantial increase in yield I

442
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,879
completely agree and I I think that also

443
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,038
goes down to how long you're vegging

444
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,480
these plants how big are these plants

445
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:12,000
you actually growing right I mean if

446
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,519
you're keeping things small just doing a

447
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,240
30 40-day veg me personally my

448
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:19,158
experience I've grown a untrained plant

449
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,279
right next to a plant that I've trained

450
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,320
and I went from 5 ounces to 8 ounces so

451
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:26,200
I got 3 ounces more from that train

452
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:27,720
plant so yes you can certainly in my

453
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,919
experience just keeping a small hom

454
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,919
growth style can certainly have several

455
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,559
additional ounces just from training

456
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,600
your plants so I think that's one of the

457
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,480
reasons why people practice it so much

458
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:41,319
one thing that I did learn pretty

459
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:46,000
recently just in in last few years of um

460
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:49,158
touring uh large grov uh Santa Barbara

461
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,960
and something like that I noticed a

462
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,280
guy who of course you know they need

463
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,759
thousands and thousands of clones you

464
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,319
know to to to do these Acres of outdoor

465
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:02,879
green houses or even hybrid green houses

466
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,918
and I noticed that you know um you know

467
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,559
when I take clones I probably take four

468
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,080
five even 6 inch clones because I have

469
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:11,158
all these I can bury it a couple of

470
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:13,359
inches and I'm going to top and do all

471
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:14,919
these things but you know when you take

472
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:16,798
commercial agricultural clones they're

473
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,440
usually pretty small they're usually two

474
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:23,319
to three inch clones and what I was

475
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,480
noticing was that basically as soon as

476
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:30,279
they had grown an inch and rooted they

477
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,839
were topping them and I asked him I said

478
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:34,519
do you really do you do that all the

479
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:37,720
time do you top your clones so early and

480
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:40,038
he explained to me how this is a really

481
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,079
important technique because I used to

482
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:45,599
wait until the plan was virtually

483
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:49,038
developed like fifth node seventh node

484
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:51,399
uh you know multiple sets of full leaves

485
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,240
and branching already coming out then

486
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,280
I'd use this spiral staircase technique

487
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,759
where I take a leaf from each side to

488
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,519
open it up no top your plants as soon as

489
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,480
possible because what that's going to do

490
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,759
is as soon as you top them it's going to

491
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,079
uh encourage lateral branching and now

492
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,200
your lateral branching is going to be

493
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:15,359
the height of your plant instead of

494
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,600
having any apical top whatsoever

495
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,279
virtually so that's something that I did

496
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:22,079
learn early is top as early as you are

497
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:23,440
comfortable with and so topping for

498
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,279
those that don't know is really just

499
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,880
taking the top of the plan and either

500
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,440
pinching it off or using trimmers to

501
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:35,880
trim it off to you a a pincher or a

502
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,000
cutter I've always been a pincher um uh

503
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,799
you

504
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,038
know I I never had any trouble

505
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:43,879
visualizing where I was supposed to do

506
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:47,480
that you know the top of the plant is

507
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,640
just simply the top of the plant and you

508
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:55,240
you should just take off a a burgeoning

509
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:58,400
newly opening set of leaves and pinch

510
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,558
and then of course there's that that old

511
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,240
um

512
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:04,720
technique that came about from a tip of

513
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:10,839
the month that I wrote in High Times

514
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:13,839
magazine that got uh labeled fine and I

515
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:15,678
love the fact I love this story

516
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:19,439
because

517
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:24,080
femming everybody would swear it means

518
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:27,038
bleep I missed missed right because the

519
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,519
theory was that if you cut it cleanly

520
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,000
like with a scissor that it's just it's

521
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,759
not going to grow back and then the two

522
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,038
uh nodes that would have popped out on

523
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,558
the side of the stem is what's going to

524
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,079
take over and you have a nice clean V

525
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:41,639
but if you kind of mess it up and make

526
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:44,678
it all messy

527
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,360
uh sometimes very often nodes will shoot

528
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:49,120
out of there in addition and sometimes

529
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:50,599
there three four five crazy numbers of

530
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,678
them shoot out depending on your growth

531
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:55,399
rate and

532
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,798
stuff but it was never intended to be

533
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,480
fimming the the the tip of the month

534
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:04,119
came from a dude who signed his letter

535
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,079
Thim I believe it was his name it was

536
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:10,199
from Thim didn't say anything about

537
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:12,038
missed just the culture itself attached

538
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,798
that acronym to it and I think that

539
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:15,038
that's

540
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:17,000
hilarious that is hilarious I had no

541
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,919
idea that was the case I heard the the f

542
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,880
I missed I heard that one but I didn't

543
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,400
hear about it actually being somebody's

544
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,159
initials or name or whatever yeah I love

545
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,798
that so when you do the topping or the

546
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,520
fiming what node are you waiting until

547
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,278
the plant has grown up to before you do

548
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:36,038
your first topping or fil well I used to

549
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:37,798
wait for five maybe even six or seven

550
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:39,440
complete sets which would mean that

551
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,879
you'd already had one or two sets of

552
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,000
branching coming out and so the top of

553
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,320
your plant

554
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,798
is it least several inches taller than

555
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:53,359
those side satellite

556
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:56,918
branches um and like I said what I saw

557
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:59,678
in a commercial setting was is that um

558
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:01,799
you know do it as soon as you know that

559
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,559
your plant is

560
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:08,519
flourishing um and that's going to allow

561
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:12,839
you to um have a wider plant rather than

562
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:14,079
a taller plant um because the the plant

563
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:17,519
is just

564
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:21,000
programmed to grow as tall as possible

565
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:23,679
because in the big bad jungle the actual

566
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,240
jungle where things grow the one who

567
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,759
grows the tallest gets the most sunlight

568
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,798
and very often ones that don't grow T

569
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:35,158
enough don't get any sunlight and

570
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:39,639
literally just croak and die so um so

571
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:41,440
yeah so I mean uh it's going to depend

572
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,080
on where you took your cutting but so

573
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,480
that's why I say it's not really it it

574
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:49,038
doesn't really matter the actual

575
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,360
maturity size of the plant how many

576
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,798
nodes it has what matters is is that

577
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:58,879
you've planted

578
00:23:52,798 --> 00:24:01,679
it and uh watered it and the roots that

579
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,278
were coming out of your clone are now

580
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,159
coming out of the media in which you

581
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:09,558
planted it as soon as you see that it's

582
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:12,120
acceptable to top it understood for me I

583
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:13,519
usually grow from seeds so I am kind of

584
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,319
one of the guys who are counting the

585
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,639
nodes and I usually do like the fourth

586
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:19,879
or the fifth now do you just do one

587
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,640
topping or do you do you know your

588
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,679
initial top and then top some of those

589
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,440
side branches that kind of grow up well

590
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,798
it kind of depends on whether you're um

591
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,159
you know if you're growing for

592
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:34,240
commercial um then you really try to

593
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:36,480
condense practices into the most

594
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,159
effective most efficient and I think

595
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,079
that that's probably a singular top and

596
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:45,320
probably a singular transplant you know

597
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:48,038
um into its final home when you have

598
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:50,119
options to you know I see these guys

599
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:52,200
growing on lines where they they

600
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:53,918
interweave the plants and they make them

601
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,319
look all pretty and they put them

602
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,320
through the chicken wire and you know

603
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:02,480
um

604
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:05,240
I think one top is is most of the time

605
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,399
is going to be access uh uh uh

606
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,000
sufficient um it's only when you and the

607
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:12,479
and I'll say the reason why I say that

608
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,038
is because by the time you get to the

609
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,960
thought of topping a second time on that

610
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:21,798
same plant I think that there's a better

611
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,038
way of utilizing that

612
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:28,599
vegetation than there is topping it off

613
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:32,119
um of course the secondary goal of

614
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:36,398
topping other than yield enhancement is

615
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:39,798
uh maximizing your uh the space that you

616
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:42,038
have and if that

617
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:44,398
top that you're thinking about topping

618
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:46,759
again is because if you bent it over or

619
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:50,038
tucked it under somewhere uh it would

620
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:51,558
just be uh growing outside of the ver

621
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:53,879
the horizontal space that you want for

622
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:56,038
that plant then you should take it off

623
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,760
um so that's you know that's my

624
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:00,679
explanation is is one one top should be

625
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,960
sufficient but if you feel like if

626
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:03,840
there's some satellites that are growing

627
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,798
out of the way and you don't think you

628
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,240
can weave it somewhere or put it

629
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:09,558
somewhere efficient then top it again

630
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,240
and of course the nodes will just take

631
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:16,839
the place um no

632
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:19,319
topping uh no topping once you flip

633
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:21,439
flowering unless you missed it you

634
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:23,359
should you should know by then whether

635
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,880
you want to use that piece of

636
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:29,439
vegetation to gain mature flowers or not

637
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,960
if you noticed a piece underneath that

638
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,159
you missed and it's not going to do it

639
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,079
get rid of it if you if something is

640
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:36,480
shooting up and you don't like it but

641
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:38,439
the best thing to do would be to bend

642
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,240
that down and just secure it with a

643
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,919
twist tie or a piece of string or super

644
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,399
cropping technique and then utilize that

645
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,960
vegetation rather than chop it off and

646
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,678
throw it in the garbage really good

647
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,399
advice there yeah and I'm with you on

648
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,840
the one top I've you know I've done it

649
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:55,439
so many ways over the years top once and

650
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,720
then tops those branches top those

651
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,640
branches again and I played around a lot

652
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,558
and I find myself in you know the past

653
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,840
five plus years really just doing that

654
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:05,599
one top letting those side branches come

655
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,759
out and then just doing low stress

656
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,278
training from there which we're going to

657
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,798
get into here in a little bit but uh but

658
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,200
yeah the one top one of the main reasons

659
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,480
why I do is just to get that side

660
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,440
branching there's some fenos out there

661
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,000
that I'll grow and I don't need to top

662
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,120
at all the side branches are just

663
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,839
natural it's good to go but having that

664
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,719
one top in there really helps with those

665
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:27,038
side branches and bring things out

666
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,360
horizontally like you like you mentioned

667
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:33,319
right I for example I'm finishing up 6ot

668
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:35,158
tall plants in my tents right now and I

669
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:39,319
think I top those three

670
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:43,480
times so that I could end up with 22

671
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:46,439
dozen tops you know maybe even more um

672
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,919
so that's a six foot plants I top them

673
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,880
three times depends on your goal yeah

674
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:54,200
yep so awesome so we got topping we got

675
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,960
fing I do want to get into one of the

676
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,558
things you're most known for which is

677
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,480
the chiropractic training technique can

678
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,200
you describe what that is how do you

679
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,759
came up with it and how to do it so on

680
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,319
and so forth I love that name too

681
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,398
somebody along the way like 10 years in

682
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,319
started said hey that's like

683
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:13,398
Chiropractic kushman Cairo kushman

684
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:14,720
Chiropractic I was like I was I was

685
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:17,319
calling it

686
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:21,000
supercropping and basically super

687
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:24,720
cropping to me is is any technique that

688
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,919
enhances yield you know hence super

689
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,919
cropping and

690
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:34,960
uh the the Cairo came interestingly

691
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:36,679
enough uh a long long long time ago it

692
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,000
was like literally one of the first

693
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:42,200
stories I was ever sent to cover for

694
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,319
High Times magazine and I drove there

695
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:48,240
from New York across the border in um

696
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,918
Ontario or something no it wasn't

697
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:55,880
Ontario it was uh

698
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:59,559
anyways uh and I was going to meet uh

699
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:03,480
one of the few legal

700
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:05,038
patients in Canada like just like us

701
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:09,558
there was only a handful of them back

702
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:13,278
then and uh it was a h a young cat he

703
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:15,839
was like 18 years old he was living with

704
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:17,919
his mother and they were only allowed to

705
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:21,158
have two

706
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:26,679
plants and so he had two

707
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:29,360
plants one each under a th000 watt

708
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:32,798
parabolic do you remember those seven

709
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:34,959
panel 45 in parabolic reflectors it

710
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:38,519
looks like a dog cone collar around an

711
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,319
exposed bulb turned upside

712
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:44,480
down I actually used those for a good

713
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:48,079
the first eight 10 10 years of my

714
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,440
growing and so what he did was because

715
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:53,199
he was only allowed to have two plants

716
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,798
he basically had the plant right

717
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,759
underneath where the bulb

718
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:01,119
was and he had the plant

719
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:03,839
trained like a

720
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,359
candleabra so the bucket is in the

721
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,000
middle and he's got a little bit of

722
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,959
stock coming up and as soon as the stock

723
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,200
starts he's got a branch trained out

724
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,880
like this and there's little nodes

725
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,159
sticking up here and here and here and

726
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,600
he's got a branch coming this way and

727
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:18,360
then there's nodes sticking up here and

728
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:20,240
here and here so if you could picture

729
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:23,278
underneath this parabolic light the

730
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,278
light hangs down to here he has a plant

731
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,880
that is all trained out with all these

732
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:31,079
branches and all these no standing up so

733
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,480
that the ones on the outside are the

734
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:36,240
same distance from the bulb roughly 2T

735
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,798
from the bulb you know two and half as

736
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,480
the one underneath it and so he created

737
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:43,679
this

738
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,839
Arena underneath of this plant and he

739
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,679
did it with a combination of bending and

740
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:52,558
twisting and he was using

741
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:54,798
um it was like a floral uh the wire they

742
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:58,200
use for floral arrangements to keep them

743
00:30:54,798 --> 00:31:00,798
in place it's a real stiff wire and it

744
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:07,080
was the most amazing thing I ever saw

745
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:09,000
and I being uh more lazy than he he had

746
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:11,359
more time on his hands than I did to do

747
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,960
that one thing I guess and I had a a

748
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:19,439
real job I just started finding a way to

749
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:22,000
twist and bend and then kind of like I'd

750
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,759
massage the plan and as I'm doing this I

751
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,638
slowly bend it over I'd first break the

752
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:30,440
inner herd and then slowly bend it over

753
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:32,479
like this until it's sat down

754
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,159
perpendicular and then take my thumb

755
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,839
underneath and do a little pinch little

756
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:40,200
just a little pinch just enough so that

757
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,038
it couldn't grow back up there it was

758
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,240
much more efficient for the plant for

759
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:47,879
the tip to just grow up and so without

760
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,200
all that wiring and all that tiring I

761
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:54,519
came up with uh that supercropping and I

762
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:57,519
started doing this candleabra shaping so

763
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,440
that so that I could one keep my lights

764
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,399
low

765
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,038
to all of the budding

766
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:04,599
sites

767
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:07,679
and

768
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:11,158
um and that's and so the the techniques

769
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,320
before me that was like scrog right and

770
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:17,720
the thing that I didn't like about scrog

771
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:19,119
was um it locks your plants into place

772
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,440
and being a

773
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:24,839
journalist I always wanted to be able to

774
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,360
find the best angle for the

775
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:31,240
photograph and so I developed that

776
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:34,519
along with the TP technique where you

777
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,079
take uh three stakes and put them in

778
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:38,519
like a tripod in the bucket and bring

779
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:41,199
them together at the top like this and

780
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:44,159
then you tie strings from the top of the

781
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,558
Tepe down to the branches so that you

782
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,278
could support the larger branches in the

783
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:53,200
end uh and you I I still had autonomy on

784
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:55,000
the plants so it was just a it's like me

785
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,440
holding my pen I hold it like between

786
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
this finger instead of this I always got

787
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,159
to be different for some reason that's

788
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,839
really interesting so you were you were

789
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,399
the creator of the super cropping huh I

790
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:07,798
didn't know that well you know I don't

791
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:10,278
you know I'm sure that it was uh you

792
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:13,079
know it's like I didn't create uh

793
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:16,599
veganic farming you know when

794
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:19,000
I designed Vega Matrix but I did

795
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:21,719
highlight it I did kind of bring it to

796
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,079
the Forefront and that's maybe what I

797
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,319
did is you know I I I I brought it to

798
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,359
the Forefront that you could do these

799
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:31,119
Uber

800
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:32,638
manipulations I used to tell this story

801
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,359
about somebody who told me once

802
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:37,678
literally this old man he said yeah when

803
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,199
I grew we grew in the woods and stuff

804
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,360
you said when I put my seeds in the

805
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,759
ground I'd come back later in the season

806
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,558
and I would just stomp on them I just

807
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,240
stomp on crush them boom boom I'd walk

808
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:48,759
through the garden two or three times

809
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,159
and then the ones that grew back up were

810
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:51,798
the strongest ones and I didn't have to

811
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,278
worry about going too tall so people

812
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:56,638
could see them it's like they're weeds

813
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:58,599
and you know it's it you can you can

814
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:01,158
manipulate these things is amazing I

815
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:03,398
suggest I don't have any sites committed

816
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:05,919
to memory but if you look around there's

817
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:08,598
these uh plant

818
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,280
artists um all over the internet that

819
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:14,280
are doing these Bonsai you know did you

820
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,560
know that you can Bonsai any plant yeah

821
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,560
oh yeah I've seen it it's not a people

822
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:22,239
think that a bonsai tree is a bonsai

823
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:25,838
tree it's it's Lally you can Bonsai any

824
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:29,000
plant and is

825
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:31,358
extremely extremely conducive Ive to all

826
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,039
kinds of manipulations the trick is

827
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:36,279
which ones get you there the fastest and

828
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:38,000
which ones are just ornamental right

829
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,639
yeah and you can be very extravagant

830
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,480
with things like you mentioned or you

831
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,519
can keep things simple and just not even

832
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,800
doing a topping or a fimming or really

833
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:47,440
doing any high stress training

834
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,200
techniques where you're damaging the

835
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,599
plant at all you can just do what's

836
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,759
called low stress training right just

837
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:54,200
bending the branches down can you talk

838
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,200
to us about low stress training what

839
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:59,239
that is and maybe how you go about doing

840
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:01,078
it well I use low stress training as a

841
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:03,519
as like I said a second or a third

842
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:06,760
technique I've already done several I've

843
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:08,599
already broken the the the the main

844
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,760
stock you start off right at the bottom

845
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,160
of the plant um and people wonder when

846
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,560
when you do this I don't do it when it's

847
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:18,239
early or young um I usually do it um I

848
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:19,960
used to do it a lot but I F found one or

849
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,000
two really good treatments at the right

850
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:28,119
time is the best thing so um

851
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,800
like a week or so before flowering um is

852
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,240
really all you need you start at the

853
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,880
bottom and you in opposite directions if

854
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:37,239
you if you stabilize the plant you'll

855
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,200
hear a snap sometimes it's pretty darn

856
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:40,559
loud and and if you let go the plant's

857
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,358
not going anywhere you've just broken

858
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:45,279
the inner herd and then you work your

859
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:47,119
way up every inch or so and break and

860
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,680
every Branch you do that like that and

861
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,000
you create these really nice Knuckles

862
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,719
that uh make the plant stand on its own

863
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,760
and also you're increasing uh the the

864
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,078
cap the capillary action inside the

865
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,200
plant where its ability to take up water

866
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:03,720
and

867
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:08,039
nutrients and so I start with that and

868
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:10,239
then um as the plant progresses and I

869
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,440
have these branches that are

870
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,598
outgrowing even after I do you do the

871
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,480
topping at just the right time you're

872
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,640
still going to have you know two weeks

873
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,800
in three weeks in four weeks in whatever

874
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,400
your avenging is I only like to do two

875
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,200
or three weeks usually you're going to

876
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,200
have a couple of branches so the second

877
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,639
so as I'm going back for my weekly

878
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:30,039
supercropping kushman CYO treatment

879
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:33,000
that's when I'll do the where I massage

880
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:34,279
it and I bend it over and then crack it

881
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,800
right where I want it so I'll look at

882
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,280
the plant from the above and I'll find a

883
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,680
spot where that Branch if I bend it over

884
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,960
is going to take an open spot and I bend

885
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:47,799
it there and then finally when the

886
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,838
plants are kind of like their shape is

887
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,480
all good and I'm like a week into

888
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:54,880
flowering or maybe two weeks into

889
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,599
flowering and I see what's going on now

890
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,240
I'll use a passive technique to just fit

891
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,359
finish off where I want everything and

892
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:06,279
that could be by putting a steak in at

893
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:08,000
an angle and then pulling this Branch

894
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,000
over to the steak and just clipping it

895
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,119
to it so that now there's room in

896
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,519
between the branches so you're opening

897
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:19,519
up the center of the plant or simply

898
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:22,280
taking a branch that I've already

899
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:24,440
um without a stake and just finding a

900
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,240
node where you can attach a sling and

901
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,599
then just uh putting a a hole in the top

902
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:31,719
of the bucket and then pulling that out

903
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,920
slightly and securing it to the rim of

904
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:36,039
the pot and so now that's a good way of

905
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,440
opening up so those are passive ways

906
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:40,800
where you're not um you're not damaging

907
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:44,119
or wounding the plant uh you're just

908
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:48,000
moving things to make the absorption of

909
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:51,880
light more ideal and the actual um the

910
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,318
actual physical uh uh structure of the

911
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,240
plant so that you're filling in spaces

912
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:59,800
and taking advantage of opening up the

913
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:02,759
pl so that your secondary and your all

914
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,680
all the lower inter nodes get light and

915
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,280
even canopy is a Grower's best friend I

916
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,879
like the way you explain that you

917
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,839
explain it so a beginner can pick it up

918
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,480
and even just bending the branches out

919
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:14,880
to get light in the middle is definitely

920
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,119
beneficial it can definitely help

921
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,920
increase light down in to penetrate the

922
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,559
canopy and that can certainly help

923
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,358
increase yield overall so appreciate you

924
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:25,719
explaining that one another thing so

925
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:28,719
just to SP a little bit is you know um

926
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:30,519
well okay what I was going to get into

927
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:32,159
was you know and the next thing people

928
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:34,079
want to know is about de leafing and

929
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:37,279
denoting yeah let's get into that I was

930
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,359
going to talk to you about that so um

931
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,519
this is a very important part of

932
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:46,159
maximizing uh your plants so that you

933
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:48,599
get the right amount of uh full mature

934
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:52,679
flowers as opposed to all kinds of

935
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:58,200
errant little undeveloped um

936
00:38:52,679 --> 00:39:01,279
ly uh immature stuff so um what I like

937
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:02,239
to do is um the first time I clean up

938
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,000
the

939
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:08,519
plant I clean up the plant um so uh what

940
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,318
I initially wanted to say was so when

941
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:14,079
you're when you're manipulating the

942
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:16,960
plant and uh manipulating the branches

943
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,839
to maximize the light coming in you're

944
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,559
going to have all kinds of leafage

945
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:23,880
everywhere popping up and big leaves

946
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:26,078
from the interior what I say is interior

947
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,079
leaves interior pointing leaves you

948
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,119
always remove okay because they're going

949
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,200
to be cutting covering something up so

950
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:38,119
that's an easy one

951
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:43,159
um I think the trick is is to leave both

952
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:45,280
uh nodes and um the lower

953
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:47,759
leaves because those are your solar

954
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,920
collectors so if you lollipop as they

955
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,079
like to call it the first time you clean

956
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,280
up your plants and as you're denoting

957
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,079
you remove all those lower leaves you're

958
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,359
going to slow the growth of your plant

959
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,119
down um

960
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:02,719
I dare say 10

961
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,800
15% unless you're growing at a very high

962
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:06,959
density if you're growing plants that

963
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,800
are allowing to be receiving each their

964
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,440
own full intense direct light meaning

965
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,079
they're not smooshed up against each

966
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,800
other don't remove those lower leaves

967
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,200
until later on when flowers start

968
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,640
developing and you're really worrying

969
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:25,759
about air flow and stuff um because what

970
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:27,759
you want to do is you want to get down

971
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,359
underneath the canopy of your plant and

972
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,599
look up into the light and everywhere

973
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,318
where you can see from the ground and

974
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,039
you can see the

975
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:39,880
light that's photons of light that is

976
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:43,440
getting wasted it's going from the light

977
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,119
and hitting the ground so if you have

978
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,079
leaves intermittent leaves even though

979
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,480
they may be three nodes down from the

980
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:53,119
main leaves okay if you've got a leaf

981
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:58,280
here and a leaf here and a leaf here and

982
00:40:53,119 --> 00:41:01,400
a leaf here it's collecting secondary

983
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:03,880
light and a little secondary times four

984
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,079
five on each plant adds up to

985
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:09,318
substantial light and that adds up to

986
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:12,560
root growth uh and taking up water and

987
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:15,920
nutrients so uh don't remove that stuff

988
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:17,440
the first time leave it through veg and

989
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,440
leave it into early

990
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,760
flowering um and uh and so uh when you

991
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,559
get ready to flower about a week in

992
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,720
about two weeks before like when you do

993
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:30,279
the first chiropractic is when I'll

994
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:34,519
start denoting and what I do the first

995
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:37,480
time is it may sound crazy but I

996
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:40,119
denote either just leaving the tip and

997
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:43,639
like one or two nodes or virtually all

998
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:46,760
the way to the tip I will leave no nodes

999
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:48,440
I may have eight nodes on this branch

1000
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,440
and I'm only I'm going to den Noe all

1001
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,838
the way to the tip and I'm going to

1002
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,838
leave all those little leaves in between

1003
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,719
that are there and it's going to be bald

1004
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,078
all the way up to the tip now that's cuz

1005
00:41:55,719 --> 00:42:00,439
I like to grow a lot of sativas

1006
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,318
and now I'm a week before flowering that

1007
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,880
means this plant is going to stretch for

1008
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:08,800
another 3 to four weeks giving me

1009
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,039
another six seven eight nodes from where

1010
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,240
I left it and that's going to take away

1011
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,519
all my

1012
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,838
lar and I don't have to go back in and

1013
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:20,960
do it again now if I'm growing an indica

1014
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:23,000
or a hybrid I'll leave the top and just

1015
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,720
two extra

1016
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,599
nodes and then by the time bud set

1017
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:32,239
happens you've got your six to eight

1018
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:33,880
nodes anything below that is garbage but

1019
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:35,279
if you lollipop and remove all those

1020
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,000
leaves the first time you do that you're

1021
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,359
going to slow the plant down that's an

1022
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
interesting way to go about it I haven't

1023
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:42,558
heard anybody doing it that way was

1024
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,318
something that I probably want to try

1025
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,880
out in the future because uh yeah I

1026
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:48,079
totally get what you mean by that it can

1027
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,160
certainly slow things down if not done

1028
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:54,480
properly and the other thing too is when

1029
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:56,480
the plant um the re the the plant wants

1030
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,838
to grow sets of leaves you know what I'm

1031
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,559
saying I mean that's what it's going to

1032
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:02,639
do right so if you if you have a nice

1033
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,480
long hearty Branch you know I'm growing

1034
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:07,719
you know you grow you you're growing

1035
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,519
plants that are a foot tall that are

1036
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:11,358
going to flower at two 2 and 1/2 feet

1037
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:12,880
I'm assuming okay that's kind of an

1038
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,598
average size height a two and a half

1039
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,358
three foot tall flowered plant um you're

1040
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,480
going to have nice long Hefty branches

1041
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:20,199
that are a foot long and they're going

1042
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,800
to have lots of nodes on them and

1043
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:23,519
there's going to be four to five leaves

1044
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,280
in between there from the top and the

1045
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,480
bottom and uh I'm telling you you leave

1046
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,880
a branch for a couple of weeks of

1047
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,960
vegging where you would have taken off

1048
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,079
those four or five leaves it's not only

1049
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,119
going to grow slower but it's going to

1050
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,599
stretch more in between the nodes

1051
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:39,200
because it needs to throw out more

1052
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,039
leaves because it's trying to replace

1053
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,078
what you took away so what about like

1054
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:45,719
defoliation though like just plucking

1055
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,760
off leaves or like Leaf tucking do you

1056
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:49,799
do any of those well that's how I

1057
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,079
learned that uh leaving them was so

1058
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,559
important because when I was really

1059
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:54,800
young and I was 25 years old 24 years

1060
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:58,119
old I started

1061
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,599
growing I didn't have any guides well

1062
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:05,720
there was actually the Ed's guide was

1063
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:08,838
out um but uh I found that um tucking

1064
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:10,598
was very useful and I'd do it several

1065
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:11,838
times a day I would go into the garden

1066
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:13,920
and I would tuck them down and they

1067
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:15,519
would pop back up again and I noticed

1068
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,079
that they were blocking you know

1069
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:20,280
branches and nodes that I wanted to do

1070
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:23,519
so I tuck them down again um but then I

1071
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:26,880
learned that if you leave the

1072
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:29,519
exteriors um and wait and and develop

1073
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,280
the interior of let let the interior the

1074
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:35,440
the branches of nose develop on the

1075
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,359
interior that it's a big increase the

1076
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,960
just how much energy that plant can

1077
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:42,838
absorb how many photons of light as

1078
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:46,240
opposed to the surface

1079
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:49,400
area just use Ma everything is life is

1080
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:52,519
math right so if you've just removed um

1081
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,838
if you Den Noe like later on where I do

1082
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:58,639
like I'm now I'm a weak into

1083
00:44:54,838 --> 00:45:02,318
flowering and I'm going to remove every

1084
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:05,759
leaf that is not 50% of the height of

1085
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:08,639
the plant any Leaf that's not 50% in the

1086
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,359
middle or above that's when they go and

1087
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,440
so now I get the nice air flow and I get

1088
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:15,759
more water turnover and all of that like

1089
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:17,200
that um but before that those so that

1090
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,440
those few buckets that I'm pulling off

1091
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:22,439
and you fill those few buckets imagine

1092
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,280
the surface area of supplemental light

1093
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,318
like I said just get underneath and put

1094
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,480
your eyes and look up and if every where

1095
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:30,519
you see a crack that you see the actual

1096
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,079
light

1097
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:36,440
array that's if it don't remove that

1098
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,960
leaf imagine like pulling it and now you

1099
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:42,000
see it now you yeah I'm getting a

1100
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,079
little no I I understand and I agree

1101
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,440
with you I like to leave all a lot of

1102
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,760
the outer leaves for the reason you

1103
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,800
mentioned and also some of the lower

1104
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,800
leaves and one of the things that was in

1105
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,359
one of the videos I created gosh it had

1106
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,800
to have been five or six years ago now

1107
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:58,679
that's on my channel talking about

1108
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:01,119
lollipopping and deing ation is leaving

1109
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:03,118
kind of the lower set of leaves right

1110
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,960
above the lollipop I used to lollipop

1111
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:09,119
but uh I typically still do a quarter to

1112
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,800
a third of the plant and then um that

1113
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,318
first batch of leaves leave them some

1114
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,680
people take them off and um I usually

1115
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:17,960
leave them it kind of looks like a skirt

1116
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:19,838
I call the skirt technique is leave it

1117
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,519
there because another reason why to

1118
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:23,078
leave it not only for light penetration

1119
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:24,400
like you mentioned is like you want to

1120
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:26,920
capture some of those photons that are

1121
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,280
there those are solar panels but this is

1122
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,280
is also going to help you identify if

1123
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,760
there's a problem happening right some

1124
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,319
of these problems that happen are going

1125
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,800
to be on those lower leaves right like

1126
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:38,039
nitrogen tox nitrogen deficiency for

1127
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:41,000
example starts at the lower leaves so

1128
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:43,000
like you can you're able to still see

1129
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,960
that and then take action right away

1130
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,599
versus if you were to remove them well

1131
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,240
you might not notice as quickly so I

1132
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,760
call those indicator leaves and that was

1133
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,639
taught to me by an old outdoor grower um

1134
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,079
you always want to have some of the

1135
00:46:54,639 --> 00:47:01,480
largest oldest leaves because they are

1136
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:04,800
the only in the only early indicator of

1137
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:08,000
some of those nutrient deficiencies and

1138
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,720
uh um the there's another reason I like

1139
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,679
to leave actually the some of the older

1140
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:12,879
largest leaves is because again it goes

1141
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,519
back to the photography and the

1142
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,358
journalism it just looks really amazing

1143
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:20,440
when you have that original Seven bladed

1144
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:23,358
leaf that ends up turning all fall

1145
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,720
colors you know and it's it's this big

1146
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:26,639
it's as big as a dinner plate and

1147
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:28,679
there's the plant behind it like that

1148
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:30,598
it's just makes for a great photograph

1149
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,598
absolutely yeah I've had my fair share

1150
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:34,720
of very large leaves that I've I've

1151
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,960
taken pictures of it's uh it's exciting

1152
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:39,318
really is so of all these training

1153
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,159
methods that we talked about you've done

1154
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:43,920
quite a bit over the years to many

1155
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:45,920
different plants what are some of the

1156
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,039
biggest yields that you've gotten from

1157
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,280
plants that you've trained I'm always

1158
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:52,838
shooting for yield it's so funny it's

1159
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,319
like I I tell everybody I always try to

1160
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:59,679
grow the best not the

1161
00:47:55,318 --> 00:48:03,679
most but really let's get real

1162
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:06,159
Adam you know I'm Adam before I was Kyle

1163
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:10,279
and it's like that's why how I overgrow

1164
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:12,799
my garden all the time it's like I'm I

1165
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,720
don't I don't really intentionally set

1166
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:18,559
out to grow the most but then once I get

1167
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:21,558
started I'm trying I'm I'm putting so

1168
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:24,160
much energy into maximizing everything

1169
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:25,800
from from cycling the plants as much as

1170
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:30,358
possible to develop the most prolific

1171
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:33,680
roots to uh literally not overdoing it

1172
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:36,960
but feeding hard because the plants want

1173
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:38,960
food in order to produce a lot of fruit

1174
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,519
you know and really overdoing it and

1175
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,000
then and then of course I can't get in

1176
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:45,679
there and take pictures of the plants

1177
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,280
anymore because no they're so big that

1178
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:50,679
they just they it doesn't look like

1179
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,599
they're supposed to anyways um what was

1180
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:54,239
the question I lost the question largest

1181
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:55,720
yields like biggest yields you've kind

1182
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,358
of gotten from trained plants the

1183
00:48:55,719 --> 00:49:00,598
biggest plants I've ever grown indoors

1184
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:03,838
are actually probably might be in my

1185
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:06,720
tent right now um and they're equal to

1186
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:09,960
the ones that I did uh back in Mendo

1187
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:14,439
days um I grew a little bit over a pound

1188
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:18,000
of plant and they were uh Sage Master

1189
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:22,760
Adam duns th seeds

1190
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,079
sage and I grew uh was right after I got

1191
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,839
arrested believe it or not in

1192
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:29,760
mesino and the trial was pending and

1193
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:31,960
everything but they didn't take away my

1194
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,880
rights to grow so like literally I got

1195
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,199
out of jail the next day and I went and

1196
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,559
planted six plants so so I had medicine

1197
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:41,000
and

1198
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,000
um and so at that you know it's so

1199
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,358
you're only allowed to have six so

1200
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,760
I grew them to the ceiling and probably

1201
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:50,358
vegged them for you know I don't know

1202
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,559
three two or three months two and a half

1203
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:55,119
months or something and uh a pound I

1204
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:58,200
think the it was close to a pound and a

1205
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,519
quarter indoors in my basement and and

1206
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:03,960
that's what I've got now I've got these

1207
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:09,119
20 gallon um 25 gallon pots six foot

1208
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:11,318
tall I vegged them for 90 days and um

1209
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,119
they're just finishing up their eighth

1210
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:15,079
week here right before I get to go to

1211
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:18,079
Barcelona I'm going to be be harvesting

1212
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:24,039
here pretty quick and uh they're going

1213
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:26,000
to be 12 to 16 or 18 ounces each so I

1214
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:28,279
got I only got eight plants it makes it

1215
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,480
really easy take care of you know a lot

1216
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:34,040
of trimming yeah but it's really easy

1217
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:36,798
cuz everything is just super super chunk

1218
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:38,838
col is and then the there's really not

1219
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:41,280
much trimming to do on some of this the

1220
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:43,920
the varietals that I'm playing with um

1221
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:47,440
The Grape Ape and the the Cherry Lopez

1222
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:51,119
is like little here and there and it's

1223
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:54,079
just very very yumalicious then mixing

1224
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:56,039
easy yes so kind of getting towards the

1225
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,519
end here I want to get some advice from

1226
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:00,400
you really advice for beginners think

1227
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:02,838
about back when you first started

1228
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,440
growing and uh you were a beginner and

1229
00:51:02,838 --> 00:51:07,480
if you could tell yourself what you know

1230
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,639
now what advice would you give your

1231
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,199
beginner self well uh back then my

1232
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,358
beginner self would not have told

1233
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:17,798
anybody and my first crop that I ever

1234
00:51:14,358 --> 00:51:17,798
grew would not have gotten

1235
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:25,400
stolen but besides that um you know it

1236
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:28,439
really is

1237
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,039
uh the plants that are the healthiest

1238
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,720
are going to be the most potent and

1239
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:34,838
yield the most so focus on growing

1240
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:40,558
healthy

1241
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:42,159
plants um and the key to doing that is

1242
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:46,960
observation

1243
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:52,078
um unlike a lot of other skills that you

1244
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:54,039
acquire it takes um a lot of uh doing

1245
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,760
over and over and over again training

1246
00:51:54,039 --> 00:52:00,079
muscles and brain and coordination and

1247
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,440
all these things gardening is really

1248
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,920
more about

1249
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:09,280
observation and if you can uh uh by

1250
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,960
observing you what I call you learn the

1251
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:16,760
language of the plant and the plant will

1252
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:19,199
speak to you not out loud necessarily

1253
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:22,599
but the plant will speak to you and you

1254
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:24,239
will learn uh what the plant uh the

1255
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:27,200
plant will Express itself in different

1256
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:31,919
ways whe when it's happy versus not

1257
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:34,118
uh when it needs water um and and and

1258
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,880
you know it's a living being you know

1259
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:39,400
some people will argue whether it's cian

1260
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:43,680
or not I'm not here to get into that but

1261
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:45,798
it is a living it is alive and um

1262
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:48,838
so uh

1263
00:52:45,798 --> 00:52:52,119
observation um you know check in on it

1264
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:54,119
now and then every time after you water

1265
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:56,519
and you'll get a sense very quickly as

1266
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:58,599
to whether it liked what you gave it or

1267
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:00,480
or not um and then you have to assess

1268
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:02,680
was it just the you know you know

1269
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,920
there's other factors but just

1270
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:09,558
observation and

1271
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:12,798
um and try to remember that uh a plant

1272
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:15,160
is not a machine it's not like a car

1273
00:53:12,798 --> 00:53:16,838
where you can put higher octane gas in

1274
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:20,960
it and just hit the throttle and make it

1275
00:53:16,838 --> 00:53:23,078
go faster it's it's um uh there are

1276
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,639
sometimes when you have to treat it like

1277
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:27,720
an animal where it's a living thing

1278
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:31,558
where you can hurt it and so you have to

1279
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:33,879
observe like if you suddenly you're

1280
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:35,599
gonna get a guinea pig and you never had

1281
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,798
a guinea pig you don't know what to feed

1282
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,720
it you don't know how to take care of it

1283
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:42,199
you have to observe so observe and uh

1284
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:44,480
and then and then there are other times

1285
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:47,318
when you can treat a plant like it's a

1286
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,119
machine when it's like um it doesn't

1287
00:53:47,318 --> 00:53:52,480
know you don't you can keep it in

1288
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:54,880
vegetation vegetative state

1289
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,119
forever and it won't matter it's not

1290
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,480
going to get hurt and wonder why the the

1291
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:04,400
sun isn't going down um and develop you

1292
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:07,679
know uh so it's a combination of uh of

1293
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,400
techniques that you learn through mostly

1294
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:11,879
through observation and then of course

1295
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:14,119
trialing out well said well we covered a

1296
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,838
lot of stuff in this episode in regards

1297
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:18,440
to plan training and increasing yield I

1298
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:20,558
