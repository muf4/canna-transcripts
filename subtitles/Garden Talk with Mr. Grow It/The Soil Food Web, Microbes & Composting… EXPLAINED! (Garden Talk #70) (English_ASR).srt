1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
coming up on garden talk once you learn

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,119
about the soul food web and how the

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,720
system works it's self-perpetuating so

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,480
as long as you have the key ingredients

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,719
which is organic matter some type of

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,199
mineral macro and micronutrient based to

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,278
it the system is self-automated to kind

8
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,278
of run on its own if you're looking at a

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,399
really healthy system versus just dirt

10
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,079
you really start to notice the

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,239
difference in biology between what a

12
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,000
healthy system has included in its

13
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,239
biology versus dirt

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,559
you mostly just find mineral particles

15
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,759
and bacteria if your system goes to

16
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,238
anaerobic

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,600
and you start producing large amounts of

18
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:39,519
alcohols which is a byproduct your

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,120
alcohol and a root system will actually

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
liquefy your roots

21
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,839
it brings more diversity into your soil

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,440
systems so having kind of a mixed bag of

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,800
all the different kinds of predatory

24
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,799
species is really important

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,280
what's up everybody if you that don't

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,640

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,118
knowledge in soil biology today we're

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,359
going to get into a small handful of

34

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,560
talk podcast today i am joined with kay

82
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,239
the guy how you doing today pretty good

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,239
man today we're going to get into a

84
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,640
small handful of topics that relate to

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,519
soil biology so first thing we're going

86
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,359
to go over is the soil food web we

87
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,200
actually haven't had i think we have

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,879
like one other guest kind of touch upon

89
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,958
the soil food web a little bit but they

90
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,799
didn't really get into many details and

91
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,400
i think the soil food web is super

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,959
important so i'm really excited to have

93
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,280
you on to talk in detail about that

94
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,680
we're also going to get into microbes

95
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,680
really deep into some of the microbes

96
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
and their functions which is very

97
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,000
important when it comes to living soil

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,479
and then if we have time we will get

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
into composting i love talking to people

100
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,318
who are into composting who have

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,840
knowledge on it because i am somewhat

102
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,280
new of a composter i mean i've been

103
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,519
doing it for about like eight or nine

104
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,280
months now so like i love to have people

105
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,680
on and like pick their brain from my own

106
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,759
personal gains so so yeah we'll uh we'll

107
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,599
get into those things and then and then

108
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,959
we'll go from there but first can you

109
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,479
tell us a little bit about yourself and

110
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,400
how you got into gardening

111
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,840
uh so i'm kay the guy i have a youtube

112
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,799
channel and a small instagram channel

113
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,000
um

114
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,319
i grow

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,680
uh build and fix things on my youtube

116
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:16,798
channel so it's a big diy channel

117
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,358
i am certified through the soul food web

118
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,679
through their fc courses as well as

119
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,240
their certified lab tech program which i

120
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,079
basically do biological lab assessments

121
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,720
and analysis on

122
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,719
uh different kinds of um microbial

123
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,800
populations and certain soil systems and

124
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,280
samples i get sent in

125
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,199
or to test on my own personal property

126
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,159
i'm also certified by green flower

127
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,639
academy for their medicinal plant

128
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,840
cultivation certificate so i also have

129
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,199
that as well

130
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,439
um

131
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,000
i got started really

132
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,519
full-time gardening in 2018

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,478
moving to the property i currently live

134
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,639
at

135
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:57,599
which we're blessed to have 10 acres

136
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,759
here and so it's at first i was excited

137
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,320
and and then i realized how much work 10

138
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,319
acres is really to cultivate and so i've

139
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,360
been doing it uh bits and pieces at a

140
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,719
time

141
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,720
back in 2018 the u.s farm bill

142
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,320
was signed into law after a 48-year

143
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,199
prohibition on

144
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,000
hemp

145
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,280
so after that it was federally legal and

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,800
in 2019 and 2020 i had a hemp

147
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,319
cultivation license through the state of

148
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,720
colorado

149
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,399
and that's where i learned a lot of uh

150
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,320
growing medicinal plants

151
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,879
and how that process works i did a lot

152
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,240
of stumbling my first year

153
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,839
and uh

154
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,120
killed some plants i really didn't know

155
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,679
what i was doing

156
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,600
and but i also was able to get plants

157
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,160
through to harvest so i was successful

158
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,320
at least in that first year to do that

159
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,520
and then after that every year i tried

160
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,000
to grow

161
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,918
my education as well as my knowledge and

162
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
wisdom for growing not just medicinal

163
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,079
plants but several different kinds of

164
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,879
species of plants and trees

165
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,560
nice nice yeah i've checked out your

166
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,959
youtube channel and i feel like you have

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,079

you know you have a whole bunch of

173
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,599
variety of different gardening topics on

174
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,960
there i don't want to say it's just it's

175
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,800
just one thing

176
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,799
but i'll definitely have a link to his

177
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,879

00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,519
valuable content there

186
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,119
so there are so many different

187
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,198
styles of gardening right there's so

188
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,079
many different ways to grow what's your

189
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,160
style are you an indoor grower outdoor

190
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,639
what medium are you in are you going

191
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,639
with synthetic nutrients or organic

192
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,400
inputs what's your style so um

193
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,840
when i first started i had to start

194
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,279
indoors because our winters were pretty

195
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,638
harsh

196
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:59,598
so i had to start our little baby plants

197
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,598
in an indoor grow area that i built

198
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:02,478
so i had to learn about

199
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,319
you know

200
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,240
different lighting

201
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,080
i started with essentially fluorescent

202
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,478
lighting just something really basic and

203
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,159
now i've i've all the way advanced up to

204
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,918
chilled tech

205
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,479
for our lighting systems

206
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,399
but i grow indoor uh typically during

207
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,360
the winter months and i and then i grow

208
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:24,159
outdoor uh during the summer months when

209
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,680
it's warmer so it's kind of a mixture of

210
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,319
both

211
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,959
i started off doing a lot of synthetics

212
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,720
and um that was for me that was more

213
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,839
challenging than than switching over to

214
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,240
organics

215
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,399
um organics once you learn about the

216
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,720
soil food web and how the system works

217
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,239
um it's it's self-perpetuating so as

218
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,560
long as you have the key ingredients

219
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,199
which is organic matter some type of

220
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,160
mineral macro micronutrient based to it

221
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,478
the system is self automated in order to

222
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,479
kind of run on its own

223
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:57,680
indoors i use

224
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,680
earth boxes and grass roots pots

225
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,280
which are really good for me

226
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,360
i like it because

227
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,038
with an earth box i could just fill it

228
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,840
with three to five thousand mils of

229
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:10,240
water and i can i can go take a vacation

230
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:13,598
for five days and so it's kind of hands

231
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,918
free i don't have to worry about the

232
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:19,199
medium getting too wet because it's

233
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:21,198
essentially a bottom fed water system so

234
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,280
when the top gets too wet

235
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,560
then you end up going slightly anaerobic

236
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,559
or your environment gets a little too

237
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,079
wet and then you end up with situations

238
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,240
like fungus gnats or those kinds of

239
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,839
situations where now you're battling

240
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,599
something because your environment got

241
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,000
slightly out of whack so i really do

242
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,479
like that bottom fed um

243
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,799
earthbox systems for indoor especially

244
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,360
yeah the automated systems for like the

245
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,399
automated watering systems can be so

246
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,879
beneficial i mean it saves time it helps

247
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,480
with the uh the right moisture content

248
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,240
in the medium which is super important

249
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,200
that's hard to really dial in when

250
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,879
you're hand watering so i have a

251
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,560
automatic watering system as well i have

252
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,120
the blue mat system and i've used the

253
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,199
auto pots in the in the past and i think

254
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,200
ac infinity not sure if they've revealed

255
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,640
this yet and they might

256
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,560
get mad at me for revealing it but they

257
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,159
actually have an auto watering system

258
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,599
in the works or actually it might

259
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,639
actually already be released at this

260
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,320
point

261
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,240
so i'm looking forward to trying that

262
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,480
one out as well but is it going to be a

263
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,799
top fed or is it a bottom fed system or

264
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,720
a drip system do you know

265
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,039
bottom fed yep it's starting from the

266
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,200
bottom of wicks up yeah i like those

267
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,599
kinds of systems because then your your

268
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,680
your top surface never really gets over

269
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,759
soaked for the most part yeah it can be

270
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,879
beneficial the only downside is like

271
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,519
i've used the

272
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:40,080
auto pots before and when i'm doing top

273
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,000
dressing keeping that top layer is kind

274
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,759
of difficult at times because the

275
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,919
wicking doesn't really keep that top

276
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,000
layer truly moist and you know as you

277
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,000
know we need to keep that top layer

278
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,080
moist with the amendments in there so

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,759
the biology can break it down and turn

280
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,360
into usable nutrients for the plant so

281
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,720
but yeah i love those systems it

282
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,240
definitely makes things a lot easier

283
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,639
let's get into the soil food web so tell

284
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,720
us what is the soil food web so

285
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,759
essentially the soil food web is a

286
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,040
discovery um made by dr elaine over the

287
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:14,559
past 40 to 50 years of research

288
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,480
that discovery is essentially how

289
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,199
plants receive the soluble nutrients

290
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,720
through the flow or cycle of organisms

291
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,079
around the roots of the plants through

292
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,879
predation

293
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,439
so

294
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,439
in the soil food web school curriculum

295
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,440
what we learn is essentially the history

296
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,600
of of all this research decades of

297
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,440
research that dr elaine has done

298
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,480
going to different continents and

299
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,519
regions around the world and perceiving

300
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,560
what the

301
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,120
organisms in the soil are doing

302
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,879
and and and what the the base life forms

303
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,600
which essentially are our bacteria and

304
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,679
our fungi are are being consumed by

305
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,360
these predatory species and what she

306
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,439
would notice over the course of time is

307
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,839
that there was certain groups that were

308
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,200
always consistent in every soil medium

309
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,480
throughout the world

310
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,440
and so what she created was more or less

311
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,039
a flow chart of understanding the base

312
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,600
life forms that need to be present which

313
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,679
are our prey in the system

314
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,000
what they do is bacteria and fungi they

315
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,479
create enzymes that break down parent

316
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
minerals of sand silts and clay in the

317
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,879
soil around different regions of the

318
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,559
world

319
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,799
and essentially what they do as they're

320
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,518
breaking down those minerals a predatory

321
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,679
species will come along and will consume

322
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,919
those creatures and then release the

323
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:31,519
excess nutrients into the soil system

324
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:34,639
and that's how uh nature has done it for

325
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,679
years and years or eons really

326
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:41,600
without the help of human assistance to

327
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:45,239
perpetuate uh productive uh plant growth

328
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,120
okay gotcha and then for some of these

329
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,240
microorganisms that you mentioned

330
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,240
bacteria fungi we'll go over protozoa

331
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,120
nematodes you can't see them with the

332
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,519
naked eye right their micro micro stands

333
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,200
for you you need a microscope for it

334
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,078
yeah what are the different types of

335
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,440
microscopes and which microscopes do you

336
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:07,359
recommend so we have um

337
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,680
a real basic microscope that we use for

338
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,399
the soul food web

339
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,599
right now we use a shadowing parafocal

340
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,879
microscope

341
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,800
which is the one right behind me on my

342
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,879
shoulder here

343
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,958
these are fairly

344
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:24,480
inexpensive kind of the same ones that

345
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:26,239
you see in high schools or college labs

346
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,159
there's really nothing super special to

347
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,879
them they have essentially illumination

348
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,480
in the bottom a condenser

349
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,399
usually you'll have at least three

350
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,720
object objectives

351
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,278
to a microscope you'll have a 40 and a

352
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,240
400 total magnification

353
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:45,039
the four we typically use will kind of

354
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,480
scan around and actually find nematodes

355
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,159
at uh

356
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,320
essentially 4x

357
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:54,719
um we'll use the 40 for

358
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,480
identifying large larger creatures

359
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,759
within our soil systems and then we'll

360
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,320
go up to 400 to look at bacteria

361
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,799
which is the base measurement to what we

362
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,200
use to measure all the other creatures

363
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,359
so whenever we're looking at all the

364
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,000
different organisms under our microscope

365
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,680
uh one particular bacteria called the

366
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,440
cocci which is essentially just a little

367
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,719
round

368
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,079
little round

369
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,560
kind of blob

370
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:23,519
is uh one micrometer in diameter so we

371
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,439
use that as a kind of a base measurement

372
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,959
to measure everything else in our fields

373
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,720
of view and then i don't want to get too

374
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,319
off topic here but one of the things

375
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,920
with microscopes that i know that you

376
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,920
can do is i kind of want to talk about

377
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,078
dna sex testing just a quick question in

378
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,639
regards to that is like i know in order

379
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,799
to find out if a plant is male or female

380
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,879
you can actually use a microscope to

381
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,198
zoom all the way in and see the

382
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,958
chromosomes and then identify if the

383
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,439
plant is male or female can that

384
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,359
microscope that you have can you zoom in

385
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,199
that far and see that the current

386
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,440
microscope i have goes up to a thousand

387
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,439
power in total magnification there might

388
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,320
be a way but i'd have to

389
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,639
i would have to recognize uh

390
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,959
what the distinctive uh

391
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,480
differences in those chromosomes are in

392
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,039
order to recognize between male and

393
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,920
female i probably could

394
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,759
but i'd have to set up specifically in

395
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,519
order to do that on this microscope

396
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,319
again this is a real base microscope

397
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,519
that goes uh between a four and a

398
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,240
hundred x objective and so um being able

399
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,399
to

400
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,799
to use it for other things uh is

401
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,559
definitely possible um

402
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,879
it's kind of fun because you you get the

403
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,239
microscope you start really looking at

404
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,399
slides and those kinds of things and you

405
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,759
kind of get lost at first because you

406
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,120
don't really know

407
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,559
exactly what you're looking at in the

408
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,720
very beginning

409
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,399
it's just really exploration and what

410
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,839
you'll start to notice is you know the

411
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,679
differences between

412
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,079
for example if you're looking at a

413
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,278
really healthy system versus just dirt

414
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:50,958
you really start to notice the

415
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,120
difference in biology between what a

416
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,879
healthy system has included in its

417
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,120
biology versus dirt

418
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,439
you mostly just find mineral particles

419
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,000
and bacteria so i've been wanting to get

420
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,440
a microscope when i did my research i've

421
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,039
seen ones that were like thousands of

422
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,880
dollars and i'm like do i really want to

423
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,198
make that investment right now and then

424
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:11,278
i came across your videos and you posted

425
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:12,479
a link to the microscope that you have

426
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,639
and i was surprised to see there was

427
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,759
only it was only like what 300 dollars

428
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,759
at the most or something like that i

429
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,439
know you have to get like the slides and

430
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,278
and things like that but

431
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,120
we're looking at less than 500 bucks for

432
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,519
everything right

433
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,560
probably around 400 in total depending

434
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,720
on how prices get but um yeah you

435
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,679
basically just need a

436
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,480
shadowing microscope that has up to 400x

437
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,799
magnification for what i do

438
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,920
and then you need your test tubes your

439
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,838
pipettes for drawing your liquid um you

440
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,319
need your

441
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,800
your slides and then your cover slips

442
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,360
in order to do your viewing of all your

443
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,639
different micro microscope analysis

444
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,800
but yeah you can use it for lots of

445
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,759
different things as well nice yeah i'm

446
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,758
definitely gonna have to pick one of

447
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,759
those up for sure so when you're looking

448
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,839
at the microscope you can look at

449
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,159
different particles you know there's

450
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,519
sand there's silt and there's clay and

451
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,639
you kind of already touched upon like

452
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,078
dirt

453
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,240
maybe get a little bit deeper into dirt

454
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,758
versus soil but explain to us what those

455
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,720
things are

456
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,039
so uh sand silt and clay and then

457
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,600
combined together which is a loam

458
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,360
um is essentially the base or parent

459
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,399
materials to

460
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,240
what the earth's crust is and included

461
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,320
in all those um different materials is

462
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,320
all the different elements

463
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,720
based on dr lane's research that are

464
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,480
once they're soluble are able to be

465
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,160
taken up by the plant to grow any kind

466
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,320
of plant in any kind of region around

467
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,799
the world some chemists or agronomists

468
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,800
will argue against this

469
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,159
but depending on how deep your root

470
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,479
system goes

471
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,078
you can have obviously more and more

472
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,000
available nutrients the deeper your

473
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,078
system goes into the ground

474
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,360
so if they're just testing the first you

475
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:01,120
know top six inches or 12 inches of a

476
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,800
soil medium

477
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,959
they're going to get a certain test

478
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,119
using a male x3 or a saturated paste

479
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,880
test of what your chemistry is in your

480
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,519
soil but if your plant's root system

481
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,280
goes down four feet then there's a whole

482
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,359
other set of tests that has to be done

483
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,599
to see exactly what we're trying to get

484
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,279
and so um

485
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,879
the differences between sand silt and

486
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:25,678
clay obviously when when you're in uh uh

487
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,520
areas that's closer to the ocean uh you

488
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,038
may see more uh sand again sand is um

489
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,918
easily drained

490
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:33,919
but

491
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,840
it's hard to bring together aggregates

492
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,759
so when you're looking at the difference

493
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:41,519
between what you would consider dirt or

494
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:44,720
nothing growing in a sand medium

495
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:47,279
it's it's basically all just minerals so

496
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,759
once you get that swing where you get

497
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,678
organic material back into sand it

498
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,759
starts to turn into a loam once you get

499
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,720
the organic material coupled with the

500
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:59,279
sand in that particular growing medium

501
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,919
then you're you're starting to build

502
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,918
aggregation because of the the

503
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,000
microbes that are being added with the

504
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,840
organic material so

505
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,880
people wonder where microbes essentially

506
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,879
come from microbes are coming from

507
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,080
the organic material that we're adding

508
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,280
or is being dropped into those

509
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,359
soil

510
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,879
environments and so

511
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,479
you don't necessarily have to go look

512
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,000
for them really that hard you just need

513
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,839
to go find systems that are thriving

514
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,400
within your area to bring that into a

515
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,599
devoid uh

516
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,919
devotive organisms um environment in

517
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,159
order to to kind of replenish all that

518
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,880
life to get the the system turned on

519
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,038
again okay and then

520
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,480
to see this stuff through the microscope

521
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,720
we're not gonna get real detailed into

522
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,679
how to use a microscope in this episode

523
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,240
although

524
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,640
on your channel you have a video that's

525
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,200
you go deep into how to use a microscope

526
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,559
what to look for so on and so forth so i

527
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,960
won't take that away from you if anybody

528
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,240
wants to get deeper into that definitely

529
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,319
check out his channel because he has

530
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,558
very detailed videos on all of those

531
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,480
things let's flip it up let's get into

532
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,720
some of the microorganisms at this point

533
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,558
how about we start with bacteria can you

534
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,640
talk to us all about bacteria so yeah

535
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:13,678
bacteria is super important

536
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,000
uh bacteria is the one of the base life

537
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,360
forms within our soil structure

538
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,440
um they are the prey to all pretty much

539
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,319
all the predators within the system

540
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,200
so

541
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:28,639
um there are

542
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,440
different kinds of bacteria depending on

543
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,679
your oxygen levels within your system

544
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,919
so the two main aerobic ones are going

545
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,600
to be cocci and bacilli

546
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,799
cocci or that round

547
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,399
almost like a little blob but they look

548
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,079
like a dot so whenever we're measuring

549
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,640
them it's almost like the tip of a pen

550
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:49,038
bacilli is essentially a

551
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,520
a pill-shaped bacteria

552
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,558
and it kind of looks like a little rod

553
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,759
it's

554
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,119
usually

555
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,558
two to three times larger than cocci

556
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,159
but these are the aerobic creatures that

557
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,480
we want to see in our solar mediums

558
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,480
these are our food for all the predatory

559
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,240
species these are also the base

560
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,759
organisms that are going to use their

561
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,558
enzymes to break down all the sand silts

562
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:15,519
and clay into plant available nutrients

563
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,599
so those are very important

564
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,519
we have three levels of oxygen that we

565
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,038
measure when it comes to the kinds of

566
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,480
bacteria that we want to see and the

567
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,960
ones that we don't

568
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,720
and so the three levels are aerobic

569
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,159
which is anything above six parts per

570
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,600
million of oxygen

571
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,080
and so

572
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,918
um whenever we know that we have an

573
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,839
aerobic system we'll see a lot of cocci

574
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,000
and a lot of bacilli

575
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,158
whenever we go into

576
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,599
lower oxygen levels what they call

577
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,520
facultative

578
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,399
that is between four to six parts per

579
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,158
million

580
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,919
and that is where

581
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,440
unfortunately you start to see disease

582
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,919
causers or pathogenic bacteria

583
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,200
this is where um

584
00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:00,400
you're going to see spirochetes spirulum

585
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,319
e coli is in this range

586
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,080
as well as some other kind of nasty

587
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,119
things that'll make you sick

588
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,399
um

589
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:10,719
below that is uh anaerobic which is

590
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,960
below four four parts per million and

591
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,640
when you're getting uh that anaerobic

592
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,558
where you have that limited amount of

593
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,320
oxygen

594
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,918
in certain conditions you are going to

595
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,480
start to see

596
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,120
really really bad organisms

597
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,720
typically like vibrios which are a

598
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,199
kidney bean shape sometimes they have a

599
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,679
little tail on the end of them and those

600
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,279
are for example when i was doing my

601
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,159
final exam for

602
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:39,519
um my microscopy test

603
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,520
my examiner was a former lab tech that

604
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,879
was testing infectious disease and blood

605
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,599
samples and those kinds of things and

606
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,159
she said in the presence of vibrios

607
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,519
you'll see situations like cholera

608
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,559
so definitely

609
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,639
really uh unsavory organisms that you

610
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,000
don't want to come in contact with and

611
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,080
if you do you obviously want to clean

612
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,240
everything as much possible is there any

613
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,000
way that we can measure what the oxygen

614
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,880
level is like you mentioned those couple

615
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,960
different

616
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,640
methods or a couple different levels is

617
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,319
there any way like the home gardener can

618
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,480
see that or did they just look at a

619
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,918
sample under a microscope and see the

620
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,400
different types of bacteria and then can

621
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,400
just assume the levels at that point

622
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,919
so if if you're really not versed on

623
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,440
using a

624
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,640
microscope

625
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,558
there's a couple of things that you can

626
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,640
do to

627
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,839
understand when a system is going septic

628
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,679
where those things are starting to

629
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,918
proliferate

630
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,000
smell if you're getting any kind of

631
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,080
septic smell

632
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,839
that is a an indication that things are

633
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,879
going south

634
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:38,798
if you

635
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,799
detect something like that you're

636
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:43,279
probably oversaturated with water and

637
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,440
your oxygen levels are dropping so you

638
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,279
want to re-oxygenate those kinds of

639
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,120
situations you want to get air in there

640
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,678
as much as possible

641
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,759
you want to stop the flow of water into

642
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,320
those areas so that your

643
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,919
slowing or drying off the the amount of

644
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,519
moisture in there

645
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,360
and allowing oxygen to kind of

646
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,839
reintroduce because though

647
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,439
even if they start to proliferate in

648
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,879
those situations

649
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,759
you can kind of steer it back in the

650
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,280
other direction by just adding in oxygen

651
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,440
back in immediately so letting things

652
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,119
dry out moving things around so you're

653
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,679
not getting so much

654
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,599
moisture in one specific area

655
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,880
but typically smell

656
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,759
like for example if your composting

657
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,600
meats

658
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,679
and you have that rotten

659
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,798
putrid smell that's putressing that's

660
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,559
actually being formed on meat

661
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,558
and essentially putrescine is a

662
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:35,678
byproduct of rotting flesh

663
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,119
so

664
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,200
there's all these different chemicals

665
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,199
that have different smells based on what

666
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,919
is decomposing

667
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,038
at that time and what's um decomposing

668
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,840
it which is usually some can be some

669
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,879
nasty creatures wow that's really

670
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:52,798
interesting yeah i know when you come

671
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,278
into anaerobic conditions particularly

672
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,599
like in the root zone the roots really

673
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,960
kind of destroy themselves i don't know

674
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,798
if you've ever seen a picture of a root

675
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,400
that has just been under water and

676
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,480
there's been anaerobic conditions around

677
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,240
the root but they'll actually

678
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,960
if you cut open a root

679
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,120
you'll see like the cells are just all

680
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,798
like destroyed and the plant is

681
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:16,239
basically just trying to

682
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:18,879
get oxygen suck up oxygen through it and

683
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,038
so it destroys itself and and

684
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,159
there's all hole there's a massive hole

685
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,640
in the root

686
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,039
versus where there should be individual

687
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,720
cells so it really does some damage on

688
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,440
the root zone as well

689
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,000
if if your system goes too anaerobic

690
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,240
and you start producing

691
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,558
large amounts of alcohols which is a

692
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,038
byproduct

693
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,038
your alcohol and a root system will

694
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,558
actually liquefy your roots

695
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,480
so you want to make sure that you're not

696
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,399
getting too anaerobic because that

697
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,640
byproduct is actually

698
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,600
uh the opposite of what you want in your

699
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,360
soil in rhizosphere for your roots the

700
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,599
other point i wanted to make on the

701
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:59,439
three different levels of oxygen

702
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,359
is that when you're getting into the

703
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,720
different kinds of

704
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:07,278
bacteria aerobic bacteria will actually

705
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,440
produce alkalines

706
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,519
and glue structures so when you have

707
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,600
aerobic bacteria in your soil system or

708
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,519
your compost whatever you're trying to

709
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,839
propagate it's actually going to

710
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:20,798
increase ph

711
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,558
and actually create glues to help create

712
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:24,400
aggregates and those aggregates are what

713
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:25,440
essentially form the colonies of where

714
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,840
all your

715
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,798
microbes are going to hang out it also

716
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,959
creates a water holding capacity

717
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,798
it is also an area where you're going to

718
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,880
get a lot of organisms that are going to

719
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,319
be breaking down things closer to your

720
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,919
root system

721
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,759
it also helps with drought resistance as

722
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,440
well so whenever water goes through a

723
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,079
certain system and there's really

724
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,880
aerobic uh bacteria through that system

725
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:51,199
the water will essentially get held

726
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,120
within that that portion where a lot of

727
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,759
aerobic bacteria are being held and

728
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,798
propagating so it has a lot of benefits

729
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,960
to it

730
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:01,599
but again according to ph aerobic

731
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,319
bacteria will bring the ph slightly up

732
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:06,719
anaerobic bacteria will produce acidic

733
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:09,278
conditions or ph down

734
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,278
typically below 4.5 so if you're

735
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,119
starting to get anaerobic your ph is

736
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,119
starting to drop and obviously that's

737
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,119
going to affect your plant's ability to

738
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,359
take up certain nutrients

739
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,199
so not only is anaerobic bad for the

740
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,639
root system but now your plant can't

741
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,960
take up certain things because of the

742
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,440
fact that it's too wet

743
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,919
or anaerobic or low in oxygen in that

744
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,919
system now when it comes to fungi

745
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,400
aerobic fungi will produce

746
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,720
acidic conditions but with a fairly

747
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,880
neutral variance so aerobic fungi will

748
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,558
produce ph levels between 5.5 and 7.

749
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,200
so when you have

750
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:47,278
uh bacteria that's bringing your ph up

751
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,360
your your balance of fungi will actually

752
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,720
bring your ph back down and help keep it

753
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,278
more neutral

754
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,319
so in essence aerobic fungi and aerobic

755
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:59,359
bacteria are balancing each other out to

756
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,158
keep kind of the perfect ph for most of

757
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,439
the plants that we're going to be

758
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,039
growing

759
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,200
and then lastly

760
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,519
anaerobic fungi

761
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,038
or oh my seats as we like to call them

762
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,599
uh they're gonna produce highly acidic

763
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:14,640
conditions and again pushing the ph

764
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,558
below typically a 5.5 wow i didn't know

765
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,919
that that's uh pretty interesting i know

766
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,158
we've talked about in this podcast

767
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,679
before how different things adjust the

768
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,320
ph and there's a lot of new growers that

769
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,399
are listening in and they monitor the ph

770
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,678
of their medium because we know it needs

771
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:30,000
to be in a certain range for proper

772
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,399
nutrient uptake and there's a lot of

773
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,038
panic that happens because people are

774
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:37,119
doing a runoff test or a slurry test and

775
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,720
they're seeing that their ph is out of

776
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,119
range and they wonder

777
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,960
what is doing that and they own a lot of

778
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,639
people just think that it's the water

779
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,919
that they're putting in is the only

780
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,880
thing impacting the ph which is

781
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,559
incorrect there are so many different

782
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,720
things that impact the ph

783
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,319
and you just mentioned one of the things

784
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,759
there so definitely glad you brought

785
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,960
that up because i wasn't even aware of

786
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,319
that let's move on to fungi you already

787
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,440
touched upon it a little bit can you

788
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:04,240
talk to us more about fungi so

789
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,759
fungi fungi fungi a lot of people say it

790
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,880
different ways i just repeat what dr

791
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:08,240
elaine says

792
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,440
but

793
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,919
they are essentially the carbon

794
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,200
gatherers to our system so when you're

795
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,679
talking about just making a healthy

796
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,519
system worldwide you want more fungi

797
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,000
because they are essentially gathering

798
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:23,119
more carbon than bacteria do their

799
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,839
structures are long sometimes

800
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:29,038
uh they're huge fields just

801
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:31,839
all an interconnected fungi system

802
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,440
and they have a much wider carbon to

803
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,079
nitrogen ratio

804
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,399
so they essentially are gathering up

805
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,599
lots of different types of

806
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:43,439
more complex foods within our system

807
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,319
as opposed to bacteria which have a much

808
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,720
narrower carbon to nitrogen ratio

809
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,359
and so

810
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,720
there are essentially two types that we

811
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,439
really

812
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,360
are searching for when it comes to fungi

813
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,720
in our system we want mycorrhizal or

814
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,639
sacrophilic

815
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,159
mycorrhizal obviously pairs with the

816
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,720
root system of other plants and

817
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,919
sacrophilic essentially grows on its own

818
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,079
so the thing about fungi that really

819
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,200
will help you grow almost any kind of

820
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,839
plant

821
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,600
is that there is a successional series

822
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:20,240
of the ratio between fungal biomass and

823
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:23,119
bacterial biomass that will dictate what

824
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,159
kind of plant will naturally or

825
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:30,239
grow really well in that system

826
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,240
when you are fairly devoid of fungi in a

827
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,919
system mainly you know bacteria is

828
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,399
present you're going to see a lot of

829
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,320
weeds growing in that system or early

830
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:43,278
successional plants when you have a lot

831
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:45,200
of like for example actinobacteria which

832
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:48,159
is a long chain bacteria it's

833
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,720
technically facultative but

834
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,240
it's a really good bacteria that you

835
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,319
want to see under your microscope if

836
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,599
you're going to grow early successional

837
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:59,278
plants like broccoli coal or kale

838
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,959
so if you plan on doing something like

839
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,960
that in a garden system you want some of

840
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,960
that early successional bacteria a

841
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,278
little bit of that facultative bacteria

842
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,720
will also help those plants as well

843
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:10,960
when you start to

844
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,440
further on later in succession when

845
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,880
you're going from the different so we

846
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,480
have different uh

847
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,320
successional plants you have weeds and

848
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,159
then you have early successional grasses

849
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,319
you have mid to late successional

850
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,240
grasses like meadows and then you have

851
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,319
row crops which is where you get into

852
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,839
your corn your wheat the things that we

853
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,759
do for production

854
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:30,959
and then from that point you're getting

855
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,759
into

856
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,558
shrubs and smaller trees and then all

857
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:39,038
the way to a full tree systems and then

858
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:41,200
the very end is old growth

859
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,440
forest where you're going to see

860
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,640
bacteria excuse me fungal to bacterial

861
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,679
ratios of at least three to one or

862
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,278
higher

863
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,120
and in those systems typically the

864
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:54,000
biomass of

865
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:56,000
bacteria and fungi is much much higher

866
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,960
than what you see in early successional

867
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,720
so a lot more of the bacteria and fungi

868
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,640
and then a higher ratio of fungi in

869
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,720
those older systems lots of great

870
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,559
information there you're on a roll with

871
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,720
uh with this good info let's just move

872
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:10,960
on to the next one getting right into

873
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,558
protozoa talk to us about that uh so

874
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,558
protozoa are a species of organisms that

875
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:18,398
we really want to see in our system

876
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,480
mainly because protozoa consumed the

877
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,879
most amount of bacteria per day

878
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,440
typically 10 000 bacteria per day that a

879
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,440
protozoan will consume so they're one of

880
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,919
the highest consumers of bacteria which

881
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,919
again is going to release most of those

882
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,278
nutrients the excess nutrients into our

883
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,200
soil systems

884
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:37,679
so they're extremely important when it

885
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,480
comes to our calculations

886
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,399
the

887
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,038
three main ones that we're looking for

888
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:45,278
the three main groups of

889
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:47,679
protozoa we're looking for are number

890
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:51,599
one flagellates which

891
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,519
they are um fairly small they're almost

892
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,319
kind of hard to see because they they

893
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,558
move around constantly and they bumble

894
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,319
around from spot to spot they don't

895
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,960
really have any kind of specific

896
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,200
movement it looks like a little pinball

897
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,720
machine in the shape of like a almost

898
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,399
looks like a little mouse sometimes

899
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,480
because it's kind of it has that like

900
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,079
oval shape and a little tail to usually

901
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,679
on the front of the back

902
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,599
and they're looking around for their

903
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,120
favorite bacteria to jump on an

904
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:18,558
aggregate and just start consuming all

905
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,079
those kinds of things

906
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,158
we love seeing flagellates they're

907
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,720
fairly small they're usually 5 to 15

908
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,240
micrometers in diameter

909
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,399
and

910
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,079
fun to watch fun to see them so we do

911
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:31,439
count those when we're doing our

912
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,240
assessments

913
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,919
amoeba which is uh essentially three

914
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,399
species of amoeba

915
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,320
um there's one which is our cellas which

916
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:43,759
look like a big

917
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,519
brown uh round donut uh really

918
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,679
um they're fairly large when you see

919
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,000
them they just look like this round blob

920
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,519
uh under your microscope they're again

921
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,880
they're they're quite large when you see

922
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,839
them usually

923
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,919
three to four times the size of a of a

924
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,678
flagellate and they they have uh

925
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,600
essentially an outer circle and then an

926
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,038
inner circle and the inner circle is

927
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,000
actually their mouth and they just kind

928
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:05,679
of like

929
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,240
they they float around in the system

930
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,840
like a baskin basking shark just with

931
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,919
their mouth open just waiting for things

932
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,119
to just float in there as they consume

933
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,480
it

934
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,798
uh test

935
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,839
and arcella's are a type of tested

936
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:19,918
amoeba

937
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:22,959
um the other kind of amoeba which is

938
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,720
specifically a testate amoeba

939
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,919
they have uh they're about half the size

940
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,240
maybe a third of the size of an arcella

941
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,240
they have an egg shape to their body and

942
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,679
then they have a test on the on the end

943
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,519
which looks like a flat part which is

944
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,798
where their mouth parts are

945
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,960
they'll typically have these little

946
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,798
tentacles from their mouthpieces that

947
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,720
they'll reach out and kind of swim

948
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,440
around and they'll grab bacteria and

949
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,360
bring it into their mouth parts

950
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,960
and these are the ones that we we like

951
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,879
to see because they're just constantly

952
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,798
consuming they don't move around that

953
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,559
much our cellos or test date amoebas

954
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,879
they just kind of sit there for the most

955
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,319
part if you really watch them for like

956
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,159
like 20 minutes sometimes i'm sitting

957
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,839
there watching them um you'll see them

958
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,278
slowly reach out of tentacle and just

959
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,639
start bringing all this bacteria into

960
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,679
their body

961
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,280
the last one which is pseudopods or

962
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,440
naked amoebas

963
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,919
these have no particular structure at

964
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,760
first it's hard to see them or find them

965
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,118
because they're just a blob

966
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,720
and

967
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,200
they ooze along

968
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,678
and their body structures will change in

969
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,519
different shapes and so one part will go

970
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,280
over here and grab some bacteria and

971
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,280
then it'll it'll it'll go in another

972
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,879
direction another uh

973
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,399
round looking appendage will come out

974
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,000
from another direction and they're

975
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:35,918
really cool to watch they're about the

976
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,960
size of a test date amoeba a little bit

977
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,039
smaller

978
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,760
um but again that's another one that we

979
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:43,440
count when we're counting uh the amoeba

980
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,000
in our calculations

981
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,760
um so those are the three main aerobic

982
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,599
ones that we're looking for

983
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,399
the last protozoan that we actually

984
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,000
count which lets us know if our systems

985
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,838
going in the wrong direction are

986
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,280
ciliates ciliates are very easy to see

987
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,679
they're usually the most fun to watch

988
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,839
because they have they're they're like

989
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,239
little speedy gonzales they go from spot

990
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:09,358
to spot in a real linear fashion they're

991
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:11,679
moving so fast under your microscope um

992
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:13,598
that you're just you're trying to to

993
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:15,279
just catch up with them and watch what

994
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,359
they're doing they're fun to watch

995
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,359
but uh too many under your microscope

996
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:21,920
slide if you're seeing one two that's

997
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:24,159
typically fine but if you're seeing five

998
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,480
six seven under a field of view in a

999
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,159
drop um your system's starting to go

1000
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,320
anaerobic and that's the creature the

1001
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:33,440
protozoan creature we we look to make

1002
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,760
sure that we're not going um anaerobic i

1003
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,358
was watching your microscope videos on

1004
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,200
your channel and

1005
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:42,239
exactly what you were explaining is what

1006
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:43,439
i saw in the videos especially the blob

1007
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,118
you mentioned

1008
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,159
it's like it's pretty crazy to see like

1009
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,160
there's no

1010
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,118
actual like shape but like the shape of

1011
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,920
the body

1012
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,240
just

1013
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,519
changes it's just a blob it's it's like

1014
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:55,039
you said difficult to see i thought that

1015
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,559
was like super interesting once i saw

1016
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,880
that one now one thing i noticed is that

1017
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,880
protozoa in particular when we get into

1018
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,800
microbial inoculants and i do have a

1019
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,880
question for you later on on microbial

1020
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,560
inoculants but not many microbial

1021
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,838
inoculants on the market actually have

1022
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:09,599
protozoa

1023
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,358
is there any reason why that would be

1024
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,559
the case

1025
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:14,880
um

1026
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:18,000
it's probably because a lot of people

1027
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,440
actually are struggle to find protozoa

1028
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,800
they're one of the most important

1029
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,838
creatures when it comes to our solar

1030
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,400
systems

1031
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:26,400
but finding them and getting to them to

1032
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,720
reproduce and propagate

1033
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,039
in a controlled system is actually

1034
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,959
kind of difficult

1035
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:35,039
once you have them you want to make sure

1036
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,720
that they're alive and

1037
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,480
replicating

1038
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,039
through binary vision

1039
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,159
which is essentially them splitting into

1040
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,679
another one um they they reproduce

1041
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,000
asexually so

1042
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:49,519
um as soon as they have enough uh food

1043
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,519
and they're in that system they just

1044
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,119
start to reproduce and split into

1045
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:54,320
multiple other ones

1046
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,800
but

1047
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:00,160
why they're not in certain

1048
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,640
inoculants it's hard to say um

1049
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:05,118
i i maybe there's a transportation issue

1050
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,719
or them going into dormancy that makes

1051
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,119
it hard

1052
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:11,519
i i personally haven't

1053
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,039
done a whole lot of reviews on people's

1054
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:16,800
uh microbial inoculations or products if

1055
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:18,960
people want to send them to me

1056
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,920
i'd be happy to review them

1057
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,320
um obviously it goes under pretty strict

1058
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,720
protocols when we do that um so if

1059
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,359
anybody's game sure send them to me and

1060
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,799
uh and i'll do as many assassins as i

1061
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:33,358
can and try to help and that's the

1062
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,920
majority of what we try to do as

1063
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:38,319
as lab techs and eventually consultants

1064
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,320
is we actually do uh not just working

1065
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,440
with farmers uh in agricultural

1066
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,680
production

1067
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,159
we work a lot with compost and compost

1068
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:49,118
producers which are essentially

1069
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,559
kind of you know the inoculation

1070
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,039
products that a lot of people are trying

1071
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,960
to produce i imagine that some of these

1072
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,039
living soil systems might be lacking in

1073
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,960
protozoa potentially i'm just a little

1074
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,519
theory here because they're inoculating

1075
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,599
with bacteria and fungi and nematodes

1076
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:04,880
and but the other protozoa like we just

1077
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,559
talked about it's

1078
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,039
somewhat rare in these microbial

1079
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,480
inoculants so who knows it might be rare

1080
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,800
in the system it could be thrown off a

1081
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,559
balance of the soil food web not really

1082
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,519
sure but that brings us into our next

1083
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:20,559
microorganism which is nematodes or

1084
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:23,519
nematodes tomatoes tomatoes right yeah

1085
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,838
talk to us about nematodes so nematodes

1086
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:28,239
uh are another important creature

1087
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:30,480
um again when you're talking about all

1088
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,799
these different predatory species the

1089
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,199
the more the merrier it brings more

1090
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,800
diversity into your soil systems which

1091
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,679
again is going to

1092
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,760
create just another um layer

1093
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,358
of creatures that are going to provide

1094
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,520
certain nutrition for your plant that

1095
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:48,480
maybe some other ones that do

1096
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:50,960
waste certain nutrients may not provide

1097
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,960
so having kind of a mixed bag of all the

1098
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,320
different kinds of predatory species is

1099
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,039
really important

1100
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,480
nematodes we typically will

1101
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,759
do that in the first part of our

1102
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,679
assessment

1103
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,440
to see how many that we have and what

1104
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:05,679
kinds that we have

1105
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,159
because there's essentially five

1106
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:10,399
we have bacterial which

1107
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,960
we identify all of these creatures by

1108
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,559
their digestive and mouth parts at 400

1109
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,280
magnification

1110
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:18,719
bacteria typically will have a

1111
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,280
cylindrical mouth

1112
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:23,358
with like a dual pumping system to pump

1113
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,280
bacteria in

1114
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:27,199
there's fungal feeders which essentially

1115
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,680
they have

1116
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,559
a spear that comes out of their mouth

1117
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:33,838
and that spear is obviously used to

1118
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,078
go into the

1119
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:38,559
fungal bodies and then extract the

1120
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,079
nutrients from it

1121
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:41,519
fungal feeders

1122
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,039
typically will have kind of some kind of

1123
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:46,159
pumping structure a single pumping

1124
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,838
structure in their digestive system

1125
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,078
there's also root feeders which are the

1126
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:53,119
ones we don't want in our system

1127
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,320
we recognize those by a similar spear

1128
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,280
that they have

1129
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,280
but

1130
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,720
the there's an appendage at the bottom

1131
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,839
of the spear that looks a lot like um

1132
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:06,639
uh male medicinal plant parts at the at

1133
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,559
the bot at the base of it uh

1134
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,559
and so those are the ones that we don't

1135
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,799
want in our system

1136
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,838
or we if we do see those in the system

1137
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,200
we want to make sure that we see

1138
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:16,719
predatory species that are going to

1139
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,318
consume those

1140
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,919
to balance out

1141
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:22,639
their damage that they may do to any

1142
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,400
root systems near our plants

1143
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:26,159
and the last ones are omnivores they

1144
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,920
essentially will eat anything that fits

1145
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,559
into their mouth

1146
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,159
predatory species are the largest and so

1147
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:33,519
we do things

1148
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:34,799
we have a couple procedures in the soul

1149
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,358
food web where we can do either

1150
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,680
protozoan infusions or nematode

1151
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:42,318
infusions and we use a specific way of

1152
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:44,879
using uh nematodes in a soil solution or

1153
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:45,599
a water solution and we actually suspend

1154
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,358
it

1155
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,800
and predatory species are are the

1156
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:50,799
biggest and they're also the heaviest so

1157
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,160
they sink to the bottom the fastest

1158
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,200
so it's kind of a way that we can kind

1159
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:57,440
of select for predatory species

1160
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:00,318
exclusively and then inject that into

1161
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,599
our system if we see the presence of

1162
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:03,440
root feeders

1163
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,200
it's pretty much endless when it comes

1164
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,880
to talking about microbes and there's

1165
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:08,639
just so many different species i mean

1166
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,559
here we're just kind of scratching the

1167
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:12,159
surface a little bit i know when we talk

1168
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:13,759
to scientists

1169
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:14,799
we don't know of all the microbes out

1170
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,640
there right there are some that we

1171
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,680
haven't even identified yet

1172
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:21,440
so uh it's really a field where you can

1173
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,199
just continue to learn and continue to

1174
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,318
learn and continue to learn for the rest

1175
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:26,480
of your life

1176
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:28,960
and that's one thing that really makes

1177
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,838
it exciting and fascinating to me at

1178
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,679
least

1179
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:34,159
and that's definitely an area where i

1180
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:36,000
plan to spend some time in researching

1181
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,799
and getting deeper and learning more so

1182
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,239
i might actually take dr elaine's course

1183
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,839
on that one because it seems like

1184
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,078
there's a lot of great information that

1185
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:45,759
she shares with her students there so

1186
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,920
but let's flip it up let's talk about

1187
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,520
composting and i know there's one type

1188
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,358
of composting in particular that you

1189
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,599
want to get deeper into

1190
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:56,000
thermophilic composting can you talk to

1191
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:59,039
us about what is thermophilic composting

1192
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,239
yeah so thermophilic composting is the

1193
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:05,119
main composting method we use for one of

1194
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:08,479
our biggest tools which is compost

1195
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,318
our two big tools that we use for

1196
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,559
replenishing systems is compost and a

1197
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,318
microscope so we use compost to make

1198
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,480
sure we're getting what we call

1199
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,800
biocomplete compost which is the compost

1200
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,559
that has all the creatures that we want

1201
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,240
the bacteria the fungi the nematodes the

1202
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:26,078
protozoa and everything in there to

1203
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:28,639
perpetuate more life and then we use our

1204
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,480
microscope to measure if that's going

1205
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:33,039
in the right direction and more are

1206
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,639
being created within our soil systems or

1207
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,079
are they dropping off for some reason is

1208
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,239
something else happening when it comes

1209
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,318
to thermophilic compost

1210
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,159
the reason why we're doing thermophilic

1211
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,239
compost is because

1212
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,639
what we want to do with that compost is

1213
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:48,318
heat it in a specific manner

1214
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:50,719
and there is essentially a schedule to

1215
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:53,039
this that we're trying to abide by but

1216
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:55,039
we're trying to get above 131 degrees

1217
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,639
fahrenheit for at least a three day

1218
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,838
period

1219
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:03,598
in that process we are uh essentially

1220
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:05,920
killing pathogens pests um so pests that

1221
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,280
may be in our our compost that may have

1222
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,838
gotten introduced somehow through some

1223
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,079
organic matter and then also weed seeds

1224
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,358
so whenever you're bringing compost and

1225
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,280
mixing it all together you're going to

1226
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:16,799
get you know some kinds of weed seeds in

1227
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,240
there or grass seeds or something else

1228
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,160
you really don't want

1229
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,679
and that thermophilic process

1230
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:22,960
essentially

1231
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,919
having

1232
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,838
three days of cooking time will kill the

1233
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,240
undesirables

1234
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,838
while also being able to maintain

1235
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,279
certain oxygen levels which we're

1236
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:37,838
usually shooting for a 50 moisture ratio

1237
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,560
is enough oxygen so that the good guys

1238
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:42,639
start reproducing and we start building

1239
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:45,440
a lot of them and then all the

1240
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,199
pathogenic or bad guys are starting to

1241
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,519
die off

1242
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,358
in some cases they'll go dormant

1243
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:53,759
but essentially

1244
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:55,199
their numbers are are getting uh cut

1245
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,280
further and further down so we're

1246
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,598
essentially selecting for the best

1247
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,119
microbes by using this schedule of

1248
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,200
getting it hot

1249
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,519
three days between turning at at least

1250
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:08,480
131 degrees fahrenheit

1251
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:11,440
below 170 degrees fahrenheit

1252
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,440
with a specific schedule to each turn

1253
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,920
and then when we turn the pile we turn

1254
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,838
the pile in a specific manner that

1255
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,838
essentially we we segregate it into

1256
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:22,480
three sections so we have the top the

1257
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:25,119
middle and then the bottom

1258
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,280
so whenever we've reached that three day

1259
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,039
131 at least

1260
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,119
fahrenheit temperature

1261
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:33,679
we take the top off the pile and we use

1262
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:36,400
kind of a wire cage to keep it a very a

1263
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:38,719
uniform cylinder we take the top off and

1264
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,720
we set it aside we take the middle and

1265
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:43,279
the middle becomes the new bottom

1266
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:45,118
after that the top becomes the new

1267
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,519
middle and then the bottom becomes the

1268
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,079
new top we do that process three times

1269
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:53,119
and then everything every third has has

1270
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,640
mixed equally in each area of the pile

1271
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,559
and so that's how we know that our

1272
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:57,838
compost is homogenous at least at that

1273
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,599
point

1274
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:02,000
some people that are shooting for usda

1275
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,318
certified will have to do two more turns

1276
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,358
and have a total of five turns to have

1277
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,838
usda certified compost okay and then

1278
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:12,000
thermophilic compost is this something

1279
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:13,838
that can be done in like a bin in the

1280
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
garage like i'm doing vermicompost right

1281
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:17,920
now i have a small bin

1282
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,760
in my garage and i'm able to add things

1283
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,159
in and there's worms in there and so on

1284
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,760
and so forth thermophilic composting can

1285
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:28,000
that be done inside in a bin or is this

1286
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,560
should certainly be done outside in a

1287
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
pile dr lane shows us

1288
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,199
typically in a barn on like a a concrete

1289
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,119
uh floor

1290
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,799
what they'll typically do is is have

1291
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,039
some kind of tarp to catch all the

1292
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,920
catchings of the stuff that'll fall and

1293
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:46,480
then she'll have a pallet on top of that

1294
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,000
and then wire mesh surrounding the pile

1295
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,318
so yeah you could certainly do it in a

1296
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,838
space inside of a garage

1297
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,318
now you want to make you want to make

1298
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:55,358
sure that your moisture content is 50

1299
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,719
percent

1300
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:59,759
and not too high or too low below that

1301
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,239
um

1302
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,560
when you can fill moisture and

1303
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,959
we call we do what's called a field test

1304
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,400
and you grab your compost or your

1305
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,240
ingredients to compost when you're first

1306
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,480
starting and if it feels wet but it

1307
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:15,598
doesn't stick together you're about 30

1308
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,760
percent moisture if it feels wet

1309
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,599
and you squeeze it and it clumps

1310
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,000
together but you don't get any drops out

1311
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:24,079
of your hands you're about 40 percent

1312
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,519
when you squeeze it and you get maybe

1313
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,440
one drop

1314
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,358
pulled up within your hand

1315
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,119
um you're looking at 50

1316
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:33,199
obviously from that point you get a

1317
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,358
couple drops out you're 60 you get

1318
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,598
multiple drops 70 and then if you're

1319
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:40,078
getting lots of water coming out then

1320
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,359
you're getting closer to 100 moisture

1321
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,079
being able to

1322
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:46,078
have that pile be aerobic using the wire

1323
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,839
and then having a pallet underneath is

1324
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,680
what you want the pile to be you want

1325
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,480
air to be able to travel in and out of

1326
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:52,559
it

1327
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,358
if you're in a dry climate like i am i

1328
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,119
actually wrap it in plastic to keep the

1329
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,358
moisture inside because i actually have

1330
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,200
an issue with losing moisture

1331
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,880
in my area if you're in a real tropical

1332
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,639
or humid environment

1333
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,559
you'd probably not cover it at all you'd

1334
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,960
probably just leave it out in the open

1335
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,559
with just with something to catch

1336
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,519
everything falling underneath it but

1337
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:16,480
you'd probably want to make sure that um

1338
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:18,239
you're getting more air uh not less air

1339
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,199
like i would need to in our desert

1340
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,279
climate

1341
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,118
okay and then what do you put in the

1342
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,920
pile to begin like how do you start this

1343
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,079
pile and then what can you put into the

1344
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,159
pile as you go along and what should you

1345
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,039
not put in the pile

1346
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:34,480
so once you have all your ingredients

1347
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,480
you actually want to build a pile that's

1348
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,719
approximately three feet high by three

1349
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,639
feet tall is kind of the base to what we

1350
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:42,879
do and the reason why we do that is

1351
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,639
because that's kind of the minimum size

1352
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,079
that you want in order to generate the

1353
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,960
kinds of temperatures that we're looking

1354
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,318
to do

1355
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,838
so again

1356
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:51,679
if you're doing inside the house you

1357
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:53,119
just want to make sure that your

1358
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:55,838
temperature you're monitoring your

1359
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:58,000
temperatures because a pile can get over

1360
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:59,679
180 degrees depending on how much

1361
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,639
nitrogen you add to the to the pile

1362
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:02,239
itself

1363
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:04,960
but once you build the pile you don't

1364
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:07,358
want to continue adding things to it

1365
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,199
there's different uh composting like

1366
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:11,358
static composting where you do add

1367
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:13,838
things over time but with thermophilic

1368
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:16,719
composting it's kind of um it's like

1369
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:18,719
making uh you know bread or a recipe of

1370
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:21,439
baking you you don't continually add

1371
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:23,358
stuff to the the batter after you've

1372
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,159
started the cooking process

1373
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:29,199
and so the three components you want to

1374
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,399
add to your compost pile is going to be

1375
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:33,439
carbon

1376
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,639
a nitrogen source and a high nitrogen

1377
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,800
source

1378
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:39,039
the more carbon diversity you can get

1379
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,880
the better so i'm actually going to be

1380
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:43,920
starting some

1381
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,200
of my consultant training soon and where

1382
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,519
i'm compiling all the different

1383
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:48,799
ingredients i need for my compost and so

1384
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:50,000
i'm using

1385
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,720
wood chips

1386
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,760
as a large portion of what would be

1387
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:58,078
considered 60 of the pile

1388
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,920
i'm also adding in paper shreddings so

1389
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,680
recycled paper and then i'm also adding

1390
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,119
in recycled cardboard which is a little

1391
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,118
thicker

1392
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,039
i'm only adding

1393
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,680
i would consider it six parts or six

1394
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:11,920
wheel barrels is how i use it so

1395
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:14,639
six wheel barrels equals my sixty

1396
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,639
percent of the pile that i need

1397
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:18,480
and that's it's a pretty good ratio of

1398
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,639
volume in order to get the size of the

1399
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,240
pile you need for the carbon side

1400
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,920
um and so you want the three different

1401
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,679
foods in there because

1402
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,760
fungi you'll get more diversity if you

1403
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,480
have different kinds of foods that are

1404
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,599
homogenous within that carbon source the

1405
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,920
second ingredient you're going to want

1406
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,280
to have is your green material or your

1407
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,760
nitrogen

1408
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,760
this could be any kind of silage it

1409
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,359
could be you know cut grass grass

1410
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,720
clippings

1411
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:46,960
it could be trimmings off your plants or

1412
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,399
trees

1413
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,519
weeds if you're pulling weeds and you

1414
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,880
have all this

1415
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,480
you know you know

1416
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,760
bag of weeds instead of throwing out a

1417
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,199
way to go to the landfill you can

1418
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,480
actually use that as your nitrogen

1419
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:01,118
component to your your compost system

1420
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,318
um the last one that we use is high

1421
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,920
nitrogen

1422
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:06,000
and uh

1423
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,318
so the carbon is the fungal resource or

1424
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,318
fungal foods the nitrogen essentially is

1425
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,079
bacterial food but the nitrogen or the

1426
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:13,759
green material actually helps keep our

1427
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,839
temperatures

1428
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,000
uh up where they need to be for an

1429
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,519
extended period of time so it's kind of

1430
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,880
like the um

1431
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,079
it's kind of like the fuel that keeps

1432
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,920
the fire going for a specific period the

1433
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,880
nitrogen is kind of like the lighter

1434
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,960
fluid it gets everything started quickly

1435
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,880
and that's typically uh we're using

1436
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,720
either using manure

1437
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,760
or if you're wanting to do like a vegan

1438
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:38,159
pile

1439
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,680
you can use alfalfa

1440
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:41,199
typically

1441
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:43,199
you want to use something that's fairly

1442
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:46,639
fresh alfalfa in order to put into the

1443
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:49,358
pile and also alfalfa depending on

1444
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:51,358
um if you have nitrifying bacteria or

1445
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:52,799
rhizobacteria within the root system of

1446
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:53,920
that alfalfa that's going to be really

1447
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,519
high

1448
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,920
nitrogen ratio

1449
00:50:55,519 --> 00:51:00,079
so you want to get those things equally

1450
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,079
mixed all together in the pile with that

1451
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,480
50 percent moisture

1452
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,160
and and essentially

1453
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,480
evenly mixed throughout the pile in

1454
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:10,558
order to make sure that everything cooks

1455
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,039
um the same throughout the entire

1456
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,880
process okay and then what tools do you

1457
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,119
need for this i mean you mentioned

1458
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,280
monitoring the temperature are using a

1459
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,358
temperature gun for this or using one of

1460
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,599
those temperature like that have the

1461
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:24,960
probes like used for cooking for example

1462
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,359
i have one of those you stick that into

1463
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,280
the pile and then also for you mentioned

1464
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,440
turning the pile is that just like your

1465
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,519
traditional pitchfork or or what tools

1466
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,599
are needed for this so yeah um you'll

1467
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:36,800
want some type of uh

1468
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,559
cade wire

1469
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,800
you can use really any kind of cage wire

1470
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,079
that will get you that three by three

1471
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,960
cylinder

1472
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:47,280
we usually put it on a recycled pallet

1473
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,720
and then again a tarp underneath when we

1474
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,160
turn the pile we definitely use

1475
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:52,078
pitchforks because it makes it much

1476
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:52,879
easier when things are stuck together to

1477
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,000
turn

1478
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:59,920
and put parts of the pile here and there

1479
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,039
i use some rio temp compost thermometers

1480
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,480
and you want to make sure you get one

1481
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:03,599
that's long enough to reach the center

1482
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,639
of the pile

1483
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,800
so

1484
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,960
when we're monitoring temperatures what

1485
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,559
we typically do is we'll measure to the

1486
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,039
center of the pile

1487
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,720
using our compost thermometer and then

1488
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:16,719
just kind of push it in and hold our

1489
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,799
finger there so that we make sure that

1490
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:21,279
we get the tip which is where the probe

1491
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,760
is uh in the center of the pile okay and

1492
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,400
then at what point is the compost ready

1493
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,880
to be used in your garden so um you're

1494
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,720
gonna do that turning process and again

1495
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,720
if you're if you're separating it into

1496
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,558
thirds you want three turns and then

1497
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:36,399
everything's mixed evenly

1498
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,760
if you're hitting that 131 degree

1499
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,559
temperature throughout a three-day

1500
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:43,040
period between turns

1501
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,559
then which obviously that

1502
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:47,358
amount of time

1503
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,839
between turns uh uh speeds up if your

1504
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:53,039
pile gets up to

1505
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:55,440
145 or 155 uh your your timeline of

1506
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:57,599
three days you know gets down to two and

1507
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,200
then if you're 165 degrees by the first

1508
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,359
day after the first day of assembling

1509
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,879
the pilot you got 24 hours you can turn

1510
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:04,799
it

1511
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,960
but and after you turn it three times

1512
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,318
sometimes it'll take up to five turns

1513
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,720
depending on how much nitrogen you have

1514
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:13,519
in the pile but once it starts to cool

1515
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:15,919
and it it drops below

1516
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,679
that 131 degrees and starts to fall into

1517
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,079
that 80 degree

1518
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:22,719
temperature at that point your compost

1519
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,599
is pretty much ready to to use at that

1520
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:25,118
point

1521
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,800
you could always test it out to make

1522
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,880
sure you're not getting any specific hot

1523
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,559
spots within the pile or you can kind of

1524
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,240
mix it a little bit

1525
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,079
a little bit more

1526
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:35,838
once you essentially have finished

1527
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,519
cooking and turning it

1528
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:40,078
but that at that point i've used i've

1529
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:41,920
used my compost with a little bit of

1530
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,318
you know either dirt from outside or

1531
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,639
some bagged soil that we may have just

1532
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:48,480
lying around and i've thrown seeds

1533
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:51,039
directly into that and they don't get

1534
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,199
burnt they actually grow really well

1535
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:54,800
and they all they have already all those

1536
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:56,239
organisms around them once they're

1537
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,318
starting to germinate that are actually

1538
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:00,159
going to help them continue

1539
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,719
the rest of their production so it's a

1540
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:05,519
pretty relatively quick process

1541
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:06,879
turnaround time there now are you

1542
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:08,400
since you have a microscope are you

1543
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,000
actually taking a sample of that looking

1544
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,079
under the microscope before you add it

1545
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,599
into your plants for example you know

1546
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,920
top dressing or whatever

1547
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,359
i am i am and and the main reason why

1548
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,760
i'm doing that is because i'm trying to

1549
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:22,000
make sure that um even even i will make

1550
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,839
a mistake and and have a situation where

1551
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,159
part of the compost maybe when anaerobic

1552
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:28,880
or i put it into storage and

1553
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:31,440
it didn't quite maybe the top is aerobic

1554
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,000
but the bottom's anaerobic and so yeah

1555
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,280
i'll typically do a periodic check

1556
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,639
using my

1557
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,359
test tubes which you can watch the

1558
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:41,199
videos to know how to do a sample

1559
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,358
and kind of look in there and just make

1560
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:45,838
sure the organisms that i'm seeing

1561
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:50,239
are all aerobic i'm not seeing a whole

1562
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:52,960
bunch of ciliates or pathogenic bacteria

1563
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:54,318
or oh my seats which are the fungi that

1564
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,358
are typically

1565
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:58,159
when you look at them under the

1566
00:54:55,358 --> 00:55:00,880
microscope uh the difference between an

1567
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:03,759
aerobic and an anaerobic fungi

1568
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:06,880
aerobic usually have some type of color

1569
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,160
their structures are uniform in diameter

1570
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,640
and they typically have what's called

1571
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:13,199
septation what looks like these little

1572
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:15,279
like cross walls as you're looking at

1573
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:17,199
the structure that are kind of

1574
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,280
separating into like these almost looks

1575
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:21,838
like uh like it was specifically

1576
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,720
measured and they're like all one inch

1577
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:26,880
apart so a uniform septation as well

1578
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:29,679
those are aerobic creatures typically

1579
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,519
the ends of where their tip cell is is

1580
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:34,078
usually flat

1581
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:37,519
so it's very uniform looking creature

1582
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:39,599
that ends up being a soil organism but

1583
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,559
when you get into oh my seats the bad

1584
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,400
stuff

1585
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,400
they look like um

1586
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,880
almost like a like a cactus

1587
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,519
under the microscope they're wispy so

1588
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,000
they have like a lot of structures that

1589
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:54,480
are going all different directions

1590
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,280
their structures are lumpy and bumpy and

1591
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:00,318
look kind of like bubbly they don't have

1592
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:03,280
usually color they're usually colorless

1593
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:04,719
their uh diameters are usually on the

1594
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,119
smaller side

1595
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,239
and it's nothing's uniform about it it's

1596
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,880
basically

1597
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:12,078
it looks like a like a fungal strain

1598
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,960
but it's

1599
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:17,200
it's chaotic it's not as structured as

1600
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,358
an aerobic fungi would be i need to get

1601
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:20,239
my hands on a microscope asap because

1602
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:22,639
i'm just

1603
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:24,879
it makes me wonder like how many bad

1604
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:26,480
bacteria i have in my system you know

1605
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,400
and you don't know unless you have a

1606
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,440
microscope so that's definitely

1607
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,200
something i'm gonna have to pick up in

1608
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,358
the future so i want to circle back to

1609
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:35,598
microbial inoculants for a minute here

1610
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,598
there are so many people now using

1611
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:39,680
microbial inoculants and like we

1612
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,880
mentioned earlier it's a lot of bacteria

1613
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,039
and fungi

1614
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,358
some have nematodes in them as well but

1615
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:47,279
a lot of people are over using it you

1616
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:49,440
know they're they're applying it way

1617
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,599
more than they should i imagine that

1618
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,440
there's an imbalance in the soil food

1619
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,119
web that could potentially be causing

1620
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,880
some sort of damage but i want to open

1621
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,599
up this question to you and just kind of

1622
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,039
a big broad question here is what advice

1623
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,200
do you have for someone who's using

1624
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:06,079
microbial inoculants if you're not

1625
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:08,719
investing into a microscope and you're

1626
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,960
just adding things into a soil system

1627
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:12,879
um it is guesswork but you can still

1628
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,199
experiment on the amounts that you're

1629
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,838
you're giving to the plants

1630
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:20,639
what will happen is if you don't have

1631
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:23,119
enough organic material within your soil

1632
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,318
system those inoculants that you're

1633
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,920
adding

1634
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:27,838
they won't have enough food to survive

1635
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,559
so they'll basically just die

1636
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:32,239
um that decay process could lead to

1637
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,880
something that's anaerobic

1638
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:37,199
um but again without a microscope it's

1639
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,358
it's it's more or less trial and error

1640
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:41,598
so it is kind of a longer process but

1641
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:43,838
what i would do is if you're using

1642
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,680
uh microbial inoculants without a

1643
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:48,159
microscope

1644
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:50,399
record how much you're using and the

1645
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:52,078
effect that it has on the plant

1646
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,639
and you can either increase or decrease

1647
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,640
depending on how the plant reacts

1648
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:58,719
in some cases some plants will react

1649
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,239
better than others even if it's the same

1650
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:02,879
species of plant

1651
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:06,479
so it's not always an exact science if

1652
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:09,119
you don't have all the data that you're

1653
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,318
able to quantify so again it's one of

1654
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,039
those things that i would i would create

1655
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:14,719
a log book i would see what uh your

1656
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:16,798
plants are doing how they react how

1657
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:18,798
certain plants react

1658
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:21,039
because some different cultivars may

1659
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:22,480
want more than others or react different

1660
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,599
than others

1661
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,199
but if you can get your hands on a

1662
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,559
microscope

1663
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:29,919
and you can

1664
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:33,359
use that same data set and data

1665
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:35,119
logs with a microscope even if you

1666
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:37,358
can just use some of my videos and just

1667
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:39,280
recognize what you're looking at and

1668
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:41,838
being able to say like okay i see more

1669
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,400
activity now than i did

1670
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:48,078
a week ago or two weeks ago

1671
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:50,000
so the the microbes are starting to

1672
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,240
self-sustain in this system and they're

1673
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,239
doing well it's just another tool in

1674
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:55,838
your tool belt to be able to measure the

1675
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,959
success of what you're doing with your

1676
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:59,599
plants

1677
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:02,559
even if you're just a novice at using

1678
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:04,960
um the microscope everybody can take

1679
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,640
notes and kind of track where they're

1680
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,720
going from that point i think that's

1681
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:10,719
some really good advice man you revealed

1682

00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:34,160
uh k underscore the guy

1692
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,160
i'm currently working on the final three

1693
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:37,920
stages of my consultancy program for the

1694
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:38,960
soul food web

1695
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,400
and

1696
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,679
i'm going to be doing more composting

1697
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:46,798
videos extract videos t videos on that

1698
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:49,039
entire process and in order to get my

1699
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:49,920
certification i have to take

1700
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:53,679
a

1701
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:56,400
a part of land that's devoid of of

1702
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:58,480
essentially activity uh biological

1703
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,000
activity and i have to turn it into one

1704
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,679
that's

1705
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,760
full of life and full of different

1706
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:07,118
activity and so that process is actually

1707
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,880
it's it's not that easy it actually

1708
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,358
takes months at a time sometimes in

1709
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,880
order to do so people can more or less

1710
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:17,440
get to follow along with what i'm doing

1711
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,280
uh on all the different inoculations and

1712
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,838
