1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
coming up on garden talk it can cause

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,399
the tomatoes to split you know and

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,480
that's something that like happens all

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,638
the times to people and they ask me like

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,320
why my tomatoes are splitting you know

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,480
but you have to think that all those

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,519
vertical space around it all the walls

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,760
fans

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,000
anything that it's around could be used

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,160
to train plants or to grow plants

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,160
vertically and you're gonna have a plant

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,518
with the same exact genetic as the plant

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,320
that you have like growing your watering

14
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,558
and like the water splashes back to the

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,600
leaves and these carry on like

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,000
any sort of disease like blight all we

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,079
need to nurture the plants we don't need

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,719
to apply like anything else anything

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,200
specific they can just thrive by

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,039
creating the right conditions and

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,079
leaving you know the

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,800
biodiversity to develop above the soil

23

i'm doing good good thanks for asking

95
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,840
i'm excited for this episode we're going

96
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,519
to be talking about growing tomatoes so

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,759
really we're going to be covering from

98
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,759
seed all the way to harvest so i think

99
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,518
this is going to be a good beginner

100
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,639
friendly discussion

101
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,840
not really a discussion i think you're

102
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,479
going to be doing most of the talking

103
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,400
here full disclaimer i don't grow

104
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,079
tomatoes right now i'm looking to grow

105
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
tomatoes so i think it's going to be

106
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,920
really helpful for me to be able to pick

107
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,798
your brain on how to go about it so that

108
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,158
way when i do go ahead and attempt to

109
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,680
grow them you know i would have better

110
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,359
success rate than if i didn't have this

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,280
conversation with you so yeah really

112
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,760
excited for this one you know we kind of

113
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,519
talked about this before we recorded as

114
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,840
a lot of my audience grows medicinal

115
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,759
varieties right now so as far as coming

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,040
onto the vegetable side of things any

117
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,519
type of vegetables whether it be

118
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,080
tomatoes any leafy greens or just

119
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,720
anything beyond that people are probably

120
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,478
a large majority of my audience doesn't

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,720
grow it maybe they're beginners maybe

122
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,399
they're looking to grow them or maybe

123
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,479
they just started growing them and

124
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,758
they're looking for more tips so again i

125
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,039
think that this conversation is going to

126
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,040
be awesome because it's not only going

127
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,040
to provide me information on how to do

128
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,360
it and help me but it's also my audience

129
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,520
as well but first things first let's get

130
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,040
into an introduction so can you tell us

131
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,719
a little bit about yourself and kind of

132
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,759
how you got into gardening

133
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,120
oh yeah yeah um so i started as a kid

134
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,479
with my grandpa

135
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
um

136
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,758
so i would say probably when i was two

137
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,520
or three

138
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,639
i used to spend time with him in the

139
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,159
garden uh until the age of 10. but

140
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,720
obviously i didn't learn that much you

141
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,039
know even if like he told me pretty much

142
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,240
everything about like the living soil

143
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,079
and how to cooperate with nature rather

144
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,120
than using like chemicals and all these

145
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:19,439
kind of things but then um

146
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,639
i had to you know leave it a bit inside

147
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:26,319
to dedicate to my career so

148
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,600
i started um you know um thinking about

149
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,199
tattoos as you can tell and and i moved

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,560
to london and the first impact with

151
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,120
london was you know a great city uh

152
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,360
catholic and i really couldn't find a

153
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,680
place where you know spend time and

154
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,280
disconnect you know and like be a bit

155
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,918
more in touch with nature you know even

156
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:49,198
if you know it's one of the greener city

157
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:51,599
in the world so uh so what i did like i

158
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,680
started i i got really interested in the

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,120
growing vegetable and i started on a

160
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,360
balcony at first

161
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,519
um but it was you know it was something

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,600
really small and it was

163
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,758
most case scenario was like seats that i

164
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,280
bought from the store uh like i don't

165
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,600
know i finished to eat a chili or

166
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,119
something i would split it up you know

167
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
and plant the seeds

168
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,360
but then um i got

169
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,439
more interest into it like and i was

170
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,600
like i need to know more and more so i

171
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,959
started researching and starting you

172
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,080
know different techniques of growing

173
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,560
food and i moved to a house with a

174
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,478
bigger garden and i started planning and

175
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,399
planting my first year was

176
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,120
a bit of a disaster because i couldn't

177
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,279
really grow many things

178
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,639
but then you know like by failing i

179
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,038
learned a lot

180
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,759
uh even if i could read the same exact

181
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:42,000
thing on a book i had to try myself you

182
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,080
know um

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,800
and yeah i moved roughly five or six

184
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,599
times and like over the course of seven

185
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,400
years

186
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,960
and

187
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,839
each time i had to carry my glass

188
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,478
greenhouse my soil

189
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:59,519
raised beds everything everything like

190
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:02,560
to a new garden to a new growing space

191
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,719
but yeah now i got to a point that

192
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,800
i moved to a house and i've been here

193
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,599
for like three years

194
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,759
um

195
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,439
and yeah i managed to

196
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,360
grow a lot of food especially during the

197
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,399
full season i can provide something like

198
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,038
50 60 for myself and my girlfriend of

199
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,399
like the total uh need of like

200
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,879
vegetables

201
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,519
so so yeah that's that's pretty much it

202
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,839
that's how i started and like where i am

203
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,478
right now awesome and now you also have

204
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,879
a youtube channel which is very popular

205
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,439
you have over 25 000 subscribers very

206
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,120
good quality videos i enjoy them yeah

207
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,199
i'm really interested in photography and

208
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,759
videography as well

209
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,400
so over the past 18 months

210
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,840
i've been learning editing videos and

211
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,519
like um you know um pictures and all

212
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,439
these kind of things i do it every night

213
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,758
after my full-time job

214
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,959
and yeah and i started the channel a bit

215
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,160
as a joke

216
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,159
but then

217
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,400
i really enjoyed explaining people how

218
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,680
to grow their own food in an organic way

219
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,439
you know so so yeah now i do it like

220
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,199
every single week i post a new video on

221
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,120
the channel that's awesome congrats on

222
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,960
all your success so far it was actually

223
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,360
a viewer that commented on one of my

224
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,120
videos and recommended that i i talked

225
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,720
to you on a podcast episode so that's

226
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,478
how that's all we're here today so thank

227
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,000
you to that viewer that recommended

228
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,478
alessandro to come on here so

229
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,639
cool so what would you say before we get

230
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,639
deep into tomatoes what would you say is

231
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,960
your style of gardening i mean are you

232
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,158
an indoor grower outdoor do you go in

233
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:37,278
soil cocoa hydroponics are you organic

234
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:41,038
or synthetic what's your grow style so

235
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:43,519
um i do i do everything mostly outdoor

236
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,838
except if like growing gourmet mushrooms

237
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,560
or micro greens that i do indoor

238
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,640
uh but other than that i prefer to

239
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,039
you know i tried hydroponic i tried

240
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,120
different styles but

241
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,958
no offense for all the growers doing

242
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,159
hydroponic i still love it you know but

243
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,639
i feel

244
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:04,000
more connected to to nature whenever i

245
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:08,319
put my hands into the soil you know so i

246
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
started making my own uh mix of like you

247
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,040
know i was researching how to create a

248
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,399
perfect mix uh adding perlite or

249
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,639
um adding uh work work casting uh

250
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,559
compost in the right ratio and all that

251
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,679
but then at some point

252
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,919
sorry i met uh charles dowding which is

253
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,958
an amazing grower in uk

254
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,919
who invented a method called a nordic

255
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:35,599
gardening which basically means that

256
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:37,838
so you can grow in any area even if you

257
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,480
have weeds or grass growing you just

258
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,880
need to apply a layer of cardboard in

259
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,720
the case that you have weeds or grass

260
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:48,159
and and if not you can do it without the

261
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,600
cardboard and wet the cardboard and then

262
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:54,799
add 15 centimeters of compost and that's

263
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,360
a fully organic method that it's a

264
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:00,559
minimal disturbance so you don't dig as

265
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,519
the name implies and you just simply i

266
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,278
use a deeper which is um

267
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,440
a wooden

268
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:12,399
sort of thick stick that i used to to

269
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,160
create an hole and then i plant the

270
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,559
plant without even

271
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,719
tapping the soil around it but literally

272
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,278
just leaving the plant to

273
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,278
settle the roots whenever i would and so

274
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:27,600
a minimal disturbance you know and what

275
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:29,439
i do it's 100 organic i try to

276
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,959
use different techniques including

277
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,839
permaculture so the closed loop system i

278
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,719
i don't have any wastage in the in the

279
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,480
garden

280
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,320
and also um i use jadam which is a

281
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,159
korean natural farming

282
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,079
and so i i try to you know use what's

283
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,240
cheap and available around my area and

284
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,078
convert it into things that i can you

285
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,000
know valuable things that i can use in

286
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,359
the garden to grow food that's awesome

287
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,240
yeah so it sounds like you're doing a

288
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,759
lot of things that are real

289
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,480
environmentally friendly which is

290
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,480
awesome yeah really cool that's the goal

291
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,440
let's get into the variety of tomatoes i

292
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,039
think that's one thing that you

293
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,399
mentioned that you want to talk about to

294
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,240
kind of begin you know i watched a

295
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,159
couple of videos you have on tomatoes

296
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,440
you have some beautiful harvests of

297
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,838
tomatoes with a whole bunch of different

298
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,519
varieties can you talk to us about the

299
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,279
different varieties of tomatoes you know

300
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,240
determinate versus indeterminate so on

301
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,838
and so forth so yeah um

302
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,039
in most case scenario whenever you buy a

303
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,600
packet of seeds it should say

304
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:31,199
determinate or indeterminate varieties

305
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,159
at the back so the termini means simply

306
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,920
like

307
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,439
a plant that grows to a set of

308
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,879
leaves and fruit

309
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,200
so so it doesn't grow too tall and also

310
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,720
whenever it reached the um

311
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,560
right height

312
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,360
you don't have to do anything else it

313
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,278
just stops and you produce most of the

314
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,440
fruits at once

315
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,600
uh so the cool thing about this variety

316
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,959
is that you don't have to prune you

317
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,600
don't have to remove the suckers for

318
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:02,078
example i'm gonna get to the suckers as

319
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,000
well i'm gonna explain what it is and

320
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:07,199
and also um

321
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,120
yeah it's for people that don't want to

322
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,000
take too much space in the garden you

323
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,240
know it could be for a variety of reason

324
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,919
and then we got indeterminate varieties

325
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,480
which means that it's a plant that it

326
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,199
doesn't grow to a set height but it

327
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,839
keeps growing and it keeps producing

328
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,360
suckers so it needs a constant pruning

329
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,440
and tall trellis so so you don't you

330
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,879
know break the plants because break the

331
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,279
plants for the

332
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:36,399
weight of the fruit that keeps growing

333
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,720
and yeah i personally prefer to grow

334
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,480
indeterminate varieties but they're both

335
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,079
really great

336
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,519
uh it's just because i prefer to prune

337
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:49,120
and guide the plant like on trellis for

338
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,440
the whole season and having something

339
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,360
that keeps producing at different times

340
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,240
rather than having like a you know a

341
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,120
huge harvest all at once okay that makes

342
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,839
sense

343
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,200
so

344
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,959
once growers have an understanding of

345
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,639
that you know you can either start from

346
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,879
by planting seeds

347
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,759
or by buying a plant from a local

348
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,278
nursery can you talk to us about you

349
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,439
know some of the differences maybe like

350
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,838
pros and cons you know

351
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,240
buying seeds or actually getting seeds

352
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,639
from a tomato and then planting it

353
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,720
versus buying at your local nursery you

354
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:25,039
have any tips on any of that

355
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,920
yeah um so for any grower i would

356
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,439
discourage them from buying plants i did

357
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,838
before but from buying plants from the

358
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,000
nursery just because

359
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,000
you don't know how they grow them so

360
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,958
potentially they could have odds like

361
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,159
you know

362
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:43,599
chemicals or slow release fertilizer

363
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:46,000
anything that you're not aware of so

364
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,399
like the best advice and also more

365
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,360
satisfying is to start from seed all the

366
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,639
times i try to grow mostly heritage

367
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,159
varieties

368
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,839
there are different kinds of seeds as

369
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:00,480
well uh like you can find hybrids you

370
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,639
can find seeds that are open pollinated

371
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,399
which means the like uh

372
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,799
it's not like

373
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,440
you you're not assured that the year

374
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,278
after you have the same exact plant but

375
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,839
you could have something a bit different

376
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,720
or you can buy heritage varieties which

377
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:20,079
are varieties that basically like they

378
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,278
managed to stabilize like and have like

379
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,838
um

380
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,399
a variety that it was like with good

381
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,320
qualities or anything like that the it's

382
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,198
passed on from generation after

383
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,680
generation and this is the one like the

384
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,599
old i mean the varieties that in my

385
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,319
opinion are worth

386
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,120
saving seats as well and and you know

387
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,480
passing on as well these uh seed

388
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,360
sovereignty

389
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,360
um

390
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,959
yeah it's something that it's really

391
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,199
really important

392
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,319
in the modern society because like big

393
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:51,439
companies

394
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,959
try to

395
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,360
uh you know

396
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:58,479
uh take away the confidence from the

397
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,519
farmers so this means like refers or to

398
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,000
refer all the times to the expert you

399
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,639
know and and so

400
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,958
uh the farmer uh it's not so it's

401
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,600
deprived from confidence and all the

402
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,119
times that like he needs to grow or even

403
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,879
like the small grower not necessarily

404
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,480
like the farmer and all the times that

405
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,679
you need to grow something like you

406
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,399
refer to

407
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,838
to whoever it says that knows you know

408
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,039
better than you

409
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,560
but um yeah it's something that you know

410
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:30,958
um yeah a hundred percent like

411
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,359
you learn much more if you start from

412
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,719
seed rather than like a plant that you

413
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,278
buy from

414
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,199
from the nursery you know okay

415
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,519
so you've bought your seeds or you've

416
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,679
gotten seeds from a tomato ready to

417
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,600
plant into a mix you talked a little bit

418
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,679
about the mix that you use can we get a

419
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,560
little bit deeper into it so you know

420
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:52,799
what's an ideal mix an idea of soil for

421
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,679
tomatoes to be grown in yeah so tomatoes

422
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:59,039
are heavy feeders so this means that

423
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,919
like they require a lot of feed to grow

424
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:01,519
um

425
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,639
so i would recommend either like

426
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,159
planting like companion plants so using

427
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,039
plants to

428
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:11,679
work you know uh in

429
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,399
kind of a symbiotic effect with them

430
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:17,120
with a tomato so they help the plant to

431
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,759
grow and they help each other or to use

432
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,959
a mix that has like a good ratio of like

433
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,800
a compost and wall casting you know so

434
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,239
something that like the tomato can feed

435
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,359
whenever they need to

436
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,440
uh or

437
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,600
like as i said before i use the nordic

438
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,600
method which is straight compost so i

439
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,399
don't add anything else rather than

440
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,879
compost and like whenever the plants

441
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,958
need needs it you know they can just

442
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,639
take whatever nutrient they need and

443
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,439
like and keep growing

444
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,600
or alternatively you can use uh even

445
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,560
like um

446
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,680
so

447
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,000
like

448
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,519
feeding like tea you know like won't

449
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,958
like you for example you grab the worm

450
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,440
casting you put it in a bucket and you

451
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:00,000
add like um an air pump and you let it

452
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,920
go for 24 hours and then all the

453
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,519
microbial activity the microorganism

454
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,558
keeps multiplying and then you can apply

455
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,279
to the soil and transfer all these

456
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:12,160
beneficial microorganisms and uh you

457
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,480
know nutrients to the soil so yeah there

458
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,160
are options like if you're a beginner i

459
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,959
would say i would suggest to not make it

460
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,319
over complicated just go to the your

461
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,600
local garden center ask for an organic

462
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,519
premix

463
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,078
and you can start from there then you

464
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:30,558
know if you get passionate if you get uh

465
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,319
like um really into gardening then you

466
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:35,119
can start you know planning on how to

467
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,720
make your own or different techniques on

468
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,000
on how to make it you know i think

469
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,319
that's really good advice you know

470
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,558
especially for beginners a lot of folks

471
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,798
will start off with that bagged soil

472
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,879
that bagged mix here over in the states

473
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,839
very popular as fox farm ocean forest

474
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,360
soil fox farm happy frog roots organic

475
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,359
so are you saying that they could start

476
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,519
in any one of those bag soils and then

477
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,639
kind of improve from there

478
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,599
yeah 100

479
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,919
yeah or even form like you know if you

480
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,319
manage to make your own compost at home

481
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,200
you can start like using that just try

482
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,599
compost so some yeah easy as that

483
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,279
reducing your wastage and reusing it

484
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,480
into the garden you know

485
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,160
okay and then as far as a container size

486
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,480
to plant into you know a lot of my

487
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,558
audience is home growers indoors you can

488
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,759
either plant in containers i know that

489
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,519
you use raised beds outdoors yeah can

490
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,839
you talk to us about containers like

491
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,079
what's like the smallest container size

492
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,240
that you can successfully grow tomatoes

493
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,599
in without worrying about

494
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,160
you know problems happening because

495
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,599
they're in too small of a container yeah

496
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,160
so

497
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,079
there are loads loads of informations

498
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,120
online like different recommendations on

499
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,319
how to

500
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,558
grow there and like what size to use and

501
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,399
all different devices you know but i

502
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:51,279
tried it myself

503
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,038
in

504
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,558
many many different containers and even

505
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,679
like a

506
00:18:54,558 --> 00:19:01,359
15 20 liters container it's more than

507
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,919
enough to uh start you know growing a

508
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,719
plant and bring it to fruit you know

509
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,440
it's it's a plant that literally like

510
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,798
it's really resilient and it grows

511
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,840
even if you

512
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:16,240
make like many damages to the roots or

513
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:19,119
the plant itself it's gonna keep growing

514
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,440
especially in determinate varieties so

515
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,079
uh that's why i highly recommend it for

516
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,880
a beginner you know so it's it's great

517
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,918
to

518
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,360
to experiment you know even if you have

519
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,120
i saw many people using like now um

520
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,519
airpods or

521
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,599
um fabric pots

522
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,359
which is what i use if i'm growing

523
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,678
tomatoes in container

524
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:44,159
and and they work great because yeah you

525
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,600
have a lot of variation at the root

526
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,640
level and you don't have like

527
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,798
uh issues like

528
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,080
the level of moisture to hike

529
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,480
like

530
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,480
most beginners have you know like that's

531
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,679
like most common issue like over

532
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,240
watering

533
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,840
so so yeah uh i would suggest you to

534
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,159
experiment with like fabric port or

535
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:09,519
airport and yeah now

536
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,280
transplanting let's get a little bit

537
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,440
into that because i know

538
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,440
for indoor growers in particular a lot

539
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,120
of people are limited on space and

540
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,360
you've done actually done several videos

541
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,439
on how to grow in small spaces and stuff

542
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,879
like that but let's say hypothetically

543
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,640
they're starting in a small container

544
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,960
right so they have their seedling

545
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,600
in a small container it sprouts at what

546
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,279
point would you transplant into a larger

547
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,279
container and then

548
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,879
would you transplant multiple times like

549
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,558
with some other plants

550
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,000
some folks will go from like a small

551
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:41,599
solo cup to a one gallon container up to

552
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
their final container which three

553
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,839
gallons five gallons seven gallons so on

554
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,440
and so forth talked about transplanting

555
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:51,038
a little bit with tomatoes okay so

556
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,120
so the first rule to check when your

557
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:55,200
plant is ready to be transplanted is to

558
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,839
so there are some drainage uh holes at

559
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,000
the bottom so you literally you can just

560
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,319
uh lift the plant and check at the

561
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,359
bottom if there are some roots poking

562
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,759
out

563
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,558
this means uh or

564
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:11,919
even worse if the roots are poking up so

565
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,759
above the soil this means that like the

566
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,038
root mass doesn't have enough space to

567
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,679
grow so it's looking for new space

568
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:22,480
and so what you need to do is to

569
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,640
move it to a new container um

570
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,079
and this is why another reason why i

571
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,080
don't recommend buying plants from the

572
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,558
nursery because most case scenario they

573
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,399
are root bounded which means that the

574
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,519
plant they left it to grow too much in

575
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:39,038
the same container so the roots took the

576
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:41,759
shape of the container and now like

577
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:45,279
it's uh it's almost a concrete mass that

578
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:47,599
it's it's harder to break and so the the

579
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,519
roots can suffocate themselves so the

580
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:52,480
best thing uh coming back to

581
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:55,200
transplanting is to transplant a tomato

582
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,480
plant as deep as possible so you can go

583
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,279
straight into a big container so what i

584
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,319
do usually i start in a small pot even

585
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,480
um

586
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,038
let's say plastic cup size and from

587
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,720
there i go straight into my raised bed

588
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,038
um

589
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,919
what you need to do is to well break the

590
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:16,158
root mass if it's it like like we said

591
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,640
if it's too tangled up

592
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,640
uh don't be scared of like breaking it

593
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,720
because as i said it's a really reciting

594
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,400
plant it's most people you know they

595
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,000
remove a few roots and they're worried

596
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,600
that they damage the plant but now you

597
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,759
can you can remove as many roots as you

598
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,759
want except that you don't you don't

599
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,200
remove them completely and then if you

600
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,558
check along the plant along the main

601
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,558
stem there are some whiter and those

602
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:41,599
whiter are called

603
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:44,079
trichomes and they could be uh glandular

604
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:47,119
trichomes or non-glandular trichomes so

605
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,250
glandular glandular trichlams are

606
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,759
basically um

607
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,919
[Music]

608
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,720
they they turn both first of all into

609
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,280
roots new roots so this means this is

610
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,400
why i'm saying like plant it as deep as

611
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,480
possible

612
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,880
because all this white hair they're

613
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,360
going to turn into into roots i usually

614
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,080
remove the bottom lids and i plant it

615
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,599
really deep so then all these whites are

616
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,519
turning into roots and you're gonna have

617
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,000
like a really solid you know root system

618
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,038
and the plants can grow pretty big

619
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,919
um

620
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:21,359
and they also help the plant to be

621
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,960
protected from uh rain or uh you know

622
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,759
climate

623
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,919
and from uh pests

624
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,679
so so that they got different functions

625
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,559
these trichomes

626
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,120
so so you can go straight as i say into

627
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:37,599
a big container there is no need to

628
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,038
transplant into a medium one a bigger

629
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:42,240
one and a bigger one

630
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:45,839
and and yeah and the plants uh yeah

631
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,079
gonna develop super quick because

632
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,480
i saw tomatoes literally like growing

633
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,399
that i was going into the garden one day

634
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,120
and they were 10 centimeters and the day

635
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,480
after like they were 15 20 centimeters

636
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:57,918
and i was like what you know what

637
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,200
happened

638
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,038
yeah and

639
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,960
and it's so satisfying to see this plant

640
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:04,558
growing as well i i it's one of my

641
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,200
favorite let's switch it up let's talk

642
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,678
about feeding nutrients or fertilizing

643
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,360
the plant right so let's say they start

644
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,360
in that small container they transplant

645
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,918
it into a larger container or their

646
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:18,240
raised bed at some point i assume that

647
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,240
the soil is going to be depleted of the

648
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,558
nutrients that it needs to grow right so

649
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,319
at what point would they feed and what

650
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:26,158
would they feed um

651
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,960
so

652
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,000
what i used to feed the tomatoes um

653
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,400
it's

654
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,240
you would as i said you could uh grab

655
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,400
this uh bag of soil uh pre-mix

656
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,278
uh like there was a brand i don't

657
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,840
remember the name now but basically um

658
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:46,798
it was uh pre-made with all the

659
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,319
nutrients start to finish for a plant so

660
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,400
you don't have to do anything else at

661
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,720
that point which is great for someone

662
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,919
like starting to to feed a plant to grow

663
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,319
up plants

664
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,360
or alternatively you know um

665
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,720
you can

666
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:03,119
use uh something that like you know i

667
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,278
don't really like to buy things or

668
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,918
that are claimed to be organic from the

669
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,880
shop because loads of companies claim it

670
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,520
to be

671
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,039
like an organic feed for plants but in

672
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,158
the end you know

673
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:18,319
it's it's not it's just something that

674
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,600
you can make at home for example to feed

675
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:24,639
a tomato plant if you finish your uh

676
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,558
your season and you have like um an

677
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,720
older tomato plant you can cut it and

678
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,759
chop it down into pieces put it into a

679
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,558
bucket go to your local boots and grab

680
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:37,278
some you know lift mode which is

681
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,839
the leaves the like drops leaves and

682
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:43,599
stamps the drops from from the trees and

683
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:46,399
turn into this uh dark brown uh golden

684
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,480
fertilizer you grab one in full you put

685
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,440
it into a bucket along with the all

686
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,159
those

687
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,600
breaking broken down you know stems and

688
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,320
part of the plant

689
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,240
and then you add unchlorinated water or

690
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,000
rainwater and chlorinated means simply

691
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,200
like water that it stands outside

692
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
outdoor

693
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,120
uh

694
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,240
or with the cup open so you give the

695
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,719
chance to

696
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,400
like the excess of chlorine to evaporate

697
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,120
not all of it because obviously plants

698
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,038
still need chlorine to grow um

699
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,199
and yeah and that's one of the best

700
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,599
foods that you can use for for a tomato

701
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,919
plant because if you think about it like

702
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:25,199
uh a tomato plant whenever it's fully

703
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,159
mature has already everything that it's

704
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,319
required for the plant to grow there is

705
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,039
nothing else that it requires it's all

706
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,960
inside the plant so adding this

707
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,200
component into the

708
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,159
bucket with water you add these

709
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,400
microorganisms from the forest floor

710
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,360
that they're gonna break down all these

711
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,120
um

712
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,199
micro and macronutrients and they're

713
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,119
gonna make it available again for the

714
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,759
plant to be absorbed so this is

715
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,759
something like a really super easy

716
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,759
fertilizer that someone anyone can make

717
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,679
at home you know i was gonna say that

718
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,200
that sounds really easy

719
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,200
you explained it in such a way that

720
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,880
makes it easy you know if anyone wants

721
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,278
to know more by the way it's called

722
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,960
jadam liquid fertilizer and you can find

723
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,038
in korean natural farming there is a

724
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,200
book called jadam that you can buy it's

725
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:13,278
a great book awesome so you talked a

726
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,440
little bit about water um you know you

727
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,759
said rain water or dechlorinated water

728
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,880
but how about the actual watering

729
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:20,319
process

730
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,559
you know some plants it's so easy to

731
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:25,519
over water do you have any tips for

732
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,879
watering or any just general advice

733
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,879
yeah so

734
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,880
a really cool tip that i learned if

735
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,720
you're watering like pots

736
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,440
uh it's either to

737
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,480
like stick your finger into the soil and

738
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,880
like take it out and like try to to feel

739
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,480
like how moist is the finger if it feels

740
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,760
completely dry obviously you need to

741
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,079
water the plant and if not uh like you

742
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,558
can wait to water it you can hold on

743
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,639
because the plant is gonna access that

744
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:55,200
all the moisture that it's in the pot it

745
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,320
doesn't need to be at the bottom at the

746
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,720
top midway it can access all of it but

747
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,240
the roots gonna extend to get into it

748
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,038
and like and they gonna absorb that

749
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,120
moisture or alternatively like whenever

750
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,640
you transplant your plant and you put it

751
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,359
into your container the first thing that

752
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,038
you need to do is to lift your container

753
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,558
and you feel the weight you know it's

754
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,798
something that i take you know it takes

755
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,639
a bit of time to learn but you lift your

756
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,759
container and you feel the weight so

757
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,159
then you water it and you lift it again

758
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,720
and you can feel the difference so then

759
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,880
whenever your plant feels light again i

760
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,759
mean as light as when you transplanted

761
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,000
it it's time to water your plant so that

762
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,720
could be an easy tip that anyone you

763
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,119
know could use to to to alter a plant

764
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,679
but for tomatoes it's really important

765
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,759
that you have a constant watering of the

766
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,399
plant because if you don't have a coin

767
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,240
constant moisture for the plant

768
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,519
basically you can you can have different

769
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,759
issues like

770
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,440
uh like there is a tension on the skin

771
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:57,839
of the tomatoes

772
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,240
uh so uh if you alter this uh you know

773
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:02,319
watering period between like uh giving

774
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,919
water to the plant and waiting i mean if

775
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,359
you're not constant and giving water as

776
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,278
a plant like this uh tension

777
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,439
could make the tomatoes split because

778
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,519
the plant is not used anymore to like

779
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,759
that moisture and whenever you apply it

780
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,359
again after a

781
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,759
drought or after a period that you

782
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,839
didn't water it can cause the tomatoes

783
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,919
to split you know and that's that's

784
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,759
something that like happens all the

785
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,919
times to people and they asked me like

786
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:30,558
why my tomatoes are splitting you know

787
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:33,919
uh but it's yeah it's not

788
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:36,879
so easy to learn like when when to water

789
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:40,080
like um uh tomato plant but there are

790
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,399
tricks like like i said the weight or

791
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:45,439
mulching mulching is another great tip

792
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:48,879
so you can just grab like stroke wood

793
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,558
chips or anything which is organic

794
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,600
because i don't like to use inorganic

795
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:53,278
you know

796
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,639
mulching even if

797
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,359
like at the shop you can buy them

798
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,159
anywhere um you apply to the to the

799
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,558
surface of your plant after after you

800
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,039
water and basically what happens they're

801
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:07,440
gonna retain moisture first of all

802
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:10,720
they're gonna protect the microorganisms

803
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,000
in your soil so they don't get disturbed

804
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,319
and and also you can get some like um

805
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,720
i've got a mineralized um

806
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:22,879
straw that every time i water it is

807
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,600
slowly release minerals into the soil

808
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,640
which is a win-win you know yeah a lot

809
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,719
of those things that you mentioned are

810
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,120
very similar to growing medicinal

811
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,120
varieties it's funny because you know

812
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,959
like i mentioned a lot of my viewers do

813
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,918
grow medicinal varieties and so i feel

814
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,600
like as we continue to talk on a lot of

815
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,520
folks are going to be able to catch on

816
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,398
pretty easily and be able to have that

817
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,319
transition easily and be more successful

818
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:49,359
on their first grow since it is so

819
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,960
similar so that's pretty cool to hear

820
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:53,278
let's switch it up let's talk about

821
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,120
training and pruning important things

822
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,119
certainly can you talk to us about

823
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,038
training and pruning tomatoes in order

824
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,959
to maximize yield

825
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,679
yeah sure so

826
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,798
what i usually what i normally use is uh

827
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:10,480
bamboo sticks just to like you know uh

828
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:13,119
start uh the plant like growing straight

829
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,120
but i sell crazy things not not so crazy

830
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,719
but like people growing it upside down

831
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,558
which is really cool it's something that

832
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,720
you can do a hundred percent okay you

833
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,158
can grow the plant upside down and

834
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,919
they're just gonna produce the roots at

835
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,159
the top so you don't have to you know to

836
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,679
use any sort of trellis but another

837
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,320
thing that i use other than bubble

838
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,360
sticks it's uh metal wire so you can

839
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,960
just

840
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:35,119
twist the metal wire around the bamboo

841
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,679
stick and then uh

842
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:41,038
go along like i don't know a structure

843
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,679
of your greenhouse or your fence or you

844
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,679
know anything that it's a vertical space

845
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,320
and fix it with like some staple or

846
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,720
something like that and uh the plant is

847
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,798
gonna grow along that you can just you

848
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,519
know use um

849
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:58,879
some twine or like cotton twine it's

850
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:02,480
best like around it so so you support

851
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,919
this growth but i also uh i also suggest

852
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,319
to make diy in a trellis i made a lot of

853
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,799
them like if anyone is interested you

854
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,319
can find them in on my channel and it's

855
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,119
just um

856
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:17,918
with timbers you build a structure and

857
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:20,959
then you use cotton twine to support the

858
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,640
plant uh obviously use it like double

859
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,319
because if you use a single twine it's

860
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,919
gonna it's just gonna break

861
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,678
and and the cool thing about cotton

862
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,278
twine is that at the end whenever you

863
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,240
finish you grow your plant you can just

864
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:34,720
cut it at the base we like including the

865
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,319
cotton twine and everything and just

866
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,319
compost everything because it's

867
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:39,599
compostable you know and then make it

868
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:41,678
again for the

869
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:44,158
for the season after and if you if you

870
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,880
use uh things like um

871
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,600
uh to impermeabella to make like the

872
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,278
food impermeable it's you know it's

873
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,000
perfect because it's gonna last you like

874
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:56,558
probably four or five years and with a

875
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,480
bit of diy i was really bad with diy but

876
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,398
i learned you know thanks to youtube

877
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,919
thanks to books you know

878
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,000
um

879
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,799
but yeah uh you you could potentially

880
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,720
use that to to support your plant and

881
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,558
make it grow vertical you know

882
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,240
especially in an urban garden like like

883
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:16,639
the one that i have uh it's super easy

884
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,839
like most people you know think about

885
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,159
the space

886
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:22,319
uh having a horizontal perspective you

887
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,480
know but you have to think that all this

888
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:25,519
vertical space around it all the walls

889
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,839
fence

890
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,000
anything that it's around could be used

891
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,398
to train plants or to grow plants

892
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,159
vertically you know so

893
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,079
so yeah that's a trick that you could

894
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,159
potentially use okay now how about

895
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:40,158
topping that technique can you talk to

896
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,000
us about topping tomatoes

897
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:47,120
yeah topping as i mentioned before or

898
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,919
it's also called removing suckers

899
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:51,839
the suckers are basically like so you

900
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,480
have the tomato plants growing you have

901
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:58,398
that your main stem and then you go the

902
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,480
branches poking out and then from uh the

903
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,719
intersection between the main stem and

904
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,159
the brunch all the times you're gonna

905
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,759
see these stems growing out that they

906
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,320
look different from a branch and they

907
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:14,079
look more like the top of the plant so

908
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,559
all these stems are suckers which is

909
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,839
the plant that is just trying to you

910
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:23,039
know grow new branches to expand you

911
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:25,599
know and produce more fruit so all you

912
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:28,159
need to do especially for indeterminate

913
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,159
varieties for determinate varieties most

914
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,639
case scenario you don't have to do it

915
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,398
but for in the terminator you need to

916
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,878
cut it off

917
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:39,279
but you don't have to chuck it away

918
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,918
because that's a cool thing so by by

919
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,560
doing this you can just you know remove

920
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,638
the lower leaves of this um sucker

921
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:47,679
poking out and stick it in a glass of

922
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,119
water

923
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,000
and all these trichomes that we

924
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,919
mentioned before they're going to

925
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,960
produce roots and you're going to have a

926
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:58,319
plant with a plant with the same exact

927
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,838
genetic as the plant that you have like

928
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,079
growing so this means i do it every year

929
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:05,920
for like either to give it away to all

930
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,720
my neighbors that everyone is asking me

931
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,400
all the times or to uh you know having a

932
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:12,239
backup because you never know like

933
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,720
something could go wrong

934
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,639
and if some anything goes wrong you

935
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,199
still got the same

936
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:21,679
exact plant growing

937
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,919
in a smaller size but still you know

938
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,279
with the same the same genetic so if it

939
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,039
was an amazing plant that you had

940
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,599
outdoor and you were like really happy

941
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:32,559
with it you can still have a becca with

942
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,760
the same exact genetic and also another

943
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:38,400
thing about like pruning this plant

944
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,079
is that once they reach

945
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,639
i would say something around 60

946
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,760
centimeters 50 centimeters you need to

947
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:49,598
prune the bottom part of the plant so

948
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:52,480
this means remove all the lower leaves

949
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,640
because whenever you water

950
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,880
your

951
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,199
soil around the plant most of the

952
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,358
disease comes from the soil and what

953
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,799
happens is that there is a bouncing back

954
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,119
effect so

955
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,240
so you're you're watering and like the

956
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,838
water splash it back to the leaves and

957
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:13,118
this carry on like

958
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:15,279
any sort of disease like blight you know

959
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,599
anything that could damage your plant

960
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,720
so so you by removing them first of all

961
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,160
you improve the airflow of uh like the

962
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:24,239
air circulation especially if you have

963
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:26,719
many plants growing in a line

964
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,559
and and also you encourage the plants to

965
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,358
redirect all the energies back to the

966
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:34,078
top like into the fruit or into the

967
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:36,880
vegetative stage so this means like uh

968
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,560
growing like uh in um

969
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,519
in size you know

970
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,679
so

971
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:44,880
so yeah these are just two of the tricks

972
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:47,679
that like you you could use and also

973
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,240
another great thing about the mulching

974
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:51,919
the metal that i mentioned is by doing

975
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:53,759
this other than retaining the moisture

976
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,240
and protecting your micro and

977
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,960
microorganisms you are

978
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,399
limiting the bouncing it back effect

979
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,480
because obviously you have something on

980
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,880
top of the soil so you know like this

981
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,240
water like every time you water in your

982
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,119
your around your tomato is not bouncing

983
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:12,799
up that much but it's kind of like you

984
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,599
know just settling down

985
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,680
so much good information

986
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,680
you touched upon a couple problems that

987
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:22,480
could potentially happen another problem

988
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:24,480
that i want to dive deeper into is pests

989
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,039
right so can you talk about what you do

990
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,599
in order to prevent pests from invading

991
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:32,559
invading your garden

992
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,960
so um so first of all as i said um i'm

993
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:37,119
an organic rover so so i don't use any

994
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,639
chemical so

995
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,760
there are different techniques so the

996
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:43,039
first one is to make a homemade liquid

997
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,920
so what i do at the beginning of the

998
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,519
season i go out to the local park make

999
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,358
sure that it's like check with the

1000
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,280
console if they sprayed it with some

1001
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:53,119
nasty you know like chemicals or

1002
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,200
whatever because most of most of the

1003
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,440
times they do it so you just go there

1004
00:37:55,199 --> 00:38:00,000
you look for nettles like the young ones

1005
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,880
not the old ones and you cut them at the

1006
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
base

1007
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,039
uh and these nettles like other than

1008
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,519
being like bed whenever you touch them

1009
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,920
they're also really bad for pests you

1010
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:15,119
know they they tend to stay away from it

1011
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,599
so what i do i grab a cheesecloth

1012
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,160
i grab all these nettles like this new

1013
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,160
shots i chop it down into small pieces

1014
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,199
and then i add some crushed garlic which

1015
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:28,480
is also really good to repel pests and i

1016
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,799
and i leave uh all this into into what

1017
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,599
is called and into the water into a

1018
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,680
bucket of water for probably like three

1019
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,599
to four weeks infusing

1020
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:40,719
and after three to four weeks you can

1021
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,359
use destroyed to spray your plants top

1022
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:44,838
and bottom and this is good you know as

1023
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:47,598
a prevention

1024
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:50,078
but uh the main thing that you should

1025
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,640
use is companion planting which is like

1026
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,440
the best best thing to use in the in any

1027
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,358
sort of garden so for our tomato there

1028
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,159
are a few plants that you can use like

1029
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:01,519
um

1030
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:04,399
marigolds uh are really good because uh

1031
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,280
they repel uh green and black flies like

1032
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,599
poor

1033
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,119
form anyone that doesn't know like what

1034
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,160
our green and black flies that are

1035
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,670
outfits

1036
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:11,920
um

1037
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,480
[Music]

1038
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,639
and yeah you can use uh this plant they

1039
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,960
are really really effective you can

1040
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:21,199
either plant them all around the tomato

1041
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,480
plant and they create a sort of barrier

1042
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,279
which is

1043
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,800
uh deceiving for the pests you know they

1044
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,880
they cannot tell if there is a tomato

1045
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,119
behind it because the smell is too

1046
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,680
strong for them um

1047
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,640
and i recommend to plant them

1048
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:39,279
three weeks in advance because another

1049
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:41,519
cool thing that the marigold

1050
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,839
does with the tomato

1051
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,599
is they create a symbiotic relationship

1052
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:49,440
between the roots of the marigolds and

1053
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:52,400
the tomatoes and uh they repel uh

1054
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,639
so that dangerous nematodes so there are

1055
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,320
cool nematodes let's call them like that

1056
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,960
that you can use in the garden and they

1057
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,680
are good to you know repel some kind of

1058
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,079
pest but there are also like bed limited

1059
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:06,480
that could create damages to your plant

1060
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,200
and any any sort of bad thing that could

1061
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,400
happen to your plant and another plant

1062
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,598
that i use in in combo with the tomato

1063
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,680
is basil

1064
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,200
which is which is great

1065
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:20,318
well uh

1066
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,519
i usually tend to pair the plants that

1067
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,119
they are

1068
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:26,239
if you think about it basil and tomato

1069
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,240
are pairing perfectly in a kitchen so

1070
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:31,118
why not pairing them in the garden you

1071
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:34,159
know and like they are they are great

1072
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,720
because they cooperate and they um

1073
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:39,679
repel like not only green and black

1074
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:43,118
black flies but also white flies and all

1075
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:45,358
the kind of pests you know and

1076
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,960
yeah and this plant can be interplanted

1077
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,799
between the lines of tomatoes or even if

1078
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,199
you have a pot you know you can plant it

1079
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,839
there it's not gonna develop fully but

1080
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:58,639
still you know i used to have it like i

1081
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:01,039
used to clone uh basil

1082
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:04,960
which is which is super easy you can

1083
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:07,119
just snip off the tops and the same as a

1084
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,559
suckers stick into the water and they're

1085
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,318
gonna produce new roots and then you

1086
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,480
transplant into the soil and you can

1087
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:14,400
have them like in small pots and i used

1088
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,719
to place them around the garden even

1089
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,559
like if they were not planted into the

1090
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:22,799
soil but like around the port or or like

1091
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,599
just around the base of a tomato and

1092
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,920
they help to repel all these nasty pests

1093
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,920
you know

1094
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:34,639
and another thing that it's amazing to

1095
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,720
use in the garden is nasturtium

1096
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:40,960
it's uh it's a plant that is fully

1097
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:43,039
edible so roots stems leaves

1098
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,679
flowers anything from this plant is

1099
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:47,759
edible it's a bit of a peppery flavor so

1100
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,118
not everyone likes it but you can get

1101
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,720
used to it because

1102
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,720
it's really versatile in the kitchen you

1103
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,879
can make so many things but the cool

1104
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:58,239
thing it's called a sacrificial plant so

1105
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:02,720
what i do like uh let's say i dedicate a

1106
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:05,759
raised bed to uh tomatoes i plant a pot

1107
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:08,000
with a nasturtium close by and this

1108
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,040
plant is going to attract all the black

1109
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,559
flight

1110
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:14,400
and and then uh so they're going all on

1111
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,799
the plant because they prefer nasturtium

1112
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,240
rather than like your main crops

1113
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,839
and and then you can simply whenever

1114
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,000
they're full of pests you can simply get

1115
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:23,759
rid of your nasturtium and this is why

1116
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,559
it's called sacrificial plants but it's

1117
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,520
it's amazing because thanks to this

1118
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:32,639
combination of plant you can you know

1119
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:35,920
have a natural pest control they also i

1120
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:38,400
also leave a few basil plants to flower

1121
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,760
and they attract beneficial pollinators

1122
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,358
like i don't know ladybugs or lacewings

1123
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:49,520
that they feed on green and black flies

1124
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:53,039
and um you know all this cooperation

1125
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:55,199
allows me to not use anything at all

1126
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,039
like there is a cool thing a school

1127
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,118
sentence that is mentioned in the korean

1128
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,960
natural farming which is do as nature

1129
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,720
does which means

1130
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,760
uh like cooperating with nature because

1131
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:09,199
it provides already all we need to

1132
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,119
nurture the plants we don't need to

1133
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,759
apply like anything else anything

1134
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,240
specific they can just thrive by

1135
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,079
creating the right conditions and

1136
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:21,118
leaving you know the

1137
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,839
biodiversity to develop above the soil

1138
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,519
and under the soil gotcha

1139
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:28,400
let's talk about the transition to

1140
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,960
flower you know flowering and bloom the

1141
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,000
fruiting stage so tomato plants they

1142
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,920
have male and female parts on the same

1143
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,199
plant and they need to really be we

1144
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,000
often call on the medicinal side of

1145
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,078
things pollinated right can you talk to

1146
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,239
us about the whole transitioning the

1147
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,240
flower process you know how to pollinate

1148
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,239
and so on and so forth so tomato plants

1149
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,159
like when whenever they reach maturity

1150
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:52,959
as they say like they they develop

1151
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:56,399
flowers and these flowers they're gonna

1152
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,920
develop into fruit so um most case

1153
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,639
scenario if you have the mouth door you

1154
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,039
create the right conditions you attract

1155
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,879
pollinators and these pollinators they

1156
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:06,880
all they do the work they do the job

1157
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,800
like you don't need to do anything they

1158
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,358
just jump from one flower to another and

1159
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,599
they pollinate your plants but if this

1160
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,759
doesn't happen let's say you have them

1161
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,920
inside a greenhouse or

1162
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,240
uh you know like they're not easily

1163
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,440
accessible for pollinators you can hand

1164
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:26,239
pollinate so you can just simply shake

1165
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,400
these flowers like uh

1166
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:31,279
like literally shake them like that and

1167
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,720
they drop all this pollen that then gets

1168
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,760
released and

1169
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:39,358
it goes on the other flowers and this is

1170
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,839
uh like so easy like doing so like they

1171
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:43,598
start like uh pollinating all the other

1172
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:46,318
flowers and you gotta have fruits

1173
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:50,000
developing so it's it's like one of the

1174
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:52,400
easiest thing to do but also like if you

1175
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,159
are feeding your plant with a specific

1176
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,680
feeding i don't know like you were using

1177
00:44:54,159 --> 00:45:00,399
like a

1178
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:03,440
vegetative um feeding so to allow the

1179
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,639
full in nitrogen to help the plant uh

1180
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,838
develop

1181
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,879
inside

1182
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:10,318
uh

1183
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,119
you need to swap to something that

1184
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:16,000
is made for um you know flowers to the

1185
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,960
developer fruit so lowering nitrogen a

1186
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,280
bit higher in phosphorus potassium and

1187
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,358
other micronutrients that you can find

1188
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,560
in um

1189
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:28,559
in nutrients both from the store okay

1190
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:29,759
and then so tomatoes are growing on the

1191
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,119
plant right

1192
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,280
at what point do you harvest you know

1193
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,640
when do you harvest plants you should

1194
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,359
always harvest them whenever they're

1195
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,879
fully ripe so whenever they are like

1196
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,799
most cases are you're gonna see a tomato

1197
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,400
that turns completely red but i'm

1198
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,079
growing varieties for example there are

1199
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,160
heirloom varieties that are called black

1200
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:51,359
beauty and they develop whenever they

1201
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:54,078
are bordeaux like really dark red you

1202
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:56,000
know it's it's kind of hard to tell

1203
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,400
but um

1204
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,400
so that's the ideal stage so from when

1205
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,318
to harvest your tomato but

1206
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,519
if you happen to harvest them whenever

1207
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:05,838
they're still green because of the

1208
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:08,159
conditions that i mentioned

1209
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:11,519
you can just bring them indoor and there

1210
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:14,480
are ways of turning them into chutney or

1211
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,318
which is which is good it's not as good

1212
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,358
as like fully ripe tomatoes but it's

1213
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:21,519
still good or you can a trick that i

1214
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:22,400
tried and it works you can wrap them in

1215
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:24,559
a

1216
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,000
newspaper and leave it inside the box in

1217
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:27,759
the dark

1218
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,639
and like

1219
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,880
uh

1220
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:32,719
thanks to like you know to

1221
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,480
the darkness and because they got

1222
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:38,239
disconnected from the plants and all

1223
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,760
that like they slowly ripe there's not a

1224
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:42,479
hundred percent of the times that it

1225
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:46,720
happens i heard people that they uh put

1226
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:49,440
like the tomato close to uh bananas or

1227
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:52,559
apples you know and that helps the

1228
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,559
transition like to the tomato to to ripe

1229
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,119
i tried it it didn't work maybe it was

1230
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:58,318
me but you know like for me it didn't

1231
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,280
work

1232
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:04,559
and so this trick like of wrapping them

1233
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,960
works great you know and um yeah i know

1234
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:09,440
it's not the ideal way of like when

1235
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,280
picking your tomatoes but still like if

1236
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,200
it happens that you're growing them and

1237
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,760
then you like are such a shame that i

1238
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,358
can't you know make them fully ripe and

1239
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,280
take them indoor you can still you know

1240
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:21,679
do something about that okay that makes

1241
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,160
sense so even if they're not fully ripe

1242
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,078
you can still pick them and and you know

1243
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,838
they'll actually ripen if you're in a

1244
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,359
desperate situation to where you can't

1245
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:31,119
wait until the very end are you getting

1246
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:33,279
that cold weather and so on and so forth

1247
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,559
so that's good to know

1248
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,920
let's uh let's talk about problems so

1249
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,519
there are so many different problems

1250
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,800
that you can run into there's three of

1251
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,800
that i kind of want to highlight that i

1252
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,880
was hoping you'd be able to talk about

1253
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,440
number one being pottery mildew number

1254
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,800
two being blossom enrot and number three

1255
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,639
which you've already kind of touched on

1256
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,960
is the skin splitting can you talk to us

1257
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:54,639
about those things yeah so the most

1258
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,000
common thing that could happen to your

1259
00:47:54,639 --> 00:48:00,318
tomato plant at least in uh if you have

1260
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,039
similar weather like uk which is you

1261
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:04,159
know

1262
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:07,199
really humid or or if you recreate these

1263
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:08,879
conditions by for example watering a lot

1264
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:12,078
or

1265
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,640
like not having something like

1266
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,119
enough drainage in your soil that allows

1267
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:20,000
the moisture to drain out

1268
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:22,318
it's blight it's tomato blight like this

1269
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,039
past season we had

1270
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:27,119
you know like it was a drama for all the

1271
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,679
growers here in uk

1272
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:32,640
everyone had issues with with this

1273
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:35,199
blight because it affects the plant so

1274
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:36,719
it's basically the plant starts rotting

1275
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,960
so you're gonna notice it from the main

1276
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:41,598
stem there are parts of the main stem

1277
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,920
that turn into uh they turn completely

1278
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,318
black and they slowly

1279
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,800
spread and they go into the fruit and

1280
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:50,960
into the leaves and they all plant get

1281
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,119
affected and you can just simply you

1282
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,880
know say goodbye to your plants because

1283
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,160
that's the end of it there are

1284
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,358
like there are um

1285
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,960
[Music]

1286
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:04,000
old methods claimed to work but they

1287
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,800
only work to slow down the sprite of the

1288
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,599
blight they don't get rid of the blight

1289
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,240
so you know in that case you you can't

1290
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,000
really do much about that and and you

1291
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,598
know that's it you need to tuck away the

1292
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,039
plan but

1293
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,960
one thing that i discovered uh i would

1294
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,279
say one year ago

1295
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,280
that i wasn't aware of is that most

1296
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,800
people like tend to burn the plant

1297
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,040
because they're worried you know that

1298
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:32,640
you're gonna have blight the the season

1299
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:34,719
after but i was talking again with this

1300
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:38,719
task doubting that it's sort of my

1301
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:40,719
mentor uh in in growing plants

1302
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:43,838
he explained to me that like you can

1303
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:46,639
easily compost it and like add the

1304
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:48,960
affected uh parts of the plant into the

1305
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:51,920
compost because they tried only with

1306
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,920
organic matter and so after like four

1307
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,880
months or three months or something like

1308
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,720
that it depends on the growing

1309
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,599
conditions on on the climate and many

1310
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:59,838
things

1311
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,880
they're just gonna die off

1312
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:03,838
and

1313
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,519
and you know and you don't have to um

1314
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:08,639
worry that much that the year after

1315
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:10,000
you're gonna spread this blight uh all

1316
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,318
over your garden which is a great thing

1317
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,400
because you know like you would think

1318
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:15,679
like ah i wasted not only the plant but

1319
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,079
also the plant material i'm gonna have

1320
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,719
to tuck it away but then again we have

1321
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,960
this closed loop that we can save like

1322
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:23,838
you know the plant material and

1323
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,159
um

1324
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:28,799
reuse it into the garden

1325
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,639
but yeah you could potentially have

1326
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,200
other issues

1327
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:34,239
affecting the plant as i said like if

1328
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:35,919
you know

1329
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:39,519
constantly in watering you have the

1330
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:41,280
splitting of the tomato skin and which

1331
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:44,639
ruins the fruit

1332
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,519
uh you can still eat it but you know

1333
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:47,838
it's

1334
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:49,440
like the plant is ruined because

1335
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:50,400
you know you're gonna have

1336
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,440
um

1337
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,039
