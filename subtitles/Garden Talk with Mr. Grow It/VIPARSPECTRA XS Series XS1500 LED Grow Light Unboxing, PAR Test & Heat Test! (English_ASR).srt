3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,120
and you're watching max's channel here i

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,000
have the viper spectra

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,759
xs 1500 led grill light and in this

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,320
video i'm going to unbox the unit

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,679
i'm going to test the par output and i'm

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,800
going to do a heat test on it

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,800
i'm not going to go over all of the

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
features that this grow light has but i

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,199
will leave a link down in the

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,640
description section below

13
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,720
so you can click on that if you want to

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,679
learn more about the light okay first

15
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,598
thing out the box

16
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,439
is the fixture next is a wire hanging

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:36,079
kit

18
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,920
power cord a set of rope ratchet hangers

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,878
a card here which shows you what to do

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,320
if you're happy or if you're not happy

21
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,920
and then lastly is an instruction manual

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,200
for the part test i'm going to use the

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,679
apogee mq620 extended range parameter

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,199
this meter measures from 340 nanometers

25
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,600
to 1040 nanometers

26
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,558
and the measurements are in ppfd i do

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,239
these part tests

28
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,079
just to give you a general idea of what

29
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,198
the power output is it's not going to be

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,039
100 accurate

31
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,399
i take measurements in grow tents which

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,079
have reflective walls

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
that could increase the numbers so just

34
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,719
keep that in mind the flowering coverage

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
area is

36
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,560
two feet by two feet and i'm taking

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,200
measurements in a two foot by four foot

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,040
grow tent

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,719
i'll do my best to keep my par meter in

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,080
a two foot by two foot space

41
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,239
i'll be taking measurements at three

42
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:23,280
different distances 12 inches

43
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,280
18 inches and 24 inches i've plugged the

44
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,920
led grow light into my kilowatt meter

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,079
and it shows 1.23 amps pulling

46
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:41,840
147 watts from the wall all right let's

47
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:41,839
get into the measurements

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:03:18,180
[Music]

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:04:29,720
