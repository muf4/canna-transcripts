1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,990
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,669
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,740
today I got a discussion video for you

4
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:08,939
let's talk about plant training there

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,309
are so many different things you can do

6
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,359
when it comes to training plants in this

7
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:14,609
video I'm not only going to tell you

8
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:15,928
what I do when I train my plants but I'm

9
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:18,509
bringing a guest into this discussion

10
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,240
pigeons for 20 he is a youtuber with

11
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,550
over 74 thousand subscribers and he has

12
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,229
over 800 grow videos on his channel and

13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,660
he's been doing YouTube since I believe

14
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,010
the beginning of 2016 if you go to his

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,839
channel which I'll link down in the

16
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,609
description section below you'll see he

17
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,229
does a ton of different plant training

18
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:35,519
techniques if you like these types of

19
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:37,468
discussion videos please hit that thumbs

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,879
up button that's an indication to

21
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,700
whether or not I should make more of

22
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,429
these videos and yeah let's get into the

23
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,160
discussion all right got pigeons here

24
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,780
how are you dude man I'm I'm doing well

25
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,299
thank you for having me I'm really

26
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,859
excited to talk to you it's been overdue

27
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,238
conversation I guess I'd say it's the

28
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,488
first time we've ever actually done a

29
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,250
video chat like this and you know we've

30
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:00,899
both been doing YouTube videos for over

31
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,170
three you know three four years now

32
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,359
alright five years and dude I'm super

33
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,769
psyched thanks for coming on today well

34
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,040
as I said thanks for having me man but

35
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:13,560
more importantly thank you for for being

36
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,509
kind of kind of a shining light in the

37
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,659
community when it comes to bringing the

38
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,400
community together and and getting

39
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,460
getting getting the best out of us I saw

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,350
the the show that you did with Rob and I

41
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:26,849
really enjoyed the conversation I

42
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:28,618
thought you guys really brought the best

43
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:31,408
out of each other when it came to the

44
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:33,090
conversation pulling out ideas and and I

45
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,680
think this is this is a this is a good

46
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,728
Avenue for the content so I'm really

47
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,439
excited thanks for having me

48
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:41,700
cool yeah no problem let's talk about

49
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:43,258
plant training so for plant training so

50
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,240
you know I really wanted to bring you

51
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,000
into this discussion because I've been

52
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,618
on your channel and I see a lot you do a

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,368
lot of different type of plant training

54
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:54,688
techniques and you know today you can

55
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:56,159
talk about that I don't think we're

56
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,118
going to talk about all to plant

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,118
training techniques that are out there

58
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,549
but definitely the most common so low

59
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,170
stress training topping if we can get

60
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,630
into it maybe do a little super cropping

61
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,489
or filming things like that there are

62
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:10,318
other things other ways to do it we

63
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,030
probably won't get into it all in this

64
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,299
video so just to give you viewers a

65
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,710
heads up on that one

66
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,960
let's start off with arguably the most

67
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,520
common which is low stress training so

68
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,230
first off what is low stress training

69
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:26,260
right so low stress training is really

70
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:29,889
bending down and or tying down branches

71
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:32,489
in order to allow other branches to grow

72
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:35,949
up and you know be even with that canopy

73
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,540
is kind of the basic definition of it

74
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:40,269
what's your definition of it is it kind

75
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:43,049
of the same thing there after yeah

76
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,939
absolutely absolutely low stress

77
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:49,450
training trying not to create anything

78
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:51,579
that's going to prolong the plant's life

79
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:54,609
and and stress will certainly prolong

80
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:57,070
the plant's life so just gentle bending

81
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,470
be tying down is a great way to put it

82
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,750
talking of even of just a tucking of

83
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:03,310
leaves I think is a low stress training

84
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,139
so yeah just just anything that's

85
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,509
hands-on that's not creating too much

86
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:09,279
stress for the plant in general why low

87
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:10,810
stress train was the point of low stress

88
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,669
training so I think I do believe the

89
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,740
most common reason for low stair saying

90
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:18,159
is to increase the yield so I've read on

91
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:20,260
websites that it's up to a 40% increase

92
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,060
in yield just from doing low stress

93
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:23,590
training what do you think what do you

94
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,370
think the reasons are for doing less

95
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:29,739
stress training well that that that

96
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,209
exactly at trying to create the most out

97
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:32,920
of your plant when I when I first

98
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,099
started growing I remember when I would

99
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,719
look into a a package of seeds and on

100
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,939
the back it would give you the strain

101
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:43,780
the contents of the Kanab but then it

102
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:46,449
would give you a time frame and an

103
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,419
average yield and I was looking at

104
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:52,149
numbers that that looked so unobtainable

105
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:54,759
you know we're talking 500 grams 300

106
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,250
grams of some some number that went

107
00:03:54,759 --> 00:04:01,509
along with those those those those beans

108
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:03,310
and I tried to figure out how on earth

109
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:05,139
you're gonna be able to maximize your

110
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,849
those numbers how do you get those

111
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:10,029
numbers and the best way to do that is

112
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:12,930
to to try to pull the most out of the

113
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:16,889
plant ensure that you're gonna expose

114
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,910
more possible tops to get buds from and

115
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,039
and you can you can certainly do that

116
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,780
with low stress training so yeah

117
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,789
to maximize the yield that you're gonna

118
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:26,679
get out of the plant by maximizing the

119
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:28,930
size and potential of that plant

120
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,009
when do you usually start low stress

121
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,389
training honestly it starts really early

122
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:36,490
when I'm when I'm describing this to a

123
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,949
new grower I'm gonna tell someone to

124
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,918
wait till the third node it's kind of a

125
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:44,139
rule of thumb but the reality of it is

126
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:47,349
your plant is going is going through

127
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:49,300
stresses almost immediately you know

128
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,330
you're trying to minimize the amount of

129
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:55,439
stress that a seedling goes through but

130
00:04:52,329 --> 00:05:00,008
you can certainly start flexing

131
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:01,870
well well after the first node as soon

132
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:06,879
as you start to see some kind of sprout

133
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:09,098
coming out after your original what are

134
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,490
those first leaves called called Laden

135
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:14,019
yes the first node after that typically

136
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,019
you can start to give it a little bend

137
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:19,659
get a little bit of of hands on to start

138
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:21,159
to beef in that stem so I'll go as early

139
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,039
as the first node after the first node

140
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,240
got it for me you know it really depends

141
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:27,519
on growth it depends on my schedule

142
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,960
right sometimes I'm not available to

143
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,819
start low stress training that dead

144
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,339
early but yeah starting early I

145
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:35,379
typically like to wait till the third to

146
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:37,839
fifth node and then I'll start bending

147
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:40,360
the main branch down from there now

148
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:43,329
sometimes you know it really depends on

149
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,439
growth as well because some like indica

150
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:46,959
strains for example gonna be real

151
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:48,939
naturally squat if it's more of a

152
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,228
stretchy strain like a sativa stretchy

153
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:52,899
strain like an OG or something like that

154
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:56,500
at the third node the things already you

155
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:59,978
know 7 to 10 inches tall potentially so

156
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,418
doing it at the third node you know is

157
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:03,819
always a potential as well so for me it

158
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:05,228
really depends on growth I guess I guess

159
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:08,439
that's a good point it really depends on

160
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:12,689
the the sex of seed as well if you if

161
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:15,219
you if you don't know your your your sex

162
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:17,259
training that early might not make as

163
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,300
much sense you know your you might be

164
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:21,400
putting in too much effort for something

165
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,569
that might not be going the full

166
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,839
distance you know you might not have a

167
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:27,490
female so if I'm if I'm running regular

168
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,948
seeds typically I'm actually gonna start

169
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,689
training a little bit later but then it

170
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:32,379
kind of goes hand-in-hand with the more

171
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,728
training

172
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:38,288
you're gonna you're almost gonna see

173
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:39,399
signs of sex sooner based on stress kind

174
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:40,430
of anecdotal them through my own

175
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:44,659
experience but

176
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:47,060
if I knew I had a regular seed and sorry

177
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,860
sorry-sorry a feminized seed I am going

178
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,839
to put stress on that plant that seed a

179
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,740
lot sooner than something that I didn't

180
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,899
know hmm

181
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,319
the outcome of interesting I actually

182
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:59,120
went to your channel and I saw a video

183
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,829
directly it relates to this is when to

184
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,379
start training I think you had a

185
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:05,689
chaplain that you did know training on

186
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:09,079
and it was like close to three feet

187
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:11,360
maybe two feet three feet and had a new

188
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:13,219
man handle the thing and it was just

189
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,189
straight up and then you manhandled it

190
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,890
and literally brought it in like a swirl

191
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:21,019
coming around how did that turn out

192
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:22,909
right so you had a little three feet and

193
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,829
then just manhandle it bent it like

194
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,360
crazy and then wrapped it all around and

195
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:29,479
then can you talk a little bit about

196
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,650
that yeah essentially you mentioned it

197
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,180
earlier when you said when it came down

198
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:37,310
to schedule growing your plants relies

199
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,079
heavily on your schedule if you're there

200
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,610
then you know they're gonna benefit a

201
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,419
little more a little bit more than if

202
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,810
you're not there

203
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,640
this particular plant got yeah I think

204
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,990
it was even upwards of four feet high

205
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,329
and this was sheer ignorance I just let

206
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,550
it get the best of me I kept I kept

207
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:57,529
doing other things you know you get a if

208
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,290
you have a full flower room you know

209
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:02,479
it's easy to let the veg room kind of

210
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,540
kind of kind of get a little bit behind

211
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,850
where it should be and and that's what

212
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,090
happened in this case and this girl in

213
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:15,560
fact it was a I believe was it was new

214
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:17,659
dog was that was the strain it it it got

215
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,220
way to I unmanageable but I knew through

216
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,140
experience that this wasn't something to

217
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,970
be worried about I knew that I could

218
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,279
bring this to a size manageable

219
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,140
something that I could deal with and my

220
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,599
first my first response was to bend it

221
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,729
in half take take take take that four

222
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,159
feet and turn it into two feet because

223
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,470
at least now I'm I'm an indoor growers

224
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,789
so I can I don't have the sky the sky is

225
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:42,860
not the limit for me so I decided to

226
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:44,240
manipulate that stem and at four feet

227
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,600
we're talking about a stem that's

228
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,279
already almost in maybe an inch inch and

229
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,980
a half thick already and with no

230
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,110
training and I decided to just really

231
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,139
manipulate that stem get it nice

232
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,778
loose and I just as you really started

233
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:01,189
to break that membrane you could it

234
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:03,320
almost starts she started to just fall

235
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,450
over on her own and then it was just a

236
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,610
matter of just getting her down tying

237
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,410
her to the pot and ensuring that all

238
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,139
that undergrowth was gonna start coming

239
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:15,458
upwards and as a matter of fact I still

240
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:18,740
have the refer to it as the antlers of

241
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:20,268
the the stem that was the new dog I

242
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,339
trimmed it up and it still sits in a

243
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,899
back room in the house because I I'm so

244
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:25,100
attached to that one I'm not ready to

245
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:26,720
get rid of her I'm trying to think if I

246
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,430
should lock her up and put her up as

247
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,060
like a trophy on top of the garden or

248
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:35,269
something you know all right yes she's

249
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:38,359
right right she yielded she yielded

250
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:40,850
wonderfully III I don't I I didn't weigh

251
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,009
my harvest but we got quite a few jars

252
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:47,899
off of off of vekar I'd say in and

253
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:50,328
around that half that 3/4 of a of a pea

254
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:52,039
you know so it was a good it was a good

255
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:53,389
it was good haul I was a happy camper so

256
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:55,669
I was beneficial for you so would you

257
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:58,159
say that there's no it's never too late

258
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:59,838
to start low stress tree no no

259
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,389
absolutely not never too late you know

260
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,000
absolutely not you you can go hands-on

261
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:07,039
at any time and in fact even when you're

262
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,839
in flower I would still suggest going

263
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,349
hands-on for at least the first few

264
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,940
weeks to ensure that you know well the

265
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,579
plants using up those starches and those

266
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,589
sugars and and and enjoying that stretch

267
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:21,139
that it's not gonna become too uneven

268
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,910
that you're having some some some

269
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:24,980
flowers that are closer to the light and

270
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:27,319
some that aren't you know so no it's

271
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,360
never too late never too late the plant

272
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,149
should be just the way you want it

273
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,610
before you put it into flour and and if

274
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:38,509
that means you need to train it at week

275
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:39,769
8 12 or 15 and in veg then get you got

276
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:42,319
to get her done you got to get her done

277
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:43,970
I did that one time where I bent a

278
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,680
French down when it was similar

279
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,959
situation I think it was as as big as

280
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,149
what you mentioned it was very unstable

281
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,939
to planning at being very unstable and

282
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,528
that's mainstem still continued to be

283
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,029
the main stem and had the largest bud

284
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,980
and thing was just flopping all over the

285
00:10:56,028 --> 00:11:02,509
place did that happen with with yours or

286
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:05,120
no no no once like once you once I bent

287
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:07,730
her over it was it was it was imperative

288
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,919
that I gave those other stems

289
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,289
is my here I am this is much this is the

290
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,458
technique I use on the stems I roll them

291
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:15,019
through my fingers I do this all the

292
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:17,388
time I walk through the garden in the

293
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:19,100
mornings and and and roll all these

294
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:21,079
little stems through my fingers

295
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,300
I must roll you know upwards of a

296
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:24,439
hundred stems in the morning as I just

297
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,448
come through the garden with my coffee

298
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,190
and the idea was with that particular

299
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:30,769
girl once she was flipped over was to

300
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,810
just manipulate all those shoots all

301
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:35,328
those tops to ensure that none of them

302
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:37,159
got left behind but then I did you got

303
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:40,099
it we have to remember that sometimes

304
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:41,809
not every top is going to be a potential

305
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,190
bud you've got to just get rid of

306
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:45,289
something you've got a creeper clean

307
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:49,399
you've got to keep your canopy fresh

308
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:51,169
open and and and and available for to

309
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,480
take in fresh air and if you're keeping

310
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:56,240
every single top you're gonna have some

311
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,600
buds that are huge some that are small

312
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,698
and and it's just it's important to just

313
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,320
ya get get hands-on on all of those

314
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:05,269
individual buds so that they all get

315
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,070
that that that strength that they need

316
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:08,870
got it I'll link that video in the

317
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,790
description section below so for anybody

318
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,929
who wants to see that it I definitely

check it out because it's it's a pretty

321
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:23,959
crazy eye I was blown away with what you

322
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:26,360
did but a lot of fun it was a lot of fun

323
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:28,009
and and yeah it the story of the new dog

324
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,180
that one I remember that she was a good

325
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:30,799
one that was a good one it was a lot of

326
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:33,259
fun cool

327
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,389
ok so low stress training so what

328
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,490
exactly do you do so I'll start so you

329
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:39,860
know I'll typically do that initial

330
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,299
first Bend when it's on you know roughly

331
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,009
its fifth node right like I said it

332
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:46,338
depends on growth and I'll bend that

333
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:49,129
down and then really it normally only

334
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:51,319
really takes what like a week ten days

335
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:53,028
maybe two weeks before you have to

336
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:56,539
actually bend down other branches as

337
00:12:53,028 --> 00:13:00,289
well so for me I'm continually bending

338
00:12:56,539 --> 00:13:02,299
down branches and tying them down and as

339
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:05,259
you know a new main chute kind of comes

340
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:07,759
up and dominates I'll bend that down and

341
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:09,828
you know I'm constantly tying things

342
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,750
down you're just trying to creep to make

343
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:13,659
the canopy even at all times and I'll

344
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,370
continue to do that all the way up

345
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,929
really into flowering and then that

346
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,429
three-week stretch I'll still continue

347
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:20,870
to do less stress training I'll still

348
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:21,359
continue to pull down those branches

349
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,429
tied

350
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,649
down in order to try to keep an even

351
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:27,120
canopy and I found that really that

352
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:28,259
first three weeks when you flip the

353
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,909
flowering when the plant is still

354
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:31,799
stretching is kind of like the hardest

355
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:34,110
in my opinion to still control and

356
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,689
create even canopy feel like it's a lot

357
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,519
easier when the plant is in veg just

358
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,440
because you get I mean a plant can grow

359
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,269
while like two inches overnight or

360
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,519
something like that like that's right so

361
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:46,440
yeah it's a little bit harder to control

362
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,320
my opinion but that's kind of when I

363
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,209
stop is really after that stretch now

364
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,360
what do you do how long do you do

365
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:57,649
low stress train and when you stop it

366
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm very similar in terms of the

367
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:03,600
starting starting early with that

368
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,828
initial been I don't do like I have but

369
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,170
I try to refrain from tying down or or

370
00:14:07,828 --> 00:14:13,169
pinning down now i i do i do take coat

371
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:14,699
hangers metal coat hangers and i and ice

372
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:16,740
and i cut them up so that you can keep

373
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,870
the metal pins and i can put those to

374
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,430
use as pins for the for the shoots to

375
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,070
kind of keep them towards the soil but

376
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:26,939
generally i feel as if if you can get in

377
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:30,180
there every day every second day let's

378
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:33,899
be real and and twist and bend those

379
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:36,889
tops you're gonna turn a very small stem

380
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,120
into a very thick stem very very quickly

381
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:41,370
when you do pin them down there's still

382
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,620
that same effect but i do feel as if you

383
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,179
can every time a top rises up and

384
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,278
sometimes it can only take three hours

385
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:49,948
four hours maybe maybe a little bit

386
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,198
longer they from going in from a flat

387
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:54,299
bend to being straight up again if you

388
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:55,889
can get back in there and keep bending

389
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:57,778
that down i think that's far more

390
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:00,299
beneficial than you know tying it down

391
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:03,750
leaving it coming back tying down

392
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,859
leaving it coming back you know but but

393
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,480
that would be more that would that's

394
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,079
just i guess more my technique than

395
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,629
anything else

396
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:12,120
I certainly utilize both techniques when

397
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:14,338
it comes to pinning and or bending when

398
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,879
it comes to your schedule this whole

399
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:20,130
at-home virus this 2020 has allowed me

400
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:23,250
to do a lot more in garden work than I

401
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:24,899
have ever been able to do so I'm kind of

402
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,789
learning these little little techniques

403
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:30,208
over the last few months that I didn't

404
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:32,458
necessarily know before but when it

405
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,299
comes to as early as training yeah that

406
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,709
initial Bend

407
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:37,799
typically it's hands-on

408
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:39,870
bend it down still twisting and there's

409
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:42,419
that that finger thing yeah still

410
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,580
twisting each stem and just just making

411
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:47,219
sure that each stem from going straight

412
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,129
up at the the end of my visit

413
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,950
looks like something stepped on it she I

414
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,809
don't want any tops pointing the sky to

415
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:57,150
the sky when I leave the flower room

416
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:58,889
after a good low stress training in the

417
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:00,659
morning because then I feel like I've

418
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:03,029
gotten I've gotten I've gotten

419
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:05,610
everything taken care of so yeah as

420
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:07,409
early as I can hands on and then same

421
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,330
thing not three weeks and you're right

422
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:11,250
it is the hardest because you're growing

423
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:14,660
in the veg room over the course of well

424
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:17,490
my case is three plus months of vegging

425
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:20,309
whereas you're seeing growth over three

426
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,529
months you can see a month's worth of

427
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:24,269
growth in just a couple days in the

428
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:26,069
flower room and if and if you're not

429
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:27,689
click on the hands on next thing you

430
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,640
know you've got you've got nine inches

431
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,100
in between your flower points or in

432
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,080
between your but your bud sites so yeah

433
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,850
I totally agree in terms of that three

434
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,889
weeks is just as important or more

435
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,379
important to ensure that you can

436
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:43,230
maintain all that hard work that you put

437
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:45,990
in at throughout the rest of the flower

438
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,820
room so I totally agree the the last

439
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,430
time I'm training you know you're still

440
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,500
you're still tucking leaves and and

441
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:54,449
trying to trying to separate buds you

442
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,129
don't want any buds stuck together so I

443
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,379
still think that that in some sense is

444
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:59,850
low stress training just to ensure that

445
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:02,039
these buds they're there in their own

446
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,840
isolated environment you don't have two

447
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,879
buds that are stuck too close together

448
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,809
you don't have a leaf that you know say

449
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,760
drooped right on top of a bud personally

450
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:13,980
I would not remove that leaf I think

451
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,990
that's a high stress training I would I

452
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,088
would just tuck that leaf underneath

453
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,549
that bud so that there's no moisture or

454
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:22,529
any any trapped air inside that kick

455
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:23,940
there that bond cutter you bring up a

456
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:25,289
good point with the hand bending you

457
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,970
know I use ties I mentioned how I use

458
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:29,159
ties but there have been grows where I

459
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,740
all I did was ham bending so I go in

460
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,759
there and just use my hand and you know

461
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,420
you have to do it like two or three

462
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:36,089
times a day

463
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,289
but hand bending down and continuing to

464
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:39,119
bend down and you'll see those other

465
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,039
branches come up and I've done plants

466
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,829
several grows where I just do hand

467
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,420
bending and no ties whatsoever so it is

468
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,129
still possible to do low stressed

469
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,680
hanging without actually using ties

470
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:52,110
what do you use for ties when you use

471
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,789
ties should you use coat hangers coat

472
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:55,109
hangers and I think that's a that's a

473
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:58,019
underutilized

474
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:59,909
item in our households now granted metal

475
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:02,639
coat hangers are kind of going out with

476
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,290
with the times and we're more of the

477
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,450
plastic coat hangers now granted I'm

478
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:08,339
sure you could like you could manipulate

479
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,519
a plastic coat hanger and do the same

480
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:13,079
thing but metal coat hangers have really

481
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,859
got me through because it's like I find

482
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,750
these things everywhere I've got

483
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,579
hundreds of metal coat hangers now they

484
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,279
don't last forever they do corrode and

485
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:22,829
they do eventually go bad but you know

486
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:25,349
just just to cut a coat hanger you cut

487
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:27,089
the the bottom in the middle and you cut

488
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:28,829
the top you just take the two sides you

489
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:30,779
can even take the little the hook and

490
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:35,460
cut that off and use that as a hook as

491
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:37,859
well however I I primarily use either

492
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,680
they're they're like mechanic's ties

493
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:43,229
there are like pipe ties or something

494
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:46,019
they're like a they're like a twist tie

495
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,920
but they're rubber and my viewers have

496
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:50,879
told me they're like they're a

497
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:53,340
mechanic's twist tie of sorts okay and

498
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,740
or garden wire typically like just a

499
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:57,449
twist tie a roll of twist tie and aside

500
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,670
from that ma'am that's it in my hands

501
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,350
yeah that's that's most of I use those

502
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,390
garden ties I think it's like two bucks

503
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:05,189
at your local gardening roll of them

504
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:08,850
right yeah for the whole like a green

505
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:10,950
yeah yep yep and you can just take off

506
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:14,579
those ties and reuse them so exactly

507
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:17,789
exactly but I mostly use that and when I

508
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:20,309
tie the branch what I do is I'll wrap

509
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:22,319
that tie around like a loop like a

510
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:26,129
double wrap but I won't actually like

511
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:29,789
twist the ties together because as that

512
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:31,230
branch grows thicker the way I do it

513
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:33,509
could I'm just continuing wrap it it'll

514
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:35,849
unravel on its own right so it doesn't

515
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:37,920
like choke up the stem I don't know if

516
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:39,449
I'm explaining that clearly enough but

517
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,490
just kind of wrapping it around twice

518
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,130
and then as it expands well then it's

519
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:46,049
unraveling the tie now you have to

520
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,300
adjust every now and then but just a

521
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:50,639
small tip so people don't choke out

522
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,919
there there and you totally will that's

523
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,810
a group that's a great tip I still choke

524
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,370
out my plants because it's like you'll

525
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:57,899
forget about a tie you know what I mean

526
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:59,399
you'll you'll come in make sure I'm

527
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,990
moving ties all the time but you know as

528
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,730
the plant gets larger and the more tight

529
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,019
put down you're gonna forget one and and

530
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,160
so wrapping them that's a good idea

531
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:06,509
that's a good idea I've choked out

532
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,779
plants too way too many times

533
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:11,250
yeah and then sew on fabric pots I think

534
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:12,509
common thing that beginners might be

535
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,000
wondering is how do I tie this down to a

536
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:17,099
fabric pot and what I usually do is I'll

537
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,619
take like a bobby pin and I'll pierce

538
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:21,089
the side of the fabric pot and then you

539
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:22,799
know close off that bobby pin and then

540
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:25,980
take that twist tie and then attach it

541
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:28,319
to the bobby pin just I do for fabric

542
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,400
pots I'd see some things with velcro

543
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,200
that actually wrap all the way around

544
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,030
the the fabric pod then you take the

545
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,940
velcro and go up and bring the branches

546
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:37,710
down if I have a link to that I know

547
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,990
coop med uses that shoutout to ku

548
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,579
Matty's a grower if I can find the link

549
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,710
to that I'll link that down below and

550
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:46,619
then for plastic pots I usually use

551
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,970
those binder clips just really when you

552
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:50,789
do a most are strangest whatever you can

553
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:53,789
find okay that's it I use I use e paper

554
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:55,230
clips yeah around a fabric pot okay

555
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:57,058
paper clips around it and then I just

556
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,308
tie to the paper clip same idea whatever

557
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:01,829
you can find yeah I know some people

558
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:03,178
drill holes in the plastic pots I mean

559
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:04,649
whatever you want to do right so

560
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,960
whatever whatever you have available

561
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:09,509
really what about you and anything else

562
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,670
to add kind of for that no that's it I'm

563
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:13,410
an exclusively fabric pots I don't use

564
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,730
anything aside from a fabric art and

565
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,140
it's been that way for years so I don't

566
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,839
know anything different but yeah it's

567
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,880
the the paper clip but the paper clip in

568
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:22,589
you're gonna put about you'll see it in

569
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,510
that new dog video actually as a matter

570
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:26,819
of fact if some if anyone checked the

571
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:30,720
description after the after the video I

572
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:32,490
there was probably twenty some paper

573
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,690
clips all the way around that pot and I

574
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:38,099
just tied now the downside of course as

575
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,009
the plant gets stronger and they are

576
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:43,769
incredibly strong they will pull the

577
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:45,029
paper clips out of the fabric pot so you

578
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,769
got to be yeah you got to be vigilant

579
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:48,480
you have to be vigilant anything else

580
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:50,670
for low stress training I think it's

581
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,779
necessary I think it's necessary IIIi

582
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:57,630
don't avoid it get hands-on and and and

583
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:59,220
manipulate your your plants to increase

584
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:01,710
yield it's a necessary it's a necessary

585
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,600
you can really forty percent I think if

586
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,090
they if that's the statistic that's I

587
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,919
think that's an under statement in terms

588
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:09,990
of the amount of yield you'll increase

589
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,720
by doing training

590
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,730
I think it's upwards of you know seventy

591
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,490
percent in some cases but yeah

592
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,890
get hands-on dulo training I wouldn't

593
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,710
say I disagree I was as necessary like

594
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:26,130
as a new grower you don't have to do low

595
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,630
stress training but it's extremely

596
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,530
emotional yeah good point that's a good

597
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,890
point good point

598
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:34,410
cool topping let's talk about topping so

599
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:37,220
okay so topping what is topping topping

600
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:40,500
really just straight basically is just

601
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:42,329
pinching off or cutting off a piece of

602
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,579
the plant usually it's that main stem

603
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:47,579
that comes off and then what happens

604
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:51,240
from there is it'll kind of split into

605
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:52,710
two and it will have two tops right it's

606
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,690
like kind of your definition of it as

607
00:22:52,710 --> 00:23:01,200
well or uh yeah and not only are you in

608
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,850
like it you're promoting on undergrowth

609
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,009
as well you remove a top you're gonna

610
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:07,289
get two tops and then you're gonna see

611
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:09,298
an excess amount of energy promoted to

612
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:11,519
the undergrowth of the plant as well

613
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,798
great boy yes great point so for me I

614
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,269
usually top I usually wait until it's

615
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:17,609
like on its fifth node then I'll top

616
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:20,069
down - well actually I'm sorry there's

617
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:22,168
so there's two ways to kind of top is

618
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:24,539
the pinching method and then there's

619
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:27,090
also the the cutting method where I like

620
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:29,460
to call it a hard top is where you're

621
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:33,029
actually taking you know trimmers and

622
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,950
trimming off the stem I've done both

623
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:36,629
techniques you know the pinching off is

624
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,419
super easy just take your hands and

625
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,940
pinch off I kind of like to do the the

626
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:43,020
hard top where I cutting

627
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,240
usually when I'm pinching I'll just wait

628
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:47,639
and then pinch at that fifth node if I'm

629
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,140
doing a hard top you know I'll hard I'll

630
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,450
wait till it's fifth node and hard top

631
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,740
down to the third node for me

632
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,950
similar to LST it depends on growth

633
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,960
right a real stretchy strain I'm going

634
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,759
to do a hard top down because I might

635
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,910
have other plants in the garden which

636
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,740
are slower growers and so trying to kind

637
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,650
of create keep that canopy even between

638
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,779
all the plants so as far as you know

639
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:12,150
when I top how I top it really kind of

640
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,500
depends on growth what about you you

641
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,090
know when I first started training

642
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,200
topping is something that I did all the

643
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:21,240
time as I've become more efficient in my

644
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,048
growing I don't top at all anymore

645
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:28,769
I just I Bend I just bend I find bending

646
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:30,690
does a very similar has a very similar

647
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:33,000
Nikken earths are a very similar effect

648
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:36,779
when it comes to promoting undergrowth

649
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,839
and and creating strong stems I just

650
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:42,990
yeah once you start training your plants

651
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,240
you start to you to like the I find when

652
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,069
you're not training a plant the energy

653
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,539
is focused at the top of the plant I

654
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,819
don't think there's anything new about

655
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:53,309
that the energy goes up when you start

656
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:56,309
bending that plant the energy is now

657
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:58,470
being delivered to more than just the

658
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:00,990
the top of the plant

659
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,220
wait you're now seeing a promotion of

660
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,259
growth and that under growth or the

661
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,579
other anything other than the top I

662
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:07,049
think that's a very similar effect that

663
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:09,960
when you have a topping is you remove

664
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:12,180
the top you then have two tops but then

665
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,630
you have a promotion of undergrowth now

666
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:17,910
III yeah I've just not found topping to

667
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,340
be as beneficial anymore when it comes

668
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:23,310
to training I just bending has a very

669
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:25,470
similar effect and I end up when it

670
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:27,000
comes to being say two and a half to

671
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,220
three months in two veg I'm removing

672
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,710
tops at this point because I have too

673
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,380
many not because I want more I've got

674
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,029
way I have way too many so it's through

675
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,630
training you're gonna be removing tops

676
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:41,369
just just just to keep a clean canopy so

677
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:44,130
if that's the same thing I'm not

678
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:46,049
entirely sure but yeah not not much of a

679
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:49,130
topper anymore yeah I mean you bring up

680
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:51,149
a great point right so topping is HST

681
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,650
high-stress training right so it's a

682
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:55,920
high-stress train technique you're doing

683
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:58,290
physical damage to the plants so really

684
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,910
you know if you're cutting off the top

685
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:01,440
of the plant plants gonna use some of

686
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,690
that energy for recovery right so it

687
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,950
could you know slow down the growth and

688
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,240
most likely gonna slow down the growth a

689
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,789
little bit right like a day or two

690
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,240
whatever it takes to recover so bending

691
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:13,649
down arguably just doing LST I give Lee

692
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,930
isn't gonna slow down that growth right

693
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,430
so just revert faster your vegetables at

694
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,230
you that's right

695
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,940
but yeah I'll top I'll do a combination

696
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,559
of topping and low stress training so

697
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,150
maybe you know top down I'll top the

698
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,159
fifth node for example and then I'll

699
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,360
Bend all those branches down and then

700
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,130
just to low stress training for the

701
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,259
remainder of the time so some plants I'm

702
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,670
just doing that one top one top of the

703
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:35,190
fifth node and then spreading out all

704
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,990
those lower branches I've done other

705
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,519
techniques where I top-down like I said

706
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:41,099
wait till the fifth no top down to the

707
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,109
third node and I'll remove the first

708
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,908
node leave the second node

709
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:48,479
there's so many different things you can

710
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:50,909
do right so I've really recommend people

711
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,739
to kind of experiment with with topping

712
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,789
and low stirring all these different

713
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:55,350
training techniques that we talked about

714
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:58,230
because there's so many different ways

715
00:26:55,349 --> 00:27:01,199
to do it but yeah I've done both I like

716
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:04,499
to top and also I've done multiple tops

717
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,879
so I do that first initial top then I

718
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:10,200
wait a week or so and then do another

719
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:11,998
top of those tops and then kind of wait

720
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,610
till those branches develop so

721
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:17,368
topping so I get you know eat Maine coal

722
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:19,618
is coming up or I could top a third time

723
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:21,898
we get 16 Maine coal is coming up I've

724
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:24,959
done as much as thirty thirty-two

725
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:27,658
Maine Cola is coming up on plants so

726
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,069
there's just so many ways to do it and I

727
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:31,080
definitely recommend people to kind of

728
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:33,569
experiment with that that's true it you

729
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:35,220
have experimenting is key experimenting

730
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:37,678
is key regardless of what you hear from

731
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,659
from myself or or yourself is that

732
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,509
you're gonna find a way that works for

733
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:44,190
you by by blending a bunch of the

734
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:45,960
techniques I I did the same thing I

735
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,369
started by doing a bunch of topping I

736
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,200
thought it was the best way to go top

737
00:27:47,368 --> 00:27:50,368
and get all the tops and then I and then

738
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,499
when people asked how many times do you

739
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:54,569
top I ended up only topping two times I

740
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:57,358
would do the initial top and then maybe

741
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:59,819
one more top after that but to emen and

742
00:27:57,358 --> 00:28:01,589
then just kind of weaned out too I find

743
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:04,259
I was getting a similar technique which

744
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:06,028
is the bending so that's it experiment

745
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:08,788
get your hands dirty these plants are

746
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:11,429
resilient it's wonderful that we can

747
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:13,108
discuss a low stress training and a high

748
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:15,509
stress training you know that's that's

749
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,888
pretty special so so so get your hands

750
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:19,470
dirty get your hands on and and and

751
00:28:16,888 --> 00:28:21,148
maximize the yield maximize the

752
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,379
potential and you could literally if you

753
00:28:21,148 --> 00:28:23,579
just have one of those plants where it's

754
00:28:22,378 --> 00:28:24,959
just growing straight up and really

755
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:26,519
you're not getting much side branching

756
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,590
at all if you're a beginner and you're

757
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,569
kind of worried about you know doing a

758
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:32,970
topping you could literally just do that

759
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:34,048
one top and that plant is gonna Bush out

760
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,460
you don't have to do any additional

761
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:37,618
training on top of that and the plant is

762
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,929
gonna push out just from one initial

763
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:43,019
topping and no additional training that

764
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:45,090
feeling in your heart of insecurity and

765
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:46,649
unknowing that the unknown of what's

766
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:47,788
gonna happen when you type that's normal

767
00:28:46,648 --> 00:28:49,408
that's normal

768
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:51,960
you're gonna get over it and it's gonna

769
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:53,190
be okay because I'm sure it happened to

770
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,869
you on the first time that you eat

771
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,860
someone told you to chop the top of your

772
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:59,980
plant off you're like what

773
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:02,500
yeah it's gonna be okay and that feeling

774
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,360
deep down is normal I just yeah I want

775
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,190
that to be new and anything else on

776
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:07,808
topping there's not much else - all

777
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,250
right no I think that's it pretty

778
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:09,579
straightforward pretty straightforward

779
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,470
yeah

780
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:13,259
how about FEMEN have you ever done

781
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,610
filming yeah I think on like

782
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:18,730
inadvertently when you try to top and

783
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:21,038
I'll let you two actually describe the

784
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,390
acronym and what it is but because a lot

785
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:25,599
of people you have the idea of what

786
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,890
filming is and what it stands for don't

787
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,599
actually go hand in hand people have no

788
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,990
idea I know I didn't when I said when I

789
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:33,759
learned the technique but I think yeah

790
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:37,149
inadvertently you end up en up filming

791
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:40,298
went often when you're topping and and

792
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:42,489
it's it's it's a very similar technique

793
00:29:40,298 --> 00:29:45,369
but you haven't completely removed the

794
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,019
initial talk so there there's there's a

795
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:48,579
little bit of life there to keep going

796
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:51,519
and in terms of the energy that's being

797
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:53,439
being provided but yeah I've certainly

798
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,028
practiced it one of the same things but

799
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,130
topping though it's it just kind of gone

800
00:29:55,028 --> 00:30:00,250
by the wayside with time got it

801
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:03,519
yeah so it's so FEM our filming phim

802
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,990
stands for I missed that's actually what

803
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:06,329
it stands for Google if you don't

804
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:10,269
believe me

805
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:13,028
really the name comes from somebody

806
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:16,120
trying to top but when they pinched off

807
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:18,579
the top they missed so they didn't

808
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:20,678
actually top off entirely so they just

809
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:22,329
pinched that top growth and what

810
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,220
happened instead of just splitting out

811
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:26,048
in two different directions it went to

812
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,370
four different directions I believe I've

813
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:30,460
actually finden went off three different

814
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:32,018
directions so you know just cutting off

815
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,509
not actually like pinching off the

816
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:37,659
entire top but just kind of pinching off

817
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:39,579
almost the entire top it could lead to

818
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:41,799
it's hard to get accurate actually I

819
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:42,970
feel like it's hard to especially I it

820
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,679
so small

821
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,630
yeah it's hard to get that perfect spot

822
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,298
to where it's gonna split out into four

823
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,669
different branches of stages - but yeah

824
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:54,158
I've done it accidentally - I thought

825
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:56,590
I'd topped right and then it turned out

826
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,778
to be a film which was it's kind of cool

827
00:30:56,589 --> 00:31:00,788
I don't know but I hard over to miss

828
00:30:58,778 --> 00:31:02,769
it's almost harder to miss than it is to

829
00:31:00,788 --> 00:31:04,599
get it right I don't like to get to get

830
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:06,190
that right miss so that it gives you

831
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:08,199
those tops those extra tops it's almost

832
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:09,500
harder to get it wrong than it is to get

833
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,120
it right

834
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,509
so that now if ma femme isn't something

835
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:16,159
I often practice to be honest but I

836
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:19,309
would love to hear from the viewers how

837
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,440
many of you guys try to film on purpose

838
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:22,940
let us know down in the comments section

839
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,460
below and let us know like when you try

840
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,720
to film as well good question there's so

841
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,490
many different ways to do it right

842
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,220
you know what note do you like to film

843
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,660
at and to get the best result from so

844
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,640
anything on that anything else one

845
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,380
filming no you nailed it man you know

846
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,850
that not something I heard at practice

847
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,470
myself but again something to experiment

848
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:41,329
with that there's so many different

849
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:44,839
techniques and I think that's the joy of

850
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:47,149
being a gardener in 2020 is that people

851
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,859
are trying everything now and you can

852
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,300
almost go and check someone out who's

853
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:52,399
doing it you know and you'll find

854
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:54,980
someone and then pick up some techniques

855
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,230
have you ever heard of no technique

856
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,970
plant training you know never heard of

857
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,529
that no technique no you'd have to

858
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,220
explain because maybe it's not as simple

859
00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:03,319
as it sounds

860
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,029
yeah so I came across the Sun on the

861
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:08,019
website that was talking about it all it

862
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:11,629
is is basically taking that main branch

863
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:13,700
bending it down 90 degrees and that's a

864
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:15,260
no other training on top of that so just

865
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,090
taking that initial initial branch

866
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:18,680
bending down 90 degrees and then of

867
00:32:17,089 --> 00:32:20,569
course the lower branches of stuff are

868
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,440
gonna grow up so I thought that was

869
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:23,029
pretty interesting it's something

870
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,920
actually when I was looking at some

871
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:26,839
training websites or websites talking

872
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,640
about training right before you know

873
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,769
we're talking here today I came across

874
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,390
the Hat and I was curious to know if you

875
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:34,279
had ever heard of that because it's

876
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,590
something that I really hadn't heard

877
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:38,149
that before and I don't really know

878
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:41,240
anybody who just bends it down 90

879
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:43,790
degrees right and I be I'm sorry go

880
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,549
ahead but you know that is another form

881
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:49,250
of training I I would be I don't know I

882
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:51,559
like I just cuz I've never tried it you

883
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,369
can't knock it not in this industry but

884
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:58,009
initially I think the first been

885
00:32:54,369 --> 00:33:00,769
fantastic but I feel like those under

886
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:02,450
branches still needs some sort of

887
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:05,690
attention in order to give you that

888
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:08,210
maximization or maximized potential of

889
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:10,940
the the plant now now I'll be curious

890
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:14,779
though are you bending it at three nodes

891
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:16,490
are you bending it at three feet yeah

892
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:18,589
I'd be curious because maybe at three

893
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:20,630
feet if you bend that over those those

894
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:22,579
branches are a little farther along but

895
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,500
I'ma be assuming pretty stretch

896
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:27,289
yeah techniques learn something every

897
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,000
day he's exciting okay what about super

898
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:31,460
cropping let's move on to super coughing

899
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,079
do you want to explain I know I've seen

900
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,990
that on your channel before do you want

901
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:37,759
to explain what that is do you want me

902
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:40,220
to uh yeah go ahead go ahead keep

903
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,140
consistent and I'll go with your your

904
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,690
definition ok so super cropping is

905
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:48,410
really just I guess you're kind of

906
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:50,930
breaking that outer layer of the plants

907
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,120
you know the what cell membrane or

908
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:56,420
whatever you want to call it and kind of

909
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:58,969
flop and making it flop over so some

910
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,860
people do that normally I typically do

911
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,690
it when it's during that three-week

912
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:04,250
stretch period and I'm having trouble

913
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,650
controlling the stretch or if I want to

914
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:10,010
kind of keep that canopy even in some

915
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:13,429
sense I'll go ahead and I'll just like

916
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:15,650
you were doing it right there kind of

917
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:17,840
manipulating that breaking off that

918
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:20,809
outer layer and then flopping it down

919
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,550
and then as the things flop down it

920
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:24,139
allows the lower branches to kind of

921
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,910
catch up and that thing will you know

922
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:28,099
it'll pop back up nope that branch is

923
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:29,690
gonna pop back up yeah I mean kind of a

924
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,610
poor definition but that's kind of no

925
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:33,470
that's really that's really it and

926
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:36,980
honestly if there is a technique that I

927
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:39,619
follow the most it's super cropping it's

928
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:42,230
it's exactly that now some some mate

929
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:45,440
might argue that it's it's just the main

930
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:48,289
branch that you're super cropping and

931
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,909
and and sure if that's the definition of

932
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:52,219
super cropping would be the main branch

933
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:54,710
then sure sure yeah I certainly exercise

934
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:56,359
that as well but the manipulation of the

935
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,309
cell membrane and someone in the

936
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,420
comments can tell us what that there's a

937
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:02,029
name I know it is

938
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:04,610
but anyways when you break that cell

939
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:07,870
membrane I guess it could be argued to

940
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:11,090
that that is high stress training yeah

941
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:12,739
for sure and and that is that is a

942
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:16,789
practice that I think needs to be

943
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:18,469
utilized in the garden or at least if

944
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:20,929
you want to get the numbers to which

945
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:24,379
that you're that particular seed can or

946
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:25,759
that strain can Hart harvest then super

947
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,800
cropping is where you're gonna get that

948
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,830
I feel that the manipulation of the stem

949
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,289
is what seriously reinforces the

950
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:35,690
structure which then supports the the

951
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:36,170
flower at the very end the bigger the

952
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,809
strong

953
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:41,690
that stem is the more the more dense the

954
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:45,109
speck they go hand-in-hand if you've got

955
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:46,250
limp loose light stems you're gonna have

956
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:48,798
loose light limp

957
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:51,079
flowers it's it's literally hand in hand

958
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:52,869
the stronger the plant is in veg the

959
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:56,630
stronger the plant's gonna be in flower

960
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:57,980
environment a excluded kind of thing you

961
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:00,769
know what I mean variables excluded but

962
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:03,260
super cropping is is is is the technique

963
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:05,719
that I'd like to utilize the most every

964
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:08,690
single day I come in the garden and

965
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:13,459
manipulate my my my plants during veg

966
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:16,730
and then less manipulation of it during

967
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:18,199
the stretch more of just anytime you

968
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,329
want to bend the stem you can't just

969
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:23,269
come into your flower room and just bend

970
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:26,180
it over you need to manipulate it now

971
00:36:23,269 --> 00:36:27,858
how much you want that bent in flower I

972
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:29,779
don't want that I don't want it to lay

973
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:33,409
flat in most cases I just needed to come

974
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:35,210
down in inches rather than to come flat

975
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:38,088
so super cropping great technique and

976
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:41,059
and when I utilize almost the entirety

977
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:43,578
of the girl so I only utilize it when I

978
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:45,140
need to kind of create that even canopy

979
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:47,660
and I feel like low stirring isn't an

980
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:49,338
option anymore because maybe it's like

981
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:50,808
that Center branch in the middle and

982
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:54,108
it's like well I can't really pull it

983
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:55,880
down with the other branches I Supercop

984
00:36:54,108 --> 00:36:58,429
are you saying you do super copying in

985
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,559
order to strengthen the stems yeah

986
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:02,298
everybody every step Wow

987
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,819
when I come in if you've watched a

988
00:37:02,298 --> 00:37:07,880
time-lapse on my video although all the

989
00:37:04,818 --> 00:37:09,858
plants start or even a training all the

990
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,780
plants start very high up they're all

991
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:13,699
very perky pointed to the words the

992
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:16,220
light that's when I will come in and in

993
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:18,558
in in you know I'd say it's like a 60-40

994
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:20,719
in terms of bending and twisting

995
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,970
I want those like once you bend those

996
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,588
main when you start bending your plants

997
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:26,868
you're gonna find very quickly that

998
00:37:24,588 --> 00:37:28,940
there's gonna be stronger ones stronger

999
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:31,010
stems on the outside just just through

1000
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,838
through nature itself without the

1001
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:35,299
training and you're gonna have weaker

1002
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:37,730
ones in the middle going through the

1003
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:39,798
middle the middle branches is where I'm

1004
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:41,179
exercising that technique the most to

1005
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:43,250
make sure that they're gonna keep up

1006
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:44,808
with the outer branches so that I'm

1007
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:48,380
gonna have similar buds throughout the

1008
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:49,670
entirety of the plant yeah I think yeah

1009
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,380
I would say yes so

1010
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,000
when do you start super coughing the

1011
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,190
moment I'm gonna make that first Bend if

1012
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,230
it would the moment I'm gonna bend it in

1013
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,220
veg would be the moment I start to super

1014
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,429
crop you're gonna start to manipulate

1015
00:37:58,219 --> 00:38:04,759
that stem try to I don't know if

1016
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:07,250
breaking is the right way to describe it

1017
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,319
all the time if if super cropping is the

1018
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:12,440
technique of breaking the stem you know

1019
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:15,558
you can hear it snapping I don't think I

1020
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,630
do that all the time but the idea of you

1021
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:20,210
know stretching that membrane and

1022
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:22,490
manipulating enough that it falls over

1023
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:24,769
is is more of the technique that I

1024
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:27,139
follow but breaking it is just another

1025
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:28,670
way of getting it done yeah so when do

1026
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:30,710
you stop it then when when's the last

1027
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:33,048
time you super crop really typically

1028
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:35,539
like if it's going like it'll be late

1029
00:38:33,048 --> 00:38:36,980
veg because typically I've got by the by

1030
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:40,369
the time I'm sending the flower I've

1031
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:42,740
created the canopy that I bet I'm happy

1032
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:46,190
with so then I'm sending it to flower

1033
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:49,368
at that point when it comes to keeping

1034
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:52,490
the canopy even I it's more of just a

1035
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:54,200
light manipulation of the stem so I

1036
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:55,848
would I would say it's still within the

1037
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:58,368
first couple weeks of a flower still

1038
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:59,960
still trying to make sure because like I

1039
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,818
said by the time your flower in your

1040
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,159
plant your stems are really thick

1041
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:06,608
they're very heavy and and and and

1042
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:10,308
they've they've almost built up like a

1043
00:39:06,608 --> 00:39:12,108
not a bark but like um just an outer

1044
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:14,690
core and if you were to come up to that

1045
00:39:12,108 --> 00:39:15,769
that branch and just try to back to get

1046
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,150
it to go flat with the rest of the

1047
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:18,858
canopy it's gonna snap in half and

1048
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:21,170
you're gonna lose it without taping it

1049
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:23,739
back together so you're gonna have to

1050
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:26,630
kind of kind of rub it in your fingers

1051
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:29,568
just to get that that that bent that

1052
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,039
stem to bend down a little bit so first

1053
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:32,568
couple weeks of flower do you have a

1054
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,130
tutorial video on your channel that I

1055
00:39:32,568 --> 00:39:36,170
can link oh yes okay I'll link

1056
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:38,869
description section below for for

1057
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,700
everybody out here so during that three

1058
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:44,559
week stretch for a period and flower you

1059
00:39:40,699 --> 00:39:47,298
you really don't do I'm super copping no

1060
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:50,269
no I wouldn't I wouldn't say to the

1061
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:51,920
extent that I am in veg every day no no

1062
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:53,929
okay no because I'm hoping by the time

1063
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,818
I've sent it to flower all of the

1064
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:59,149
effects that I've done in veg are enough

1065
00:39:55,818 --> 00:40:00,679
that those stems are good like they're

1066
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:03,539
tight they're built they're robust

1067
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:06,299
they're strong any any bending that goes

1068
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:09,960
and flour is just merely to keep the

1069
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:12,660
canopy flat all even you might even tie

1070
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,369
down still in flour to make sure that

1071
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:18,239
it's but I know I wouldn't say that I

1072
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:20,250
continue super cropping in flour okay as

1073
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,719
intense as intense there's that's as

1074
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,769
Canadian answer as you're gonna get

1075
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:26,609
right there I think I went both ways

1076
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:28,500
three times and arguably I mean somebody

1077
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:30,240
could could probably comment and say you

1078
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,449
don't want to be sort of high stress

1079
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:39,419
training in flour right I'm you can but

1080
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:40,710
I give Lee training yeah your your plan

1081
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,210
would then focusing on that repair

1082
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:45,000
process instead of the blood formation

1083
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:46,530
process so I try to avoid doing any type

1084
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,519
of high stress training techniques like

1085
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:54,690
that or topping in the flowering stage

1086
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:55,949
but I do do it just to try to create

1087
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:57,720
that can be even as like a lot you've

1088
00:40:55,949 --> 00:40:59,579
gotta do what you got to do keep that

1089
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:00,959
canopy even because that's what's gonna

1090
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:02,969
reward you in the long run

1091
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,320
and I found I need to do it whenever I

1092
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:06,029
do like a trellis and try to like do

1093
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,200
like a screw to scrub technique you know

1094
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,350
I find like during that three-week

1095
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:12,750
stretch period in flower it I don't have

1096
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:14,730
the chance to bend down it anymore to

1097
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:17,639
get under the netting anymore so I'll

1098
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:20,639
you know I'll super cry so that's just

1099
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:22,319
another another time I do it anything

1100
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,210
else on super cropping don't be afraid

1101
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,620
don't be afraid it's another one of

1102
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,210
those techniques as you're it's very

1103
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:29,400
aggressive it's very hands-on these

1104
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:33,030
plants are resilient and it's almost

1105
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:36,750
it's almost the more abuse at the right

1106
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:38,519
time is is he's gonna reward you they

1107
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,949
can handle it they can handle it well I

1108
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:42,509
think we've covered a lot in this video

1109
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:44,730
man this was good this was a lot of fun

1110
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,860
yeah yeah good stuff so thank you so

1111
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:50,039
much pigeons for coming on to my channel

1112
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:53,130
and discussing training techniques I

1113
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:54,690
think that this is definitely some good

1114
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:57,539
information again for the people viewing

1115
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:59,639
this and I've got beginners I've got

1116
00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:01,800
veterans that are viewing this there's

1117
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:03,359
so many different ways to do it just

1118
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,930
experiment and yeah I just try to have

1119
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,329
fun with it

1120
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:08,099
right that's the key have fun because

1121
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:09,449
there's already enough stresses let

1122
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:11,339
alone though in the world there's enough

1123
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:13,859
stresses in the garden that'll keep you

1124
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,940
preoccupied we don't need to we don't

1125
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,920
need to create any more unnecessary

1126
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,530
stress have fun

1127
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,329
relax and it's it's quite the experience

1128
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:23,370
and anything that you experience through

1129
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:25,710
this grow is going to seriously help you

1130
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:27,750
in the next grill so get your hands

1131
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,420
dirty and Chris I want to thank you for

1132
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:32,489
having me as I said at the beginning

1133
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:34,230
your this this this form of interview

1134
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:36,239
this kind of content is is a shining

1135
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:38,219
light for our community and I look

1136
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:40,829
forward to seeing seeing what else and

1137
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:42,179
who else you can have have over and and

1138
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:44,130
the information you can pull from them

1139
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:45,750
much needed and I want to hear from I

1140
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,369
want to hear from in the comments to you

1141
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,530
know whether you agree or disagree what

1142
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:51,569
are your techniques because like I said

1143
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:53,310
we've been here for almost an hour forty

1144
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,570
some minutes but it's like we haven't

1145
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:55,920
even scratched the surface we haven't

1146
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:58,769
even scratched the surface in terms of

1147
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,619
of the techniques and the numbers of

1148
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:04,949
ways of getting it done so absolutely

1149
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:06,630
more content for the future yep and yeah

1150
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:08,939
another question if the viewers is who

1151
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,340
would you like me to kind of have a

1152
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,920
discussion with next right so I talked

1153
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:17,039
with Rob from CL TV we've got pigeons

1154
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,630
here I want to get more growers involved

1155
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,909
in these types of conversations because

1156
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:23,880
there's just there's so many different

1157
00:43:20,909 --> 00:43:25,289
perceptions on ways to do things it's

1158
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,630
going to generate ideas for people right

1159
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:29,730
