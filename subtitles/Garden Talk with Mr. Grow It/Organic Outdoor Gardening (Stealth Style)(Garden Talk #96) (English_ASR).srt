1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,318
coming up on Garden talk it's really

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,419
important to visit that site many times

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,160
of the day you know go there in the

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:10,500
morning go there in the evening go the

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,679
go to the sort of midday in amongst the

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,940
other plants it's sort of it looks like

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,698
stinging nettles it could be anything

8
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,920
it's sort of a sort of green Mass isn't

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,679
it I mean it it seems nothing best

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,140
advice I could have is get yourself a

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,899
dog or if you don't have a dog buy

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,179
yourself a dog lead because at least if

13
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,439
you're found out in the wild and you've

14
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,238
got a dog that you can protect at least

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,399
pretend you're looking for your dog it's

16
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,379
really easy to get down the rabbit hole

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,539
and it's amazing it's so much fun and

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,879
it's it's so many good positive things

19
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,159
it's amazing for mental health it's it's

20
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,140
all those good things and I can't

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,538
recommend it highly enough but

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,399
have an understanding of consequence and

23
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,399
just have an Exit Plan

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,899

going to be a fantastic thumbnail I'm

83
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,200
super excited that you decided to

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,180
disguise your identity I fit your

85
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,399
character

86
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,099
you know pleasure to be here but in

87
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,658
order to get good quality sound uh we'll

88
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:30,060
have you remove that mask and just have

89
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:32,818
that other disguise that you have what

90
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,019
about the farmer and and here we are

91
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:37,219
back

92
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:40,200
back in the room so uh yeah totally

93
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:41,098
still still hard to see who I am but um

94
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,899
yeah

95
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:45,298
it's like this slightly better audio

96
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,120
exactly so today we're going to talk

97
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,159
about Gorilla growing you are a gorilla

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,500
grower and have to implement stealth

99
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,639
practices in order to be successful so

100
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,979
in this episode I'd like to get into

101
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,419
what you do but first how about

102
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:58,859
introduction can you tell us a little

103
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,738
bit about yourself and how you got into

104
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,540
gardening yeah I think I I have been

105
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:07,500
being company I think probably sort of

106
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:10,560
illegally for 20 years uh I think for me

107
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,060
the the sort of turnpoint was that sort

108
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,580
of sense of

109
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,100
quality I think it comes down to that

110
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,100
idea of you know the difference between

111
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,959
a cake you bake yourself and one you buy

112
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,419
from the shops and I think the day you

113
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,879
learn to bake a cake that is amazing

114
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:29,579
that you do it at home you suddenly go

115
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,439
oh hang on a second maybe there's

116
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:33,659
another way and I think that's that's

117
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,379
what it came down to medicinal plants

118
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,360
that's for me was a sort of a a bit of a

119
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:42,540
sea change and I and

120
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,759
you know I was buying medicinal plants

121
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,100
in a city where they were being

122
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,199
adulterated the spice was a thing people

123
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,840
are spraying stuff on that you sort of

124
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
your option is one which sort of makes

125
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,258
you feel like you're sort of having a

126
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,599
mental breakdown because it's so strong

127
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,699
and the sort of the philosophy of the

128
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,100
people that are producing their images

129
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,259
of plant is I want something that makes

130
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,180
you do some of the enemies it's not good

131
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,040
you know it's it's like being in a bar

132
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,079
where they only sell spirits and all you

133
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:15,000
want is a beer so I think ultimately

134
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:17,219
it's that you know the cake you bake

135
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,019
yourself is the best so that's what

136
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,419
really brought me to the table and sort

137
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,918
of access and sort of that quality and

138
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:25,439
the the lack of wanting to be anything

139
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,719
to do with the criminality and you know

140
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,079
there's lots of things wrong with in the

141
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,180
legal market and ultimately you take

142
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,459
control of your that Destiny and it's

143
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,560
not difficult to do and I think

144
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,239
and I think that's often for people to

145
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,280
barrier it's that sort of you getting

146
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,780
into a sort of habit you you you're

147
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,559
tapped into that legal market and

148
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,538
actually

149
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,839
there's there's ways to do that that

150
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:51,418
isn't a legal market and you can have an

151
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,060
independence and the internet provides

152
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:56,399
you with all the knowledge and there is

153
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,259
a world outside there that you can just

154
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,879
get involved and that's where the

155
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,280
Gorilla Grow comes from and I think

156
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,439
that's what I want to sort of convey and

157
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,478
inspire people to think you know there's

158
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,519
another way you don't need to be

159
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,579
involved with that criminal see you can

160
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,859
do things and you can get involved in

161
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,258
doing things totally differently that

162
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,500
takes you out of that and gives you just

163
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,600
like like you know that home baked cake

164
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,759
experience

165
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,740
um when you've you've only ever had shop

166
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,419
all stuff so I mean that's that's

167
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,840
basically what I hope to inspire people

168
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:33,060
to do and um yeah that's that's where I

169
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:36,719
come from what exactly is Gorilla

170
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,699
growing and why do it well I think uh I

171
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,840
think for a lot of people that

172
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:44,939
maybe maybe have no space no don't have

173
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,038
a gun they live in a city in a flat area

174
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,199
and I suppose we don't have a garden or

175
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,759
maybe you live with a gardener you you

176
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,520
couldn't grow

177
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,840
stuff that maybe people would

178
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,859
Farm

179
00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:00,060
so there's that and and and if you live

180
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,060
in a part of the world where maybe

181
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,339
that's illegal than you know having

182
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,160
stuff rooted in the ground you know or

183
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:09,538
in a portal it's a liability makes you

184
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,699
vulnerable and I think the problem with

185
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:13,560
all this sort of illegality it makes you

186
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,240
really vulnerable and they can be a

187
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,918
partner they can be a friend that can be

188
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,199
all sorts of numbers of things that

189
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:20,758
makes you really vulnerable so if you've

190
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,919
got it in in the ground in your garden

191
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,360
and you think whatever you know you

192
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:27,000
don't get it with your neighbor that's

193
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,520
you You're vulnerable whereas no one's

194
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,839
ever been prosecuted for growing a tree

195
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,939
in the forest

196
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,859
and that's that's what it comes down to

197
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,899
so maybe you don't have a girl maybe you

198
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,199
live in a class in a city and you're

199
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:43,019
thinking you know I really like smoking

200
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,300
and you know it's it's expensive and

201
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:47,579
maybe maybe the cost of living process

202
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,639
that's a it's a thing but maybe you

203
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:52,379
could go on a bus ride or a train ride

204
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,240
and you're sort of suddenly in the

205
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:56,699
countryside and maybe you just go

206
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,259
somewhere frequently and you you find a

207
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,060
place that you can put something in the

208
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,939
ground and maybe you visit once a week

209
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,379
and hey you know the liability of that

210
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:05,639
versus I mean in your garden that's

211
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:07,740
there every day and all the

212
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,319
vulnerability that comes with that

213
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,879
um man that's a federal alternative for

214
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,500
you and maybe that's something we can

215
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:17,038
explore whether this podcast this

216
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:20,639
evening got it how do you determine a

217
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,978
good piece of land or a spot to grow in

218
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,319
well I think it comes down to I mean I

219
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:26,939
think the best advice I could have is

220
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,800
get yourself a dog

221
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,560
or if you don't have a dog buy yourself

222
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,899
a dog lead because at least if you're

223
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,979
found out in the world and you've got a

224
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,019
dog that you can protect at least

225
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,580
pretend you're looking for your dog but

226
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,918
I think the thing about a dog is people

227
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,200
see the dog not the person so if you're

228
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,539
if you're out in the world in the

229
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,300
countryside and you've got a dog people

230
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:49,980
see the dog another person so that's a

231
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:51,778
pretty good thing and dog's an amazing

232
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,759
for your mental health amazing for just

233
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,679
like your soul I mean they're a great

234
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,600
thing and why why wouldn't you have a

235
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:01,139
dog if you could

236
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,659
um but but ultimately it's it's about

237
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,399
there's a lot of Countryside that is

238
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:08,338
available and there's a lot of footpaths

239
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,620
certainly in a lot of countries that you

240
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,899
can go along and and you can find a

241
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,139
space and I suppose it's about going out

242
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:18,480
there finding something that's that's a

243
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:21,179
wave off the footer path a little bit

244
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,940
hidden a little bit discreet no straight

245
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:26,039
lines you want to have a zigzag path you

246
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,140
want to find a spot that gets Sun all

247
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,659
day you want to find somewhere that's

248
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,278
sort of you know now's a good time to go

249
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:34,860
look because you can sort of see what

250
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:37,500
the growth was when it was sort of the

251
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:40,080
the plants are all out and stuff but you

252
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,839
can sort of start to sneak in in through

253
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,940
that and find a space that maybe you'd

254
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,800
be perfect you'll feel good right that's

255
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,160
pretty straightforward and so once you

256
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:53,099
identify a site to grow in or a piece of

257
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,000
property an area how do you prepare that

258
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,940
site

259
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,679
well I think it's really important to

260
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,600
visit that site many times of the day

261
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,639
you know go there in the morning okay

262
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,200
they're in the evening go the go to the

263
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,958
sort of midday you want to you want to

264
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,959
have Optimum that that peak time of the

265
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:12,778
day where it sort of Optimum Sun you

266
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,518
want to be sunny but you sort of ideally

267
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,799
wanted to be sunny all day you want to

268
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,139
be there from sort of dawn to dusk and

269
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,759
in the Sun so sort of when you're

270
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,379
scoping you're site you wouldn't have

271
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:25,259
that's that's really what you're looking

272
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:28,259
for there's always a risk of people kind

273
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:31,139
of finding you walking to that area or

274
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:33,600
people identifying that that site how do

275
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,639
you manage security and you know

276
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,040
camouflaging the area right keeping the

277
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:40,379
area camouflaged so people aren't able

278
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,599
to see it what do you do for that well I

279
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,578
think there's a few things that are sort

280
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,680
of crucial for that number one sort of

281
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:48,719
have a have a site where your entrance

282
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,399
and exit are different so if someone

283
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,200
follows you they're not going to see you

284
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,039
come out of the same way you went in

285
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,140
always have an in and out number two the

286
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,899
sort of security just as a digital

287
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:03,059
security Rule and phone that that fair

288
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,940
attracts you when you when if you if

289
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:09,419
you're into this project turn your phone

290
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,399
off to turn that location for anything

291
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,740
that's your biggest sort of enemy in all

292
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,078
of this you get arrested and I think

293
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,360
there's a wider point on that the phone

294
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,039
is dead to you don't don't get involved

295
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,778
with that don't be there taking pictures

296
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:25,078
of what's Happening your friends all

297
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:26,759
that my life it's it's a it's a bad

298
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:29,819
thing and I think that's the wider point

299
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:32,338
to be made there tell them this is this

300
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,660
is this is like a private project you

301
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,540
know anyone you tell that's a

302
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:38,879
vulnerability you know your best friend

303
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:41,838
whatever anyone that doesn't need to

304
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,360
know doesn't need to know you know

305
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,040
you only expose yourself to danger and

306
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,800
you know you can misjudge things we're

307
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,778
all used to misjudging things and this

308
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:54,059
is no different and ultimately if you

309
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:56,220
tell no one then there's no risk you

310
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:58,439
know you tell everyone then

311
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,899
good story it's no one else is doing it

312
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,940
you know oh my friend you know oh it

313
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,139
just it makes you vulnerable it comes

314
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,880
back to the whole thing because it's

315
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,439
legal it's abundable it makes you

316
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,620
vulnerable I think that's what I'd say

317
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,540
or not I think one risk is the smell

318
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,740
right I mean these plants they once

319
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:15,899
they're in the flowering stage they're

320
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,820
giving off an aroma do you worry about

321
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,980
the smell at all

322
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,459
well I think the smile more comes from

323
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,860
the Cure in the dry I mean it's it's you

324
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:28,439
know the benefit of growing Outdoors is

325
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,680
there is if you've got a good site and

326
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,660
it's away from the people the smell yes

327
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,000
it's amazing it's strong it's whatever

328
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:38,519
but if you've got a good sight that's

329
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,958
irrelevant where it comes into being a

330
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,600
problem maybe is when it comes to

331
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:46,799
drawing it and if you've got you know a

332
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,300
kilos a kilo flour or a couple of kilos

333
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,000
of flour and that's drying that that

334
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:53,519
smells and I suppose that's more of your

335
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,259
concern and it's all very good to get

336
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,120
all excited and then suddenly you've got

337
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:59,700
it in the bags and it's like oh my

338
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,000
goodness this smells it really really

339
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:05,459
really smells so I think having a plan

340
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,078
of where you're going to dry that is far

341
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,659
more important than worrying about the

342
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,638
smell in the film understood now back in

343
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:13,919
the day in the United States they used

344
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,220
to have helicopters flying all over the

345
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,139
place looking for gorilla grows and

346
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,579
Landing chopping down plants and so on

347
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,399
and so forth you deal with any of that

348
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:26,458
stuff where where you live well I I

349
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,379
suppose what I do isn't is not that

350
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,939
Common People pillow I don't think

351
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:33,000
there's thousands of people out there

352
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,880
doing it and I think the key is subtlety

353
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,519
don't buy the plants that like guarantee

354
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,578
like three meters tall okay they're

355
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,679
small and plenty you know don't clear

356
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:45,299
all the underground in the way just just

357
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,239
do it in a way that should have been

358
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:50,338
ends in you know a medicinal plant and

359
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,620
Senior Nettles look very similar from

360
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:54,180
resistance and if you don't clear it out

361
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,940
if you've got a clearing where it's sort

362
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,319
of really obvious then yes you're a

363
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,899
drone a helicopter will say it but if

364
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,540
it's in amongst the other plants it's

365
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,278
sort of he looks like stingy Nettles it

366
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:07,799
could be anything it's sort of a sort of

367
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:11,039
green Mass isn't it I mean it it seems

368
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:13,620
nothing okay gotcha now let's get deeper

369
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,539
into actually growing the plants in the

370
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,778
area so first of all do you grow

371
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:20,759
autoflowers or photo period and then do

372
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:22,078
you start the plants indoors and then

373
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,019
bring them Outdoors or what's your

374
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:28,138
process there I think I think for me for

375
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,600
me I've got a little LED grow light that

376
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,639
I could ever trunk and I'll do maybe six

377
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,100
months at a time and then I don't know

378
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,600
do they mean batches and we'll go from

379
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:42,420
zero to a mix of Auto and uh uh photo uh

380
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,639
seats I think it's sort of having that

381
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:46,979
Ying in the Yang I think Autos are great

382
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,039
but you just don't get the same yield as

383
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:53,639
you get off of a photo favorite seed so

384
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:55,559
I think it's it's nice to make sure both

385
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,198
um and I think

386
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,698
you know with hardening off and you want

387
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:01,919
to put them out you want to give them

388
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:04,919
that chance to sort of get a bit more

389
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:08,458
but I think generally

390
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:10,019
with with with with all of this because

391
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,239
you've got that long period of time it

392
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:14,039
gives you that opportunity to

393
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,480
do a bit more of that training a bit

394
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,519
more of that

395
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,740
um manipulating the plan if you

396
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,639
particularly with the photos whereas the

397
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:26,100
Autos you're sort of in and boom it's

398
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,019
three months or whatever however long so

399
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,459
it's sort of nice to have a ying and the

400
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,019
Young on there and how long are you

401
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:33,299
vegging them indoors before you actually

402
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:36,360
bring their material to a location

403
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:39,958
well I would say at least

404
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,199
um until you've got three tiers of plant

405
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:46,259
hi but probably that would probably

406
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,879
about a month to six weeks before we

407
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,519
take them out into the into the class

408
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,639
but I think what's interesting is that

409
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,019
if as long as you get them in sort of

410
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,440
really before August

411
00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:00,360
they all become pretty similar size and

412
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,760
I think that's sort of that idea of the

413
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,620
sort of May the fourth being the day

414
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,078
where if you want the big ones well you

415
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,879
know what I plugged it stuff end of June

416
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:11,099
they've been as big as the ones I put in

417
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,439
in the beginning of may you know those

418
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,839
sort of key months of sort of June July

419
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,600
August really what makes the difference

420
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,639
now do you bring out soil and use

421
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,220
containers so they're they're grown in

422
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,899
containers or are you taking the plants

423
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,180
and then planting them directly in the

424
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,940
ground at the spot that you chose

425
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,879
I started out when I when I stopped

426
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,380
doing this I was sort of like yeah

427
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:37,078
containers above ground let's sort of

428
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:39,480
own the soil actually as I've got it

429
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:42,359
gone on I've gone in the ground and

430
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,339
there's several reasons for that so fine

431
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,039
you've got a container it's got to find

432
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,660
out of finite amount of space and if

433
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,039
you're putting all the micro roses in

434
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:52,500
there and you're sort of doing that

435
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:55,019
whole organic let's let's have a living

436
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,578
soil obviously you needed quite a big

437
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:59,159
container for that to be a sustainable

438
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:01,739
amount of living soil you know for that

439
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:04,859
to for you not to have to keep adding

440
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,318
the sort of microbes to keep it alive it

441
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:09,418
actually embrace that if you're doing it

442
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:12,298
Outdoors embrace the outdoors get

443
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:15,059
involved you know get get in there and

444
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:17,160
actually there's so much to be had from

445
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:19,500
that you you you're at the mercy of the

446
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,240
environment where I started out doing

447
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,578
sort of raised things but I found there

448
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,699
was two two factors number one they drew

449
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:29,099
a drying out much quicker and and number

450
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:32,419
two actually you you don't gain any of

451
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:34,859
the benefit of having the wild

452
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:36,720
involved in your growth you're sort of

453
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:38,399
this sort of thing plant

454
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,440
in the middle of it whereas actually

455
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,559
when you put it in the ground suddenly

456
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,538
you're tapped into them ecosystem you're

457
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:48,960
tapped into the environment you're sort

458
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:51,240
of the you know you're you're part of

459
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,940
nature actually that gives you loads of

460
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,700
benefits you know it's very rare to see

461
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,380
Florence in nature that is overwhelmed

462
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:02,340
by those spider bites another sort of

463
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:04,799
pass actually you you get involved in it

464
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:07,079
if it's a healthy plant actually you're

465
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,779
not worrying about the past there isn't

466
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:11,220
all these things coming on and yeah I

467
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:13,139
frequently hurt my plants and those

468
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,240
lovely spiders in there and eating all

469
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,100
sorts of stuff and they should have been

470
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,079
treat it as much as they do every other

471
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:20,639
plants within that environment you sort

472
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:22,918
of tapped into that both in the root

473
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,140
system and both in in terms of the sort

474
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,059
of bugs that are eating the other bugs

475
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,038
so how many trips do you actually take

476
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:32,099
to that location then you know you're

477
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,720
gonna think equipment nutrients all that

478
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:36,240
stuff how many how often do you go on

479
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,880
like back and forth to that location so

480
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,880
I think that for me just sort of looking

481
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,679
at how frequently you go I it's a part

482
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,480
really depends on how many plants you

483
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,720
grow and I sort of want to speak to a

484
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,660
little bit to that is you know I think a

485
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,220
federal look at your uh I suppose

486
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,700
there's a there's a big question you've

487
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,980
got to have there is if I get called

488
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,200
how much of a fair to get caught with

489
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,360
and yeah it's just a funny question but

490
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,980
you know we gotta you've got to assess

491
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,319
the risks before you get involved in

492
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,880
this and it's a commitment you know if

493
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,200
you want to do goretta growing this

494
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,200
isn't just like

495
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,298
buying in a few seeds turn up sort of

496
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,759
three months later and woohoo happy days

497
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:20,639
doesn't work like that it's like a sort

498
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:24,119
of frequent visit you've got to really

499
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,919
work hard to get the yields it's no less

500
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:28,619
intensive than if you're very indoors

501
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,419
the fact that sun is free doesn't

502
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:33,418
doesn't take away from the fact that

503
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,799
actually it's a lot of work if you're

504
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,559
doing the training you're doing all the

505
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:41,400
other bits involves it it's a commitment

506
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:43,379
so in terms of the numbers is what do

507
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,860
you prefer to do I think you want at

508
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:49,620
least once a week visit and then you

509
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:51,719
want to bring your foot I mean for me I

510
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:54,859
I own the only thing I've ring is

511
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:58,019
nutrients I don't bring water the the

512
00:19:54,859 --> 00:20:00,479
God will do that with the rain

513
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:02,639
um but it's it's purely nutrients you

514
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,919
bring in and then it's how how many

515
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,960
plants and how prepared to do that

516
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,280
frequently I

517
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,620
um the wolf loans you have the more

518
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:13,500
trips you've got to make I suppose

519
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:15,899
that's and also how much of a risky

520
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,200
Professor you first you run 20 plants

521
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,700
you prefer to run six plants I mean look

522
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,798
at your local guidelines there'll be

523
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,500
guidelines of what is acceptable is

524
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:28,740
personal if it's illegal and what's

525
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,298
considered a commercial and I suppose it

526
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,220
comes down to what do you prefer what

527
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:33,900
risks you profess fact what yield are

528
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,640
you looking for

529
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,740
um I think in my country it's about like

530
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,380
six plants it's a considered personal so

531
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:43,798
I won't do more than six in any one site

532
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,299
but I may run several sites

533
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:47,819
um I suppose that's what it comes down

534
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:51,839
to and it's the effort you've had to put

535
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:53,579
it you know I think this this season I'm

536
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,038
probably getting at least half a gram

537
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:59,579
for every liter of water I put in a

538
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:01,140
liter of um feed over there which is you

539
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:03,240
know pretty good return on investment in

540
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,280
some machines that's interesting yeah I

541
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,740
was going to ask you how often you go to

542
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,058
water the plants and you know you bring

543
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,859
up a good point you're growing in the

544
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:13,379
ground so if they were in containers

545
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:16,019
they wouldn't have access to as much

546
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,880
water as in the ground okay if you're

547
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:20,220
tapping into that sort of mycorrhiza

548
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,500
sort of scenario you want it to maybe

549
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,880
tap into the Woodland who knows with a

550
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,339
lovely

551
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,200
sort of thing that brings to you grow I

552
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:31,199
mean that's stuff you can't you can't

553
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,019
conceive it's sort of you're putting it

554
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,640
out there and and it's amazing sort of

555
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:37,918
how much of a difference that makes us

556
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,720
as they are growing in pots and actually

557
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,059
put it in the ground it was just like

558
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,819
wow there's a sort of depth to this that

559
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:46,798
is just a bit special yeah I mean the

560
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:50,519
microbes alone I mean the diversity of

561
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:53,400
microbes in the soil that's there in the

562
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:56,158
ground is way more than anything you're

563
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,600
going to get out of a bag to soil so um

564
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,720
yeah it's no surprise that you're seeing

565
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,339
a better result planting in ground yeah

566
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,740
and it's great to do that and I sort of

567
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:06,480
feel you know that's it's sort of where

568
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,279
it should be and just sort of embrace

569
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,558
the environment you're in and just sort

570
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:12,658
of love it what it is but fertilizer

571
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,579
that's one thing where I want to get a

572
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:16,559
little bit deeper into talk to us about

573
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:17,759
what you I know you said before we

574
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,519
started recording this you talked about

575
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,839
how you're fully organic 100 organic and

576
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,900
I just want to say before we get deep

577
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:27,899
into it thank you for being organic

578
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,519
Outdoors because there are so many

579
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:33,298
issues with people using synthetic

580
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,679
fertilizers over fertilizing and runoffs

581
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:36,480
happening into our lakes and streams

582
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,600
which is causing toxic algae problems

583
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,460
it's a huge issue around the world and

584
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,558
you going the organic route you're

585
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,538
helping with that so first of all thank

586
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:49,079
you for not contributing to the the

587
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:51,720
pollution of our lakes and streams for

588
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:53,939
me it's like you're out there you will

589
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,000
work with it on against it I think for

590
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,980
me also organic is just it there's no

591
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,599
reason not to

592
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,659
um there's so many amazing products out

593
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:07,019
there and for me biobuses is the is the

594
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:08,820
the one I go for it's the Dutch company

595
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,400
they do amazing stuff if you use the

596
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:12,960
fish mix which

597
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,400
jeez those those plants love it I mean

598
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,579
if you if you're growing indoors that's

599
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,340
probably a bit smelly but it it it's an

600
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:22,558
amazing product and I do the bloom and

601
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:24,839
they do the uh the tomax that they

602
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,000
produce and they sort of three things

603
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:29,819
the the thing I like about them is

604
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,759
they're just pH balance so you I don't

605
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:34,918
bother having to worry about pH

606
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:37,740
um they're pretty much everything you

607
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,740
need I go with a few other supplements

608
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,779
because do I need them really or not I

609
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,179
don't know but I mean probably the five

610
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:47,460
of us does it all but you know we're

611
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:50,159
we're busy gardeners and we like to

612
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,740
fiddle so um there's another product

613
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:56,940
that I use that is like an Eco Thrive

614
00:23:52,740 --> 00:24:00,419
and it's an organic thing for uh and so

615
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:03,000
I I I I'll break it down so when it

616
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:05,640
comes to the hole I'll dig compost in

617
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,740
and then I'll add some bone meal and

618
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,000
I'll answer back one up and I'll add

619
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,179
some

620
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,099
um fish fish and mix into that just a

621
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,860
sort of base layer for the plant to sort

622
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:18,658
of Tuck into when it needs it and be bit

623
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:20,279
careful now by guano because you can

624
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:22,140
burn the plants if you put too much in

625
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:25,079
it you know you'll get the yellow tips

626
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,940
so you know it's nice and then I'll top

627
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:29,639
dress later with some of those products

628
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,558
you know the Eco Thrive stuff is amazing

629
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,659
and and that's got all the Egyptian

630
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:36,119
that's got your insect for us that's got

631
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:39,120
all those sort of lovely things and back

632
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:42,359
what I just I find it really makes the

633
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,939
makes the flowers taste amazing so it's

634
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:49,439
sort of It's a combination of both of

635
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:51,840
those that sort of I go for I mean it's

636
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,100
feeding the microbes ultimately and I

637
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,079
think you're trying to do that on

638
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:57,538
several levels and sort of that gives

639
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:00,839
your plant the sort of the best sort of

640
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:02,700
mix of those two things so sort of the

641
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:04,740
stuff in the soil is when it needs it

642
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,259
and the stuff you're watering regularly

643
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,839
is sort of hopefully is sort of topping

644
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:13,019
up on that got it so you do an initial

645
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,759
amending of nutrients some of those are

646
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:16,679
slow release a lot of them it sounds

647
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:18,839
like our slow release so it's going to

648
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,340
break down over time and last you

649
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:23,220
throughout the grow but you're also

650
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:25,379
doing a feeding with biobuzz can you

651
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,778
break down your bio Buzz feeding a

652
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,159
little bit deeper specifically I think

653
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:32,339
you said once a week you're doing a

654
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:35,000
feeding are you following the ratios on

655
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:37,859
the actual feeding chart yeah

656
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,659
I'm totally feeding into that that what

657
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:41,038
they say is what I'm sort of mixing in

658
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:44,159
terms of those ratios that a lot of

659
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:46,319
people say do do half what they say and

660
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,760
actually I'm going full on I'm just

661
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,038
following what they say I'm following

662
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,379
their feed Max and actually I find that

663
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:54,119
that's working

664
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:56,278
I'm seeing very little yellow tipping on

665
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:59,278
my plants I'm not seeing any sort of

666
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:01,380
curling I I feel they've they've nailed

667
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,960
it they they do a very good job they're

668
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:07,260
a fantastic company and that fish stuff

669
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,480
a man the plants absolutely love it I

670
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:11,099
mean you're just getting you know you go

671
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,720
you know and there's a gorilla you

672
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:14,939
you're not seeing them every day so you

673
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,900
go once twice a week and you're like you

674
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:21,298
come back and go oh my God

675
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:23,400
it's amazing it's like it's just

676
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:25,679
exciting I mean like I'm a kid and a

677
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,240
candy shop like come back oh my God

678
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,519
that's getting bigger and bigger and I

679
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,640
think you know

680
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:35,038
um yeah having having that organic

681
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,440
matter coming in and and having the

682
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,119
balance of the two it's sort of I think

683
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,940
I think for me that's a really happy

684
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:44,459
compromise it it it it works for me you

685
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,200
mentioned big plants and I gotta ask how

686
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,759
big are these plants I don't think you

687
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,440
mentioned when you're actually planting

688
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,900
what month are you planting them and how

689
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,519
big are the plants actually growing to

690
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,380
so I mean I think the sort of May the

691
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,879
fourth is the sort of time to get the

692
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,640
big plants in but I think you get away

693
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,960
with with um

694
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,059
June you've got really big ones if you

695
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,919
get it in in June maybe we've probably

696
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:07,740
done six weeks before you plant it in

697
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,900
June so sort of went back from that

698
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,000
um I think I think for me I don't choose

699
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,980
strange that I like the sort of nine

700
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,558
foot plants because actually I don't

701
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:19,380
want something that's nine foot high and

702
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,899
for me I think there was a bit of it

703
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,919
there was a moment where I I learned

704
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,798
about

705
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:28,380
training and there was a time when there

706
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:30,298
was like well they send the the hormone

707
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,580
to the highest point in the plant I'm

708
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:35,278
just like wow that's canopy management

709
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:37,259
for me I just I know what that canopy

710
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,700
needs to be now and so I do a

711
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:40,740
combination of sort of trellis

712
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:45,900
stretching it out on the trainers and

713
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:48,120
and just canes and I'm pretty the lovely

714
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,460
thing about sort of

715
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:52,619
growing Outdoors is you've got time

716
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,298
that's the thing you can you can really

717
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:56,879
get it wrong and it doesn't really

718
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:58,798
matter it will recover you know you get

719
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,960
it wrong in June or by the time August

720
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,519
comes around you know it's recovered

721
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,400
they're pretty residual they don't got

722
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:08,639
it you know their name they call it for

723
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,740
nothing I mean it it's a robust plant it

724
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,919
can really take some sort of thing so I

725
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:16,980
will do super crafting I will do

726
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,919
a lollipopping I will do high stress

727
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,500
training I will pinch the plant and then

728
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,480
bend it over and then I will tie it to a

729
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,278
cane and the principle of having

730
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,400
everything on a Level Playing Field

731
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:31,859
making everything the same height that's

732
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,320
just until it goes into flour that's the

733
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:36,359
one strategy you need to have make

734
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:40,139
everything level when it goes into black

735
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:42,298
boom your top curlers are abounding you

736
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,860
know that that was for me a real penny

737
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:45,658
drop moment when someone just said yeah

738
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:47,699
it just sends the hormone to the highest

739
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:49,440
point in the blood I just thought wow

740
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,880
everything's going to be the highest

741
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,519
point you mentioned you're doing super

742
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,278
cropping do you also do any topping if

743
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,798
so how often do you do the topping yeah

744
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:01,798
I suppose I suppose sort of topping is I

745
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:04,440
mean I've you know doing the topping is

746
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:06,480
fairly crucial to sort of getting the

747
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,038
maximum number of sort of things so it's

748
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,038
a combination of topping and training

749
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:13,319
and you sort of the more you do it you

750
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,960
sort of the you sort of learned that

751
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:18,960
maybe is the one to do look at the front

752
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,659
be sort of organic with how it sort of

753
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,399
is growing and sort of if there's

754
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,679
particular ones that are going up maybe

755
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:28,678
that's the one to top and just sort of

756
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,679
have a bit of a sense I suppose you you

757
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,298
you it's such a long time so each of

758
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,000
those plenty of sort of quite intimate

759
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:38,220
with you you really learn them you learn

760
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,440
what those plants are you sort of have

761
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,899
that relationship with them and it

762
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,058
sounds ridiculous but it it is that

763
00:29:42,898 --> 00:29:47,339
you're sort of looking you're seeing Oh

764
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:49,038
that bit's going well there that bit oh

765
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:51,898
if I crop that it will go

766
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:54,179
to that and and I suppose that's it it's

767
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:57,418
like regular interaction with the plant

768
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:58,740
it's looking at it and just reading it

769
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:00,299
and the more you do it the more you'll

770
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,120
learn the more you'll see you'll make

771
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:05,220
mistakes and that's the proof you're

772
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,798
learning in some respects yeah being

773
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,778
patient with it taking your time and

774
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:13,139
doing the training making sure all the

775
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:16,200
training is done prior to it starting to

776
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,640
flower can certainly be super key I mean

777
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,778
you mentioned you're doing lollipopping

778
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,580
which a lot of people know the benefit

779
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:23,339
one of the big benefits of that is to

780
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:25,019
eliminate all those larfy buds that grow

781
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:27,079
towards the bottom part of the plant so

782
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:29,879
you mentioned you do lollipopping

783
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:34,079
defoliation do you do any of that at all

784
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:37,679
if so when yeah I sort of just I do feel

785
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:40,079
defoliation I I think you know mold

786
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,940
outside is your biggest worry so you

787
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,278
want to have that sort of canopy that

788
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,538
has some air blowing you through it you

789
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:47,460
know I think there's a degree of danger

790
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:51,200
if you let it and and man when they go

791
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:54,480
into flower it's like this

792
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,519
so having just rolling back from some of

793
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,038
that it doesn't need all those front

794
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:02,038
plot of leaves you can take some of them

795
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:04,798
out and managing that canopy you know

796
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:07,019
making sure it's just the top ones that

797
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,179
are there that the energy is going to

798
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:11,940
and just thinning it out and I will

799
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:14,940
stand above it and look down and see

800
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,840
right what it's the lights on the on the

801
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,940
bugs

802
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:21,298
is it blocking light on the butt it's

803
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,798
gone gone and and I think you just got

804
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:24,778
to be on it frequently because it's

805
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,359
amazing how much it grows have you ever

806
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:29,220
had a like lose a plant because of like

807
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,278
powdery mildew or have you come across

808
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,440
Bud Rod or anything like that before

809
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,819
yeah I mean I'd be very lucky I think

810
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,419
what's interesting is if you've got

811
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:41,460
healthy plants pests and bugs they don't

812
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:44,038
tend to go for healthy plants if you've

813
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,798
got things that are a bit dodgy bit weak

814
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:49,140
yeah they tend to go for that a lot more

815
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,538
so I think it's it's

816
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,460
you know and you just can be unlucky you

817
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:56,158
can just get plagued by something and

818
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,720
we'll just take the plans but ultimately

819
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,760
you know take off the Dead Leaves

820
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,500
anything with any kind of discoloration

821
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,119
on removing it and that's really

822
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,278
important because you can then see when

823
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,500
you next come back is there more of that

824
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:10,019
plan with that you know that spotting on

825
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,839
the leaves you know is it is a cow make

826
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:14,579
deficiency is it a a magnesium

827
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:17,099
deficiency you know what what's coming

828
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:20,278
through that if you if you don't remove

829
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:22,259
those it's harder to tell so I'd always

830
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:23,819
recommend remove the dodgy looking

831
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:25,919
leaves because that will give you an

832
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:28,200
indication of it's more of a problem or

833
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,020
it's a one-off problem that makes sense

834
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,819
and of course the humidity is going to

835
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:35,940
be a big impact on whether or not that

836
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:38,579
stuff forms what is the natural

837
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,100
temperature and humidity at the location

838
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:43,199
you grow at well I mean we're sort of

839
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:45,439
northern hemisphere Europe so you know

840
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,538
you're at the mercy of the Outdoor World

841
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,298
we're wet we're damp I mean this year

842
00:32:48,538 --> 00:32:54,778
has been amazing I mean I was I had

843
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:57,058
girls out there till end of November you

844
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:59,640
know it's a beginning November I mean

845
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:02,099
you know end of October rather and it's

846
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,480
it's a bit it's been amazing this year I

847
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:06,359
mean we we can't really talk about

848
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,899
climate change in a positive times often

849
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:11,819
but I have to say where I live well it's

850
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:14,339
uh yeah if this is kind of a train to

851
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:16,200
happy Prophet now you mentioned that you

852
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:18,480
haven't really come across many pests

853
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,519
are you doing anything to prevent pests

854
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,200
so like a lot of people do sprays that

855
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:23,819
they do as like a preventative are you

856
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,380
doing anything like that at all to your

857
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:27,678
plants are you just letting them go and

858
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,720
hope for the best

859
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,700
I have historically done neem oil and

860
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,360
done the sort of you know getting into

861
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,380
this spray spray which is fine but I

862
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,259
sort of

863
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:43,019
I said but in their life embracing

864
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:44,460
nature let's just see what happens and

865
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:46,259
sure if you've got past the best thing

866
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,019
you do if you've got past is just take

867
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:51,119
time to squeege them you know get on the

868
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:53,099
plant get the between your fingers and

869
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,018
just go the spider mites well let's

870
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:57,058
spend the next two hours squidging the

871
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:59,099
spider mites on the plants

872
00:33:57,058 --> 00:34:01,319
um but I'm finding that actually within

873
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:03,359
nature that and when you grow organic

874
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:05,939
and really grow wild there's there's an

875
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:09,059
abundance of pests and

876
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,980
things to eat with us so I'll look at my

877
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:13,559
plants and they'll be covered in spiders

878
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,119
and you're like oh well the sponges are

879
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,159
taking care of the things and you know

880
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,000
every pest is also an opportunity for a

881
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,878
predator

882
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,460
so there's that sort of Natural Balance

883
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:25,079
which maybe if you're if you're a gross

884
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,480
based the spider mites get in you're

885
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:28,739
indoors they're all over the plants well

886
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,480
there's nothing to really eat them

887
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:33,118
unless you buy somebody off the internet

888
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,780
to eat them whereas in the wild

889
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,639
you know it's very ratsy plants

890
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,980
overwhelmed by pass

891
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,240
that there's a normal Natural Balance

892
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,039
and actually what's been really

893
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,259
interesting is growing Outdoors you see

894
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:48,719
that there's spiders and stuff he's

895
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,820
eating these there's there's the sort of

896
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,098
balance playing out in front of you yeah

897
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:56,760
you just have to deal with what Mother

898
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:58,200
Nature brings you right yeah I'm and you

899
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,900
know and if it comes big with the

900
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:03,598
Spider-Man then I'm not I'm not adverse

901
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,300
to treating that but I in my experience

902
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,039
I found that healthy plants tend not to

903
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,619
have that much of a problem when maybe

904
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:13,980
I'm lucky maybe that's just how it is or

905
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:15,780
maybe that's a sort of yeah it could be

906
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,760
a thing and maybe next year I'll be like

907
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,800
absolutely out there with the neem oil

908
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,099
and all the other things trying to kill

909
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,760
it all and you know I'm unlucky okay so

910
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:29,039
you plant in May or June typically what

911
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:32,640
months are you harvesting

912
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:34,920
so I mean I I like tend to play find a

913
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:38,279
sort of variation of sort of autoflowers

914
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:41,760
semi-autos and sort of photo period

915
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,700
plants so you sort of want to have you

916
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,680
know as much coming through the seasons

917
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:49,379
different crops and different harvests

918
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:51,118
but I mean this year's been amazing and

919
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,579
I've been able to push it off to sort of

920
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,960
I'll do a niche an initial crop and then

921
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:59,460
I'll leave it two weeks for the second

922
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,380
flush so to let the plant recover so but

923
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,820
really we're talking sort of

924
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,180
mid-september

925
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,619
if it's not an auto but also you know

926
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:09,779
you're just sort of counting the

927
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:12,000
calendars and certainly saying and then

928
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,040
how big are the plants when you harvest

929
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,900
oh wow

930
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:18,239
um like I'm wondering how you're getting

931
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,740
these plants out of the location I gotta

932
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,239
imagine that that could be difficult if

933
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:22,500
you have a huge plant on your back and

934
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,319
you're trying to get it out of the

935
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:29,219
location the best recommendation would

936
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,599
be buy these they are the the the facts

937
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:32,819
that you can buy in the grocery store

938
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,160
that you put your vegetables in they're

939
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,920
reusable and they're just the best these

940
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:39,719
these these these little bags and

941
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,880
they're great for plants because if it's

942
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:44,578
a bit wet then it's breathing it's got

943
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,980
that air coming through so these little

944
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:48,960
sort of cloth sacks with the sort of

945
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,460
yeah I'd recommend those for sort of

946
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,539
managing it and actually when it comes

947
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,358
down to it

948
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:56,699
and you're managing that sort of numbers

949
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:59,279
of plants it gets quite big you you you

950
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:00,539
you're into rock size I mean I think

951
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,820
taking them out

952
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:04,679
camera bags are great because they have

953
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,440
that sort of rigid structure and you can

954
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:09,358
put the little plants in and like take

955
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,519
camera there to break particularly so

956
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:15,259
the plants out to the site and then

957
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:18,000
bringing them back the the the the the

958
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:20,820
webs bags I'd really recommend those

959
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,239
they're fantastic for for taking them

960
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,079
and it's yeah it's like after rucksack

961
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,078
and

962
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,700
you know I will do a initial graph and

963
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,800
then I'll do two weeks later I'll do the

964
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:34,139
second trough and then maybe a third

965
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,820
depending on you know how many little

966
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:37,199
buds there are that you need a few more

967
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,480
weeks

968
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,578
um so it's it's really tailored to the

969
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,500
plant just to be in touch with your

970
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,539
plant but they're sort of at that stage

971
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,338
they're friends they're all friends yeah

972
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:49,800
they've been in the ground for so many

973
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:52,559
months you you're sort of quite intimate

974
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,900
with them you you're watching every bit

975
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:57,059
of them growing or training them you're

976
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:00,838
manipulating them together absolutely

977
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:03,299
best out of them and you know I think

978
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:05,099
um yeah by the time you come to crop you

979
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,660
you know which which ones it which

980
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:09,240
flowers you're taking first which ones

981
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:11,879
you're leaving and yeah I mean it's

982
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:14,279
having that just attention to detail

983
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,140
okay so you just you're doing like a us

984
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,460
I want to say scattered Harvest but

985
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:19,679
that's not really the right way to to

986
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,838
say it but you're harvesting like one

987
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,578
plant at a time kind of so that way you

988
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:25,820
can able to carry it out or you

989
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:28,859
harvesting them all yeah yeah

990
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,359
well now I went to the mall I'm gonna

991
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:32,460
tell you them basically when they're

992
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:34,380
ready to go

993
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,380
um I'll be playing Transportation with

994
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:39,059
the leaf I'll be looking at when those

995
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:42,119
plants are sort of starting to get a bit

996
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:43,858
Amber on the trichomes and just try and

997
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,480
tailor it to the perfect time for the

998
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:46,858
plant that ultimately one of the most

999
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,599
people

1000
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:50,460
um obviously there's limitations that

1001
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,359
sort of how much I can dry in my dry

1002
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:56,338
space at any one time so this is of that

1003
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:57,838
is a factor within the in the thing but

1004
00:38:56,338 --> 00:39:00,719
I think people are going to remember

1005
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,699
that basically when the best of us ever

1006
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:05,519
get given was like when you think it's

1007
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:07,799
time to craft wait three weeks and

1008
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,659
that's so true you know you think it's

1009
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,280
the moment and you're sort of willing it

1010
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:13,440
on because you're like I mean you're

1011
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,140
always actually always gained for the

1012
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,760
wave but you sort of you're there and

1013
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:20,759
you look at it and you'll think oh I

1014
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,099
spent that time and actually it's it's a

1015
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,280
three-week window you can crop a plant

1016
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:29,099
there is no now's got to be the moment

1017
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,200
there isn't the perfect time it's a

1018
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:33,480
window within which you'll guarantee

1019
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,879
that it will be good

1020
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,880
um and I think you can get yeah it's

1021
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,500
that whole snake oil the Bro signs

1022
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,838
there's all these things about sort of

1023
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,820
growing where they it has to be this

1024
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,279
it's gonna be that it's if you don't do

1025
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:49,440
that you'll miss it's you know there's a

1026
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,079
lot of that but there's also just the

1027
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,480
reality it doesn't really matter and

1028
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,019
it'll be all right and you'll still get

1029
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,280
high so happiness

1030
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:02,099
so after you've chopped down your your

1031
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,500
plant and you're bringing it back home

1032
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,180
or wherever you're bringing it drying

1033
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,219
and curing let's get into that a little

1034
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:10,199
bit what do you do for drying like what

1035
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:13,919
are your conditions how is your drying

1036
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:16,858
area set up so on and so forth yeah I

1037
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,740
mean I I I thought a product this year

1038
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:21,838
thinking oh yeah you know the bud dryer

1039
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:24,358
you know online it's got a carbon filter

1040
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:27,960
I mean yeah it doesn't solve the smell

1041
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:29,838
yeah at least yeah it's a secret even

1042
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,720
though it's going to come through still

1043
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:36,480
absolutely honks so I think you know

1044
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:38,219
having us I think and I think you know

1045
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,740
you can be a career to grow and you can

1046
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:43,679
live in a flat and you don't have the

1047
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:46,379
space to grow and Gorilla growing sees

1048
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:50,159
like the the best solution I think my my

1049
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:52,619
warning to you is yes it's amazing you

1050
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:55,019
can grow keto weed in the wild no one

1051
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:58,140
will find you but you know bring that

1052
00:40:55,019 --> 00:41:00,980
back to your flat in some City somewhere

1053
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:04,159
you know have a plan for drawing that

1054
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:08,159
and when medicinal plants are drying

1055
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,899
it's very smelly that the smell is quite

1056
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,179
prominent

1057
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,338
um so be prepared for now have a plan

1058
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:17,759
for those two weeks where it goes from

1059
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:19,440
you know I've got loads of it too oh my

1060
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,180
goodness what the hell am I gonna do

1061
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,740
with the smell I hope no one notices

1062
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,179
because it comes back to that

1063
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:26,819
availability because all this stuff's

1064
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:28,618
illegal You're vulnerable and that can

1065
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,260
be from your partner that can be from

1066
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:33,119
your neighbor that can be from any

1067
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,500
number of sources that makes you

1068
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,140
vulnerable whether they want to

1069
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,900
manipulate you call the police get one

1070
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:42,480
over on you any of that stuff you know

1071
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,460
don't underestimate how vulnerable you

1072
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,500
are you may be the big dude that

1073
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:51,240
whatever it smells strongly

1074
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,338
people recognize that spell

1075
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:55,259
you know there may be problems and

1076
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:57,420
things escalate really quickly you don't

1077
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,700
think they will but you know it can be a

1078
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,220
landowner deciding to detain you and

1079
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:03,358
calling calling the cops it can be your

1080
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,578
landlord

1081
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:08,759
you know coming for a flat mixed Bank

1082
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:11,760
expense you know inspection and just

1083
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,380
blocking what's going on you know all

1084
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,359
these things it can unravel really

1085
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,160
quickly which is why I say if you're

1086
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,259
thinking about doing this and it's

1087
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:21,299
really easy to get down the rabbit hole

1088
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:23,400
and it's amazing it's so much fun and

1089
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:25,320
it's it's so many good positive things

1090
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,019
it's amazing through mental health it's

1091
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:30,359
it's all those good things and I can't

1092
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:33,599
recommend it highly enough but

1093
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:36,598
understand the consequence and just have

1094
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,280
an Exit Plan you know if it goes wrong

1095
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,559
and your neighbor complains about the

1096
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,660
smell have a friend that says you have

1097
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,219
got to go as you can put it in you know

1098
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:46,019
have an excellent strategy because

1099
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:49,139
there's nothing more stressful than

1100
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:51,420
spending nine months producing the most

1101
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:54,358
amazing thing and then just like your

1102
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:56,460
trapped between a partner saying make it

1103
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:59,940
disappear and you you your neighbor

1104
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:02,460
going I can smell medicinal plants and

1105
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:05,519
you know what are your options just have

1106
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,780
an Exit Plan have a plan B A call over

1107
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,300
and so is that enough because there's

1108
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:11,220
nothing worse than having to make that

1109
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,200
disappear in a way that you you don't

1110
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:15,838
get to benefit from it and you know

1111
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,939
doing this stuff it takes a long time it

1112
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,519
takes a lot of effort it really really

1113
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,440
does and it's a commitment so if you're

1114
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:25,019
sort of in with the thing and it's an

1115
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,300
amazing YouTuber just at the back of

1116
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:29,519
your mind have those things mapped out

1117
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,220
don't just go into it all sort of

1118
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,858
sketchy girls fine no it won't be you

1119
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:36,118
you need to work it out because when

1120
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:38,639
they're when they're saying there's a

1121
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:41,220
problem you could have a plan yeah I

1122
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:43,440
know one way to conserve the terpenes

1123
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:45,480
obviously that the smell coming off the

1124
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,700
plant is that terpenes volatizing right

1125
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,019
it's evaporating into the air and that's

1126
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:50,879
what you're smelling

1127
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:53,519
to conserve those terpenes lowering the

1128
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,900
temp in your dry room so I don't think

1129
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:56,699
you mentioned what temperature you

1130
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,900
usually aim for in the dry room or

1131
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:01,078
humidity

1132
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:03,240
I mean I I hide my control over that is

1133
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:05,818
sort of limited just because there it is

1134
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:08,098
but it's probably between 60 to 18

1135
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:11,039
degrees is normally what it is it

1136
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:13,019
probably takes me sort of 10 days to two

1137
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,759
weeks for it to dry to the point where

1138
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:15,900
you can get it and I've I've this is the

1139
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,380
first year I've really gone for the

1140
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:22,318
growth bags and I have to say I mean wow

1141
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:24,660
amazing I mean it just like it's being

1142
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,579
transformative I was in the mason jars

1143
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:28,679
and the birthing and the thing oh my

1144
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:30,599
goodness whatever so when you get to

1145
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:33,059
sort of an outdoor grow where you've

1146
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:36,539
caught it's a sort of considerable

1147
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:39,420
quantity Where it's it's it's not like a

1148
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:42,480
sort of a few ounces you're like you

1149
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:44,940
know you're into the 40 ounces you know

1150
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,920
you're a kilo you quite quickly gets to

1151
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,019
the point where you're like

1152
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,420
you need to manage that and that's a lot

1153
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:54,000
to manage and it can go wrong very

1154
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,400
quickly mold goes really quickly I mean

1155
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,179
I think I would say with outdoor growing

1156
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:03,480
you know mold is your big enemy but just

1157
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:06,480
accept it it will happen if you've just

1158
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:09,000
got to plant more twice what you think

1159
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,818
you want and assume the heart you'll

1160
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,358
lose half the world and you'll be fine

1161
00:45:10,818 --> 00:45:17,099
but it comes and nothing goes in a jar

1162
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:19,440
without being looked at through a very

1163
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:22,019
very tight with it through a loop on

1164
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,720
there like literally every bud and it's

1165
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:27,659
easy to spot the mold so you know but

1166
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:30,000
just except it's gonna happen and this

1167
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:31,440
has been amazing but you know to went to

1168
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,358
the end of the Harvest when you go for

1169
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,760
that second crop and it's sort of laid

1170
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:39,900
out over you know you may lose half bits

1171
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:43,680
of mold but you know just be on it

1172
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:45,838
um and don't just don't ignore it it's

1173
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:47,480
happening it's gonna come there's no

1174
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:51,059
going away from it and

1175
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:53,760
just manage it as best you can that's

1176
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:55,559
good advice there wow yeah so we went

1177
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,359
through your whole process there what

1178
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:59,519
you do when your Gorilla growing

1179
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:01,019
everything from preparing the site for

1180
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,920
planting identifying a place to plant

1181
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:06,179
all the way through planting fertilizer

1182
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,000
watering all the way to harvesting

1183
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:11,338
drying and curing so um definitely an

1184
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,139
interesting process I'm mostly an indoor

1185
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:14,940
grower but I do have outdoor gardening

1186
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:16,799
experience and yeah there are some

1187
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,960
things that relate to indoors but

1188
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,240
there's a lot of differences growing

1189
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,760
outdoors and I appreciate you coming on

1190
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:25,739
and sharing what you do here on this

1191
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,420
podcast I know you want to be discreet

1192
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:30,118
here so there's not going to be any

1193
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,700
social media links down below or

1194
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:34,440
anything like usual

1195
00:46:31,699 --> 00:46:35,838
difference that like showing you around

1196
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,000
my garden and all that stuff but

1197
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:41,759
unfortunately the way the law is now I

1198
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,059
mean you know I think Amazing America

1199
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:48,060
has done it amazing the Germans about to

1200
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:50,039
do it but you know we saw how Rogue

1201
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:52,799
versus Wade went the other place so

1202
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:55,259
don't be too confident it's yeah I hope

1203
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,880
it's not a fleeting flash in the pan and

1204
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,619
I hope it's the start of the thin into

1205
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,240
the wedge that changes everything

1206
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,579
because I think the world be better for

1207
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,139
it so um yeah but it's nice to be

1208
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:06,420
involved in your podcast

1209
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:07,679
and hopefully I Inspire some people you

1210
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,480
know because I think there's a lot of

1211
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,940
people out there that can't do a 4x4

1212
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,199
tent even if it is legal and I think

1213
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,960
there's a lot of people out there who

1214
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:18,059
just have Partners family that just

1215
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,818
would never accept them doing that even

1216
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:23,578
if it is legal and and I think Gorilla

1217
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:26,759
growing offers an opportunity to get out

1218
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:29,280
there to do something and it's sort of

1219
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:32,640
it's exciting it's that rock and roll

1220
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,519
element of sort of yeah it enables you

1221
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:37,980
to have a project go out there and it it

1222
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,599
can be thrilling it can be really just

1223
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,039
exhilarating and I think it's really

1224
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,900
good for your mental health to have that

1225
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:44,940
secret garden to be able to be out there

1226
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,800
and go which I just read my class I'm

1227
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,420
just hanging out I think that's good for

1228
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,300
your soul and I think

1229
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,740
you know consider it and I think uh I

1230
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,019
think the industry's full of sort of

1231
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:56,759
snake oil and all of that stuff but when

1232
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:58,440
it comes down to it you know you can do

1233
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,900
some really you can go and do it you

1234
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,539
don't it's not about money you can go

1235
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,579
and buy the pound store fertilizer you

1236
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:08,400
can buy the pound store or the dollar

1237
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:10,440
store sort of bone meal and you can do

1238
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,599
you don't need to spend lots of money on

1239
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,519
sort of high-end stuff you know

1240
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:16,500
ultimately spend the money on the

1241
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,719
genetics get those seeds right that's

1242
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:22,559
the bit to spend the money on ultimately

1243
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:24,539
we'll go and do both yeah we do if you

1244
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,059
spend a bit more money but ultimately if

1245
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:28,500
you do enough of that it will it will

1246
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:30,480
give you something and it will reward

1247
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,818
you and it will make your soul feel

1248
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,159
richer and you'll your life will be

1249
00:48:32,818 --> 00:48:37,259
better for it and you know don't be too

1250
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:40,679
paranoiding or it's late September

1251

October time will be fine no one knows I

1252
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:44,759
