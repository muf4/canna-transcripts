1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
coming up on Garden talk I'm a big

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,859
believer in making sure your minerals

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,199
are up where they need to be you know we

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,240
focus a lot on NPK but really it's it's

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,298
all the kind of micronutrients and

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,399
minerals that really make the difference

7
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:19,559
you're better off just going out and

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,179
getting some Leaf litter the diversity

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,399
that's in some Leaf litter from the

10
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,719
forest floor is gonna far out compete

11
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,778
anything that you're buying from the

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,579
store the reason why a lot of people are

13
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,660
having to reinoculate or even say in the

14
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,759
package you know you have to do this

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,799
every month or every 90 days is because

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,619
most people are growing in volumes of

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:40,679
soil that are too small to sustain a

18
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:42,839
proper soil food web it's nice to do it

19
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,780
in a way that's not only responsible

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,260
because it's a regenerative practice but

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,679
in a lot of ways it's been proven that

22
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:54,659
it is the best way to produce that type

23
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,439
of medicine

24
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:57,439

information of all plants to the general

52
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,219

welcome to the Garden Talk podcast today

75
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,539
I am joined with James from organic

76
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,640
cultivators how you doing today I'm

77
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:58,579
doing good how are you good thanks for

78
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,199
asking today we're going to get into

79
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,540
large-scale farming so this topic has

80
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,098
actually been requested by quite a few

81
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:07,500
people because we haven't really covered

82
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:09,598
it on this podcast yet most episodes

83
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,519
really revolve around small operations

84
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,399
such as home grows so in this episode

85
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,379
let's focus on your experience in large

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
scale operations but first what I like

87
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:19,439
to do with all the guests is an

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
introduction can you tell us a little

89
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,620
bit about yourself and how you got into

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,239
gardening yeah I've been gardening

91
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:32,099
vegetables for probably 25 years or so I

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,900
was like a science experiment in

93
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:36,259
elementary school I don't remember what

94
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,360
it was but I had tomato seeds in a bag

95
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:40,859
and they germinated and sprouted and my

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,220
teacher was like you should go home and

97
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,920
plant those and it just like sparked a

98
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:48,299
thing where it was like this amazing

99
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,619
cool thing I could put a plant in the

100
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,439
ground and grow it and I put my first

101
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,780
Garden in the worst place possible uh up

102
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,519
against a building that was not facing

103
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,620
the South so

104
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,620
um it was mostly in the shadow the

105
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,879
entire time but over the years I kind of

106
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,980
just gradually uh grew things bigger and

107
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,199
started out as a lot of people do

108
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:13,798
especially you know back when I was a

109
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:16,139
kid you know you bought Miracle Grow and

110
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,879
you use that to fertilize your garden

111
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,379
and thought you were doing amazing

112
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,639
wonderful things because that's what

113
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,939
everybody did

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,418
and then I was 18 and I grew some

115
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:31,620
medicinal plants and a closet I built a

116
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:35,099
homemade nft system and grew plants with

117
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,500
a good old Dyna grow and eventually use

118
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,740
like the leftovers in my outdoor Garden

119
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:45,360
because you know it said I could and say

120
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:47,100
it's nutrients so why not over time uh

121
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,780
just kind of paying attention to what

122
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,540
was going on around me made these

123
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:54,659
logical leaps to moving away from that

124
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,259
stuff and building composts

125
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,540
um

126
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,900
really doing like polycropping I never

127
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,819
really just separated plants so I just

128
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:05,459
kind of started mimicking nature and

129
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,959
throwing like 20 of my Harvest just

130
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:08,159
right back onto the ground like

131
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,859
literally go out there and pick stuff

132
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,479
off the plants and drop it on the ground

133
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,180
and uh I just kind of felt like hey this

134
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,939
is what's happening naturally so this is

135
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,000
what should happen and my garden just

136
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:23,699
got better and better every year and uh

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,220
yeah and then eventually uh in Michigan

138
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,879
uh things ended up in a place to where

139
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:32,039
we could grow medicinal plants without

140
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:35,159
the fear of anyone coming in and getting

141
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:38,339
in trouble and uh kind of started

142
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,400
looking into my intention was to do an

143
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:44,038
nft system again but I figured I wanted

144
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,779
something a little faster and I grow my

145
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,680
garden outside every year so why not

146
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:51,599
grow and some soil indoors and I started

147
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,840
Googling like what's the best soil to

148
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,780
grow this plant and stumbled onto the

149
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,000
concept of the soil food web and Jeff

150
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:01,339
lowenfels and Lane Ingham and all these

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,779
people and

152
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:06,478
I stumbled into a couple other people

153
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:08,579
that kind of sparked the whole no-till

154
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,099
thing and really kind of being more

155
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,139
hands-off and so all these practices I

156
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,259
had been doing for like the last 20

157
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,780
years I had no idea any of the science

158
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:22,919
behind it the nomenclature nothing at

159
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:25,138
all so kind of stumbling into this uh

160
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:27,899
just kind of broadened this whole huge

161
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,639
picture for me and then I ended up in

162
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:32,279
some Facebook groups

163
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,038
and kind of there's a lot of drama in

164
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,258
them so I started my own group which has

165
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,860
kind of grown it's it's like 13 000

166
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:43,379
people in the group and we focus on

167
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,840
regenerative agriculture we put our

168
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,759
first conference on uh this year in

169
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,359
February in Sturbridge Massachusetts we

170
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,979
put our second one on this next February

171
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,400
and uh it's been kind of a crazy Journey

172
00:06:52,978 --> 00:07:00,538
finding natural farming and it led me to

173
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:04,379
my fiance and moving to California and

174
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:07,918
stumbling into large scale uh medicinal

175
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:10,199
plant farming so uh yeah it's it's been

176
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:13,978
quite a change from growing in a few

177
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,960
tents in a basement to Growing 18 000

178
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:19,139
square feet outside

179
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:21,899
pretty wild wow 18 000 square feet that

180
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,160
that is huge roughly how many plants are

181
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:29,219
you growing in that space uh there are

182
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:32,520
nine light depth Hoops uh that take up

183
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,880
roughly uh 9 000 square feet each one of

184
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:40,139
those Hoops gets around 300 plants uh

185
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:44,279
per run uh so you know what's the 2700

186
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:47,699
plants I guess in the light depths and

187
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:50,219
then the full term Garden uh that kind

188
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,280
of varies depending on how early the

189
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,080
plants go in uh this year we got a a

190
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,899
much later start because of weird

191
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,060
weather out here so we have many more

192
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:03,538
plants in the space kind of like

193
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,918
hedgerows and much smaller so you see

194
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:07,459
you know people walking around with

195
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:10,918
plants that are at least as tall as them

196
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:12,899
which is nice any taller than that it's

197
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,579
unmanageable I would not want to be

198
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,899
getting on a ladder and dealing with

199
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:20,339
some of the monsters that people grow

200
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:21,899
which is a nice photo op and Wendy and I

201
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,459
are next year we're going to grow a

202
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:25,679
couple of them just so we can be like

203
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:29,279
you know check these monsters out but

204
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,978
for management of the canopy it's you

205
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:36,958
know it's definitely not economical uh

206
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:39,598
for time at all so uh yeah I think a lot

207
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,519
more smaller plants is probably the way

208
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,700
to go when you're growing at scale for

209
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,679
sure I can imagine the difficulty the

210
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,080
more difficult it gets with the bigger

211
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,879
plants me I'm just a small home grower

212
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,980
so I'm growing uh you know mostly

213
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,620
indoors I do have some outdoor plants

214
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,379
but mostly indoors grow tents you know

215
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,299
and I do keep my plants pretty small and

216
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,820
you know when I grow those bigger plants

217
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:05,159
what I call Big you know five six feet

218
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,100
it's uh certainly more work involved

219
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,259
than it is smaller plants you know two

220
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,320
three feet I gotta imagine the tools and

221
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:15,659
equipment are a lot different right so

222
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,120
when you're outdoors in a large scale

223
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:21,679
operation what tools and equipment you

224
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:25,560
typically use uh well I mean honestly

225
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:27,179
for us it's not that much different uh

226
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:28,619
certainly not that much different from

227
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:30,299
having

228
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,220
um well I mean I guess it depends if

229
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:35,639
you're talking about moving from tents

230
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,320
to a big uh large-scale operation that's

231
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:39,360
probably a lot of it is going to be a

232
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,700
bit different but if you've been doing

233
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,220
any type of home vegetable gardening or

234
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,160
anything like that what we do on our

235
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,740
farm is very similar

236
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,899
we do very minimal tillage basically if

237
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,459
we have to till we will there are

238
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,320
certain situations where that's

239
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:57,799
necessity certainly if you're opening up

240
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,959
a new field or something like that

241
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:04,139
tilling makes sense get some amendments

242
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,379
in there break up the the the grass and

243
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:09,480
so you can actually plant into it

244
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:13,259
but you know this last year when we had

245
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:16,080
to rip some ground like you know rented

246
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:17,879
a tiller we have a tractor that we

247
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,360
bought last year but we don't have the

248
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:24,740
funds to buy uh attachments for it right

249
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,019
now so it was me walking behind a tiller

250
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,820
tilling up some ground

251
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:32,060
you know again we try to do that as

252
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,620
minimally as possible

253
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:38,458
and really try to focus on things like

254
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:41,459
cover crops and doing some silage

255
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:44,159
tarping after knocking down cover crop

256
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:46,319
to kind of break things down but this

257
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,219
year the way things worked out we just

258
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,740
were not able to do that so you know we

259
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,560
made a decision and it it really it kind

260
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:58,740
of worked out it benefited us because we

261
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:02,879
do do a cover crop so heavily and that

262
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:06,480
ground was cover crop through the winter

263
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,278
um it seated so when we tilled

264
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,560
everything in there's a lot of biomass

265
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:13,139
and it all just grew back

266
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,319
um so we basically didn't have to to

267
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,819
reseed because we tilled all that in and

268
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,560
we were able to get some amendments in

269
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,660
there too so

270
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,099
um that that full term Garden right now

271
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:24,620
you walk out there there's personally

272
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,079
and that's like a foot and a half high

273
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:30,120
and that's you know we literally Chopped

274
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,159
all that stuff down and tilled it in so

275
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,320
it comes back pretty well okay so let me

276
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,000
ask you this we'll get into cover crops

277
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,399
first and then we'll kind of get back

278
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,679
into kind of how you prepare the soil

279
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,379
for planting because I assume that

280
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:45,479
you're doing cover crops between grows

281
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:47,820
is that right and what do you typically

282
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,700
do for cover crops

283
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,879
so out here

284
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,640
um we buy like a

285
00:11:53,879 --> 00:12:00,360
fodder scene basically

286
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,278
um it's uh it's what's available locally

287
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,100
um so there's like some fava beans and

288
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:06,179
some veg and stuff like that in there

289
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,980
um

290
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:11,039
you know the cover cropping we do is

291
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,659
really like at the end of cycle and then

292
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,338
there's companion plants that are out

293
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:16,620
there along with the plants if you want

294
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:19,680
to get technical about what you're

295
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,240
calling you know each thing and at the

296
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,278
end of the year we will plant different

297
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,480
things and what we're companion planting

298
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,220
with everything I just described like

299
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,620
the purslane those are companion plants

300
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,420
that were put out there

301
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:33,440
and then our covers depending on the

302
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:36,419
situation we'll use different things

303
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,760
this is my this will be my second winter

304
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:42,179
in California

305
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,980
so my goal is to really try to put out

306
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:46,138
some different cover crops than where

307
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,560
last year which was kind of like

308
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:52,560
a variety depending on what the soil

309
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:55,018
tests reads so we may change up what

310
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,458
we're doing I know we're talking about

311
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,799
planting

312
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,599
um

313
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:03,419
for making our own mulch next year

314
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,579
because we weren't able to get any mulch

315
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:08,219
this year everybody was contracted out

316
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:12,120
so there are some considerations that

317
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:15,899
we're trying to make outside of just

318
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,578
nutritional but how much biomass is

319
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,958
created by whatever we're planting out

320
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:21,479
there because we got a fair amount of

321
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,399
ground we need to cover and we don't

322
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,759
necessarily want to do it with Native

323
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:30,059
grasses that seed really fast and we

324
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:32,700
don't want to deal with that but in

325
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:35,219
between grows we basically just follow

326
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,440
everything we let it go let the plants

327
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,360
ride out the winter come back knock

328
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,940
everything down try to get some tarps on

329
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,320
it let the sun bake everything and come

330
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,560
back and you can literally just stick

331
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,000
your hand in the ground

332
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:50,219
unfortunately we weren't able to do that

333
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,500
this year with the amount of rain that

334
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,480
we had how long does it take after you

335
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,159
you knock down the cover crop and you're

336
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,019
saying you're putting like a tarp over

337
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,659
it how long until you actually we take

338
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,759
that off and then start planting in a

339
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:04,679
few weeks depending on the weather

340
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,200
and how much sun there is it can be a

341
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:10,620
few weeks

342
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:12,660
we got out to our planting started so

343
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,720
late in the season that we had plants

344
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,519
the weather was there so you know we

345
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,459
just honestly got out there a little

346
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:24,179
late this year and weren't able to to

347
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:25,699
make it happen but ideally given the

348
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:29,819
amount of

349
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,980
old light depth tarps that we have on

350
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,820
hand you know it just makes sense to use

351
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:37,019
that certainly over you know using you

352
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,839
know tilling every year or something

353
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:42,240
like that it really does destroy your uh

354
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,180
the micro life in your soil so

355
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,278
so we try to avoid that got it and then

356
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:49,379
after you remove those tarps are you

357
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,820
doing anything to prepare the soil for

358
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,278
planting like some people add in

359
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,560
amendments for example some people will

360
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,720
inoculate with microbes for example are

361
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,939
you doing any sort of preparation prior

362
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,420
to planting so

363
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,519
um this year what we did ideally you'd

364
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,078
want to get a soil test to kind of gauge

365
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,539
where you're at

366
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:12,719
um we weren't we did not do that this

367
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:15,778
year so basically what we did is we

368
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,959
um each bed got some rock dust it got

369
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:21,679
some organic chicken manure uh it got

370
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:25,859
some some lime

371
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:28,799
and some alfalfa meal so we do do

372
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,620
amendments between Cycles I'm a big

373
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:35,219
believer in making sure your minerals

374
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,500
are up where they need to be you know we

375
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,540
focus a lot on NPK but really it's it's

376
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,120
all the kind of micronutrients and

377
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:44,578
minerals that really make the difference

378
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,980
uh so I'm a big believer and get some

379
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:53,120
rock dust out there every time

380
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:55,680
um you you can do uh you know a larger

381
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,899
application of rock dust

382
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,039
um less times depending on how much

383
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,539
you're doing it you could do an

384
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:01,698
application of rockness like once every

385
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:04,639
20 years

386
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:07,379
as far as inoculations

387
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,139
in my home grows I was doing all kinds

388
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:13,078
of stuff I was doing compost teas and

389
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:16,440
playing with IMO and in the beginning

390
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:19,259
was really heavy-handed I think a lot of

391
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,360
us when we get into growing it's like we

392
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:24,480
want to play with everything and it's

393
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,320
such a responsive plant that you know it

394
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,879
it's satisfying you really can see

395
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:33,480
changes when you're when you're playing

396
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:36,838
with things the danger with that is even

397
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,360
if you have a fair understanding of what

398
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,040
you're trying to do is being

399
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,199
heavy-handed and you can throw things

400
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,919
out of bounds so for for me I was doing

401
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:49,198
teas like every week and I know people

402
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,059
do do tease every week for me I was

403
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,519
adding too much to my teas and then

404
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:55,319
throwing things out of balance so

405
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,120
you got to kind of be careful what

406
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,220
you're when you're going and getting

407
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,899
information online who you're getting it

408
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,180
from and kind of parse that with some

409
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:05,279
common sense and understand that the

410
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:05,899
system itself works pretty well on its

411
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,879
own

412
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,600
out on the farm the inoculations that

413
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,220
get done are imos

414
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,980
and Imo hasn't been done for the last

415
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,259
few years so our plan is to do one for

416
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,900
this next season but essentially we're

417
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:24,720
going out and collecting indigenous

418
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,360
microorganisms from different biomes

419
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,240
essentially and then propagating them

420
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:34,079
out on piles of of carbohydrates and

421
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:37,200
carbon and it is a you know it's a

422
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:40,319
selection for bacterial or excuse me for

423
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,819
terrestrial yeast and fungi and there

424
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,839
will be some different bacterias in

425
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:48,720
there but essentially the way it's done

426
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:51,599
um is you know it's just a great

427
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,519
collection of uh microbes that you can

428
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:57,480
bring to your farm for very little money

429
00:17:53,519 --> 00:18:01,019
as opposed to buying an inoculum from

430
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,360
the store which you know

431
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:05,639
they're usually you know it's four or

432
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,500
five species it's very limited so you

433
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,179
don't have diversity there not saying it

434
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,480
can't help you certainly in an indoor

435
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:15,120
growth and if you're in a sterile soil

436
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,419
or dirt essentially you know those

437
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:21,959
inoculums can help you uh definitely but

438
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:24,480
you're better off many times just going

439
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,519
out and getting some Leaf litter the

440
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,440
diversity that's in some Leaf litter

441
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,119
from the forest floor is gonna far out

442
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,880
compete anything that you're buying from

443
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,859
the store keeping in mind and having an

444
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,559
understanding that you're also bringing

445
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:39,538
in other things into an indoor

446
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,700
environment that's not a complete soil

447
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:45,119
food web so you can have things run out

448
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,240
of control a lot of people like seeing

449
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,298
roly-polies and they're they're grow

450
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,880
because they bind up heavy metals and

451
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:56,819
you know they eat detritus the problem

452
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,660
is they they explode out of control so a

453
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:59,399
lot of

454
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,919
um living soil Growers are now having

455
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,340
problems with roly-polies and bringing

456
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:08,340
uh Leaf litter into your grow while it's

457
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:09,959
can be a great idea can also cause you

458
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:12,298
some problems so some of these things

459
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,779
you kind of need to understand that

460
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:17,639
there's a balance here and

461
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:20,460
indoor and outdoor like in my indoor

462
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,400
I've always had a low level thrips issue

463
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,538
about six months in I had thrips under

464
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,940
my grow

465
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,980
they're not that bad apply some

466
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,679
beneficials I did some sprays here and

467
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,599
there but I had a clover cover they love

468
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,100
that stuff and they live everywhere they

469
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,619
live in the plant tissue they're very

470
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:39,899
hard to get rid of

471
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:41,519
so I just kind of dealt with them and

472
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,100
and survived with them

473
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,259
um Outdoors you know on the farm and

474
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:49,859
even in my vegetable grow I just let

475
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:52,220
pests go generally if I saw a pest enter

476
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:54,959
the garden they weren't there very long

477
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,960
had aphids come and attack my milkweed

478
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,940
every year in Michigan and within a week

479
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,279
or two they were gone

480
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:06,298
they never became a problem because I

481
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:08,399
had a diverse population of plants on my

482
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:10,319
property and kept everything pretty

483
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,298
healthy because I wasn't spraying a

484
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,918
bunch of stuff on it all the time you

485
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:15,839
mentioned balance a few different times

486
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,700
and I want to kind of focus in on this

487
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,159
for a little bit specifically the

488
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,100
balance of nutrition in the soil so you

489
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,558
mentioned that you're typically doing a

490
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:27,839
soil test and then you're finding the

491
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:30,119
balances off so you're amending in there

492
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:33,000
I think there's a lot of folks that grow

493
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:35,579
organic or no-till regenerative and they

494
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,160
hear that the plant uptakes nutrients as

495
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:40,319
needed and it's a common misconception

496
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,240
that things can't get out of balance

497
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,639
because of that can you talk to us about

498
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,099
like how important it is to stay in

499
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,799
balance and what damage can actually be

500
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:53,038
done if you're out of balance yeah and I

501
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:55,759
I will say all of this with the caveat

502
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:59,279
that I'm not a soil scientist

503
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:01,640
I've caught myself as someone who's very

504
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,798
good at collect acting people who are

505
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,080
wildly more intelligent than I am and

506
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:10,918
know a lot more about this stuff than I

507
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:13,678
do they help me run my group so I defer

508
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:16,280
to them on a lot of this stuff I will

509
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:20,000
say that in my experience

510
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:23,038
depending on the size of your

511
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,619
vesicle that you're growing in

512
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,779
much like a fish tank it has more

513
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:30,239
buffering capacity so there's more room

514
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:32,158
for error you can throw a lot of things

515
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,259
at it for much longer without throwing

516
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,919
it out of balance

517
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,259
um

518
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:40,340
I think again for me I think if you

519
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:42,839
start off with a base if you have a an

520
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:44,220
understanding of

521
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:46,199
um how the different nutrients work

522
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,880
together and I don't have a great

523
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,480
understanding of that

524
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,640
um soil science is extremely complicated

525
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,038
I'm reading books all the time when I

526
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,679
have the time but

527
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:01,440
um there's a lot of nuance in this and

528
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,940
the science is just barely being

529
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,058
scratched at

530
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,159
I will say that you know there are some

531
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:11,940
important things we understand about

532
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,340
mineral balance and how cations work and

533
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:18,058
if you have certain things super out of

534
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:21,959
balance then nutrients won't uptake and

535
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:25,019
there's part of the problem is we look

536
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,298
at this as a chemistry thing so it's

537
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:31,019
like you know nutrients in a certain pH

538
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:31,740
are available and that is very true

539
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:35,158
um

540
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:39,419
but you know the biology is so important

541
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:42,960
in all of this so I think really if you

542
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:46,740
create a environment that's hospitable

543
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,319
to a a diverse biology and you don't

544
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,620
mess with them too much they can balance

545
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:54,538
a lot of things

546
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:57,779
but again you know if you're I think of

547
00:22:54,538 --> 00:23:00,179
a lot of problems come with people think

548
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:02,460
they're or growing organically and

549
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,640
they're using bottled nutrients there's

550
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:08,400
a lot of soluble

551
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,460
nutrients in those bottles and that can

552
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,559
throw things off of balance a lot faster

553
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,558
than if you're overdoing it on some dry

554
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,500
amendments it's it's a little bit harder

555
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:22,678
to overdo it that way

556
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:24,960
but people do it all the time so you

557
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:28,380
know for me I started out with like a

558
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,679
clats Coots mix with basically with

559
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,840
negating the neem meal because I could

560
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,980
it and get it locally and people are

561
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,418
kind of weird about it so I just didn't

562
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:41,839
use it and I've just kind of

563
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:44,580
grew the soil from there

564
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,798
I think if you really want to look into

565
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:50,759
like soil science and the numbers and

566
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:53,879
balancing things behind soil testing you

567
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:56,700
should look into Dan kitchen just talks

568
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,320
on YouTube he's actually one of the

569
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,720
speakers at the conference he's able to

570
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:04,200
break things down in a way that kids

571
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,900
understand it so you know explaining how

572
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,900
what PH actually is and how it functions

573
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:12,840
and and what it means looking at it as a

574
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,100
fuel tank as opposed to just a number

575
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:18,319
that makes a nutrient available

576
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:21,480
so yeah I think looking

577
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,619
the ideas that he presents are largely

578
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,779
from

579
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:27,899
um on the soil science aspect the

580
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:32,579
testing uh John or not John Kemp

581
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,798
Albrecht and so there are some specific

582
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:37,500
numbers

583
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:39,619
on the mineral side of things that have

584
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,599
kind of been

585
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:44,459
collectively decided upon by albrecht's

586
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:46,558
students they've kind of all come

587
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,720
together and decided what these optimal

588
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:51,240
numbers are

589
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:54,000
and there there are some slides on his

590
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,579
Talks on YouTube that he kind of like

591
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,179
lays it all out so if you're someone who

592
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:03,899
has a hard time deep diving into the

593
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:06,059
books that can be kind of long-winded

594
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,860
and complicated there are some some

595
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:11,879
cheats out there that you can go and

596
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:15,359
find these people and and get into that

597
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:18,539
aspect of it outside of that I think

598
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:21,479
keep it simple is probably the best

599
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:24,960
advice and the best path forward if

600
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,778
you're doing a worm casting tee once a

601
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,579
month you're probably killing it you

602
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:32,400
know like that is a really easy

603
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:36,960
maintenance thing to do uh for your

604
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,400
indoor as a maintenance tee for biology

605
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,720
I'm not really familiar with those

606
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,278
sources I'll have to check them out

607
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,019
there's so much good information out

608
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,480
there you mentioned that the when it

609
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:47,579
comes to soil science it's so complex it

610
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,440
really is and we're just scratching the

611
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:52,139
surface like you said like there's a lot

612
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,298
of things we do not know about this and

613
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,820
uh it's exciting to be the things that

614
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:58,139
we're unraveling as we continue to go on

615
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:00,178
so so yeah I'll definitely check out

616
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,360
those sources Let's uh let's flip it up

617
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:04,679
let's talk about mulch layers so uh from

618
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,959
my understanding you do use multiple

619
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,298
layers large scale it can certainly be

620
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,340
different than smaller scales so talk to

621
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:13,918
us about mulch layers yeah I mean in my

622
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:15,899
indoor I grew all kinds of stuff in my

623
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,620
bed and would just smash it down and use

624
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:22,919
it as mulch you know Swiss chard like

625
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:26,219
just stuff for biomass essentially

626
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,659
um in the on the farm we try to use uh

627
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,079
alfalfa

628
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:33,840
straw as much as we can but like I said

629
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:35,960
this year we weren't able to get any of

630
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,759
it it's all been contracted

631
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:41,220
you know anything that you can get on

632
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:45,419
your soil to cover it up so it's not

633
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,819
bare is probably a good thing outside of

634
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:49,919
a bunch of you know grass seeds that you

635
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:51,298
don't want to deal with later on down

636
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,380
the line

637
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:55,139
um

638
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,960
yeah you know nature really you know

639
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,759
doesn't like bare soil the microbes have

640
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,259
a real hard time existing in an

641
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,740
environment that's just being baked by

642
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:06,599
UV rays and dried out and generally if

643
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,819
soil is not covered up it dries out

644
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:11,099
really fast

645
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:14,399
we try to add a mulch that has some

646
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:17,158
nutritional aspect to it as hence the

647
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,038
Alfalfa but if you don't have that even

648
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,900
like a third or fourth cutting hay you

649
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:24,558
know get it on there and cover it up

650
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:27,500
you're going to be doing much better

651
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:30,960
certainly you know if you can't

652
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:34,500
you know use cover crops in the winter

653
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,600
or you know for whatever reason a layer

654
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,179
of you know eight to ten inches of mulch

655
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:43,319
you'd be surprised at how much that does

656
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:46,080
to improve soil aeration and soil health

657
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:48,119
over a winter like you come back and

658
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,960
there's a good amount of topsoil there

659
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:54,359
that's nice and loose and arable so

660
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,400
definitely beneficial eight to ten

661
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:59,339
inches huh it seems kind of thick is

662
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,620
that typical for outdoors oh that's what

663
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:04,740
we put on that's what we put on our beds

664
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:08,158
uh for our plants on the farm a nice

665
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:11,099
thick layer of mulch and you know before

666
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:14,159
Harvest it's gone it's it's generally

667
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:15,418
mostly gone interesting yeah I usually

668
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,580
just do it indoors I mean completely

669
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:20,159
different right but uh you know two

670
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:22,439
inches roughly is what I do but maybe I

671
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,640
need to thicken it up a little bit it'd

672
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,659
probably be beneficial especially if I'm

673
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,880
using something that's going to break

674
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:28,320
down and be nutrients for the plant so

675
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,840
well that's what I was going to ask you

676
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:33,240
how how long before you have to

677
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:36,359
replenish your mulch uh you know

678
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,400
typically lasts most of the grow you

679
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:40,678
know I'm in a very dry climate I live in

680
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,259
the desert and so the water retention in

681
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,840
the soil keeping that top layer moist is

682
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:47,879
difficult for me so adding in that mulch

683
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,158
layer is is very beneficial but it can

684
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,440
last but pretty much the entire grow how

685
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,260
big is your are you growing in a pot hot

686
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,620
or a bed I've been doing seven gallon

687
00:28:55,259 --> 00:29:00,658
pots okay so

688
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:04,199
um do you have a microscope I do not

689
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:06,900
okay so I will tell you that the single

690
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,100
best investment in a tool that I ever

691
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,980
made

692
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:12,119
um for growing was a microscope

693
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,880
um

694
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:17,759
we like to think that we're growing in

695
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:22,140
living soil uh in small pots because

696
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:26,099
we're doing all of these practices that

697
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:28,020
really are beneficial to building and

698
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:30,439
maintaining a living soil unfortunately

699
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:32,759
when you're in that small of a volume

700
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,960
it's it doesn't have that buffering

701
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:35,940
capacity that we're talking about it

702
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,399
doesn't have the ability to sustain

703
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,860
moisture

704
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:43,079
the way that you would like to it's not

705
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:46,199
enough volume for life to sustain itself

706
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:49,740
in a cycle Without You consistent

707
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,140
continually having to add more life to

708
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,419
it so when you see that when you buy

709
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,220
something from the store

710
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:59,100
um like an inoculum

711
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,440
there's two facets to this one is that

712
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:04,199
it's a lab-grown microbe so

713
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,740
they're kind of weaker but they should

714
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,440
propagate and live in an environment

715
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,538
um and and keep breeding and living and

716
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,140
reproducing as long as they have food

717
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:18,419
and the conditions are right so the

718
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,038
reason why a lot of people are having to

719
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:21,360
reinoculate or even stay in the package

720
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:24,119
you know you have to do this every month

721
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,339
or every 90 days is because most people

722
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:29,278
are growing in volumes of soil that are

723
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:32,220
too small to sustain a proper soil food

724
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:34,980
web there has I don't I'll have to ask

725
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,538
uh Wendy what the guy's name was but

726
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,538
there has been

727
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:42,778
um some limited research done that shows

728
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:45,679
at about 60 to 65 gallons of soil is the

729
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:47,819
minimum you want to have a self-cycling

730
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,140
self-sustaining living soil that you're

731
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:55,019
not constantly having to add things to

732
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:57,360
my suspicion is that your mulch is

733
00:30:55,019 --> 00:31:01,379
lasting so long because you don't have

734
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:04,158
the amount of microbiology that would be

735
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:08,039
efficient to actually break it down

736
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:11,760
and that in turn you probably you would

737
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:14,278
see an increase in your cannabinoid and

738
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,140
terpene levels if you got into a larger

739
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:19,380
volume of soil because you would have

740
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:22,559
that diversity and microbiology and that

741
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,260
would create a more complex cannabinoid

742
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,579
and terpene profile

743
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:29,398
the reason why our mulch doesn't last

744
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:32,339
very long out on the farm is because the

745
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:34,739
microbiology out there kills it you can

746
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:37,439
literally lift up clumps of dirt that

747
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:40,259
have fungi running through them and we

748
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,240
have like I said we haven't inoculated I

749
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:44,038
don't think Wendy's put I am author this

750
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,960
will be the fourth season so it's been

751
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:50,460
four years since she's made an IMO

752
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:53,579
application it's a testament to you know

753
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,980
the microbes being Hardy and the

754
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:58,139
environment being such that

755
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:01,440
you know once there's water out there

756
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:03,179
they just go off you know so and that's

757
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,820
the other thing too is

758
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:08,220
you know people have this and again not

759
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:09,898
a soil scientist but people have this

760
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,480
misnomer about

761
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:15,199
um microbiology like dying off when

762
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,200
things get dry

763
00:32:15,538 --> 00:32:23,038
yeah I mean sure but they you know

764
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:25,379
mostly they go dormant and it can take a

765
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:29,339
long time for them to come back so you

766
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:33,600
know Outdoors where they the biology

767
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:35,220
goes deep the soil can get pretty dry in

768
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,139
areas out there and then once we have

769
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,720
water out there the plants just they

770
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,580
kill it and you can see the activity you

771
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,679
can see the fungi coming back Plumping

772
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:45,119
up it never disappeared it was always

773
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,278
there just kind of dried out and went

774
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,319
dormant

775
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:51,659
indoors when your pot dries out and

776
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:53,939
everything goes dormant it takes a long

777
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:55,679
time for it to wake up because it's all

778
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,259
gone dormant and then again you're

779
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,880
having to reinoculate so there are all

780
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:04,079
these things that when you're in a small

781
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:06,419
pot fighting all these forces they stack

782
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:09,058
up and it makes it harder for you to

783
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:11,278
maintain so I like I said I I think if

784
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:14,519
you get into a bigger volume you and

785
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:16,259
focus on getting more diversity in there

786
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,200
you'll probably notice your going away

787
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:22,019
faster and if you get a microscope and

788
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,778
you Scope your seven gallon pot compared

789
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:27,120
to like a good living soil I think

790
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:28,859
you're going to be surprised at how

791
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:32,099
little is actually happening in there

792
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:34,740
because I thought I was killing it

793
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:37,199
in my bed and then I got a microscope

794
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,980
and I was like wow there's almost

795
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,538
nothing happening here and I could see

796
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:45,058
the effects of it starting to happen in

797
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:46,519
the plant but I still thought I was

798
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:50,278
doing such a great job

799
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:52,038
so once and the other aspect of that is

800
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,599
I don't know if you do teas at all

801
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:57,298
compost teas but I was doing compost

802
00:33:54,599 --> 00:34:00,359
teas a lot and just going off of recipes

803
00:33:57,298 --> 00:34:02,398
and times you know you put this in the

804
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:04,139
tea and your boy you know you run it for

805
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:04,678
36 hours

806
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,840
um

807
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:10,679
until you have a microscope and you're

808
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:12,679
actually looking at the T itself you

809
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,760
have no idea what you've grown in there

810
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:16,679
and you're not going to know all the

811
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,080
names of everything because that's

812
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,000
impossible no one does but you can

813
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,279
definitely look in there and see you

814
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,159
know do I have bacteria in there is it

815
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,280
full of just a bunch of E coli uh you

816
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,960
know do I have some higher order

817
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,820
organisms have I brewed it to a point

818
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,760
where it's nothing but those higher

819
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,859
order protozoa and they've consumed all

820
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,020
the bacteria and all the oxygen

821
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:42,659
depending on the type of tea that you're

822
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:44,280
going for that might be a great thing if

823
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:47,460
your soil is completely dead you know

824
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,320
some produce oil Not a Bad Thing an

825
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,059
anaerobic tea

826
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,440
it's not the worst thing it's not the

827
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:54,119
greatest thing there are anaerobes that

828
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,800
live in your soil so like there are all

829
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:57,599
these taboo things you don't want to put

830
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,619
a super anaerobic stinky tea on your

831
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,539
soil don't get me wrong but there are

832
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,220
some some words like anaerobes or people

833
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:06,179
like yeah it can't be anaerobic it can't

834
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:08,279
whatever

835
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:10,219
you know there are facultative anaerobes

836
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,480
there are things like

837
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:14,759
lactobacilli which you know are

838
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,559
definitely facultative anaerobes and

839
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,660
they're good they're in your gut they're

840
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,838
they're all over the place we use them

841
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:24,059
to to clean with so gotta yeah time and

842
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:25,799
time again organic farmers have

843
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:28,739
mentioned that uh should be using a

844
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,240
larger container and uh yeah some people

845
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:31,919
are trying to you know they're they're

846
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,078
they're trying to run Organics in three

847
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,000
gallons five gallons because it's easier

848
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,859
to move that around but I mean you bring

849
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,420
up some fantastic points and I've heard

850
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:40,920
it before I'm slowly working towards

851
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,780
larger containers it's only a matter of

852
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,940
time before I'm in a bed running

853
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,200
Organics and uh potentially you know

854
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,820
getting to the point where I don't have

855
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:50,098
to till at all but I'm a little bit of

856
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:53,280
ways there I would say I'll tell you

857
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:55,920
when you make the switch to your bed the

858
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,540
biggest learning curve I would tell

859
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,539
everyone this when they're switching to

860
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:02,400
beds is watering that'll be your biggest

861
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:04,500
learning curve is how to water that bed

862
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,480
properly without over watering it or

863
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,579
underdoing it and so my

864
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,079
my biggest piece of advice to you is

865
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:12,780
when you build your bed and you're

866
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,000
putting soil in it water your soil in

867
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,280
layers as you're building it so you make

868
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,440
sure your bed is watered sufficiently

869
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,240
from top to bottom the first time you

870
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,820
put your soil in there because if you

871
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,618
fill that with dry soil and then you

872
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,599
start to water that you will have

873
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:32,338
hydrophobic pockets in that that you are

874
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:34,680
battling forever so I I can't stress

875
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:35,820
enough uh you know water that as you're

876
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:38,399
putting it in

877
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:42,240
that's a really good tip for sure so

878
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,559
tucking on a large scale fertilizer you

879
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:45,419
know you have the plants growing you

880
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:48,119
already mentioned what you do for cover

881
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,980
crops mulch layer how you prepare the

882
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,599
soil to begin you've planted those

883
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,539
plants in there and they start to grow

884
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:58,079
at what point do you fertilize and what

885
00:36:54,539 --> 00:37:01,139
do you use for a fertilizer so it really

886
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,599
depends on you know and and the outdoor

887
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:04,759
really kind of keeping an eye on the

888
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,800
plants

889
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,599
when we're able to be out there on a

890
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,300
regular basis and for this next year

891
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,980
we're trying to set it up so we have

892
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,920
somebody out there on a more regular

893
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,199
basis we have five kids we don't live on

894
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,000
our farm our farm is about 45 minutes

895
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:24,539
away from the homestead so just to get

896
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,420
out there it's a trip but

897
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:30,960
in an Ideal World we would be doing a

898
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:33,079
weekly maintenance spray which is a

899
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,740
Korean natural farming

900
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:40,280
concoction of some k f inputs uh it's a

901
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:43,739
fermented plant juice an oriental

902
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:47,640
Oriental herbal nutrient which is a

903
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:51,799
tincture with vodka and a brown rice

904
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:54,179
vinegar or a live vinegar and and that's

905
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,820
sprayed as like a weekly maintenance

906
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:59,279
which is basically a super minor plant

907
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:02,400
food which has all different types of

908
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:07,079
micro and macronutrients in it some of

909
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,358
the fpjs that we've seen the

910
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,800
uh nutrient test results on have been

911
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:14,279
really interesting there's there's a

912
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,500
wide variation of nutrients in there but

913
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,300
they're all at very you know it's all

914
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,358
one to one thousand one to five hundred

915
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,640
so it's not very much uh the nice thing

916
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,619
about all of the k f inputs is they're

917
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:27,358
they're edible you can take them a lot

918
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,440
of people take them for human health but

919
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,480
you certainly don't have to worry about

920
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,119
them hurting you uh because you can eat

921
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,858
them uh so it'd be like a weekly spray

922
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,680
of that and then there are some other

923
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:39,179
inputs if you needed some calcium and

924
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,879
some phosphorus you could add some

925
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:43,858
calfas which is essentially some some

926
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,539
charred bones that are then soaked in

927
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:49,980
vinegar

928
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:51,838
um really you know ideally you have all

929
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,099
of the nutrients and everything you need

930
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,559
in the ground

931
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:57,300
uh at the beginning of the year you've

932
00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:00,000
kind of you've set your you know you've

933
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,039
filled your fuel tank up essentially

934
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,780
um and then we have all of these tools

935
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,300
that we can use to kind of top it off

936
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,760
when we need to

937
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:12,839
um but you know last year we weren't

938
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,480
able to do anything uh as far as k f

939
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:17,759
maintenance sprays really um at the end

940
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,420
of the year we didn't do anything to our

941
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,480
full term it was you know water only and

942
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:27,720
again that is a testament to the

943
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,820
microbiology that that is out there a

944
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,919
lot of people would say the terroir and

945
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:34,740
I I think there probably is something to

946
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,420
that as well as far as the end product

947
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,139
goes

948
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,880
um

949
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:40,559
but yeah so we'd be doing like

950
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,599
maintenance sprays and then you know

951
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,880
topping it off with the occasional

952
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:48,000
addition to those sprays sometimes we

953
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,619
will fertigate with those same uh

954
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,440
concoctions

955
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:54,480
those same inputs all at the same rate

956
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,159
you're just using more of it because

957
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,920
you're soaking it into the ground as

958
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:01,259
opposed to foliar feeding once we get

959
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,659
towards the end of the cycle we don't

960
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:06,480
really like spraying stuff on the plants

961
00:40:03,659 --> 00:40:08,699
so we move away from that and then

962
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,539
certainly if you're doing something like

963
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:15,239
a liquid IMO which is the IMO in kind of

964
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:18,139
a compost tea form you definitely don't

965
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:20,699
want to be spraying that on flowers

966
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:22,400
because you can fail microbial testing

967
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:26,159
and stuff like that

968
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,858
but yeah essentially we're pretty hands

969
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,358
off and and mostly you know setting

970
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:31,619
ourselves up at the beginning of the

971
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:33,059
year really taking care of the

972
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:36,119
microbiology

973
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:38,338
making sure we have you know a diverse

974
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,079
set of plants out there we always have

975
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:41,880
flowers and different kind of wild

976
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,300
plants and

977
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,820
you know given that it's it's me and my

978
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:52,140
fiance and her you know 70 year old mom

979
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:55,260
uh you know we we're pretty limited on

980
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:59,159
how much we can be out there but the

981
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:03,240
fact that uh you know the end products

982
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:08,098
consistently won awards and uh you know

983
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:10,618
people definitely really enjoy it I uh

984
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:13,079
you know it works out pretty well so I'm

985
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:15,900
I'm a firm believer of the you know

986
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,180
keeping it simple kind of trying to stay

987
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,880
hands off and a lot of that comes down

988
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:22,679
to you know working in concert with

989
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,358
nature understanding that not everything

990
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:25,618
is going to go your way you're not going

991
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:27,539
to be able to control everything and

992
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:30,660
that's probably a good thing

993
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:34,559
I think the best thing about

994
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:35,578
uh the plant that we're talking about is

995
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,159
that

996
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:40,560
um it's a Gateway plant it everybody

997
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:43,440
wants to grow everything after they

998
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,900
start growing it I hardly know anyone

999
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,440
that started growing it that hasn't

1000
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:51,780
moved to other things it was the reverse

1001
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,019
for me I I liked growing plants period

1002
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:57,060
so it's just a really fun plant to grow

1003
00:41:55,019 --> 00:42:00,358
and it brings a lot of joy to people and

1004
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:04,019
and healing so it's nice to do it in a

1005
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:06,739
way that's not only responsible because

1006
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:09,539
it's it's a regenerative practice

1007
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:13,139
but you know I think it

1008
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:16,500
in a lot of ways it's been proven that

1009
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:17,940
it is the best way to produce that type

1010
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,880
of medicine

1011
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,679
so you're almost entirely doing natural

1012
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,480
farming techniques besides that rock

1013
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:26,879
phosphate for example that you mentioned

1014
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,260
for the initial amending or the initial

1015
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,000
amendments that you put in prior to

1016
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,820
planting you're doing natural farming

1017
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,500
techniques now let me ask you prior to

1018
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,500
implementing these natural farming

1019
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:39,539
techniques was your farm using chemicals

1020
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,440
at all or did you always just start with

1021
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:44,358
the natural farming Yeah Wendy on their

1022
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,159
Farm

1023
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:50,119
uh I'm trying to think I think you know

1024
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:52,799
back in the day like a long time ago

1025
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:54,300
when her parents were growing and she

1026
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,400
was growing up and that kind of stuff

1027
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,200
they were definitely

1028
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,599
um

1029
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,818
using some chemical nutrients here and

1030
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:05,700
there but I think everybody was back in

1031
00:43:02,818 --> 00:43:08,579
the day I will say that when everything

1032
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:11,219
went legal here and everyone was

1033
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:12,660
freaking out Wendy was confused why and

1034
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:14,219
then everyone started feeling testing

1035
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:18,420
and she was like oh because everyone

1036
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:19,078
uses like crazy chemicals and they don't

1037
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,599
um

1038
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:24,839
I think at you know early on they made

1039
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,400
the switch from anything that was a

1040
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:27,659
synthetic nutrient to organic because

1041
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,880
that's how they were growing their food

1042
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:31,039
so it didn't make sense to keep doing it

1043
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,160
like that

1044
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:38,460
I know you know as far as K F that farm

1045
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:40,199
has been running you know knf inputs for

1046
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,838
six years now

1047
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:44,939
uh where it's you know they're it's just

1048
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:46,739
you know us making inputs and then

1049
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,780
applying them

1050
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:51,118
um you know as I said before when I

1051
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:54,300
started out growing I was definitely

1052
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,720
using Miracle Grow and

1053
00:43:54,300 --> 00:44:01,318
um hydroponic whatever uh that was out

1054
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:02,879
there and it you know it was a few shops

1055
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:05,159
in Michigan that had that stuff because

1056
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,960
it wasn't like every corner store like

1057
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:08,818
it is now there was like one spot you

1058
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,519
had to drive an hour and a half to and

1059
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:15,960
get your nutrients for your tomatoes

1060
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:17,579
that you're growing and uh you know do

1061
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,199
it like that

1062
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:22,680
um you know I don't

1063
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:24,358
fault anyone who's using that stuff I

1064
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:27,480
mean the thing is

1065
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:29,338
a lot of people just don't have a deeper

1066
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,260
understanding of soil science because a

1067
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:33,599
lot of it's so new and it is just

1068
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,339
permeating the culture and

1069
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,140
um you know there are all these new hot

1070
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:39,599
button things that you know regenerative

1071
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:41,519
and organic and

1072
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,619
um you know unfortunately all these

1073
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:46,380
labels kind of get co-opted and people

1074
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:48,180
you know twist things around and then

1075
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,640
there ends up hat being negative

1076
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:52,980
connotations to them that's part of the

1077
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,779
reason why I'm trying to talk to so many

1078
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,760
people in different camps you know the

1079
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:59,220
permaculture people don't necessarily

1080
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,839
hang out with the biodynamic people they

1081
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:03,358
don't necessarily hang out with just the

1082
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:04,799
organic dudes who are buying bottles of

1083
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:06,539
whatever

1084
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,940
um you know there's a lot of people that

1085
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:11,460
really believe in in that you know

1086
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,260
bottle of magic or whatever that they're

1087
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,440
buying from the store like it's the best

1088
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:19,560
stuff unfortunately at Large Scale you

1089
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:22,559
it's you know it's far too expensive you

1090
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:24,539
can't grow at Large Scale by buying

1091
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,940
bottles of nutrients and I'll tell you

1092
00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:29,460
right now that you know some of the

1093
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,559
farmers that are

1094
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,440
um you know hyping these expensive

1095
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:36,179
nutrient lines out there uh you know

1096
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,920
they're they're not hyping them because

1097
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:39,059
they're buying them and they work so

1098
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,559
great they're hyping them because

1099
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:42,299
they're paid money and they were given

1100
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,119
to them they would never buy those

1101
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,579
because they can't afford them at large

1102
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,818
scale it's the same reason why nutrient

1103
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:53,160
companies go all around the world and

1104
00:45:50,818 --> 00:45:54,420
get Farmers hooked on fertilizer and

1105
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:56,818
teach them how to grow with their

1106
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,099
fertilizer and then basically make them

1107
00:45:56,818 --> 00:46:00,599
indentured slaves for the rest of their

1108
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:03,300
life because it's the only way they know

1109
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,460
how to grow and they have to buy these

1110
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,440
nutrients from the companies that have

1111
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:10,139
come in that's part of the reason why

1112
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,440
we're trying to set up our non-profit is

1113
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:16,199
to show people that they can make

1114
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:19,260
nutrients from the things around them in

1115
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:24,059
nature and and you know kind of get off

1116
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:27,180
that teep and I'll tell you that people

1117
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:29,480
who are fighting really hard in the

1118
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:33,960
regenerative space and natural farming

1119
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:37,619
you know those are people that

1120
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,300
um you know their their Rebels out you

1121
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:42,180
know they're they're the people on the

1122
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:46,079
front line who when this really starts

1123
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:47,399
to threaten uh fertilizer companies

1124
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,318
um know they're the ones who are going

1125
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,720
to take the brunt of the hit

1126
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:55,440
so it's really important that we all

1127
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:58,259
connect and not in fight and come

1128
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,318
together because you know we have much

1129
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,480
more power uh coming together as one big

1130
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:05,159
loud voice as we do a bunch of small

1131
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,960
camps that are in fighting with each

1132
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:09,059
other and we're all banging the same

1133
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,039
drum but we're banging it at a different

1134
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:12,358
beat and we all got to get on the same

1135
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,159
beat

1136
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:16,619
um so that's kind of what my goal has

1137
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:19,559
been is to get everybody talking about

1138
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:21,300
the same thing and you know right now is

1139
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:23,880
a great time because

1140
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,680
with everything going on fertilizer

1141
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,920
costs are super high or you can't even

1142
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:32,399
get it so a lot of farmers are making

1143
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:34,800
the switch to organic practices but

1144
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,460
they're gonna fail they're going to fail

1145
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,500
a lot because their land is screwed up

1146
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:42,059
and it takes time to repair that it

1147
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,619
doesn't take a lot of time it can

1148
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:47,519
actually take a very short amount of

1149
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:49,318
time if you do it properly but there are

1150
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:51,179
there are a lot of people that are going

1151
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:53,039
to make mistakes and they need help and

1152
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:54,838
they shouldn't be ostracized because

1153
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,579
they've been growing with chemical

1154
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,980
nutrients this whole time that's what

1155
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:01,560
they were taught

1156
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:05,159
you know you can't fault them for that I

1157
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:07,920
think it's foolish to try to fight with

1158
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:09,118
the big AG companies because you're

1159
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,358
never going to win and they're not going

1160
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:16,440
anywhere I think our main goal needs to

1161
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:19,799
be to show them how this is the best way

1162
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:22,318
for one thing farmers can save a lot of

1163
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,119
money by switching the natural farming

1164
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,460
you're certainly going to save money on

1165
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:30,599
inputs your labor is going to go up a

1166
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:33,179
bit but in the end once the consumer is

1167
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:37,260
fully educated on what nutrient density

1168
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:39,179
is and why it is important how you grow

1169
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,040
your crops in medicine is going to

1170
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:43,739
become instrumental and it will drive

1171
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,838
the price of Commodities as opposed to

1172
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:47,639
there just being a flat price right now

1173
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,179
basically unless you're in a farmer's

1174
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:52,799
market a tomato is the cost of a tomato

1175
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:55,259
you know but they're

1176
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,960
there can be

1177
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:01,440
um incentive there for Farmers to grow

1178
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:05,280
the best produce possible as opposed to

1179
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,079
the most produce and it is a shift

1180
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,300
that's happening

1181
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:10,800
um and it's interesting to see got it

1182
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,440
yeah I was just curious about that one

1183
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,900
going from chemical nutrients to Natural

1184
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,358
farming with the time savings would be

1185
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,980
versus the the cost savings the

1186
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:22,858
difference in product and all that stuff

1187
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:26,400
I'll tell you that you know if you're

1188
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:29,759
you know buying anything in a bottle you

1189
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,019
are mostly paying for water

1190
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:35,040
um and you're paying for it to be

1191
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:39,480
shipped to you uh so you know the cost

1192
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:41,880
for sunabis to switch from its regular

1193
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:45,480
you know buying

1194
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:48,240
um fertilizer uh and amending and all of

1195
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,818
its other practices she was spending two

1196
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:52,858
dollars an acre going from two dollars

1197
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:55,500
an acre to 20 cents an acre so you're

1198
00:49:52,858 --> 00:49:57,059
talking about ten percent of the input

1199
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:00,300
cost

1200
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:03,000
um than than what it was so again like

1201
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,318
your input cost will go down but you are

1202
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,079
going to go up in labor a little bit

1203
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,400
because it takes time to make this stuff

1204
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,780
but you know if you get a group of

1205
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,818
people together at the beginning of the

1206
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:14,579
year you can smash out your inputs for

1207
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:16,500
the whole year in a couple of days

1208
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:18,000
so you're making all your inputs in a

1209
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,338
couple of days and then there's the

1210
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,019
added labor of applying like maintenance

1211
00:50:20,338 --> 00:50:24,599
brace to your plants or whatever but

1212
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:26,420
depending on your setup if you're a

1213
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:28,920
large-scale farm and you have a tractor

1214
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,659
certainly you have a sprayer for the

1215
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,099
back of that tractor so you hook your

1216
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:33,358
sprayer up and you put your maintenance

1217
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:35,940
spray in there and you drive up and down

1218
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:37,679
the rows and it sprays the spray on your

1219
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:40,440
plants and you're done

1220
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:42,539
so I I know that you know there are

1221
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,119
people who you know do a whole Orchard

1222
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:46,980
in an hour or less

1223
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,838
uh they just drive up and down the rows

1224
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,338
and they spray and their Orchards do

1225
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:52,019
that all the time anyway they're

1226
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:56,519
spraying all kinds of chemicals on those

1227
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:58,019
trees so you just switch over to the k f

1228
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:00,900
input or whatever other thing you're

1229
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:02,818
using that's a natural farming input and

1230
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,680
you're not really increasing your labor

1231
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:08,639
costs there because you're already

1232
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:10,618
spraying other chemicals so really in

1233
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,659
those situations it's a huge cost

1234
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:15,358
savings because you have dropped your

1235
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:17,279
inputs down so much I will say that you

1236
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,659
know there are

1237
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,059
there's lots of different natural

1238
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:22,920
farming stuff out there and you know

1239
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:25,260
there's knf and there's jadam and

1240
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,480
there's other practices not all of them

1241
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:30,359
are interchangeable and they have

1242
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:33,599
different applications there's not a

1243
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:35,818
whole lot in the way of pest control in

1244
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,400
Korean natural farming but there is in

1245
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:39,900
jadam so yeah significant cost savings

1246
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,900
which is what I assumed and what I've

1247
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:45,720
heard so that's really good to know okay

1248
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:47,400
few more questions for you one of them I

1249
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:48,899
like to ask towards the end of every

1250
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,579
episode which is really advice for

1251
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,519
beginners you know there are people

1252
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:54,960
listening in here that are transitioning

1253
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:56,699
to a large scale operational maybe they

1254
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,858
just started working in a large scale

1255
00:51:56,699 --> 00:52:01,679
operation what tips do you have for

1256
00:51:58,858 --> 00:52:04,259
those that are making that transition oh

1257
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:08,519
a laundry list

1258
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:11,819
um I I would say that if you're moving

1259
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:13,619
into the industry as a whole not even

1260
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:15,259
just as a grower

1261
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:17,818
um

1262
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,859
it's probably going to dishearten you a

1263
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:22,558
little bit there aren't much ethics

1264
00:52:19,858 --> 00:52:26,039
involved yet because there isn't a whole

1265
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:31,380
lot of in the way of legal recourse

1266
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:34,558
um so uh just a word of caution there as

1267
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:37,200
far as people uh moving into growing or

1268
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,099
learning about how to grow

1269
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:41,098
um

1270
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:43,318
I I would say be very careful where

1271
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:44,519
you're getting information from there

1272
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:47,420
are a lot of people out there who

1273
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:50,400
pretend to be experts in everything

1274
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:52,980
uh and I will tell you that the Kruger

1275
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,920
dining syndrome is a real thing

1276
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,719
um you know people often before they

1277
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,858
people think they know more than they

1278
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:01,078
know

1279
00:52:58,858 --> 00:53:02,400
um anyone who's claiming to be a master

1280
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:05,940
grower

1281
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,660
you should probably be wary of them

1282
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,780
um

1283
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:12,000
you use common sense

1284
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:14,339
uh whenever someone is trying to tell

1285
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,980
you something try to think about does

1286
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:18,119
this apply in the natural world

1287
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,740
um they're like there's a lot of

1288
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,800
tinkering that goes on and that's fine

1289
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:23,519
but really keep it simple

1290
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,740
um

1291
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:26,940
there are some great learning resources

1292
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:28,379
out there

1293
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,300
uh

1294
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:32,579
some of them even though they're great

1295
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:34,740
learning resources have the tendency to

1296
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:37,680
push some what we would consider bro

1297
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:40,799
science uh and it's it may only be Bro

1298
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:42,539
Science because it hasn't been uh proven

1299
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,700
out in a way that can be peer-reviewed

1300
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:46,500
so you need to be careful when you're

1301
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:48,598
listening to people who do have

1302
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,420
authority and a lot of followers and

1303
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:54,260
understand that unless you can find this

1304
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:56,338
information in white papers online

1305
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:58,980
scholarly articles that have been

1306
00:53:56,338 --> 00:54:02,039
published then this is just conjecture

1307
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,960
on someone's part I'm a big fan of

1308
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:07,139
people saying I don't know

1309
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,300
uh so anyone who can be upfront and

1310
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:12,058
honest about their limitations and their

1311
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:14,099
knowledge that's huge uh you want to

1312
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:14,940
listen to those people

1313
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:17,280
um

1314
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:20,039
that's probably the best advice I can

1315
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,740
give is and be careful of who you are

1316
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:26,099
getting advice from reach out to people

1317
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:30,358
who are trusted and have been around for

1318
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:32,940
a long time and ask their advice uh you

1319
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:34,858
know feel it out a bit before you just

1320
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,659
go down a rabbit hole of adding a bunch

1321
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:38,659
of stuff to your grow and then you've

1322
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:41,098
killed all of your plants

1323
00:54:38,659 --> 00:54:44,279
that would be my second piece of advice

1324
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:46,859
is trial everything out do side by sides

1325
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,960
don't assume that because you applied

1326
00:54:46,858 --> 00:54:51,420
something to your grow and you killed it

1327
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,880
that that thing was the determining

1328
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,980
Factor did you apply five other things

1329
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,200
that you hadn't done before did you do a

1330
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:00,240
side by side with a control group if you

1331
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:02,219
did not do that you have no idea that

1332
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:04,679
what you have done has been beneficial

1333
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:07,439
or negative to you in any way

1334
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:09,358
so if you're moving into this space and

1335
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,519
you want to learn the best way possible

1336
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,318
and you are going to Tinker make sure

1337
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:14,579
you're doing side by sides make sure

1338
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:18,420
you're keeping a track of what you're

1339
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:20,579
doing because in our group if you say

1340
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,200
something you need to be able to back it

1341
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:24,300
up and it doesn't have to be something

1342
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:27,239
that is out there for the whole world

1343
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:29,400
the published study but have some data

1344
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:32,098
we like to debate things we like to talk

1345
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,318
about what people have done but if you

1346
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:35,640
don't do that work and you just have a

1347
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:37,980
claim

1348
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:39,118
you don't really know you have no idea

1349
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,280
what you did

1350
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,619
did anything for you at all

1351
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,839
solid advice obviously do your due

1352
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:48,838
diligence try to find those research

1353
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:51,659
