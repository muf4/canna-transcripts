1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,599
coming up on garden talk because it's

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,120
much better for a plant to have slightly

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,279
less nutrients and work your way up

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,400
then to basically force your plant to a

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,399
nutrient lockout

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,599
through that osmotic process and then

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,080
have to reel it back

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,039
in there's these ec fans coming out

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,839
right now

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,118
which basically can operate with digital

11
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,879
controls

12
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,160
which can make them work a lot better

13
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,559
with controllers

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,160
and they operate on way less wattage

15
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,079
especially in the summer i'm always

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,760
adding co2 and people are like oh what

17
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,199
kind of crazy co2

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,719
operation you got going in there and i'm

19
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,320
like dude it's a four by four ten just

20
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,160
get an exhale bag or two

21
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,759
hang it up you'll be fine so if there

22
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,878
are any home growers out there who are

23
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,399
like you know what

24
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,919
i love doing this i want to do this for

25
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,320
a living i want to make a career out of

26
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,239
it

27
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,759
start reading manuals on a lot of the

28
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,599
technology watch a whole bunch of videos

29
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:54,320
and read some manuals on how they work

30
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,320
and you're you're basically halfway

31
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,600

especially shooting style but yeah we

170
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,038
have

171
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,479
those two channels um that probably will

172
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:17,839
be in the description below

173
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,120
but yeah don't look at that ones from

174
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,399
eight years ago definitely look at the

175
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,720
ones

176
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,279
in the last year that's probably better

177
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,800
those ones are antiquated you know

178
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,719
uh yeah but your it looks like your

179
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,800
channel is mostly about like equipment

180
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,160
different equipment that you have uh you

181
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,680
know i assume you sell this all at

182
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,439
grower's house

183
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,478
and um i know you talked you know you

184
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,079
said you wanted to talk about light

185
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,560
testing which we'll get to

186
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,359
towards the end of this episode yeah

187
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,918
sounds great

188
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,479
so let's talk about the garden so you

189
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,959
have

190
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,800
a garden right i don't know if you grow

191
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,638
do you grow indoors or outdoors and what

192
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,800
type of plants do you grow

193
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,160
yeah so right now people do ask me that

194
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,319
question a lot they're like so what

195
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,800
what are you doing you're growing like a

196
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,800
humongous outdoor plot or a greenhouse

197
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,000
or like a 50 000 square foot indoor and

198
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,840
i'm like well

199
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,519
you know not really i kind of have a

200
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,519
little set up at home

201
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,198
both kind of what i would consider a

202
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,120
really small greenhouse almost like a

203
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,919
hoop house

204
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,959
that's where maine like mainly like the

205
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,719
the veggies grow

206
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,680
that we play around me and my girlfriend

207
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,400
and then we do have the indoor grow tent

208
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,918
where i do a little like r d research

209
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,198
and development on like new products

210
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,839
coming out you know

211
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,199
we do resell other products but we do we

212
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,038
have a lot of our own product lines

213
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,400
you know we have our own grow tents you

214
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,439
know our own carbon filters

215
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,719
fans i've had our own line of leds so

216
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,319
when those products come in i like to

217
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,800
test them out and see if they they work

218
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,120
well

219
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,919
if they do awesome if they don't we make

220
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,759
some tweaks

221
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,439
um of course sometimes we find you know

222
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,000
a new partner to partner with

223
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,639
but that 4x4 for medicinal plants that's

224
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,279
inside

225
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,079
is um you know it's relatively basic

226
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,758
growth

227
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,359
and uh lately you know i tell people man

228
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,800
my day job is like it takes a lot of

229
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,080
time like i'm usually working six or

230
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,079
seven days a week

231
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,758
on the business the equipment side so

232
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,519
we're helping other people grow

233
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,520
and when you do that you realize you

234
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,399
barely have any time for yourself

235
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,879
to grow sometimes so what we try and do

236
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,478
is

237
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,519
you know uh maybe we'll start with the

238
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:14,240
veggie garden and then we can move to

239
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,159
the medicinal

240
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,598
garden but on the veggie garden it's

241
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,360
like you know four foot by eight foot

242
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,360
kind of hoop house thing

243
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,560
growing like some days you just wake up

244
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
on a saturday and you're like you know

245
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,199
what

246
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,119
i'm gonna go get some plants you hit up

247
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,319
the nursery in the morning grab a coffee

248
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
on your way out

249
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,840
like that is like those mornings that i

250
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,680
dream about

251
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,038
um then you just go pick some things so

252
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,079
most recently we got

253
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,519
some broccoli some cauliflower

254
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,359
you know my girlfriend was all about

255
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,478
getting the nerve garden kind of the

256
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,598
traditional thing so

257
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,839
like oregano rosemary thyme

258
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,839
things of that sort parsley and then we

259
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,198
tried some funkier things you know we

260
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,560
tried some yams

261
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,120
out there too and we did try some melons

262
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,399
which

263
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,598
it's funny i think we got these seeds

264
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,719
and we thought there are melons and they

265
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,159
turned out

266
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,560
to not be melons so you know that's

267
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,120
always

268
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,439
a fun surprise too but in arizona it's

269
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,240
tough like you basically grow

270
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,120
october through maybe may then in the

271
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,598
summer you just

272
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,879
shut shut the outdoor one down it gets

273
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,959
way too hot

274
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,080
uh on tucson it'll be 100 you can get up

275
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,439
to 110

276
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,680
and then that greenhouse would be like

277
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,439
150 probably you know it's

278
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,439
just everything would bake but when you

279
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,879
go into the medicinal garden

280
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,279
you know like i said working six or

281
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,400
seven days a week i really want to set

282
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,079
it up to just be

283
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:36,799
fully automated in a way so i like

284
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,399
what i like to say is you know i want

285
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,038
someone out there to write a book

286
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,440
please viewers write this book i would

287
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,439
read it if someone had it but

288
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,360
you know how to grow medicinal plants

289
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,360
for the busy person

290
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,959
and i will give you the outline of how

291
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,399
to do it so

292
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:58,159
let's see uh get a 4x4 ten

293
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,000
step one step two um i got an auto pot

294
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,278
foresight system so some of you guys

295
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,720
have probably heard about that

296
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,399
the good thing about it is you don't

297
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,240
have to plug it into anything it's

298
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,278
totally gravity fed

299
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,680
waters the plants as they need water

300
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,720
um so with four plants and a four by

301
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,439
four

302
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,240
um you know on the medicinal side you

303
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,959
could yield

304
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,039
you know with a good light probably end

305
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:25,278
up yielding um you know about a

306
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:28,000
pound and you know what i would say is

307
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,519
i could fill up that reservoir and about

308
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,759
two weeks later i can come back

309
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,879
and i would not have opened the tent for

310
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,240
two weeks

311
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,000
i just filled the reservoir with

312
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,919
nutrients which is about 12

313
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,080
gallons ish so it depends on how big

314
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,958
your plants are how fast they're feeding

315
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,240
um but then you just have a few timers

316
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,439
you know for your lights to go on and

317
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,480
off at the right times for your

318
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,800
ventilation to go

319
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,639
on and off at the right times and it's a

320
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,958
super set it and forget it system

321
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,799
uh i loved it and like in those buckets

322
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,359
you can choose what media you go with

323
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,399
and

324
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,320
what i'd probably recommend most is

325
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,639
filling the these these autopilot

326
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,519
buckets into about four gallons each

327
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,559
and they gravity kind of feed and then

328
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,120
they will

329
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,278
wick up through the media and i'd fill

330
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,078
it probably the first

331
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,200
inch or two with hydroton so clay

332
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:16,799
pebbles

333
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,879
and then on top of that you can kind of

334
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,919
add whatever media you want

335
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,320
um so i go with cocoa

336
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,679
straight cocoa and you know you can use

337
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,120
a lot of different cocoas ones i would

338
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,399
recommend is like

339
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,839
you know kanakoco is great even mother

340
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,078
earth cocoa is great you can go mother

341
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,920
earth straight cocoa with perlite

342
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,599
um you know some people even go into

343
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,799
soilless mixes like a pro mix that would

344
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,639
also work really well

345
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,919
but the cool thing is you can even put

346
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,199
like a

347
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,879
um like a nutrient dense soil

348
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,240
above those clay pebbles and it works

349
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,838
really well in that system and then you

350
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,120
can like rely a little bit less on

351
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,320
nutrients if you want

352
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,078
because you know with the cocoa you

353
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,160
definitely want to make sure the plants

354
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,239
have that full nutrition

355
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,439
in that reservoir but you could do like

356
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,399
an ocean forest

357
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,680
inside of that or a vermifire which are

358
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,039
two soils that

359
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,879
come packed with enough nutrients that

360
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,319
like three or four weeks in you know you

361
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,159
can be totally fine

362
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,519
and then add some light nutrients

363
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,159
thereafter

364
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,919
so pretty good system i like it quite a

365
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,600
bit that's kind of my r d system because

366
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,838
usually i'm testing out like

367
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,519
lighting is very common and then

368
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,480
different forms of environmental control

369
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,759
but i leave the

370
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,039
hydroponic system relatively the same

371
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,639
let's talk a little bit more about auto

372
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,199
watering so i have the auto pot system

373
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,439
too

374
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,399
i think i had like the six pot or

375
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,040
whatever

376
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,480
and uh i think i used like four and then

377
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,000
two of the plants ended up being male so

378
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,920
i went down to two

379
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,519
yeah but it's so easy to use like you

380
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,639
said is gravity fed

381
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,639
i was actually i did

382
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,838
perlite on the bottom two inches then i

383
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,639
used foxar motion for

384
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,760
soil like you had suggested or you

385
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,480
talked about

386
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,000
and then um i was actually top dressing

387
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,920
with organic nutrients and then my

388
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,639
reservoir was only plain water

389
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,919
so made things pretty simple now this

390
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,000
last run i did have

391
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,759
a little bit of issues because that top

392
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,720
layer does kind of dry out a little bit

393
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,120
and when you're using

394
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,959
organic nutrients in your top dressing

395
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,639
that top layer should be moist

396
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,159
so i need to figure out a way around

397
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,240
that whether it be a thicker mulch layer

398
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,319
on top of it or what but

399
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,680
yeah i mean using that auto watering

400
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
system was definitely made things a lot

401
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,039
easier

402
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,159
so you're putting nutrients within that

403
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,599
reservoir

404
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,399
right what brand of nutrients you're

405
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,399
using and are you using any sort of like

406
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,759
like pump or air stones or anything to

407
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,440
like mix it up

408
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,000
so the nutrients stay in solution they

409
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,920
don't just settle at the bottom or what

410
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,120
yeah yeah so let me actually right

411
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,719
before we jump into that i'm going to

412
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
give you a couple suggestions on your

413
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,079
side

414
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,720
so when you order auto pots you get this

415
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,319
um

416
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,639
what you've probably seen it's almost

417
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,399
like a mesh piece of fabric

418
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,079
that you put on the bottom that keeps

419
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,399
particulates from getting into

420
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,359
and clogging some of the so that some of

421
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,720
the drains

422
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,720
the copper disc yeah yeah exactly and

423
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,240
you know you can actually use things

424
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,160
like um

425
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,600
think of it this way water can permeate

426
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,679
basically any type of fabric

427
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,360
right you can make another layer of that

428
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,000
and what i would do is put the perlite

429
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,120
if you want to you can add another um

430
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,240
layer of like uh

431
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,560
even think of it like this way like a

432
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,720
cheesecloth right and then you

433
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,838
put maybe an inch or two of your ocean

434
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,160
forest on

435
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,959
dress some of the nutrients in your top

436
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:26,480
dressing

437
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,479
which you'd actually do a bottom

438
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,560
dressing add a layer of soil

439
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,800
dress a little bit more and that way as

440
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,078
it wicks up it'll pull the nutrients up

441
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,319
with it so it's not

442
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,278
missing them because it's not wicking at

443
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,600
the top

444
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,799
so that's one thing you could do in the

445
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,560
future that

446
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,679
might be helpful for that organic style

447
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,119
because that's that's really cool too if

448
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,159
people want to go organic but also have

449
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
a hydro system

450
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,000
that's a good way to do it like you were

451
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,959
just talking about um

452
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,919
yeah so yeah i tried to uh i tried to do

453
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,078
it that way and

454
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,439
so sort of create a super soil to where

455
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,759
it would be

456
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,639
more dense in nutrients so i added more

457
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,720
nutrients on top

458
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,560
of the fox farm and then more nutrients

459
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,278
in to try to get it to

460
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,239
last the entire grow now those auto pot

461
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,679
systems i'm not sure if they're

462
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,560
different pot sizes but they're about

463
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:12,319
four liters

464
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,239
i believe is the pasta just under four

465
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,959
liter pot size

466
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,278
and it just the i guess maybe i grew veg

467
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,359
the plants for too long or what but

468
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,399
within flower i started seeing those

469
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,839
deficiencies and

470
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,879
that's why i know i didn't have that

471
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,760
super soil i didn't have enough

472
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,439
nutrients in there

473
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,319
so maybe i didn't need to go heavier on

474
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,000
the nutrients in the future i think that

475
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,160
that would be a good idea for sure yeah

476
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,440
yeah potentially um you know that could

477
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,078
be a way to do it but i do think they're

478
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,320
four

479
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,359
four gallons not four liters is a

480
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,440
heads-up

481
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,360
oh yeah okay yeah sorry four gallons yes

482
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,000
they're and they do have like an xl one

483
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,199
which i forgot

484
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,759
i think it's like six gallons or

485
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,439
something but it's a little bit bigger

486
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,039
um but i haven't i haven't used those i

487
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,600
just kind of go with the standard

488
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,639
auto pots um but they're modular so it's

489
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,759
like look

490
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,879
you have one plant that's just

491
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,720
absolutely crushing it then you have

492
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,919
another male just take out the other pot

493
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,959
super easy you know but going into oh

494
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,838
yeah so like i guess

495
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,399
in the latest r d run that i was doing

496
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,480
um

497
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,839
nutrient-wise i was running this new

498
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,240
nutrient line

499
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,680
that were actually participating in

500
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,839
bringing to market which is called

501
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,039
ventana plant science

502
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,639
and um you know it's been about two

503
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,278
years in development

504
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,759
and you know most nutrients i will say

505
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,399
they're

506
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,039
um they're based on a lot of the same

507
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,799
kind of

508
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,078
macro and micronutrients that plants

509
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,120
need so macros

510
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,159
you know being your npk and then micros

511
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,560
being a lot of those

512
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,919
kind of smaller elements um that people

513
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,439
don't hear about as much

514
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,039
you know you're boron your zinc things

515
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,519
like that um

516
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,159
but the interesting thing about this one

517
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,560
is there's a

518
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,198
kind of like this proprietary amino acid

519
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,198
polymer

520
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,278
that we've been playing around with that

521
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,679
this formulation chemist built

522
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,720
which has been pretty awesome because it

523
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,198
was like supposed to be

524
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,920
like it should and could be patented but

525
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,000
as soon as you

526
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,198
patent kind of like a formula for a

527
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,919
nutrient

528
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,519
basically or anything like that you um

529
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,078
you release more information

530
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,320
about how it's made and like that is

531
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,319
something so that's why we call

532
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,680
basically a proprietary instead of

533
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,160
patented so you want to keep some of the

534
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,758
secret sauce you know like uh

535
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,958
kind of so that we can keep the secret

536
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,759
sauce to secret sauce but the cool thing

537
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,479
is we're gonna be

538
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,919
um you know selling it under the ventana

539
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,159
plant science name

540
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,159
and the the interesting thing is this

541
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,240
polymer this amino acid polymer it's

542
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,679
actually made from the shells

543
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,839
of mollusks so like sea creatures

544
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,359
yeah the shells of moles have this very

545
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,480
interesting amino acid and then they

546
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,800
polymerized it

547
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,519
meaning that they made it in a way

548
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,240
that's just

549
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,159
hyper absorbable for plants and it also

550
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,519
breaks down other nutrients to be

551
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,439
more more absorbable by the plant so

552
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,639
um george the formulation chemist this

553
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,880
guy's been

554
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,399
we met him and uh he's the one who

555
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,879
developed this and we were like man this

556
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,000
is the

557
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,958
smartest person on plant nutrients we've

558
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,160
ever met

559
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:06,399
um and that's you know me and um

560
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,839
one of our other people on our staff

561
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,319
renee who's uh

562
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,000
been you know she was the director of uh

563
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:12,720
sales director for botanical for like a

564
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,400
decade

565
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,000
and so she knows her nutrients really

566
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,439
well um and

567
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,279
you know i love talking with her about

568
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,839
nutrients and she's she's written

569
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,359
like a lot of the labels you know for

570
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,958
the old school labels that people have

571
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,519
seen for botanical

572
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,400
but um man george is one of those guys

573
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,160
that like

574
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,519
you just want to like crack open a beer

575
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,000
and sit and just let him talk for like

576
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,639
an hour

577
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,279
you know and he's just such a nice guy

578
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,320
but

579
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,399
you know he developed it they've been

580
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:40,000
trying on a commercial garden um there

581
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
were well a few of them for the last two

582
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,519
years

583
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,759
and we're having some pretty good

584
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,639
results so i was trying it here and

585
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,079
the plants grew amazingly and yeah

586
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,200
that's the last r d kind of thing that

587
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:50,960
we were doing but it's

588
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,400
kind of like a pretty standard nutrient

589
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
line when it comes to the amount of

590
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,640
bottles

591
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,039
you know it's not advanced nutrients

592
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,480
with 18 i think it's like a six bottle

593
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:03,200
uh kind of formula and then um

594
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,240
yeah the proprietary amino acids in a

595
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,360
product called flava

596
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,919
it's like flavuh yep

597
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,439
so the best way i can compare it almost

598
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,520
is like

599
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,038
if you had like um what are people

600
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,319
familiar with almost like a

601
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:20,640
turbinator meets blood candy in a way

602
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,480
so that's that's some effects you can

603
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,640
see something like that

604
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,599
those six bottles are those aren't all

605
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,919
base nutrients or

606
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,639
is it base nutrients plus their

607
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,200
additives

608
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,880
exactly yep based nutrients plus the

609
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,558
additives so

610
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,320
um there's well there's a kind of more

611
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,079
of like a home gardener line and there's

612
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:41,279
a commercial line but

613
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,639
um you know i was uh they're basically

614
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,519
the same thing it's just the commercial

615
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,840
lines more

616
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,720
in like a it's like a soluble powder

617
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,639
because that's how

618
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,640
most commercial gardens use their

619
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,960
nutrients a lot easier to transport

620
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,400
store um can be a little bit cheaper

621
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,759
when you're buying in bulk like a pallet

622
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,519
of nutrients

623
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:02,558
but it's basically a grow in a bloom

624
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:03,759
and then um there's a cow mag and

625
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,160
there's a silica

626
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,599
and then there's the flavor and then

627
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,240
there's a pk

628
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,359
and that's basically the whole lime yeah

629
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,400
all powdered

630
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:17,359
so no the the at home one is all liquids

631
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,080
okay and then the commercial line is um

632
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,678
all powder

633
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:24,159
except for the the flava product because

634
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,798
that one has to be in a solution for it

635
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,120
to

636
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,000
that proprietary amino acid polymer to

637
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,159
like work

638
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,160
properly so that's the only liquid yeah

639
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,320
okay and then you said these are going

640
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,080
to be released soon i assume that

641
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,240
the way folks can find out when they're

642
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,678
released is probably to sign up to your

643
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,279
email list is that right the growers

644
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,880
house email list i assume that you guys

645
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:45,279
will make some sort of announcement or

646
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,039
something

647
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,798
yes let those folks know that it's

648
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,400
available

649
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,440
yeah maybe we should like help her you

650
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,679
know hire you for our marketing

651
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,480
department or something

652
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,120
a lot of times we're like um it's it's

653
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,880
funny we operate this way but

654
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,879
when it comes down to it like we're

655
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,480
growers and we're not like

656
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,400
like i like to say we're a company of

657
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,599
growers but that that comes with its

658
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,720
pluses and minuses

659
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,240
what that means is we're not

660
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,240
experienced at launching product lines

661
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,679
so we just like like to r d the products

662
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,679
as much as possible make sure that we're

663
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,919
making something that like

664
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,360
we love it's doing like as good as it

665
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,880
possibly can and we stand behind and

666
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,918
we'd recommend to our friends

667
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,840
and then we have to figure out how to

668
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,120
get the message out there so that's

669
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,240
that's the part we're probably not as

670
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,279
good at

671
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,200
we're probably good at growing the

672
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,480
plants uh the marketing side yeah we

673
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,319
could probably use some help

674
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,319
so any marketers out there want to work

675
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,519
with us um that'd be great but yeah fill

676
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,038
out the email list

677
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,798
that's funny yeah i'm not good at

678
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,000
marketing either so many people comment

679
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,359
on my videos like you should be

680
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,839
promoting your book more

681
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,119
and blah blah blah and i'm just like i

682
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,000
never like think about that stuff like

683
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,678
i'm thinking about

684
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,599
the garden and like showing off the

685
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,440
plants and talking about the plants

686
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,798
yeah but that's what happens yeah i

687
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,200
could use a marketer too so anybody

688
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:00,480
in marketing uh hit me up yeah we can we

689
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,960
can we can share them you can work for

690
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,960
both of us it'd be a fun time

691
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,400
that would be awesome that'd be awesome

692
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,600
but getting back into

693
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,798
the grow let's talk about water source

694
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,199
so are you using ro water tap water rain

695
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:15,279
water

696
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,319
what are you doing for water yeah oral

697
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,200
water for sure

698
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:21,439
um like i told you the way i grow uh

699
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,679
when i'm doing r d i will say like

700
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,120
i do love you know fully organics like

701
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,038
sometimes you feel like

702
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,399
like my garden outside with all the

703
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,519
veggies totally

704
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,880
organic right 100 and sometimes you're

705
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,158
like yeah i really want the garden to

706
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,640
just be

707
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,840
all full of these meals and you know

708
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,520
manures and

709
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,798
basically everything that you feel like

710
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,319
is just coming out of the earth and

711
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,519
putting it back into it you know we have

712
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,119
a compost bin

713
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,079
so i compost and uh when it comes to the

714
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,439
r d

715
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,240
side though on the medicinal plants in

716
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,519
the grow tent um i like to have it

717
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,400
a lot more dialed in in a way where

718
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,119
i'm i'm the scientist controlling all

719
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,038
the levers

720
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:04,239
right so when i was talking about the

721
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:07,759
clay pebbles and just straight coco core

722
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,480
um totally inert right add the nutrients

723
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,480
in

724
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,159
and that's the way that you know

725
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,480
basically i like to operate

726
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,400
and i want my water for those nutrients

727
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,839
to be basically as close to zero parts

728
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,559
per million as possible

729
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,918
so um through an ro system if as long as

730
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:23,440
it's working properly you're going to be

731
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,919
between like zero and 30 parts per

732
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,640
million

733
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,000
um if you're like north of you know you

734
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,038
can see your membranes starting to go

735
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,798
out when you're like

736
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,079
kind of north of 50 but it's not too bad

737
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,400
even up to 100 it's like

738
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,000
like your water's still great once you

739
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,440
get over 100 it's probably

740
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,279
make sure you're checking your filters

741
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,960
and everything like that i actually had

742
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,240
a filter go out on me and i didn't

743
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,798
realize it

744
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,839
and uh i was growing with it and my

745
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,440
plans started to look like

746
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:52,639
hot trash and uh then i checked the ppm

747
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,840
on my rl and it was like higher

748
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,038
than tap and i was like okay well

749
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,319
there we go i think i had to change out

750
00:22:57,038 --> 00:22:59,200
the membrane or something like that so

751
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,119
that's a huge

752
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,640
tip right there is make sure you're

753
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:05,038
checking the ppms

754
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,320
on your ro water because you could a

755
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,319
filter could just go and the memory

756
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,439
could go and it could just be injecting

757
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,879
tap water in there

758
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,080
yeah and you know i mean i don't um

759
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,000
depending on how you do it like

760
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,798
sometimes i put like a almost like those

761
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,960
like

762
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,558
20 or 30 dollar rubber mates you can put

763
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,038
like in a garage or something where you

764
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:22,960
can have

765
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,558
row filtering into it with a float valve

766
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,360
so it automatically shuts off when it

767
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:27,119
fills

768
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,240
and then if you have like 30 or 40

769
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,678
gallons of water i mean i guess

770
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,279
depending on how large your grow is

771
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,960
but if you're just doing a home grow

772
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,279
that'll last you a while so if you just

773
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,798
test that out once every few weeks you

774
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,720
know you should be good

775
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,879
but i noticed people who like fill up

776
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,839
their reservoir consistently with an ro

777
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,000
system

778
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,359
you are you know i guess you'd be more

779
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,159
prone to having issues because you'd

780
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,719
have to be testing

781
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,000
basically every time ro is putting water

782
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,079
in your reservoir or in your

783
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,359
plants which could be every day for some

784
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,519
people depending on how their system's

785
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,278
set up

786
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,798
that makes sense yeah now for the

787
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:59,440
nutrients you know you mentioned you're

788
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,519
in coco

789
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,798
inert medium you're adding the nutrients

790
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,480
correct me if i'm wrong but this isn't a

791
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,839
synthetic line that you're

792
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,880
that you've got and that's so salt-based

793
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,918
and that um are you following a feeding

794
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,640
chart

795
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,919
and this feeding chart that you guys

796
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,400
have

797
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,759
is it for medicinal plants is it going

798
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,519
to be a full dose is

799
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,038
accurate for medicinal plants or should

800
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:24,720
it be like every other nutrient almost

801
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,319
every other nutrient line where

802
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,278
it's typically recommended to start with

803
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,519
a half dose and see how your plants are

804
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,880
yeah and you know it's um so there is a

805
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,400
feed chart both in

806
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,960
meters per gallon and ppm for it so

807
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,080
um both those are available on you know

808
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,240
the url for the site's actually

809
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:45,119
ventanaplant.science

810
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,798
so it's not ventanaplantscience.com but

811
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,278
if you go there you will see

812
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,720
the two different bean charts but uh you

813
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:51,679
know the funny thing is with with

814
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,960
nutrient lines

815
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,960
um yeah almost all of them kind of

816
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,480
overstate yeah basically the

817
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,720
concentration of nutrients you should

818
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,640
give to your plants and i do

819
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,319
always really recommend going at half

820
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,080
strength and even for this one i would

821
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,720
start going at half strength

822
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,879
and then work your way up because it's

823
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,400
much better for a plant to have slightly

824
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,480
less nutrients and work your way up

825
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,679
then to basically force your plant into

826
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,679
a nutrient lockout

827
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,759
through that osmotic process and then

828
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,159
have to reel it back in

829
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,200
so that's honestly one of the reasons

830
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,880
why a lot of

831
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,480
people recommend that and people they

832
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,880
usually have a better experience with

833
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,720
nutrients when they go that way

834
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,400
and the the interesting thing is you

835
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,640
know some plants will do

836
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,600
they will look 100 healthy under half

837
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,440
strength

838
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:38,798
and even if you start pushing into

839
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,278
three-quarter strength

840
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:41,839
and even up almost to full strength some

841
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:44,798
plants

842
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:45,839
you won't even notice a difference and

843
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:47,200
they're just

844
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:48,879
they're they're you know they're they're

845
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,840
really adaptable to nutrient

846
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,600
concentrations

847
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,399
you know some strains some plants and

848
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,759
cultivars but

849
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,240
some are not then you have to find the

850
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:01,119
sweet spot so i wish there was like a

851
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,278
uh general kind of rule or guideline i

852
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:05,119
could give to people where i say

853
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,640
you know here it is just do this close

854
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,839
your eyes walk away and everything will

855
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,880
be fine but

856
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:14,319
it's just not that easy you know so

857
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,640
um i think people if you think of it

858
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:19,678
this way psychologically

859
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,038
if you have by the way just going back

860
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,480
to that last point if you are feeding

861
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,679
half and your plant is looking great and

862
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,240
then you go up the whole

863
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,600
you know 100 and it's also still looking

864
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,120
great you probably just want to go back

865
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,959
to half anyways because at that point

866
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,199
you're just kind of wasting nutrients

867
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,558
um like money you know and your plan is

868
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,400
probably going to do just fine it'll

869
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,918
adapt to what it needs

870
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,159
but psychologically if there was a

871
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,159
nutrient line who said you should feed

872
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,240
you know five mils a gallon

873
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,000
and then your plant is looking yellow at

874
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,679
five mils a gallon in some ways that

875
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,720
show a deficiency and then you increase

876
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,120
it to ten mils a gallon

877
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,919
you know sometimes people are

878
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,639
psychologically

879
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,480
like wow you know i'm oh i'm like i'm

880
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,000
feeding this plant so much i'm so far

881
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,759
above it's almost like taking medicine

882
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,839
like do you want to take double the dose

883
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,440
of a medicine do you think that's

884
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:09,519
healthy you're safe

885
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,798
so psychologically it's better to tell

886
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,720
people the limits

887
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,079
over here than rather to underestimate

888
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,759
the limit and

889
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,839
hopefully depending on the cultivars

890
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,640
you're growing you know someone is

891
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,918
somewhere between that 75 to 100 range

892
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,520
of what you give them

893
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,600
and i think psychologically that's a

894
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:28,158
little bit better for people to absorb

895
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:29,199
if you have to throw something out there

896
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,520
that makes sense

897
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,798
yeah now with these lines another thing

898
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,558
you had mentioned that it could be you

899
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,398
know overfeeding or

900
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,480
toxicity issue or plant problems in

901
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:41,918
general maybe yellowing or whatever

902
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,839
do you monitor the ph you know ppm

903
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,440
is another thing or ec there's another

904
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,879
thing that that people look at do you

905
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,320
personally do that do you recommend that

906
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,240
for this nutrient line

907
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,759
or some there's some nutrient lines that

908
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,759
have the ph perfect

909
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,278
advance has a ph perfect so you don't

910
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,158
need to worry about

911
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,038
ph your nutrient mix prior to giving

912
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,039
your plants so

913
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,079
yeah talk to us a little bit about that

914
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:04,480
yeah definitely and

915
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,519
normally i would if we're talking about

916
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,038
nutrients in general

917
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,720
um i do recommend ph

918
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,079
but of course mix your nutrients first

919
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,558
you know wait five or ten minutes stir

920
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,879
it up

921
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,240
test your nutrients out for advanced

922
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,080
nutrients ph perfect

923
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,919
um you know that is an interesting

924
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,158
product and it does work pretty well

925
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,600
this this nutrient line has developed if

926
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,600
you add it to

927
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,278
clean ro water and you add all the

928
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,038
nutrients during every phase like it

929
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:30,159
should actually be in the correct ph so

930
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:34,079
you won't have to ph

931
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:36,399
it so that is that is pretty cool it's

932
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,519
basically how the nutrient was designed

933
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:39,759
basically with uh

934
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,879
george's this comes back to george's

935
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,798
genius of like

936
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,159
basically what type of chemical

937
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:44,639
structure am i going to have in each

938
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,159
bottle

939
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,159
and how is that going to make it so that

940
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,760
it makes it as easy as possible so

941
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,360
this is i guess you could call it i

942
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,359
don't know i don't want to use that

943
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,678
terminology am i trademarked by advanced

944
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:58,479
nutrients but it is a ph balanced

945
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,720
nutrient so you don't have to jump in

946
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,240
there and the interesting thing is

947
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,759
the way it's designed the ph will

948
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,240
fluctuate a little bit

949
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,079
but as it basically goes to the plant it

950
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,079
makes sure that

951
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,439
the ph in the environment is proper for

952
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,398
the nutrients to be absorbed

953
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,320
which is the most important part so does

954
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:16,798
that mean that your solution always has

955
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,879
to be

956
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:23,359
exactly at 6.2 ph no you know

957
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,480
it can vary a little bit but people

958
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,959
don't have to jump in there unless

959
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,399
they're

960
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,319
you know ro water they're starting with

961
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,959
is that like a 4 or a 10 or something

962
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,158
you know

963
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,480
something absolutely ridiculous so

964
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,240
um yeah that makes it relatively simple

965
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,679
to do but when it comes to ph in your

966
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,640
water with other nutrients if they're

967
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,440
not

968
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,520
advertising that you know their product

969
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,919
has some type of ph balancing technology

970
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,519
then i

971
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,278
i definitely would recommend doing that

972
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,398
and uh when it comes to ec

973
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,839
ppm tds um

974
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:53,759
you know that's like saying miles per

975
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,199
hour kilometers per hour

976
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,480
you know it's it's it's like there's

977
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,880
different ways of measuring the same

978
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,558
thing

979
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,278
the concentration of nutrients in the

980
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:04,798
solution um

981
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:06,798
uh i do recommend i think especially if

982
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,079
you're growing the same cultivar over

983
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:12,240
and over

984
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:14,240
paying attention to your to your ec

985
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,079
or parts per million and seeing how the

986
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,558
plant responds like having your own grow

987
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,158
journal

988
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:22,960
is like the best way to do that uh

989
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,399
i would say you know starting off with

990
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,319
your the guideline we were speaking

991
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,398
about of just being at like 50

992
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,599
of what the feed chart recommends and

993
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:31,119
working your way up

994
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,599
that's probably the best way to initiate

995
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,839
it but you know a lot of times

996
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,038
i know people growing amazing medicinal

997
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:39,439
plants at

998
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:40,398
end of flower it's like 900 parts per

999
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,000
million

1000
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,519
and then i know people growing amazing

1001
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,558
plants and at the end they're

1002
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,398
doing 1600 parts per million and

1003
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,079
if you flip-flop those nutrient recipes

1004
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:51,519
like you're probably not

1005
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,519
going to have the same amazing plants so

1006
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,440
those people are growing so

1007
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,879
it's it's really about a positive

1008
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,278
feedback loop

1009
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,080
and in a way it almost it's funny

1010
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:01,599
because it's like

1011
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,000
people should treat themselves the way

1012
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:06,959
they treat their plants and vice versa

1013
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,480
and what i mean by that is journal for

1014
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,558
your plants journal for yourself

1015
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,519
you know if you had a funky day write

1016
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,240
about it

1017
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,759
and try and understand the association

1018
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,599
between like you know what when i hang

1019
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,278
out with these people

1020
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:20,719
i always seem to have a really good day

1021
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,359
and i can look back on that

1022
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,640
and make those associations and then you

1023
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,079
start hanging out with those people

1024
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,600
again more and more

1025
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,359
and it's no different with your plan

1026
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,038
it's like what kind of cool things were

1027
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:32,639
going on its environment when it looked

1028
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,879
its best

1029
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,240
now how do i recreate that again and

1030
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,600
believe me if you just try and rely on

1031
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,359
your mind and be like oh yeah i'll

1032
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:42,798
remember it dude it's all good

1033
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,678
i got this you're gonna realize that you

1034
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:45,679
forgot

1035
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,798
and then you're gonna like be chasing

1036
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,600
your tail

1037
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,960
so for me it's like even the smartest

1038
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,719
people i know

1039
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,079
are writing down notes referring back to

1040
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,720
them because then you don't have to be

1041
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,839
keeping like this

1042
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,079
encyclopedic knowledge in your head

1043
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,599
about what happened every day like look

1044
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:06,319
what happened in your garden

1045
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:09,519
in january 23rd you know do you remember

1046
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,278
no no yeah i don't remember

1047
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,440
i don't remember like the older i get

1048
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,119
the more i realize the value of

1049
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,240
writing things down and journaling

1050
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,158
things and whether that goes to your

1051
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,880
plants or yourself so

1052
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,278
do you do i completely agree yeah i have

1053
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,600
what i use is google sheets

1054
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,759
and the reason why i use it is because i

1055
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,639
have a roommate who also helps in the

1056
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:30,879
garden as well

1057
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,720
and yes being able to share that sheet

1058
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,919
be able to refer to it both added notes

1059
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,919
is key

1060
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,080
and it's basically just pretty simple uh

1061
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,919
you know on the rows you've got the date

1062
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:42,000
and then on the columns you've got the

1063
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,519
plant and then you know within

1064
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,919
each cell you're writing down for that

1065
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,000
day like what you're doing whether it be

1066
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,120
um you know you're transplanted on this

1067
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,200
day or

1068
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,158
uh you know you fed in and this was the

1069
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,360
runoff ph

1070
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,159
or runoff ppm or ph even ph going in ph

1071
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,759
going out

1072
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,399
so just all those details it's good to

1073
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,278
look back on especially if you do pop

1074
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:03,759
into a problem

1075
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:04,480
you can look back at those notes and say

1076
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,038
oh okay

1077
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,278
maybe this is happening because a week

1078
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,440
ago or two weeks ago i did this

1079
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,519
so i totally agree with you on um you

1080
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,278
know using some sort of

1081
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,359
journal diary whatever you want to call

1082
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,798
it to track your plants

1083
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:20,398
because you're you're not going to be

1084
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:23,038
able to remember it especially

1085
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,000
for me i grow like typically like 6 to

1086
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:25,839
twelve plants at a time

1087
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,278
there's no way i can remember all that

1088
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,119
all different cultivars they all have

1089
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:32,079
different nutrient requirements

1090
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,959
so it's super tough what do you use to

1091
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,639
track do you

1092
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,759
use any sort of app or or just a piece

1093
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,000
of paper or what

1094
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,158
yeah no i'm a i'm a definitely a child

1095
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,038
of the internet so i'm extremely digital

1096
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,679
um and you know most of my notes either

1097
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:47,440
go into

1098
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,240
google drive shared spreadsheet or

1099
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,600
evernote those are my two go-to's

1100
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,960
so um i'm probably very very similar to

1101
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,240
you and it's good doing it with someone

1102
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,679
too because they they can kind of keep

1103
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,200
you accountable in a way

1104
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,200
you know they can prod you if you missed

1105
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,319
a day or two and also like don't sweat

1106
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,679
it like some people are super

1107
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:05,759
perfectionist and they'll be like

1108
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,840
oh i'm gonna start journaling you know

1109
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,398
every single day of my growing operation

1110
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,239
and it's

1111
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,239
it's gonna be perfect you know i'm gonna

1112
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,078
write like a paragraph each day

1113
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,078
and then i'm also gonna do a hundred

1114
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,560
push-ups and run three miles and you

1115
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,919
know

1116
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,559
dude like relax it's okay you just put

1117
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,239
like a couple

1118
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,078
small notes that takes you five seconds

1119
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,078
don't set yourself up to fail

1120
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,519
and like if you miss a few days oh man i

1121
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,960
went out with my friends and wicked

1122
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:29,679
hangover and i missed a day or something

1123
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,320
like look it's

1124
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,960
it's okay you don't need perfection just

1125
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,639
like

1126
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,480
if you can get it the majority of the

1127
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,720
time you're doing yourself like

1128
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,519
exponentially better than not doing it

1129
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,199
at all

1130
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,800
so it's almost like that one push-up

1131
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,000
rule kind of thing like i have to use it

1132
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,079
all the time i think i have to refer

1133
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,679
back to it like every other week but

1134
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,359
it's like look every morning just do one

1135
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,720
push-up if you don't want to do a second

1136
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,279
one you don't have to

1137
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:55,039
but often times what happens is you like

1138
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,919
you end up doing like 10 or 20 push-ups

1139
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,639
because you're like you know what i'm

1140
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,559
already down here

1141
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,400
i'm already doing the push-up why should

1142
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,960
i get back up but some days you

1143
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,800
you just do one push-up you know and

1144
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,639
that's just kind of the way it is

1145
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,039
plants are like life you know they teach

1146
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,559
you a lot

1147
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,960
yeah that's a really great point for

1148
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,400
sure yeah let's uh let's switch it up

1149
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,880
let's talk about environment a little

1150
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,079
bit

1151
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,599
so um temperature humidity you know what

1152
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,480
do you typically aim for

1153
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,280
on those avenues yeah um you know it's

1154
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,199
so funny

1155
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,040
also because in in many ways um

1156
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,358
people are like man your your homegirl

1157
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,039
must be so dialed in and perfect

1158
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:35,440
you know you you help build out these

1159
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,960
like basically multi-million dollar

1160
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,960
operations with their equipment and

1161
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,880
things like that i'm like well you know

1162
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,960
because i'm doing that sometimes i don't

1163
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,000
pay as much attention to the one at home

1164
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,639
as i should and

1165
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,440
i will be the first person to admit that

1166
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:49,838
um but

1167
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,358
a lot of times like i don't like it's

1168
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:52,159
it's basically in a room and whatever

1169
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,199
that room is

1170
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,838
is what the grow tent is so the thing is

1171
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,078
in the winter

1172
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:59,519
you know it's probably closer to about a

1173
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,160
75

1174
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,519
and being in arizona um humidity is

1175
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,679
naturally pretty low so i do have to

1176
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:08,320
find cultivars that can deal with that

1177
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,239
um usually i am keeping like in flower i

1178
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,640
do try and keep it around like

1179
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:16,319
um 50 um in veg and then around 40

1180
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,679
in flour which is a little bit lower

1181
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,960
than probably the average person but

1182
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,358
look i'm in arizona

1183
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,119
right um but when it comes to

1184
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:24,719
temperature around 75 in the winter it

1185
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,280
probably gets to 80

1186
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,319
maybe i might even creep up to 85 in the

1187
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,680
summer

1188
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,440
depending on that room it's just the

1189
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:32,399
natural house is getting a little bit

1190
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,920
warmer but

1191
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,079
you know especially in the summer i'm

1192
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,920
always adding co2 and people are like oh

1193
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,359
what kind of crazy co2

1194
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,960
operation you got going in there and i'm

1195
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,559
like dude it's a four by four ten just

1196
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,358
get an exhale bag or two

1197
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:47,519
hang it up you'll be fine you know and

1198
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,199
so that's what i do for that little guy

1199
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,358
that's that's what i was gonna ask if

1200
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,439
you supplemented co2 so

1201
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:54,719
use the bags have you had good success

1202
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,800
with those do you hang them above the

1203
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,000
plants or what do you do with those um

1204
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,079
definitely hang them above the plants

1205
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,079
because co2 will fall um

1206
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,359
you know so naturally you do want to

1207
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,480
hang them out up there

1208
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:06,960
um you know we did do some testing i'm a

1209
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,159
very

1210
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,920
big tester i love testing products like

1211
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:14,239
i don't trust

1212
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,079
most things that are given to me until i

1213
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,199
can corroborate the evidence myself

1214
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,440
especially if it's something that's

1215
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:20,799
going to be like

1216
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,039
for example product we're going to bring

1217
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,560
to market right it's like

1218
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,239
you know you have to make sure you

1219
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:27,838
rigorously test the product to make sure

1220
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,319
that it's it's good and

1221
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,599
i got into that even before you know we

1222
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,800
were coming out their own products i was

1223
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,000
testing a lot of leds

1224
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,079
these days i'm sending them to light

1225
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,599
laboratories and doing full panels on

1226
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,280
like other brands of leds cost a

1227
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,800
thousand dollars per test

1228
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,359
we do that we have a blog on our website

1229
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,200
where we test a lot of that stuff

1230
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:46,400
but i like to find like you know here's

1231
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,838
the marketed

1232
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,000
efficiency of the led and then most

1233
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:53,279
often

1234
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,280
here is where the actual testing comes

1235
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,760
into the efficiency of led in terms of

1236
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,200
u moles per joule so that efficiency

1237
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,880
rating that a lot of people see

1238
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:02,399
so a lot of led companies out there i

1239
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,320
will i'm not going to name any names but

1240
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,000
i will say there are a lot of companies

1241
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,640
especially on amazon who say they are

1242
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,519
like

1243
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:10,559
2.7 2.8 new moles per joule and they

1244
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,519
actually test at like

1245
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:16,239
2.2 which if you think about it that's

1246
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,519
like a 30

1247
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:19,279
you know decrease from what they're

1248
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:20,000
advertising like imagine if like you

1249
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,720
know

1250
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,159
vitamin c advertised you and like or a

1251
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,598
pill like ibuprofen they're like oh yeah

1252
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,199
it's 200 milligrams

1253
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,280
and then you test it it's like ah it's

1254
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:33,039
actually more like 140.

1255
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,720
like that's not false advertising right

1256
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,000
yeah i guess it is false advertising but

1257
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,199
when you're in such a niche little

1258
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,239
industry it's like

1259
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,439
who who's the police you know of the

1260
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:43,039
of the small industry i think they're

1261
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,200
policing more like google and apple on

1262
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:46,800
facebook and things like that

1263
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,078
so let's get into the light testing a

1264
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,839
little bit more that is something that i

1265
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,280
had on on the list here that

1266
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:53,119
we wanted to talk about so you've done

1267
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,640
some light testing in the past

1268
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,358
i definitely want to dive deeper into

1269
00:38:54,639 --> 00:39:00,319
that you know integrated sphere

1270
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:00,719
is a test that's very common i'm sure

1271
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,039
you

1272
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,399
use that or you you've had you've used

1273
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,079
that in the past or

1274
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,920
at least had your third party testing or

1275
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,519
whatever yeah can you talk about

1276
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,480
like testing in a whole and kind of what

1277
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,639
your goal there and so on and so forth

1278
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,159
yeah so with integrated spheres they're

1279
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:17,118
extremely expensive if you want to look

1280
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,199
one up and buy one

1281
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,720
um more power to you that means you

1282
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,799
definitely got some

1283
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:24,078
you know some play around money but we

1284
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,240
do contract that out

1285
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,720
um we actually do use you know it sounds

1286
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,879
funny because it's like light laboratory

1287
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:33,199
that's actually the name of the company

1288
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,680
so it's not just a laboratory that tests

1289
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,279
lights

1290
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:39,598
um but they're out of california jason

1291
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,200
jason gee i think it is or g i don't

1292
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,359
know the best way to pronounce it

1293
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:45,279
um he's one of the main guys over there

1294
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:48,880
but he's tested a lot of lights for us

1295
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,000
and so we do um a full panel

1296
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,280
like we'll do a grid over like a 5x5 at

1297
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,320
12 you know 18 24 36 inches

1298
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,720
they do full testing um looking at

1299
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,200
basically ppf and ppfd few moles per

1300
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:04,399
joule they do it between 400 and 700

1301
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:05,759
nanometers

1302
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,039
and for those of you don't know that's

1303
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
just kind of like the photosynthetic

1304
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,159
range

1305
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,400
they also test it from like i think 380

1306
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:13,598
to 720 so a little bit of a wider range

1307
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,720
and give you also

1308
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,559
the ppf and ppfd for that

1309
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:21,439
they do a full spectral chart so they

1310
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:23,440
show you that awesome little funky wave

1311
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,559
and you can see like how many blues are

1312
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,559
coming out

1313
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,838
in relative intensity versus the reds

1314
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,838
and maybe some whites and oranges

1315
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,318
yellows things in between

1316
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:33,920
they also do a you know a chromaticity

1317
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:37,358
graph which is a little bit

1318
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,280
um maybe a little bit above the average

1319
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:42,000
kind of late person to kind of

1320
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,599
absorb but they do do that and you know

1321
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,960
a lot of people i actually

1322
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,318
who are customers of ours especially on

1323
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,159
the commercial side when they're like

1324
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:49,039
you know i'm thinking about this led or

1325
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,519
that led

1326
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:53,199
and i'm gonna be investing uh two to

1327
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,318
three hundred thousand dollars which way

1328
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:56,078
should i go

1329
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,599
i want to be able to speak intelligently

1330
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,599
about what

1331
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,720
you know what way i think they should go

1332
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,318
in and

1333
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:06,000
based off of data not just necessarily

1334
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:09,119
what a sales rep from the company

1335
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,239
told you who happens to be you know

1336
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,680
a really good friend or a great you know

1337
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,759
um maybe sales person so

1338
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,199
i i'd rather have the data kind of do

1339
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,280
the talking for the product

1340
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,639
but sometimes the data's not available

1341
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,560
so

1342
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:26,400
in a way i felt like an obligation to

1343
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:27,679
start creating that data and making it

1344
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,440
publicly available

1345
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:30,799
and that's where the light testing kind

1346
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,318
of came from and believe me i've tried

1347
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,359
to test other products like i tried to

1348
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:36,000
do a

1349
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,559
fan test uh with like inline fans

1350
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,119
because

1351
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,239
people would call us and like everyone

1352
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,680
buying a fan would be like

1353
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,199
hey so um what's the quietest six-inch

1354
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:46,879
fan that you have

1355
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,799
and we'd always be like man i don't know

1356
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,880
like this one's quiet when you put

1357
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,640
ducting on it and a carbon filter but

1358
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,920
is it quite as the other one so i bought

1359
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,039
this like decibel meter

1360
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,000
and i was like you know what we're just

1361
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,480
gonna test it so we went up to the

1362
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,480
office

1363
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,000
bought like every fan in the market

1364
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,119
started testing with this decimal meter

1365
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,880
i think this is one of those really old

1366
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,240
videos like a six or seven year old

1367
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,838
video on grover's house probably still

1368
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:10,078
up there i got it taken down probably

1369
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:11,759
but we were testing it and i will say

1370
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,800
like we got some measurements out of

1371
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,640
that decibel meter

1372
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,480
but the thing was also like all over the

1373
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,039
place so like

1374
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,358
that test in particular i i will be like

1375
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:23,119
one of the first people to say like

1376
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,559
we got some decibel readings for those

1377
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,000
fans but like

1378
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,239
when i was in that room listening to

1379
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,559
them they were all loud like

1380
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:32,159
like can i perceptively know the

1381
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:33,679
difference no so you're like kind of

1382
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,440
splitting hairs in a way

1383
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:38,159
so like some of my testing goes really

1384
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,880
well and some of it's like

1385
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,318
you know i guess you can't feel fast

1386
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,760
fail forward i guess

1387
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,199
it's a good philosophy

1388
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,200
now for the light testing you said this

1389
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,679
information is publicly available

1390
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,480
where would folks go to access this

1391
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:54,078
information

1392
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,480
yeah and how many roughly how many

1393
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,400
lights does this consist of

1394
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:03,280
all the tests yeah the i mean how many

1395
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,079
like lights have i tested in my career

1396
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,720
were probably

1397
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,440
somewhere between 50 and 100 on the most

1398
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,759
recent

1399
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,440
and relevant blog post that we have up

1400
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,240
that uses the

1401
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,119
um the light laboratory that i really

1402
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,479
like using

1403
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,519
there's probably 10 ish up there

1404
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,280
including like

1405
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:26,159
gavita fluence hlg

1406
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,400
growers choice california lightworks and

1407
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:28,239
i

1408
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,079
might be missing one or two but i know

1409
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,358
coming up we are going to be testing a

1410
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,680
few more brands and putting them up

1411
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,440
there

1412
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:38,960
i know that on deck we have like lux

1413
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,318
illuminar um you know some people we we

1414
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,519
do take

1415
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:45,759
um some recommendations from people so

1416
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:46,639
some people have thrown out led

1417
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,440
companies

1418
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:54,559
such as the think grow by troll master

1419
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,920
science you know uh and

1420
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:57,679
you know if there's any other led

1421
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,119
companies that are really making

1422
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,039
making waves in the industry then

1423
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,599
they're probably worth testing but if

1424
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:06,559
you go to growershouse.com

1425
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,400
blog um that'll take you to our blog and

1426
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,159
we have a lot of tests there but there's

1427
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,119
one blog in particular i think if you

1428
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,559
just google like

1429
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,318
best led grow lights of 2021 uh in

1430
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:17,440
google we're like the first or second

1431
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:18,800
thing that comes up

1432
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,800
and just look for the one that's by

1433
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,200
growers house and that's kind of the led

1434
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,920
test

1435
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,799
and yeah awesome yeah i think that's

1436
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,519
great information

1437
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,960
for the folks to have you know

1438
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,960
especially you know

1439
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,800
as you know i deal with a lot of a lot

1440
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,559
of home growers are really my audience

1441
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,160
is what i like to think you know

1442
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:37,759
not as many in the commercial side of

1443
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:39,920
things i feel like more

1444
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,359
indoors versus outdoors because that's

1445
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,000
the way i grow so i feel like a lot of

1446
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:45,199
folks

1447
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,119
a majority of them maybe not everybody

1448
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:48,399
are kind of similar to that so indoor

1449
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,240
lighting is huge

1450
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,599
it can be expensive and there's

1451
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:54,239
definitely a lack of data

1452
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,079
and misinformation like you mentioned

1453
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,318
with people reporting false numbers and

1454
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,760
stuff like that so you doing these tests

1455
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:01,519
having this information publicly

1456
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,520
available is huge

1457
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,280
so thank you for for doing that for us

1458
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,599
and uh i'll link

1459
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,040
grosshouse blog down in the description

1460
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,280
section if i can find that specific

1461
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,559
specific article i'll link that in the

1462
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,680
description section so you guys can get

1463
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:15,039
right to it so you can see that

1464
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:17,118
information right away

1465
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,400
but uh yeah great stuff there good stuff

1466
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,559
with the lighting for sure

1467
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,119
yeah and you know we um so even though

1468
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:25,358
i'm doing the r d at home i do have

1469
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,039
r d with some friends at you know

1470
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:28,400
licensed commercial facilities and i'm

1471
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:29,440
actually also part owner one of

1472
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,440
massachusetts

1473
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,880
so we are doing some testing with leds

1474
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,119
over there different types of

1475
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,559
automated irrigation like so people are

1476
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,960
wondering like oh do you just have that

1477
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,159
little

1478
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,679
rmd 4x4 like no we test it it depends on

1479
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,838
the product line right

1480
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:45,759
um so we have a little hobbyist product

1481
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:46,559
line stuff like plant house tents that's

1482
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,000
like one of our

1483
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,838
tents so i tested that and that's the

1484
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,280
temp i'm growing it but

1485
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:52,880
that's obviously not relevant for the

1486
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,079
commercial grower right

1487
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,680
so yeah makes sense so kind of getting

1488
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,400
into the commercial side of things

1489
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:00,318
you've

1490
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,440
you know you have your own show can of

1491
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,000
cribs

1492
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,838
and you tour dozens and dozens of

1493
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,039
facilities over the years you guys have

1494
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:09,279
been doing that for what are you on your

1495
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:11,039
third second season third season

1496
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,040
yeah set we're like finishing up our

1497
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:13,759
second season finishing up the second

1498
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:15,599
season

1499
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,119
yeah so finishing up the second season

1500
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,880
and then we're just gonna keep going we

1501
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,559
have some fun stuff coming out actually

1502
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,160
we have uh

1503
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:23,759
yeah we have i'll just say this summer

1504
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,559
there's gonna be a really funny video

1505
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,280
that drops

1506
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:27,679
that is very unlike what we normally do

1507
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,440
so

1508
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,279
check it out yeah definitely subscribe

1509
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,720
to grower's network if you uh

1510
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,880
are not currently so

1511
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,799
question i want to ask you is in regards

1512
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,240
to cultivation facilities and kind of

1513
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,720
having the

1514
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:44,318
the home grow in mind right like i

1515
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,959
mentioned a lot of my audience is

1516
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:48,318
probably home growers is there anything

1517
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,838
you've seen in these commercial

1518
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:51,440
facilities that

1519
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:53,279
you think can be applied to the home

1520
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,720
grower that maybe you don't see

1521
00:46:53,280 --> 00:47:00,000
the homegrower traditionally doing

1522
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:02,399
you know um i would say

1523
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,838
immediately the answer is absolutely yes

1524
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,358
um

1525
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:07,119
there are a lot of differences between

1526
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:09,440
commercial and home um

1527
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,960
kind of growing operations but even in

1528
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,960
our last episode

1529
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,599
uh we we filmed at shango in las vegas

1530
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,960
um that that was just released and

1531
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,519
there's this one section where we talk

1532
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,400
about

1533
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:24,480
propagation and like you know in that

1534
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,720
propagation section

1535
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,760
you know let me let me rewind for a

1536
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,959
quick second when you go into a

1537
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,680
flowering room of a commercial

1538
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,720
cultivation facility it's like

1539
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:37,598
it's it's so impressive and large

1540
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:39,279
and expansive and the environment is

1541
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,480
controlled by these like

1542
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,680
you know 800 pound dues that hang from

1543
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,719
the ceiling and there's

1544
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:47,838
10 of them and there's 200 lights and

1545
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:49,919
they have this

1546
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:51,039
preva argus you know environmental

1547
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,720
controller

1548
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,800
and that also cost a hundred thousand

1549
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:56,719
dollars as nets worked into their system

1550
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,119
and they're monitoring by computers

1551
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:00,799
that's not like your home girl right but

1552
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,079
when you go into like the propagation

1553
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,359
section even

1554
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,920
it's like you know they're using little

1555
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:09,199
watt clone lights on a little rack with

1556
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,720
10 by 20

1557
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:12,239
you know cloning trays with little grow

1558
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:13,759
dang cubes and clonex

1559
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:16,159
you know and i said that in the episode

1560
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,599
i was like this is the same exact way

1561
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,118
that you're probably going to be cloning

1562
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,880
at home and this is exactly what they're

1563
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,960
doing at the commercial facility

1564
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,800
but instead of one cloning dome you know

1565
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,199
with a few plants in it they just

1566
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,640
end up having about 40 of them you know

1567
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:31,199
with 50 clones each

1568
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:32,719
and they do that consistently every week

1569
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:35,279
but

1570
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,000
it's it's almost it's almost like

1571
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,319
comical

1572
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,039
that you know cloning and propagation is

1573
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:40,880
exactly

1574
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:42,079
the way it is at home as it is in these

1575
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,920
commercial facilities

1576
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,680
so if you watch like any of those kind

1577
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,119
of groups videos like in the propagation

1578
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:49,279
you'll watch it and you'll be like

1579
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,960
oh yeah like this is basically what i do

1580
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,760
at home oh but oh they taught me that

1581
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,679
little

1582
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,599
you know maybe that that little thing

1583
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,759
about like

1584
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,960
you know kind of like shaving the outer

1585
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,720
layer of the plant or something like

1586
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,039
that these cool little tips but

1587
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:04,318
you know what if we go deeper though

1588
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:06,480
some of these commercial operations are

1589
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,079
trying to keep um

1590
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,760
uh the genetics of their plant you know

1591
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,680
as as pure as possible so they're

1592
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,839
getting into like tissue culture

1593
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,358
which is something that not a lot of

1594
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:18,239
people do at home

1595
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:20,400
but you know when it comes down to it i

1596
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:23,118
think in commercial operations

1597
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,960
they're really monitoring the exact same

1598
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,160
environmental factors

1599
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,400
they just have to do it on a bigger

1600
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:29,519
scale so they're checking their ph

1601
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,720
they're checking their ppm

1602
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:32,880
they're checking their temps their

1603
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:34,639
humidity you know the

1604
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,079
considerations when you go up to a

1605
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:39,920
really large operation

1606
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:42,800
are not a change in those levers

1607
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,519
it's just a change in what technology is

1608
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,920
needed

1609
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,358
for you to monitor those levers at that

1610
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,559
scale

1611
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:53,039
and learning that so i

1612
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,720
i wouldn't put commercial growing on a

1613
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:58,558
pedestal from

1614
00:49:54,719 --> 00:50:00,000
basic kind of growing um understanding

1615
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,480
and expertise

1616
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,679
but i will say i do put it on a pedestal

1617
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,838
when it comes to

1618
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:07,118
how you get the proper technology to all

1619
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:09,920
integrate together

1620
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,200
and almost becoming a general contractor

1621
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,519
of a commercial

1622
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:15,279
garden like that's the people that i see

1623
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:17,358
do really well

1624
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,800
they really study the manuals on this

1625
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:20,239
technology and

1626
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,519
they they really read through that and

1627
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:22,399
they try and understand everything about

1628
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,079
the growing

1629
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,639
operation and then they try and be their

1630
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,920
own contractor and building it out

1631
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:29,519
those are the people that do well so if

1632
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,720
there are any home growers out there who

1633
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:32,159
are like you know what

1634
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:33,759
i love doing this i want to do this for

1635
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,679
a living i want to make a career out of

1636
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,680
it i want to move from

1637
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:39,440
you know let's say you're a bookkeeper

1638
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:41,039
now doing accounting and you're like you

1639
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,480
know what but i love the plants i want

1640
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:45,759
to be with them every day

1641
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,519
you know i would say start reading

1642
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,000
manuals on a lot of the technology like

1643
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:49,280
watch

1644
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,719
some candy cribs episodes because it'll

1645
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,079
give you a lot of ideas and you'll hear

1646
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,399
these brands come up

1647
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,839
like these really sophisticated you know

1648
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,519
elaborate ones watch a whole bunch of

1649
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:58,400
videos and read some manuals on how they

1650
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:01,119
work

1651
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,079
and you're you're basically halfway

1652
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,519
there

1653
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:07,839
that's awesome good stuff there so

1654
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:08,719
you are the owner of grower's house the

1655
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:12,400
largest

1656
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:14,000
retailers for equipment

1657
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,358
you've got to have some insight on some

1658
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,239
of these new products that are coming in

1659
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:17,920
the future

1660
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,439
so can you tell us can is there anything

1661
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,039
you can reveal to us is there anything

1662
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,079
that's that's coming out that excites

1663
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,639
you

1664
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,119
yeah um there is and you know it's funny

1665
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:29,920
that the the largest retailer in the us

1666
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,318
it's like we're not really the largest

1667
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,039
but

1668
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:33,599
if we're like kind of the largest like

1669
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:36,480
single

1670
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,559
store kind of e-commerce operation but

1671
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,280
there's other bigger companies out there

1672
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,079
you know than us for sure but uh when it

1673
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,960
comes to cool

1674
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,920
products um you know what i think a lot

1675
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,720
of people are going to see

1676
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,000
are so people might know like ac and dc

1677
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:53,118
fans

1678
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,760
most fans are ac by

1679
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,559
you know where the electrical current

1680
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,880
goes but

1681
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,680
there's these ec fans coming out right

1682
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,480
now

1683
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:03,679
which basically can operate with digital

1684
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,519
controls

1685
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:06,799
which can make them work a lot better

1686
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:09,199
with controllers

1687
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,559
and they operate on way less wattage way

1688
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:12,558
less power

1689
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,880
and i don't know if people in the past

1690
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:17,680
have been like man

1691
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,519
you know they buy like a little rheostat

1692
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:20,879
or a speed adjuster for their fans and

1693
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:23,199
it kind of works

1694
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,119
you know it goes from like 100 to 50 but

1695
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:27,039
it's like not very precise

1696
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,039
and things like that and you can't

1697
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:31,440
really get from 50 to zero

1698
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:33,039
like these ec fans will be like i want

1699
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,559
it at 37

1700
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:36,558
dial it in with an app on your phone

1701
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,800
like you know and then

1702
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,319
have it change because it's digital it's

1703
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,720
like

1704
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:44,159
basically the world is your oyster like

1705
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:45,598
as long as someone builds a technology

1706
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,719
just to like say oh yeah

1707
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,160
at 847 i wanted to go from 37 to 62

1708
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:51,838
but then an hour later i wanted to drop

1709
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:52,639
another five percent because this

1710
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:54,480
happens like

1711
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:56,719
you can do all that stuff and these fans

1712
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,800
i think will end up being like the same

1713
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:00,959
cost as like the ac fans too which is

1714
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,318
really cool so that's gonna be coming up

1715
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,318
on the horizon

1716
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:05,920
um i think everyone's gonna see a lot

1717
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:08,480
more like wi-fi

1718
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,838
kind of based and app-based controllers

1719
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,358
for home grow tents

1720
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:13,119
that are gonna be coming way down in

1721
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,880
cost um

1722
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,160
i've been like working on a project

1723
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,680
helping out some people

1724
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:20,159
with some stuff like that where it's

1725
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:22,239
like a controller that

1726
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:24,639
you know it's kind of modular you can

1727
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:27,759
end up hooking up like

1728
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:30,960
basically a um you know like a

1729
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,480
soil a you know a soil moisture probe

1730
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,159
and then you can hook it up to your fans

1731
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,440
and then you can have a ppm probe in

1732
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:36,879
your reservoir

1733
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,200
and you know you can hook up a whole

1734
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,640
bunch of other probes and it's all

1735
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,960
based on this little one controller with

1736
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:44,480
a touch screen and you can also

1737
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,639
hook it to your router and check it on

1738
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,400
your phone and your laptop anytime and

1739
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:49,759
that controller will probably be like

1740
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,280
like i'm helping these guys out if

1741
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,119
actually if you go to homegrown

1742
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,119
engineering that's like a little youtube

1743
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,318
channel by this guy named volker he's an

1744
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,720
engineer

1745
00:53:56,318 --> 00:53:59,358
and um german engineer who lives in

1746
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:01,199
australia

1747
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:02,799
great accent love his accent just

1748
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:04,639
hearing him talk is like

1749
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,240
put you know put you to put you to sleep

1750
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:08,400
or meditate or something but

1751
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:10,479
um that's a cool channel and that

1752
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,280
product will be like 299 bucks or

1753
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,519
something

1754
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,680
you know like that's cool i love i love

1755
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:20,159
seeing little things like that come out

1756
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:23,440
um even on the more sophisticated side

1757
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:25,118
you know there's um a lot of things

1758
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,880
the interesting thing that people don't

1759
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:30,720
know that much is

1760
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:33,358
the commercial growers

1761
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:34,000
there's the high value crops for this

1762
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:36,000
industry

1763
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,039
like there's so much investment in r d

1764
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,960
in technology

1765
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,480
that it's actually like spilling over

1766
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,559
into other crops because they don't have

1767
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,960
as much profit to like invest in this so

1768
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,640
the high value crops are like driving a

1769
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,720
lot of technological innovation

1770
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:50,159
right now which is awesome because we

1771
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,519
used to be like you know

1772
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:53,838
the the runs in the corner that no one

1773
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:54,798
paid attention to and now we're like a

1774
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:57,599
driving force

1775
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:58,000
in thought leadership but you know

1776
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,680
there's

1777
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,199
there's some very cool applications

1778
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:02,558
coming out with like crop steering where

1779
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:04,239
it's like

1780
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,920
if you're not familiar with the term

1781
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:07,118
crop steering yeah just please google it

1782
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,400
read it really fast

1783
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:13,519
pause now play again so uh

1784
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,280
but they're taking all these factors

1785
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,358
and you can like basically see these

1786
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,160
really small deviations in a plant's

1787
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:20,719
health

1788
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:22,159
and then like bring it right back to

1789
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:22,879
where it needs to so you're not waiting

1790
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:24,960
a week

1791
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,640
to see how something's going and then it

1792
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,280
takes another week to respond to it it's

1793
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:29,519
like

1794
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,839
you're keeping that like what we can

1795
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:32,559
call homeostasis or equilibrium there

1796
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:35,759
and you're like

1797
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,920
riding that wave perfectly so that kind

1798
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,319
of stuff is pretty cool i think

1799
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,960
awesome so lots of exciting things

1800
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:42,639
coming on

1801
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,639
to the market soon that's good to hear

1802
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,440
oh yeah yeah and i think the cool thing

1803
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,440
that we're going to see is like

1804
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,280
raspberry pi's like homegrowers

1805
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,039
just making their own stuff that i'm

1806
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,000
excited for too you know

1807
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,279
that's gonna be right yeah for sure so

1808
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,960
wrapping things up

1809
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,200
how can the listeners find you and what

1810
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,000
do you have upcoming in the future

1811
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:03,199
yeah how can they find me um on you know

1812
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,079
instagram is really big

1813
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:06,798
i i like don't really go on facebook um

1814
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,079
so

1815
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:10,000
i think i have one i just don't really

1816
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,000
do stuff on it that much but i have an

1817
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
instagram it's nate.j.lipton

1818
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,159
they can hit me up that's probably the

1819
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,039
most popular social media for me in the

1820
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:20,159
