1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,960
coming up on garden talk if you're at

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,799
5.8 you have access to everything your

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,320
plant has access to everything that's

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,160
one of the things i love about hybrid

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,559
hydroponics and deep water culture is

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,798
that i mix it and i have full control

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,160
and i know what's happening cracky is a

8
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:18,480
fantastic growing method but it's

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,439
limited for certain plants changing the

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,399
reservoir that advice is anywhere from

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,039
weekly to every two weeks

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,518
when i fill up my hydro buckets i always

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,399
fill them up one to two inches

14
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,879
below the bottom of the net pot it's not

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,439
for advanced growers it's for new

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,359
growers is because it takes the grower

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,599
out of the equation how many times have

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,359
you ever over watered a plant or

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
underwatered a plant when you grow in

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:49,119
deep water culture that doesn't exist

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,120
there's no watering

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,960

legitimate concerns and i'm just

132
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,080
overthinking things but yeah we'll get

i got into gardening uh a few years ago

153
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,879
it was pre-legalization you know i've

154
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,519
always grown plants i've always had

155
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,360
house plants but i just kind of let

156
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,758
house plants i keep them alive i don't

157
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,038
grow them so much but pre-legalization

158
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,680
in canada

159
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,199
when legalization was announced i

160
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,800
immediately knew i was going to grow

161
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,199
medical plants i've always wanted to

162
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,038
i've always had a uh

163
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,520
a thing there so

164
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:52,478
i went out and i bought the grow bible

165
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,560
and i started reading and

166
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,879
i came on to deepwater culture

167
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,038
and so two years before legalization i

168
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,038
just started growing deep water culture

169
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,680
in my basement getting familiar with it

170
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,839
growing tomatoes peppers cucumbers

171
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,918
anything that i could so i knew when

172
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,359
legalization happened

173
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,519
you know i had some experience and i was

174
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,199
just gonna roll with it and and that's

175
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,439
what happened yeah and i've been growing

176
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,080
ever since awesome so we'll get into

177
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,759
that deeper hydroponics in particular so

178
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,279
you said deep water culture a lot of

179
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,520
people call it dwc what is dwc and then

180
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,519
there's also rdwc can you talk to us

181
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,000
about those two things

182
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,000
sure yeah so the difference is is that

183
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,519
it's one style of hydroponics

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,439
hydroponics there's lots of different

185
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,439
styles deep water culture and

186
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,240
recirculating deep water culture are the

187
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,240
two

188
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,600
is what we're talking about and a deep

189
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,439
water culture

190
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,600
is essentially a plant that is in some

191
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,120
sort of medium suspended above

192
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,120
a solution and then that solution

193
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,240
contains just the roots there's nothing

194
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,800
else down there except for roots and

195
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,680
nutrient solution and air stone

196
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,280
being and oxygenating the air and and

197
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,319
and that's all

198
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,439
and then how what separates a deep water

199
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,520
culture

200
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,519
from recirculating deep water culture is

201
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,519
exactly that is a recirculating system

202
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,079
if it's just deep water culture it's

203
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,159
just one container and there's no pumps

204
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,918
or anything nothing's moving it's deep

205
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,840
water culture if it's a recirculating

206
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,639
deep water culture it's still deep water

207
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,478
culture same principles apply except now

208
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,199
there's water moving typically to an

209
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,918
external reservoir and there's reasons

210
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,079
and

211
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,000
i mean differences between having and

212
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,159
pluses and minuses of having an external

213
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,319
reservoir versus simply just having

214
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,960
everything contained in one uh

215
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,800
container okay that makes sense and now

216
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,519
what equipment is needed you said for

217
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,759
dwc it's just kind of a bucket in itself

218
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,519
i'm sure you need like a net pot within

219
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,199
the net pot there is a medium can you

220
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,038
talk to us like in detail about what the

221
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,598
different pieces of equipment are needed

222
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,038
for those setups yeah absolutely so

223
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,680
for deep water culture you're going to

224
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,399
need a few basic things you're going to

225
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,439
need

226
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,399
a

227
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,759
bucket

228
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,000
something to

229
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,919
hold your your fluid you're going to

230
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,720
need something to hold your plant and

231
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:11,038
your medium and you're going to need an

232
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,440
air pump an air stone

233
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,360
and an airline and

234
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,279
and that's it that really is all that

235
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,439
you need uh of course then you need your

236
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,959
nutrients and all the other stuff but um

237
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,918
those are the basics and you can really

238
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,560
get into deep water culture uh for it's

239
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:29,120
quite an affordable thing

240
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,399
to get into but it's a little bit

241
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,959
intimidating um i think everybody can

242
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,120
can speak to that right so and so within

243
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,038
those net pots you can put different

244
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,000
types of mediums right you can do the

245
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:44,720
clay pellets clay balls right hydroton

246
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,039
or you can do cocoa can you do soil can

247
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,200
you do perlite can you do different

248
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,039
types of medium within that net pot or

249
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,959
does it have to be a certain type

250
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,958
right yeah so uh so typically what you

251
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,799
need for deep water culture is you

252
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,319
you're suspending your plant above your

253
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,000
nutrient solution right your nutrient

254
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,600
solution below is just roots just just

255
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,519
uh aerated

256
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,440
solution and i would say you know about

257
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,440
two-thirds of your plant is submersed in

258
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,600
that that's your consumption selection

259
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,640
of your roots your upper portion of your

260
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,320
roots is enclosed in a net pot some form

261
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,679
of apparatus some people call them the

262
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,480
top hat those are the ones that are

263
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,799
large that contain the structure that

264
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,839
holds the medium so that is either going

265
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,000
to be

266
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,959
hydroton which is the clay pellets it

267
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,839
could be

268
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,439
rock wool uh that that's an inert medium

269
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,680
that's up there as well

270
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,360
you could technically use

271
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,120
anything to hold the plant above in the

272
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,879
net pot

273
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,120
but you don't want to be making your

274
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,200
solution dirty if you're using cocoa or

275
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,600
you're using soil or anything like that

276
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,920
it can be done but it's not

277
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,440
ideal it doesn't work well it's best to

278
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,599
keep everything really nice and clean

279
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,040
and uh um go with the inert mediums okay

280
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,720
gotcha yeah that makes sense i even

281
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,838
think about that it could dirty the

282
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,399
water if you're using something like

283
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,040
soil right just drips down in there so

284
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,039
that right that's

285
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,078
balls and stuff like that because that

286
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,000
doesn't really drip down into in there

287
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,599
or anything so

288
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,639
right and that's one of the things is

289
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,639
getting away from i found getting away

290
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,519
to not introduce soil every time i've

291
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:22,720
tried to introduce oil or or cocoa

292
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,919
just for the experience in my garden i i

293
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,278
find other things come accompany with it

294
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,958
you know when you're just dealing with

295
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,759
rockwool and you're doing with hydroton

296
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,919
or

297
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,559
an apparatus say that doesn't use medium

298
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,479
at all uh

299
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,518
you you now don't have to you're not

300
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,879
introducing any organic uh critters

301
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,039
right there's there's there's there's

302
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,679
nothing alive coming into your garden

303
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,838
it's all washable and uh

304
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,000
the pests are really uh easier to

305
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,480
control uh in that matter

306
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,600
gotcha now you mentioned air stones so

307
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,680
that's one way of doing you know you

308
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,839
have air stones within the bucket it is

309
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,958
oxygen that water that's key that's

310
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,959
gonna one one thing that's gonna help

311
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,559
prevent you know something like root rot

312
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,639
you know what i mean lithium i think

313
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,719
it's called is is the actual name of the

314
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,958
the bacteria in there that that causes

315
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,360
the harm there's also the kratky method

316
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,278
which i believe is just there's no air

317
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,639
stones right correct me if i'm wrong the

318
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,559
roots are just sitting in the bucket so

319
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,919
you can actually get away with not using

320
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,759
air stones at all can you talk to us

321
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,759
about the differences between the two

322
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,759
like kind of the pros and cons of air

323
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,319
stones versus the kratky method yeah

324
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,838
definitely so kraki is a fantastic

325
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,560
growing method but it's limited for

326
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,640
certain plants

327
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:36,159
the principle of kratky method is that

328
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,759
you can mix a nutrient solution

329
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,919
and

330
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,519
you could put your plant

331
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:46,559
in your medium in your lid and then put

332
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,959
that lid in your mixed solution in a in

333
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,278
a container and then there's no

334
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,679
oxygenation there's no disturbance

335
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,600
there's no ph balancing there's no

336
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,599
addition of anything what you mix and

337
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,278
what you put into that container is

338
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,040
going to

339
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,200
have everything the plant needs to get

340
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,199
it to harvest so that's really cool but

341
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,800
it's only applies to certain things your

342
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,079
leafy vegetables

343
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,879
and nothing that has to have a

344
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:14,319
transition in its nutrient

345
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,078
regime so if you have a plant that needs

346
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,480
vegetative nutrients and then has to

347
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,638
switch to bloom nutrients exclusively

348
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,120
and has different nutrients that is

349
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,120
changing

350
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,000
for a fact

351
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,278
that's not gonna work with kraki because

352
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,440
you're obviously working that and

353
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:33,278
something that's a a very long uh um and

354
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,720
uses you know intense amount of

355
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,639
nutrients and stuff is not gonna work

356
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,320
for kratky but it is cool there is ways

357
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,360
to use it for

358
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,839
different plants and uh um

359
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,600
also with uh you know cloning medical

360
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,560
plants it's uh there's some neat things

361
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,079
to do with kratky so okay gotcha now one

362
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,679
of the top questions i had through

363
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,278
instagram was can you grow organically

364
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,319
using dwc

365
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,159
right

366
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,000
and that is

367
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,159
i would love to be able to grow in a

368
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,278
pure organic sense you know that is just

369
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,519
something that people it's a big box to

370
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:12,159
check for a lot of people that's the

371
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,759
one thing that allows people to really

372
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:18,399
get into living soil and and organics

373
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,799
and and just pursue that

374
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,278
i'm testing some nutrients right now

375
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,958
some fertilizers and they are an organic

376
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,240
line um

377
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,719
but

378
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,200
again i'm just testing that right now

379
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,200
i don't use it

380
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,240
because i found with organics even

381
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,879
introducing organic amenities

382
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,278
you risk the run or you don't risk i

383
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,320
mean you have accumulation is what it is

384
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,240
you have

385
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,760
you have you have to think of your water

386
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,560
solution that you have as your deep

387
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,240
water culture solution and you have your

388
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,759
roots and

389
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,919
everything in there

390
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,319
and when you have

391
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,759
organics that are physical compounds

392
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,120
that are in there

393
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,360
you have to be careful how many things

394
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,039
you add that create

395
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,199
uh

396
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,599
you know sticky into the water right

397
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,919
that film that could you can only handle

398
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,600
so much and then at a certain point

399
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,599
but i don't know understand all the

400
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,079
science but any time i've tried it it's

401
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,278
just you get an accumulation of gunk you

402
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:22,319
get a uh uh and and that goes in the

403
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,480
opposite direction of when you don't

404
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,760
it's just nice and clean and white right

405
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,120
you know everything that's happening

406
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,559
that's one of the things i love about

407
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,278
hybrid hydroponics and deep water

408
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,759
culture is that i mix it and i have full

409
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,120
control and i know what's happening

410
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,759
organics

411
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,600
i'm working on it i i think in year in

412
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,519
years to come

413
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,120
and who knows maybe very shortly there

414
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,759
there will be some great organic

415
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,879
products that work really really well

416
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,958
that's around the corner but right now

417
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,000
for ease of use especially for new

418
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,919
growers i stick to you know some

419
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,039
semi-organic stuff

420
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:01,679
that's just fully dissolvable so it's

421
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,679
all about dissolvable right okay that

422
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,759
makes sense and just kind of talking

423
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,359
more about nutrients i know like some

424
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,278
organic lines they're

425
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,560
very thick you mentioned sticky they're

426
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,639
gonna clog the actual lines of the

427
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,919
hydroponic system right so

428
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,759
are there any can you talk about some

429
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,078
nutrient lines maybe that you recommend

430
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,838
that won't actually clog the lines

431
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,278
yes uh

432
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,720
if we're talking about and we're talking

433
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,879
about a recirculating system

434
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,920
specifically right and here's here's you

435
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,278
know the

436
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,958
again going back to the difference

437
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,720
between recirculating deep water culture

438
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,799
and deep water culture deep water

439
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,320
culture has its advantages because

440
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,159
there's nothing to

441
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,000
there's nothing moving there's no pumps

442
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,078
happening in your house there's no

443
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,039
external reservoir with lines and

444
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:44,159
pressure

445
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,480
and

446
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,399
crevices and cleaning in between grows

447
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,360
it's just a bucket right that's the

448
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,078
hydro bucket that's why that's why we

449
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,159
we made it it's kind of getting away

450
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,319
from that recirculating system so you

451
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,799
don't have accumulation you have it all

452
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,920
right in front of you available

453
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,439
to

454
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:09,039
interact with um and and

455
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,720
and this i think may lend to

456
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,159
more

457
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,440
you know going down that line of

458
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:18,399
organics and uh

459
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,160
using stuff that is a little more gunky

460
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,639
because you can you can manage it on an

461
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,198
individual basis per plant right

462
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,440
and you have access down in front of the

463
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,838
roots you can actually see the roots

464
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,399
as per design of the hydro bucket and

465
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,120
the deep water culture vessel that it is

466
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,519
but

467
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,240
right now i use crop salts

468
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,959
anything that is a

469
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,839
you know any liquid will work well

470
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,758
you know

471
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,360
like so many people i started off with

472
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,480
gh3 part

473
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,919
right

474
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,800
and then a lot of people start there and

475
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,719
they start going up to maybe some nice

476
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,599
expensive stuff like advanced nutrients

477
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,399
uh

478
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,000
you know they work great you you

479
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,879
there's so many great nutrients out

480
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,439
there uh canadian companies american

481
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:07,199
companies uh european companies uh but

482
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,600
also then you can get into some nice dry

483
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,679
nutrients where for new users it's very

484
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,279
nice and economical where you get a

485
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,480
couple sacks they're going to last you a

486
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,558
year

487
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,439
and you just don't have to measure

488
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,759
multiple things per when you're mixing

489
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,600
up your solution you just get to go

490
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,519
so many grams of a so many grams of b

491
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,119
and you're done and that's the same

492
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:28,558
throughout your grow you just dilute it

493
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,279
with water

494
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:31,519
so

495
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,200
the big thing with nutrients

496
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,440
it really doesn't matter which one you

497
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,798
choose as long as it's fully dissolvable

498
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,880
that's what you're looking for it

499
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,759
dissolves 100 percent

500
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,679
and there's it just looks like a nice

501
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,240
clean water after maybe there can be

502
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,440
color i mean some of many of them

503
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,759
manufacturers use color um and again

504
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,440
that can stain your roots and

505
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,400
make people think oh no my roots are

506
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,558
brown or orange or whatever but

507
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,440
you know if you just choose a nice white

508
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,038
fully dissolvable nutrient line then

509
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,360
you'll just always be impressed with how

510
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:08,160
they look thinking you use liquid or

511
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,279
powder as long as it's fully dissolvable

512
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,240
and then you're just kind of dumping

513
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,240
them into your dwc system with the

514
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,798
existing water that's already in there

515
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,400
or you're putting into a bucket diluting

516
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:22,000
it down then dumping that bucket of

517
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,200
water into your dwc system right

518
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,160
yeah i mean so so so you know i treat

519
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,240
our rdwc and dwc there's a couple things

520
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,840
that i've come across uh over the years

521
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,359
especially now that i have hydro buckets

522
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:36,480
in my garden

523
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,240
you know i

524
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,640
the whole reason

525
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,880
that i created

526
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,880
the hydro bucket was

527
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,840
uh because i here's here's what happened

528
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,440
with my with with growing um

529
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,199
is that i started growing like a lot of

530
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,798
people i chose deep water culture

531
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,319
because i heard

532
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,960
of how

533
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,439
how awesome it is i it worked for me

534
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,759
that i could grow in my basement i could

535
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,360
be clean right there's no there's no

536
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,079
coming and going with soil and mixing

537
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:09,119
and stuff i didn't have room for that uh

538
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:11,519
i could grow my four medical plants and

539
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,759
deep water culture worked for me so

540
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,279
i went out like anyone i'm i'm i'm a

541
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,960
home grower and i don't want to just go

542
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,319
out and spend lots of money and this is

543
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,279
one of the challenges of deep water

544
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,759
culture

545
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,678
and hydroponics in general is if you

546
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,160
wanted to enter hydroponics

547
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,240
there's a pretty good price tag to that

548
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,000
right especially a recirculating system

549
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,558
you're either going to spend quite a bit

550
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,679
of money on a recirculating system or

551
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:37,359
you're going to go a diy road

552
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,400
and so that's what i did is i went the

553
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:42,240
diy route uh i this is one of the very

554
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,559
first buckets that i made i went and got

555
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,759
the bucket for five bucks i drilled the

556
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:49,359
thing i got the grommet you know uh but

557
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,879
a lot of people

558
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:55,119
are we're talking about a diy people

559
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,360
versus growing people right and not

560
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,759
everybody has a drill not everybody has

561
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,240
all these things so so deep water

562
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,158
culture has kind of been overlooked um

563
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,519
for that reason right

564
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,720
but what happened was

565
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,798
after going into getting this i found

566
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,279
i have to lift my plants

567
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,480
i have to i have to jeopardize yield

568
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,038
every time

569
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,919
i have to change this nutrient solution

570
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:24,640
i have to lift a big tomato plant or or

571
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,799
a pepper plant or cucumber plant uh and

572
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,120
and and it's a bit of a disaster to be

573
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,720
able to get into here

574
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,639
so what do you do

575
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,759
to solve that is you go to a circulating

576
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,679
system

577
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:39,839
you hook up plumbing to your buckets so

578
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,759
you have an external reservoir outside

579
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,158
of your tent outside of your environment

580
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,919
so now you can service

581
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,039
all of your nutrient solution that's

582
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,960
going through all four plants from your

583
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,279
external reservoir

584
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,679
right and and that that that works well

585
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,918
because now you can scrog your plants

586
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,320
you don't have to worry about

587
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,880
a loss of harvest because you never have

588
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,319
to lift the top anymore to access for

589
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,799
fluid changes

590
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,839
or anything right it's all

591
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:12,158
controlled in the external reservoir

592
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:15,359
so that's what i did

593
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,559
is is i grew in a recirculating system

594
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,119
but then

595
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:23,038
i just found that that i was still using

596
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:24,798
all diy stuff and there wasn't uh

597
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,720
there's just there had to be something

598
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,720
better than just a pail than a bucket

599
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,440
and so that's uh yeah so that's so

600
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,038
that's when we made the hydro bucket

601
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,919
right that's why we made the hydro

602
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,558
bucket and we and we made access to it

603
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,880
and so essentially what what this did

604
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:42,879
was

605
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,759
we want access to the to the growing

606
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,759
container

607
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,960
and we don't want to lift the top so we

608
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,480
put a reservoir outside of the tent

609
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,679
so we've just moved the reservoir and

610
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,000
attached it right onto the hydro bucket

611
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,240
right i mean so now with a hydro bucket

612
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
we don't need plumbing we don't need an

613
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,159
external reservoir outside the tent

614
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,840
let's just put another tent beside that

615
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,880
tent right

616
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,918
because

617
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,200
now

618
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,360
we can have our plants on top and they

619
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,519
can be scrogged they never have to be

620
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,000
lifted they're treated just like a dirt

621
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,839
plant you never have to disturb it

622
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,240
and you have access just like you have

623
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:27,678
an external reservoir but it's on the

624
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,400
side so there's a lot of benefits

625
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,880
to doing this and getting into

626
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,798
just skipping the recirculating system

627
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,799
for those that are listening and don't

628
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,319
see the actual visual he held up just

629
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,000
your normal at first he held up your

630
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,480
normal five gallon bucket they'd get

631
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,200
from like home depot or lowe's and it

632
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,279
kind of had a kind of a pipe attachment

633
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,798
to the side and then he showed up his

634
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,879
hydro bucket which are products that he

635
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:52,798
created and it kind of has like a lip

636
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,640
this is kind of the best way for that i

637
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,558
can think to explain unless you have a

638
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,960
different words to explain that lip but

639
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,879
it gives you a way to access

640
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,720
the inside without really you're not

641
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,080
really having to remove a top at all

642
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,640
right you can kind of just kind of get

643
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,319
in there without having to lift up the

644
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,960
plant like you had mentioned so yeah

645
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,000
that's it it allows you to

646
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,279
uh

647
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,240
access

648
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,440
uh

649
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,839
the reservoir solution get in there and

650
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,600
check your ph because here's the thing

651
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,199
if you're growing in

652
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,599
a bucket

653
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,000
how do you test your ph in your

654
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,918
reservoir you know in a convenient and

655
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,759
and functional way because because you

656
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,080
have to keep

657
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,599
you have to test your ph and you have to

658
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,038
check

659
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:38,399
keep the parameters of your nutrient

660
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,879
solution in check just like your

661
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,320
environment right it's everything it's

662
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,080
it's about when you're growing plants if

663
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,759
you give them the right environment they

664
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,519
will grow well and there's two

665
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,278
environments there's your

666
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,679
root environment of your plant whether

667
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:54,400
you're soil or cocoa or hydro it doesn't

668
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,360
matter you still have a temperature and

669
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,200
a water and

670
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,959
you're managing that environment and

671
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,720
you're managing your plant environment

672
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,400
that's your light and your humidity and

673
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,319
your temperature so

674
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,000
we have to manage that we need an easy

675
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,079
way to get into our

676
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,159
solution and check it

677
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,079
we need to be able to remove fluid from

678
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,440
it and put new fluid in

679
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,798
so when we when when you're only using a

680
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,679
five gallon

681
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,200
bucket or a diy job

682
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,720
it's very difficult to get in there you

683
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,640
have to disturb that top you have to

684
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,960
lift it and move it and it can be done

685
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,799
but it's not really very convenient

686
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,000
with the hydro bucket

687
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,918
the externally the external reservoir

688
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,359
that is fluidly coupled sharing the same

689
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,960
walls and bottom

690
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:42,558
is one way to explain it it is a five

691
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,880
gallon bucket with

692
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:48,399
more space added

693
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:52,080
and that external reservoir on the side

694
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,720
has a lower access point

695
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:57,278
so you can see your roots you can see

696
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,759
inside you can see what's happening

697
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,599
and you can access it comfortably you

698
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,000
can drop a hose in there you can use a

699
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,719
water pitcher you can use your put your

700
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,519
ph pens and your ec pens in there and

701
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,679
test on a regular basis all without ever

702
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:14,240
touching your plant so

703
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,559
ever lifting it so essentially you know

704
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,919
we we made recirculating

705
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,399
systems without all the pumps and

706
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,240
pressure that's pretty cool yeah viewer

707
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,278
question was you know if you're not

708
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,120
doing our dwc and you don't have the

709
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,200
hydro bucket right you're with the

710
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,959
typical five gallon bucket what's the

711
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,600
easiest way to remove the water from the

712
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,278
buckets you know i use

713
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:39,278
a pony pony pump anyway uh when when

714
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,200
when you get into hydroponics there's a

715
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,558
certain thing few things that you need

716
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,759
that you're just going to make your life

717
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:47,278
really nice

718
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:50,400
and going to help you i mean

719
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,798
just just grow in a way that's

720
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,240
i say let the pumps do the work

721
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:55,918
you know don't you don't you don't you

722
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,319
don't have to lift anything anymore and

723
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,240
this is just well suited for certain

724
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,839
people certain growth styles certain

725
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,839
ages i mean there's a lot of people who

726
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,480
can't carry big bags of whatever in and

727
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:09,359
out of their house up and down stairs so

728
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,278
hydroponics allows you to plug a pump in

729
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:15,599
and let it do all the lifting and so

730
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:18,240
yeah i love a pony pump with a small end

731
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:21,199
that you just drop in uh

732
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,640
and it sucks it out and then you can uh

733
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,360
add to your

734
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,120
uh

735
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,678
your your vessel your water vessels

736
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:30,319
again right to top everything up um but

737
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:34,480
it's it's more than just the ad and

738
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:36,720
removing um with a pony pump okay gotcha

739
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,679
let's flip it up let's talk about water

740
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,000
so

741
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,880
water why did i say it like that water

742
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,720
water

743
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,840
let's talk about water what is the type

744
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:49,038
of water that's ideal to use for this

745
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:51,839
you know the best results that i've had

746
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:54,640
are reverse osmosis water

747
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:54,639
ro water

748
00:26:55,038 --> 00:27:00,079
it's just it's just costly to create all

749
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,919
oral water um

750
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,558
you know you you have to you need an ro

751
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,559
system and

752
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,240
there is some waste involved

753
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,400
uh with it

754
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,038
um

755
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,210
it works the best but it's not required

756
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,400
i don't use ro water uh

757
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,720
[Music]

758
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,200
again i found my best results were

759
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,038
coming from it but i couldn't grow at

760
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,519
the

761
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,759
level at the size the size of my garden

762
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:30,319
i just couldn't keep up with that amount

763
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,558
i'm still a home grower and i'm not

764
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,558
ready to spend a few thousand dollars on

765
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,918
the massive ro system that's out of

766
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:41,599
reach for me right now uh so so i'm just

767
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:44,559
uh i'm using tap water and i'm sure to

768
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,319
aerate it it comes from it's a municipal

769
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:47,599
water source i put it in a thousand

770
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,599
liter tote

771
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,359
so it sits there has the the chance to

772
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,959
off gas

773
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:57,759
and then that that's where i start so

774
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,000
i have good results with it results will

775
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,079
be better if you do use reverse osmosis

776
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,558
water when you say off gas are you

777
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,720
talking specifically about chlorine

778
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,319
exactly you're going to have chlorine um

779
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,880
and you're going to just

780
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:12,319
um you have that smell to the water when

781
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,760
you get obviously it's treated right out

782
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,918
of the facility when it comes out of

783
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,960
your tap you know for it is here so once

784
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,120
you leave it sit for a week uh or you

785
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,278
put a bare stone in there you can smell

786
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,558
that that smell goes away and

787
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:29,038
um you know it's just

788
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:31,678
something that you can do to

789
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,679
the and there are other small there are

790
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,759
some some products that exist out there

791
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,759
at our local store hardware store there

792
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,038
is a

793
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,519
i couldn't tell you what it is but it

794
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:44,000
was a fairly affordable product that

795
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,599
changed tap water made tap water

796
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,278
suitable for

797
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,278
plants and animals

798
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:50,720
um so

799
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:52,319
i'm sure it's something that busts up

800
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,038
the uh

801
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,000
the

802
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,720
the chlorine bond and maybe just helps

803
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,599
it

804
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,038
dissipate from the water

805
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,519
because really i think that's what we're

806
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:06,480
trying to do is we don't want

807
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,158
water that is going to kill live things

808
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,240
that's all we're really looking for

809
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,760
what's in the water

810
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,759
is important

811
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,798
you know if you have a water source that

812
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:16,558
is

813
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,558
400 parts per million that's what it's

814
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:20,319
starting at well that's a problem

815
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,119
because it contains a lot of stuff

816
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,879
already right reverse osmosis you take

817
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,038
everything else you're starting at zero

818
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,760
so this is why it works so much better

819
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:32,000
is you have all the space

820
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,240
in your water your water is essentially

821
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,720
empty consider consider your water is

822
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,919
your your your obviously your fluid but

823
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,480
it's what you're delivering to your

824
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,200
plant as your your battery so when you

825
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,240
start at zero or you start at 50 uh

826
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,080
parts per million you can

827
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,919
let's say you're building it up to 1 000

828
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,439
parts per million for your plants that's

829
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,120
1 000 parts per million that you have

830
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,360
full control over

831
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,558
if you're starting at 400 you have all

832
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,439
kinds of stuff in there you might

833
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:02,079
already have high levels of magnesium

834
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,240
and calcium or who knows what so when

835
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:07,599
you're just adding your three part or

836
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,200
your nutrients to 400

837
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:12,158
you don't you know it's it's it's

838
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,519
problematic most tap water you know most

839
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,480
people you're gonna be one to two

840
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:19,440
hundred

841
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,440
and that's fine uh as long as it's not

842
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:25,038
actively killing everything it comes in

843
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,200
contact with like chlorine does right

844
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:29,839
it's meant so to keep to harbor any

845
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,480
beneficials so your water's not alive

846
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:35,038
well we want our water to be alive

847
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,200
we don't want it to be dead so

848
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:40,158
we want our water to a lot be to come

849
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,038
and either ro out the chlorine and the

850
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,880
stuff that kills

851
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,038
beneficials in the water or we want it

852
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,960
to aerate it and just get that chlorine

853
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,879
out of it and then it's just water

854
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,960
so we do need to get the chlorine out of

855
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,278
it because you know chlorine kills off

856
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,038
beneficial microbes it also kills off

857
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:58,558
the bad microbes right

858
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,240
hydroponics a sterile environment

859
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,798
anyways and we don't really rely on that

860
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,440
beneficial bacteria to uptake nutrients

861
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:07,200
at the roots so on and so forth or what

862
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,320
right well so there's two ways to grow

863
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,399
um

864
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,319
we're not we don't necessarily keep it i

865
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:13,599
don't grow in a sterile environment i

866
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:15,759
know there are

867
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:19,038
other companies that do it very well do

868
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:21,919
it very well but that lends to

869
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:25,200
the big hydroponic recirculating systems

870
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,480
that that are in the industry

871
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,759
you know they're

872
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,759
at an industrial standard where you have

873
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,519
what how many how many plants hooked up

874
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:36,640
how many vessels to your recirculating

875
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,399
system 10 20 50 right you know you can't

876
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,919
afford

877
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:44,639
contamination anywhere period uh and a

878
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,159
lot of the uh regulations don't allow

879
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,200
for it i mean you have to prove that you

880
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,960
can grow here in canada where where you

881
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,880
you're not going to jeopardize

882
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,600
a large crop of plants

883
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,880
uh with something so being sterile on

884
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:01,519
that level in a recirculating system

885
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,039
is extremely important i think but not

886
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,960
necessary

887
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,240
the how i grow

888
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,759
is

889
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:13,038
with a live environment i

890
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:16,319
don't sterilize i start with water again

891
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:18,079
i'll start with with with uh um

892
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:20,398
you know i start with my aerated tap

893
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,798
water that's been sitting in my my

894
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:25,759
thousand liter tote and then i'll mix

895
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:29,519
that into a hundred liters um and that

896
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:31,919
does one of my flower rooms that'll do

897
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,079
you know five six seven eight nine about

898
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,559
eight eight or nine hydro buckets is one

899
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:39,678
of my flowers so i'll mix 100 liters at

900
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:43,359
a time and

901
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,798
my my starting point i start sterile and

902
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,079
and that is true just to make sure the

903
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,079
water going in and there's there's

904
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,119
nothing harboring in there so i start

905
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:51,038
with a

906
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:54,959
uh

907
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:57,278
silic silicic acid uh or a

908
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,519
like a

909
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:00,398
magnesium sulfite

910
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,079
and so

911
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,479
what that does is there's some benefits

912
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:08,798
there for the plant but it also

913
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,798
puts a ph spike and makes it quite

914
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,679
off the scale and and and not you know

915
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,360
great for anything to be in um so that's

916
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,600
where we always start in that direction

917
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:20,319
and then you add your your nutrients to

918
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:23,839
that once the nutrients are in there

919
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:25,918
uh then i will bring the ph into balance

920
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:29,599
once the ph is in balance then i'll add

921
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,840
some microbes i'll add microbial mass

922
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,918
and i'll add some

923
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:36,480
hydrozyme

924
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,240
root enzymes so these are living things

925
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,679
so you want to make sure your ph is in

926
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,880
check and it's a not a hostile

927
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,720
environment otherwise you're just

928
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,840
they're just going to get fried right

929
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,319
so once i add those then i put those

930
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:52,398
then i feed out of that thousand liters

931
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:55,200
or 100 liters and i just pump into my

932
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:56,959
hydro buckets and they that is their

933
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,640
feed for the week

934
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,720
okay gotcha that was actually a question

935
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,559
was can you use beneficial microbes and

936
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,399
dwc and you just answered that yes you

937
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,319
can yeah yeah

938
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,799
that's cool right now what about the

939
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:11,918
water level what should the water level

940
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,200
be within the system the water level is

941
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,279
important

942
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,118
definitely but it's more important in a

943
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,440
recirculating system

944
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,919
in the recirculating system

945
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,398
you want that water level to never go

946
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,000
above a certain level so that's two to

947
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:27,118
three inches below the bottom of your

948
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,719
net pot

949
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,000
right and basically what we're looking

950
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,719
at it is

951
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,358
the your the top portion of the plant

952
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:37,678
has to breathe this is the whole dry out

953
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:40,239
principle of of drying out plants right

954
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,679
is it has to dry out from the top down

955
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,279
because that top third is really where

956
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,960
the root

957
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,200
the plants

958
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,760
have a different process than the uptake

959
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,078
portion that's the below

960
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,760
so two to three inches below

961
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,039
always from the bottom of the net pot

962
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,200
you don't go above that in a

963
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:00,000
recirculating system

964
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:01,199
if you're in a deep water culture

965
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,599
then you can

966
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:06,000
and i say that just because not on not

967
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,559
on on good garden practice not on

968
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,199
regular practice when i fill up my hydro

969
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:13,838
buckets i always fill them up to about

970
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:16,719
what again one to two inches

971
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:20,799
below the bottom of the net pot

972
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:22,959
and then but sometimes i'm going away

973
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,119
and it's not a static environment i know

974
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,679
that that fluid level is going down it's

975
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,960
going down pretty drastically in certain

976
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:32,960
times in in the grow cycle

977
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,240
with with uh uptake of different plants

978
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,920
so

979
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:39,439
i know that

980
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,519
if i want an extra day

981
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,960
then i will fill it up right to the

982
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,639
bottom of the net pot i'll get that

983
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,039
extra two inches in there

984
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:50,400
why not because i know the plant is

985
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,599
going to say oh i'm kind of drowning

986
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,760
but

987
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,240
but it has no choice it it though that

988
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,320
fluid is moving through it um

989
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:01,759
and in a day it's down to one or two

990
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,440
inches and then it's within uh two or

991
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,599
three more days it's down to uh uh only

992
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,679
two or three inches left in the bottom

993
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,599
of the hydro bucket and then it requires

994
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,598
service again one of the general advice

995
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,519
that you hear every so often is talk

996
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,359
about changing the reservoir every so

997
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,519
often you hear about it should be done

998
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,679
every seven days some people say you can

999
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:24,400
do it 10 days everybody says you can do

1000
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,719
14 days you can do it so how often

1001
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,838
should the reservoir actually be changed

1002
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:32,399
right so again this is this is uh this

1003
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:34,000
is this is a broad area of it depending

1004
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,920
on how you're doing things for home

1005
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,440
growers right we don't want to you no

1006
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,358
one wants to waste a lot of water i mean

1007
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,800
that's a very valuable resource so we're

1008
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,000
always trying to conserve everything we

1009
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,160
can

1010
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,119
and when i did grow in a recirculating

1011
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:47,199
system

1012
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,559
and i had that larger external reservoir

1013
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:50,559
i found it

1014
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:53,199
i was more grudging to change that

1015
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,960
solution because there was more of it

1016
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:58,239
the whole principle of recirculating is

1017
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,280
you're using volume to

1018
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:03,118
move i mean the volume volume is what's

1019
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,560
moving through all the uh

1020
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,880
additional lines to move it through the

1021
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,639
tent and then back into the

1022
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,039
reservoir so you need x amount of volume

1023
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,358
that is nutrient solution that is just

1024
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,480
there simply mixed to make things move

1025
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,719
where

1026
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,159
in a sm in the same single bucket you

1027
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,159
only mix what you're going to use and it

1028
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:22,879
sits there

1029
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:25,440
so one to two weeks is when you should

1030
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,480
change your reservoir if you're sterile

1031
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,838
then

1032
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,240
uh um

1033
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:32,880
you know there it there's more to it uh

1034
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,838
you want new new you you want to change

1035
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,800
it but it's more of a system of how to

1036
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:43,599
grow it's understanding

1037
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,800
uh a a recipe in which to

1038
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,079
uh

1039
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,960
when to add nutrients when to add water

1040
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,160
when to pump it out and i say every

1041
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,880
single week

1042
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,159
and the reason why i say that is it

1043
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,800
allows you

1044
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,679
to refresh your plant put everything

1045
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,039
back

1046
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,639
into

1047
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:04,639
parameters

1048
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,239
that they want to be in

1049
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:07,920
uh and then

1050
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,118
at the end of the week completely flush

1051
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,280
your plant

1052
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,880
and get it ready for the week again

1053
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,599
if that makes sense and i can go into

1054
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,039
detail on that i do online on our on our

1055
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,400
ig page with some videos but um i'm

1056
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:21,519
happy to talk about that here as well

1057
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,480
yeah i mean they can they can always

1058
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,480
visit the ig page to learn more about it

1059
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,280
in detail and we've got quite a few

1060
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,039
questions here to continue on to so if

1061
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,519
you want to learn more details about

1062
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,239
that in particular what's your instagram

1063
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,960
it's vish it's hydro bucket uh or

1064
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:40,479
visionary hydroponics we can be found on

1065
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,800
instagram yeah and that's where we post

1066
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,838
a lot of uh videos on i call it the week

1067
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,320
in the garden where i show

1068
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:49,759
why i where how i pump out and what i do

1069
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,320
for my seven days in the garden that

1070
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,280
repeats each week okay cool

1071
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,599
ph

1072
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,640
let's talk about ph ph is another hot

1073
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,480
topic

1074
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:01,838
you know there's a general range that

1075
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,159
people can stay within 4ph that's the ph

1076
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:05,759
of the water solution can you talk to us

1077
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,719
about ph what's the ideal range and so

1078
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,359
on and so forth yeah so ph is everything

1079
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:14,239
ph is availability so

1080
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:18,480
if you're many people have seen the the

1081
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:21,838
the scales uh uh essentially if you

1082
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:25,280
are at your your range is 5.5

1083
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,799
to 6.5 in hydroponics in deep water

1084
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,720
culture hydroponics okay let's just to

1085
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,480
be clear because cocoa is hydroponics as

1086
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:33,199
well and those are not the same ph

1087
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:37,679
ranges so deep water culture hydroponics

1088
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:40,319
year 5.5 to 6.5 if you're in that range

1089
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:43,358
your plant is not

1090
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,640
going to be stressed it has availability

1091
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:49,838
to move water and function and

1092
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:52,719
availability to certain uh uh

1093
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,920
uh nutrients so

1094
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,879
if it it

1095
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,800
5.8 is ideal if you're at 5.8 you have

1096
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,760
access to everything your plant has

1097
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,760
access to everything if it goes below

1098
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,520
5.8 you're going you're not going to

1099
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,760
have access to

1100
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,400
the stuff that is at the higher end of

1101
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,000
this of the scale at 6.5 just like if

1102
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,639
you go to 6.5 you're not going to have

1103
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,639
access to the stuff that's below 5.8 so

1104
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:18,078
you can float around i mean your plants

1105
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:19,358
the plants know what to do they don't

1106
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,760
have to just be

1107
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:26,159
right there and if they're not there oh

1108
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,640
no if it's 5.5 to 6.5 it's good and we

1109
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,318
keep it in range as long as it's in

1110
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:32,799
range for four days then you have the

1111
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:34,480
ability to uh uh

1112
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,039
you know check it and adjust it every

1113
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,199
four days but you have to keep your ph

1114
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,519
in range number one what are some of the

1115
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,960
best ways to stabilize the ph from my

1116
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:44,880
understanding if you have air stones in

1117
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,480
there your ph could is more prone to

1118
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,240
drift so what are some of the best ways

1119
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,318
that you can stabilize ph

1120
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:53,039
um you know i hear this

1121
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:55,119
often is that it causes

1122
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,400
drift and

1123
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,358
um

1124
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,680
you know

1125
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:01,199
air stones in deep water culture they're

1126
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:03,919
just part of deep water culture they're

1127
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:07,358
always in there um and i don't always

1128
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,358
fight with with ph drift i think it's a

1129
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:11,679
combination of

1130
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:12,880
having nutrient solution that is well

1131
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,519
dissolved

1132
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,519
having a happy environment

1133
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:18,480
um

1134
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,280
and

1135
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,519
not an environment that's too dynamic i

1136
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,119
found i had more ph swing when i was in

1137
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,199
a recirculating system because i would

1138
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,200
have multiple plants i would have

1139
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,480
multiple nooks and crannies different

1140
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,480
things pulling it just seemed like a

1141
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,519
more dynamic environment

1142
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,119
i find

1143
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:38,159
when growing in individual deep water

1144
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,160
culture hydro buckets um

1145
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,039
i can stabilize it quite quickly if i

1146
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:42,559
really

1147
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,000
want to

1148
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:45,920
because i have that nice access on the

1149
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,599
front of the hydro bucket so

1150
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,240
i can

1151
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,359
i can i just use ph down really is what

1152
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:55,519
i do i found by using magnesium sulfate

1153
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:57,920
or sulfite uh

1154
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,719
when i when i before i when i start my

1155
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,119
mix of my fluid and then i bring that

1156
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:06,159
high ph down

1157
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,160
to 5.8 before i add my beneficials

1158
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,759
i find those two

1159
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,279
additives seem to

1160
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,040
stabilize

1161
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,200
with a good

1162
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,039
soluble

1163
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,799
uh solution right a good soluble

1164
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,400
fertilizer it has to be well so because

1165
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,119
because that's part of the problem i'm

1166
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,000
finding with certain uh

1167
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,440
things is if the salute if the solution

1168
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,679
is dynamic and it's not fully dissolved

1169
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,280
and you mix it and then you put it in

1170
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,519
with your plant

1171
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,519
now it's even more dynamic because the

1172
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:41,599
plant is up taking water the

1173
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:43,599
concentration of your solution could be

1174
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,680
it could be concentrating but if not

1175
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,800
everything is dissolved

1176
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,799
you have

1177
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,039
an addition to your fluid that's

1178
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,560
happening so when you balance it

1179
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:55,279
once

1180
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,358
maybe it's just the air is creating a

1181
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,160
good environment to dissolve what hasn't

1182
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,838
been dissolved yet and so that la that

1183
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:04,239
that that

1184
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:05,279
addition of dissolved particles into the

1185
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,358
water

1186
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,839
needs more balancing

1187
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:12,639
if that makes sense yeah it does for

1188
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:15,599
sure yeah yeah because i can really i

1189
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:18,400
can really balance my water and

1190
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,800
it's good it's once i once i make my

1191
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,800
notes and i get my you know if it's a

1192
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,720
straight if it's a plant that i'm used

1193
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,599
to growing um

1194
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,279
and i i i dial it in and i know

1195
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,960
the ph is

1196
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,200
in range i won't even check it for four

1197
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,440
days let alone balance it each day right

1198
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:36,318
it's just about using

1199
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,119
your

1200
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,480
uh

1201
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,640
paying attention to stuff and and uh

1202
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,880
i really think uh dissolving things well

1203
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,920
gotcha now with ph a lot of people talk

1204
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,200
about another measurement ppm or ec what

1205
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:54,079
should the ppm or ec range be during the

1206
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:56,879
different stages of growth right so

1207
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,280
light um you know like so many people

1208
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,400
when we grow growers like to just push

1209
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,720
push push and we're encouraged by

1210
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,680
so many packages by

1211
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:09,279
nutrient manufacturers but this isn't

1212
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:10,799
necessarily uh i think it's a

1213
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,240
misunderstanding

1214
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,280
um

1215
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:14,879
you can

1216
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,040
you want to be

1217
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,440
in a vegetative state uh you know in

1218
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:20,880
small plants and hydroponics you you're

1219
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,880
you're only they don't need much you

1220
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,880
know leafy greens uh

1221
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,559
they're just after a bit of nitrogen

1222
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,318
that is really what they're after they

1223
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:32,480
don't have massive root systems um

1224
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,639
so you're under 400 parts per million

1225
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,079
500 parts per million that that does a

1226
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,879
lot for seedlings and clones

1227
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,720
under

1228
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,480
once you're into a vegetative state

1229
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:45,118
where you're growing a plant that you

1230
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,440
really want it to get going um you can

1231
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,039
go from you know uh

1232
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,599
if it's if it's bigger what if it's

1233
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:53,599
bigger than a football a basketball then

1234
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,760
then i think you can push something at

1235
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,318
that point uh

1236
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,400
if it's going to go from a basketball to

1237
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,239
you know two to three times its size

1238
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,680
then that's a plant that could probably

1239
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,039
start getting up towards to a thousand

1240
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:07,279
parts per million

1241
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,279
of vegetative nutrients if you're

1242
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,880
switching your plant to a bloom nutrient

1243
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,960
at that point

1244
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,838
um you can go anywhere from a thousand

1245
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,358
to fifteen hundred parts per million

1246
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,559
the fifteen hundred parts per million

1247
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:20,480
that's on the

1248
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,078
the manufacturer's bottle that's for

1249
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,039
people who enrich

1250
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,440
so

1251
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:29,119
they are correct in telling us

1252
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:32,159
1 000 to 1500 but you have to understand

1253
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,920
that your plants need more when they're

1254
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,159
in a co2 environment they're going to

1255
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,318
use more so that is what that reading is

1256
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:41,118
for most people what i recommend when

1257
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:43,838
you start using a nutrient line is you

1258
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:46,480
start at half whatever they say

1259
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:48,559
go half and um

1260
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,119
it's it's easy to

1261
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,000
give your plants a little bit more

1262
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,039
uh

1263
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,559
than than the other way but uh for the

1264
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:58,239
most part

1265
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:00,000
if you're around a thousand for biggest

1266
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:01,279
plants whether you're in veg or bloom

1267
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,079
you're gonna you're gonna be in a good

1268
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,000
space okay and then talking about water

1269
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,839
temperature the water temperature is too

1270
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,280
low you can run into problems

1271
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:10,880
temperature's too high you could run

1272
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,200
into problems what should the

1273
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,519
temperature be of the water right so the

1274
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,838
temperature should be

1275
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:18,960
68 to 72

1276
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:20,239
fahrenheit

1277
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,280
is what we're looking that's that's kind

1278
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:25,439
of the ideal range it can be

1279
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,640
lower it could be

1280
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,079
anywhere

1281
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:32,000
down to below 64 you're going to get

1282
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,160
you're going to have slower growth once

1283
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,679
you get below 64 degrees and once you

1284
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,358
get above

1285
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:38,879
76 degrees

1286
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,598
you're really risking

1287
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,640
uh competition uh in there and the

1288
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:48,079
reason for that is dissolved oxygen

1289
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:50,318
when you have cold water it holds oxygen

1290
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,560
so that oxygen the water is full of

1291
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:56,000
oxygen it's it's very

1292
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,799
uh it's a very uh happy safe environment

1293
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,599
for

1294
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,359
for good microbes and and not for bad

1295
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,640
things

1296
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:06,880
and as the water gets hotter and hotter

1297
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,159
there's just not that much oxygen in it

1298
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,079
that's why air stones are really

1299
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:12,799
important to get them in there and just

1300
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,200
bubble bubble bubble in a and keep that

1301
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,400
that water cool

1302
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,799
but yeah

1303
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,559
you can be anywhere from

1304
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:25,359
64 i'll say to

1305
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:28,319
78 on the very high side of things um

1306
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:30,318
but i recommend again

1307
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:31,440
not a sterile system if you're doing

1308
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:33,519
this you're going to look you're going

1309
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,200
to want to do enzymes

1310
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:37,039
and and certain

1311
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:40,000
additives to your

1312
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:43,838
your grow because that

1313
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,079
these enzymes inhibit the ability for

1314
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:47,759
root rot and things to come into your

1315
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,280
your zone so

1316
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,800
that's important right you're not going

1317
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,559
to get the same yield if you're growing

1318
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,119
at 78 but you're not going to lose your

1319
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,240
plants to root rot there's a big

1320
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,480
difference there you're still going to

1321
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:01,118
have a yield and for some of us

1322
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,480
maybe your summer yield is is

1323
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,838
you don't have as big of a yield in the

1324
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,280
summer because it's hot and then you're

1325
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:08,480
going to rely on your bigger yields in

1326
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,960
the winter right so okay yeah that's

1327
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,679
actually my main concern the reason why

1328
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,159
i haven't done dwc is controlling water

1329
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:19,199
temp i mean my natural you know house is

1330
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,118
like 80 degrees so that's what my water

1331
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,960
temp would potentially be

1332
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,800
now when you get into the high temps you

1333
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,039
talked about you know root rot is one of

1334
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,880
the main things that people get when

1335
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,800
they're running into the high temps

1336
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,640
you mentioned enzymes as a way to kind

1337
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,480
of help deal with that is there anything

1338
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:36,480
else that you can use to deal with root

1339
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,240
rot i mean i think hydrogen peroxide is

1340
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,000
something i've heard in the past is that

1341
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:41,598
true or

1342
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,079
you know i i

1343
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,000
i think it's about

1344
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,359
not having a practice that doesn't allow

1345
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
it in the first place

1346
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:52,159
right and this is this is where

1347
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,760
uh you know we get into the conversation

1348
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,519
of why i just never went back to

1349
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,599
recirculating systems

1350
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:59,280
i was sure i was going to you know i

1351
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,039
made a recirculating system then i made

1352
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,599
a hydro bucket then i got the hydra

1353
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:05,599
buckets in my garden and i said i got to

1354
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,760
hook this these things up and i just

1355
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,200
never did i just put another tent and

1356
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,440
put more hydro buckets and then another

1357
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:13,439
10 to put more hydro buckets because

1358
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:18,240
the hydra bucket allows me to control

1359
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:19,920
temperature and not use a chiller 24 7.

1360
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:22,719
and and and and

1361
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,639
why that is is is that you add

1362
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:25,759
on the first day of the week

1363
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:27,519
and then

1364
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,319
you add in your

1365
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:32,159
ideal temperature of water right so this

1366
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:33,920
is different than a a recirculating

1367
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,159
system if you were to add 68 degree

1368
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,318
water in a recirculating system

1369
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:40,639
it's going to go up

1370
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,800
it's pumping water you have multiple you

1371
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:44,639
have one pump for sure and it's pumping

1372
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,000
through a heat exchanger essentially

1373
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:47,598
it's going through tubes that are in

1374
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,440
your hot environment

1375
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,318
and then it's going into your

1376
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,440
your

1377
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:53,039
vessels your

1378
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,800
your plant containers and then it's

1379
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:56,558
draining out a drain line back to your

1380
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,720
external reservoir

1381
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,760
where it's picked up heat it's done its

1382
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:01,759
job

1383
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,920
so people will need a chiller because

1384
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:07,280
that water cannot go down it cannot stay

1385
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,960
at the same temperature it has to go up

1386
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,319
so we'll start we go from 68 and we

1387
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:15,119
start going up

1388
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:17,039
with a hydro bucket and the single deep

1389
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,960
water culture grow environment

1390
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:22,000
you can sidestep that

1391
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,960
so you can start with 68 degree water in

1392
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,880
a single deep water culture hydro bucket

1393
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,559
and then

1394
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,640
in four days

1395
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,720
from when you first added your ideal

1396
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:34,639
solution

1397
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:37,118
your parameters have been getting out of

1398
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:40,078
out of check your your parts per million

1399
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,480
him getting out of check your your your

1400
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:45,039
ph and your temperature they all been

1401
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,280
sliding away from optimum but every four

1402
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:48,800
days you get to top it up with cold

1403
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,920
water

1404
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,000
so

1405
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,680
again you know it every four days we get

1406
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,800
to make it perfect

1407
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:56,639
you don't get to do that with a

1408
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,599
recirculating system you just have to

1409
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,799
make it

1410
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,640
good i mean you have to keep it ideal

1411
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,240
i you know they kick on and off but

1412
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,078
you're using more water and you're

1413
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,399
picking up more heat whereas a hydro

1414
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,039
bucket you're really not adding any heat

1415
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,559
in a in a in an individual

1416
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:16,800
container right and so this allows us to

1417
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,839
i i still have a chiller but i only use

1418
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,559
my chiller for an hour

1419
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:24,799
pre-mix just to get my temperature of my

1420
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,559
solution to where i want it and that's

1421
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,359
only for three months a year

1422
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,519
the rest of the year i use a heater

1423
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:34,558
because my water's too cold

1424
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:36,159
right so so if i was in a recirculating

1425
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,240
system though i'd be using my chiller

1426
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:39,519
all the time i would never i'd rarely

1427
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:41,118
use a heater

1428
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:42,960
i would i would always be using the

1429
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,480
chiller so that's just the difference

1430
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,760
it's it's trying to portray the

1431
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,760
difference of

1432
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,440
of getting your optimum

1433
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,559
temperature

1434
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,639
your optimum ph your optimum parts per

1435
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,400
million and then put it in your deep

1436
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:59,039
water culture environment

1437
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,599
and it's good for four days

1438
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:03,440
mix up some some nice cold water

1439
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,760
get it in there it's good for another

1440
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,599
four days right we don't need a chiller

1441
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,119
uh we may even be able to manage this of

1442
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,519
just cold water out of your tap depends

1443
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,440
where you live right so

1444
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:15,599
this always allows us to

1445
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,559
keep that temperature in check

1446
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,119
so

1447
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,079
gotcha let's get deeper into chiller

1448
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,920
because there was actually a lot of

1449
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,599
questions in regards to chillers can you

1450
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,358
talk to us about you know how many watts

1451
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,880
is a typical chiller i know it can get

1452
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:28,960
very expensive like you said if you're

1453
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,519
running a rdwc and you're running that

1454
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,280
chiller 24 7 well it can be pretty

1455
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,358
expensive there and it might not be

1456
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,280
worth it for you so how many watts is a

1457
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:38,799
typical chiller how much does it cost

1458
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,359
and how do you calculate the size of the

1459
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,359
water chill you need for your system

1460
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:45,838
right so

1461
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:46,719
a water chiller you need a water chiller

1462
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:49,119
if you're going to get a water chiller

1463
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:51,118
you need a chiller and you need a pump

1464
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,559
to circulate that chiller they don't

1465
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,640
come with their own pump so you need a

1466
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,079
secondary pump as well and that's i mean

1467
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,960
that's hydroponics there's pumps here

1468
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,318
and there especially if it's

1469
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,199
recirculating

1470
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:00,960
they're

1471
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:04,000
the ones here in canada they're based on

1472
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,000
horsepower uh but that equates what i'm

1473
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,079
looking at to you know anywhere from two

1474
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,519
to four hundred watts

1475
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,318
you know i think is what you're gonna

1476
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:14,559
you're gonna have for a water chiller so

1477
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:16,318
you know that's another light

1478
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:19,680
right you know if that's running on a

1479
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:21,199
regular basis to keep uh more fluid

1480
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:23,039
uh at a

1481
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:24,239
smaller temperature that's that that

1482
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,159
could be another light that could be

1483
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:26,959
another plant um

1484
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,039
so

1485
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,079
uh water chillers

1486
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,599
are

1487
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,000
necessary well i don't know if they're

1488
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,160
necessary water temperature control is

1489
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,239
necessary whether it's a heater or a

1490
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:40,159
water temperature but a lot of people

1491
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:43,279
think just because you say deep water

1492
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:45,199
culture that you must have uh a chiller

1493
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,800
right and and and it's going to be an

1494
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:48,960
additional cost and it's going to be all

1495
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,839
these additional things and that's where

1496
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,760
i say

1497
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:53,519
you know rethink

1498
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,400
individual deep water culture buckets

1499
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:57,759
because we get to turn that that that

1500
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,000
that chiller off

1501
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,760
we get to we get to save money in in a

1502
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,280
lot of ways when getting away from a

1503
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,000
recirculating system

1504
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,079
now with the chiller will nutrient salts

1505
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,440
impact the life of a chiller that's one

1506
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,400
of the viewer

1507
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,358
i i

1508
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,079
you know i i i think like anything

1509
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:18,239
whether it's your pony pump or your

1510
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,440
anything you want to flush everything

1511
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:21,439
out

1512
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,318
regardless right so

1513
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,159
um

1514
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:25,920
how you do that in a recirculating

1515
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:27,039
system yeah i mean

1516
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,119
um

1517
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:31,039
i would say if you want your chiller to

1518
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,599
last a long time

1519
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:36,159
uh you should probably disconnect it

1520
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,599
every once in a while uh and and clean

1521
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:39,920
it

1522
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:43,280
you know once or twice a week just to i

1523
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,280
i don't know yeah i don't know

1524
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:47,519
it's definitely not going to be

1525
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,440
great to have an internal

1526
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:50,880
system that never gets clean that has a

1527
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,200
stalled accumulation you're gonna have

1528
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,880
to do something okay and you mentioned

1529
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:56,639
the words flush i want to talk about

1530
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,039
flushing the plant at the end of the

1531
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:01,358
cycle so highly controversial topic for

1532
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:04,079
sure some people say you should flush

1533
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:05,920
your plants which is basically you know

1534
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,160
in a hydroponic system

1535
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,880
is you're you're removing the nutrient

1536
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:13,358
solution out of the system and just

1537
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,519
having plain water in there for a period

1538
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:17,358
of time whether it be five days some

1539
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:19,358
people say seven days some people say 14

1540
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:21,838
days what's your take on flushing do you

1541
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:23,838
recommend people to to flush at the end

1542
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:26,239
of their cycle yeah

1543
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:28,960
in my experience i've had the best

1544
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:30,879
results um in

1545
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,440
a well-rounded

1546
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,079
feeding program that ends

1547
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,798
with pure water

1548
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,599
so we can call that a flush

1549
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:41,358
or

1550
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,880
i think it's more important to put it

1551
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:44,480
this way

1552
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,960
if you were to just

1553
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,000
pound nutrients into a plant

1554
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:52,000
and then simply flush it for two weeks

1555
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,920
you're not going to get the same result

1556
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,760
as someone who

1557
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,960
fed it properly for the first three

1558
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,720
weeks

1559
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,280
transition to something that was more

1560
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:03,679
appropriate for the next three weeks

1561
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,599
and then for the final two weeks

1562
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:06,639
had another product

1563
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,280
and then

1564
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:12,719
for that last week

1565
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:15,119
went to just water

1566
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:18,480
that is that process

1567
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:20,400
is what gives a nice smooth clean

1568
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:24,000
product at the end

1569
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,880
with no bitterness or bad tastes or or

1570
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,599
anything like that

1571
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:32,160
it's not so simple as just a straight up

1572
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,318
flush at the end that's the magic trick

1573
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:36,798
in my opinion there are some things that

1574
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:39,119
i that that i can say about that time

1575
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:41,679
though which could confuse people

1576
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:44,079
or just just make it more uh just not

1577
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,558
clear is

1578
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,400
those last couple weeks if you're think

1579
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,680
about a tomato

1580
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,160
think about a a nectarine that gets to

1581
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:56,078
ripen on the tree that gets to ripen on

1582
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:58,639
the plant when you walk up to something

1583
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,880
and you pick it off and it's been ripe

1584
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:02,480
tree ripened and you pick it off and it

1585
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,880
doesn't have to ripen on the way it

1586
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,119
doesn't have to cure and ripe

1587
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,000
you know it's it's really got to stay on

1588
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,240
as long as possible

1589
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,440
[Music]

1590
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:13,598
there's something to be said with

1591
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,480
certain strains and how you grow in

1592
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:19,119
allowing your plant to mature when it's

1593
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,199
not under pressure you know it it it

1594
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,200
only can do what it can do at certain

1595
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:25,838
stages so pounding it with nutrients and

1596
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:28,199
then just giving it a flush at the end

1597
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:30,558
isn't isn't isn't going to do it

1598
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:32,558
[Music]

1599
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:35,839
you draw it out properly through all the

1600
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:39,519
the portions of it but then

1601
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:43,119
if you don't flush versus you flush

1602
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:45,280
for me it's more of a ripening process

1603
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:49,599
right you you you you could have that

1604
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:52,160
week or two um that that just creates um

1605
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:55,039
that speak people sp speak to a smoother

1606
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:56,798
flavor or this and that um i don't know

1607
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:58,558
flavor something that i was going to

1608
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:00,159
bring up next i mean there's some people

1609
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,079
who swear by

1610
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:04,639
growing in soil growing organically that

1611
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,640
the flavor is going to be much better

1612
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:08,239
than growing hydroponically you know and

1613
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:09,279
then there's hydroponic growers that say

1614
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:11,679
you're going to get the best flavor in

1615
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,440
the world growing hydroponics

1616
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:16,000
what's your take on that hydro flavor

1617
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,318
growing hydroponically the flavor versus

1618
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,079
growing in soil the flavor you get i

1619
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,880
wish i could

1620
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,640
experience both on a side-by-side basis

1621
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,760
because i love science and i love

1622
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:28,798
knowing

1623
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:31,839
the truth the truth that i do know is if

1624
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:33,679
you are hydro and you crush it

1625
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:35,440
you're gonna blow doors off people are

1626
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:37,358
gonna say wow that's amazing if you're

1627
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,440
in living soil and you crush it people

1628
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:41,920
are going to go wow that's amazing you

1629
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,079
know that that's what's going to happen

1630
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,480
in my personal experience

1631
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,599
when you're in living soil

1632
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,480
um

1633
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:52,720
you know i i've had some living soil uh

1634
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,838
uh

1635
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:56,639
stuff that

1636
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:58,400
has just been so flavorful and and such

1637
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,000
a great experience

1638
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,639
but and i think it translates when

1639
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,760
you're straight up after

1640
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:07,279
um

1641
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:10,160
you know not oils and stuff but uh

1642
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:12,319
you know organic product

1643
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:14,078
that's a nice way to grow but but

1644
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:16,079
there's

1645
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,480
there's also the components when you're

1646
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,680
talking about hydroponics you have full

1647
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,519
control

1648
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,039
right we're talking about a couple

1649
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:24,639
things where you know you got a couple

1650
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:26,798
topics there it happens leaving it to

1651
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:28,318
nature or taking full control or you

1652
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:30,480
know

1653
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:33,199
hydroponics we have full control so we

1654
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,119
can really make it do exactly what i

1655
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:37,439
want it to we can give it everything it

1656
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:39,200
needs this is what i like to say i like

1657
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,200
to give it everything it needs to give

1658
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:42,719
let it do what it wants to do at its

1659
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:44,318
full potential and that's kind of a

1660
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:47,679
similar

1661
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:50,480
you know mantra of of organic soil

1662
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:51,519
um what i do know for sure is we grow

1663
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,679
for

1664
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:56,159
what's on the organics

1665
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:58,078
not the organics we specifically have

1666
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:01,598
strains that are for

1667
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,839
uh washing that and so we know that the

1668
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:06,640
expression of what we do

1669
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:07,440
and what we create as our final product

1670
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:10,000
is

1671
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:12,880
fantastic and i'll put that up against

1672
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,199
anybody growing in anything

1673
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:18,240
that being said if someone has done

1674
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:20,318
their best to grow some amazing organic

1675
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:21,199
product for consumption

1676
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:23,519
um

1677
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:23,519
you know

1678
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:29,440
there may be something to make that

1679
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:34,159
better yeah in flower but i can't speak

1680
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:36,559
to it right i i i really think it's um

1681
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:39,358
it's a big conversation and i say it's

1682
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:42,079
about what works best for the individual

1683
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:44,639
for growing if if if you grow and you

1684
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,400
grow what grows well for you and and you

1685
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:47,199
have a good successful product in the

1686
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,960
end

1687
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:51,759
that's a success and it doesn't matter

1688
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:55,039
what what you used right and the top

1689
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,280
growers in the different categories are

1690
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:59,759
all going to have a wow product

1691
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,599
every one of them right so

1692
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,440
it really until the science comes out

1693
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:05,119
until i could

1694
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,079
have more information

1695
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,240
um

1696
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,680
you know i'm going to say

1697
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:11,118
grow it all

1698
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:13,440
well said

1699
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,599
so we have a lot of new folks that tune

1700
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,838
into my channel and they're either just

1701
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:20,720
starting out in dwc or they're about to

1702
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:23,119
start out in dwc what advice do you have

1703
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:24,480
for someone who is brand new to growing

1704
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,240
hydroponically

1705
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,440
don't be intimidated with it and do it

1706
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:31,759
um go out and get a single hydro bucket

1707
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,400
you know this is the thing is people

1708
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,000
people are intimidated by hydroponics

1709
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,798
rightfully so they think that they need

1710
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,960
a chiller they think they need a diy and

1711
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:42,159
a drill or they think they need pumps

1712
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,679
and pressure and they're going to flood

1713
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:46,078
their house there's so many things that

1714
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:47,199
turn people off hydroponics

1715
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,880
and then say

1716
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:50,719
or it's a price tag you know all those

1717
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,720
things disappear if you just have 1500

1718
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:55,358
bucks you could take roll into a fifteen

1719
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:57,358
hundred dollars and and it's real simple

1720
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:59,679
and you're gonna crush it so i tell

1721
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:02,239
people get the we have a product that

1722
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,159
allows you to just try hydroponics

1723
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:08,318
without a big bill right you can get

1724
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:10,960
into a hydro bucket net pot uh uh

1725
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:12,318
hydroton you know airstone air pump

1726
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,599
there's packages for under a hundred

1727
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:16,000
dollars you take it home and you get to

1728
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:18,480
just try deep water culture and why i

1729
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,519
say it's not for advanced growers it's

1730
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,679
for

1731
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:23,920
new growers is because it takes the

1732
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:25,598
grower out of the equation

1733
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,559
how many times have you ever over

1734
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:30,720
watered a plant or underwatered a plant

1735
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:33,839
when you grow in deep water culture

1736
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:37,358
that doesn't exist there's no watering

1737
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:39,759
you literally fill it up you mix it

1738
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:41,598
fill it up and it's good it has

1739
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,319
everything it needs that's why deep

1740
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:47,280
water culture grows so fast deep water

1741
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:49,599
culture will grow in vegetative state

1742
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,359
30 faster

1743
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,720
so that's a significant difference when

1744
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,318
you're talking about dollars and cents

1745
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:56,879
on large scales when you're talking

1746
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:58,960
about production is 30 faster is that an

1747
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,559
extra crop

1748
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,119
there's a lot of things that happen with

1749
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:04,640
uh uh with that but

1750
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,640
why i think deep waterculture works

1751
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:09,519
really really well for new growers is

1752
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:11,199
that you it's you get to mix it

1753
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:13,759
you get to put it in

1754
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:15,598
and then it just has what it needs

1755
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,520
you're not gonna water and you're going

1756
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,960
to have lifestyle as well that was a big

1757
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:21,119
thing for me you're going to be able to

1758
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,960
leave for a couple days and come back

1759
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,200
and your plants just sitting there

1760
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,720
growing and you can you can conveniently

1761
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:29,118
check the parts per million the

1762
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,558
temperature and the

1763
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,358
the

1764
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,559
uh

1765
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:35,038
ph

1766
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,960
and if it's good you're good for another

1767
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:40,160
couple days you just leave and when it

1768
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,760
comes back so it has everything it needs

1769
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:44,399
you are just there to give it what it

1770
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,680
needs and when you do that

1771
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,760
it goes

1772
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:49,118
crazy deep water culture grows like

1773
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,039
nothing else

1774
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:54,318
so you just have to manage yourself so

1775
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:57,599
just don't be intimidated just get a get

1776
01:03:54,318 --> 01:04:00,159
get your gear and try one plant

1777
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:02,240
i hear there's no going back

1778
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:03,838
great stuff for sure yeah you the way

1779
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:06,000
you said it there and what you've said

1780
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:08,400
so far within this episode i mean you

1781
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,079
you make me a little bit more confident

1782
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,400
to try it out you know what i mean like

1783
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,760
i mentioned that i did have concerns i

1784
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,760
think most of them have kind of been

1785
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,920
addressed at least the way you explain

1786
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:21,440
it with the hydro bucket in particular

1787
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,960
not running the rdwc with the reservoir

1788
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,920
and how it is can be a little bit more

1789
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,838
beneficial in some ways just doing dwc

1790
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,358
with the hydro buckets so i might have

1791
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:31,519
to give it a try just might have to do

1792
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:32,880
that so wrapping things up how can the

1793
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:34,960
listeners find you and what do you have

1794
