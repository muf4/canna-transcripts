1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
now i've gotten questions in the past

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,040
where growers ask does molasses

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,398
burn your plants or can it burn your

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,399
plants and the answer to that is

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,919
what's up everybody if you that don't

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,118
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,278
and welcome to my channel

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,439
let's talk about molasses particularly

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,879
incorporating molasses into your garden

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,480
i've been growing for a little over 10

11
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,559
years now and actually just started

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,118
incorporating molasses in my garden

13
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,879
about two years ago in molasses it's not

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:31,439
a nutrient that you're feeding your

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,960
plant

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,200
it's actually sugar that you're feeding

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,719
the soil specifically the microorganisms

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,600
that are living in the soil this video

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,800
isn't meant to be

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,480
everything there is to know about

21
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,558
molasses it's meant to give you a

22
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,078
general overview of how to incorporate

23
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,119
molasses into your garden

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,960
in this video i'm going to talk about

25
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,718
what is molasses talk about the

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,878
different types of molasses

27
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,239
sulfur versus unsulfured then i'll get

28
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,799
into the dosage

29
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,238
and when to feed molasses so first off

30
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,479
what is molasses

31
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,799
molasses is a dark substance that's made

32
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,759
during the sugar refinement process

33
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,359
sugar cane or sugar beet juice is boiled

34
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,438
down into a syrup

35
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,599
once the sugar crystals are extracted

36
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,639
the syrup that remains that's molasses

37
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,679
there are several different types of

38
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,079
molasses

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,520
they vary in both sweetness as well as

40
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,280
the way that they are extracted

41
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,118
not all types of molasses is actually

42
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,439
suitable for your garden some molasses

43
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,239
is

44
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,758
very low quality and contains additives

45
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,118
and preservatives that

46
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,478
you don't want in your garden if you're

47
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,118
going to incorporate molasses in your

48
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,118
garden

49
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,239
make sure it's organic molasses now

50
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:31,280
let's talk about the different types of

51
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,599
molasses

52
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,599
they range in color from lighter to

53
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,679
darker to blackstrap molasses

54
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,599
i personally use blackstrap molasses

55
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,000
it's denser and thicker than the other

56
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,359
types

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,118
the reason why that i use blackstrap

58
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,078
molasses is because it has the highest

59
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,040
concentration of

60
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,399
vitamins micro and macro elements i

61
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,000
actually have the type of molasses that

62
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,200
i use right here

63
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,438
organic blackstrap molasses unsulfured

64
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,640
and this contains calcium iron and

65
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,959
potassium as well

66
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,920
sulfur versus unsulfured like i just

67
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,239
mentioned i use

68
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,200
unsulfured molasses some molasses made

69
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,519
from sugar cane

70
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,399
can have sulfur dioxide added that's why

71
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,000
it's called sulfur

72
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,919
and the sulfur dioxide acts as a

73
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,878
preservative to keep it fresh

74
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,238
however it does have a negative effect

75
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:14,878
particularly when using it in your

76
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,039
garden

77
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,399
sulfur dioxide actually kills off the

78
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,919
microorganisms

79
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,680
in the soil and we don't want to kill

80
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,000
off the beneficial microorganisms in the

81
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,800
soil

82
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,239
we very much want to keep them alive so

83
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,200
if you are going to incorporate molasses

84
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,039
into your garden

85
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,759
make sure it's unsulfured and like i

86
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,000
said before organic now as far as dosage

87
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,120
there are various opinions on what the

88
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,800
dosage should be

89
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,878
i personally use one tablespoon of

90
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,760
molasses per gallon of water that's what

91
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,679
i've heard from

92
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,759
oakster dam university but i do know

93
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,239
growers that go on the lighter side

94
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,199
down as low as one teaspoon of molasses

95
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
per gallon of water

96
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,878
so somewhere in that range is fine now

97
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
i've gotten questions in the past where

98
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,840
growers ask

99
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,878
does molasses burn your plants or can it

100
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,959
burn your plants

101
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,799
and the answer to that is no because

102
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,920
again it's not a nutrient that your

103
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,360
plant is uptaking

104
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,199
it's a sugar that's being fed to the

105
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
microorganisms in the soil

106
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,799
now when you're mixing molasses into

107
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,560
water the thicker molasses can be

108
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,680
difficult to mix into the water

109
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,640
first of all make sure you're using

110
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,080
dechlorinated water ph the water

111
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,158
and then what i usually do is i'll take

112
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,400
out i'll scoop out about a pint of water

113
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,639
out of that gallon i actually put it

114
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,080
onto the stove and warm up that

115
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,919
not to the point of boiling but just a

116
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,840
little bit warmer then i'll mix in the

117
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,679
molasses to that warmed up water

118
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,039
and then i'll mix in that warmed up

119
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,959
water with molasses

120
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,400
into the remaining water so yeah warming

121
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,080
up the water a little bit just helps the

122
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,920
molasses mix in a little better

123
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
when should you feed molasses that's

124
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,079
another thing that there's various

125
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,680
opinions on

126
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,920
i've personally experienced defeating

127
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,799
molasses in different stages of growth

128
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,318
seedling stage veg stage i fed molasses

129
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,319
during those time periods

130
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,439
plants were happy but i feel like

131
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,518
flowering stage

132
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,359
is most beneficial this is just my

133
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,879
opinion i'm sure there are growers out

134
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,799
there that would disagree with me

135
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,560
really it's safe to use molasses at any

136
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,400
point of the grow some growers like to

137
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,479
flush their plant at the end of the grow

138
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
you can use molasses during that flush

139
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,878
period whether it be a one week flush

140
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,959
two week flush

141
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,318
or whatever i'd love to know do you use

142
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,479
molasses in your grow

143
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,238
if so when do you use it and at what

144
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,199
dosage let me know down in the comment

145
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,039
section below

146
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,639
for those of you brand new to growing i

147
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,358
did write a book specifically for

148
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,120
beginners

149
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,120
it's geared towards indoor growing and

150
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,519
coverage growing in soil and in coco

151

coir

152
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,478
i'll leave a link to where you can buy
