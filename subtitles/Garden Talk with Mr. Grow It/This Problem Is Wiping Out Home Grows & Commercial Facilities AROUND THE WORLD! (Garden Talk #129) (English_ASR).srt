00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,519
welcome to the Garden Talk podcast where

2
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:08,359
we interview Growers from all over the

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,079
world both beginners and experts seeking

4
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:12,000
to learn more about what they know about

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,638
gardening and how they do things in

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,920
their Garden what's up everybody for you

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,839
that don't know me my name is Chris aka

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,880
Mr Grow and you're tuned into the garden

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,278
Talk podcast this is episode number 129

10
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:26,239
in this episode I interview Dr TSA saldi

11
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:28,599
she is a chief science officer of Tumi

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,598
genomics and is an expert in molecular

13
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,759
biology with the focus on on RNA biology

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,719
within this episode she talks in detail

15
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,280
about a pathogen that has infected a

16
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,760
large percent of both commercial

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,920
facilities and hom gardeners around the

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:45,079
world everything from what the pathogen

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,719
is how it's transmitted its symptoms and

20
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,878
so much more if you want to see short

back welcome to the Garden Talk podcast

58
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,520
today I am joined with Dr tasa saldi how

59
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:14,079
you doing today I'm good how are you

60
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,680
doing pretty good thanks for coming on

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,519
to the podcast today today we're going

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
to get into an issue that's wiping out

63
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,319
commercial facilities around the world

64
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,079
73% of commercial facilities in the US

65
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,479
have been infected and just in

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,040
California alone 90% of cultivation

67
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,359
facilities research tested positive for

68
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,919
this viroid

69
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,879
what we're talking about today is hop

70
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,000
Lon vroid it's actually pretty scary you

71
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,120
know for a number of reasons which we're

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,680
going to get into in this episode but

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,200
first let's do an introduction can you

74
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,239
tell us a little bit about yourself and

75
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:47,759
how you got into gardening yes

76
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,158
absolutely so um my name is H tasa like

77
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,318
you said I am the chief science officer

78
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:54,878
of Tumi

79
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:58,280
genomics um so my background is in

80
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:01,759
molecular biology and um specifically in

81
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,199
a type of biology called RNA biology um

82
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:07,798
and what my background looks at is how

83
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:12,039
the the shape or the structure of

84
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:14,879
certain molecules can impact um cellular

85
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:18,759
metabolism and um so this is pretty on

86
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:22,719
point for um hopon vroid um because this

87
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:24,798
particular pathogen enacts its um

88
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,959
pathology based on its uh

89
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,239
three-dimensional shape or its secondary

90
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,438
structure um and so that's what I did by

91
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:36,000
graduate postdoc work on um so uh we

92
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:39,280
founded our company Tumi genomics a

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,919
little over four years ago and um we

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,560
moved into helping cultivators um

95
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:47,079
identify pathogens and um especially

96
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,799
this particular

97
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,120
pathogen um maybe about three years ago

98
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,040
um and basically we had somebody who was

99
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,000
running a nursery contact us and ask us

100
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,318
if we could help them identify this

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,239
particular pathogen um we were all

102
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,158
molecular biologists actually working on

103
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,878
um we started in cancer and then we

104
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,679
moved into covid um but we agreed you

105
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:12,199
know we could definitely help um

106
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,000
identify this as well um and once we

107
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:17,879
realized the breadth of this issue and

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,120
how critically you know um cultiv the

109
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,800
cultivation industry needed to have good

110
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,199
Diagnostics um more research to

111
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,360
understand this particular pathogen um

112
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,478
we kind of found our home as a company

113
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,240
and so um that's what we've been doing

114
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,599
for the last three years is um you know

115
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,079
research collaborations with Academia

116
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,639
with industry as well as developing um

117
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:44,680
you know reliable Diagnostics and even

118
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,280
some on-site testing to help cultivators

119
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,600
identify this thing um and and keep

120
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,758
their uh operations safe awesome so what

121
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,960
exactly is hopl and Vare break it down

122
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:58,479
for us and mention how does it differ

123
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,680
from other pathogens yes absolutely so

124
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,758
um hop plate and viroid and viroids in

125
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,879
general are um one of the strangest and

126
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,000
I would say most interesting organisms

127
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:13,199
if you can even call them organisms out

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,680
there so um most organisms contain um uh

129
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,360
well almost all of them except for

130
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,120
viroids contain an inside part which has

131
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,240
their information so that's like your

132
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,160
DNA or in viroids case it's RNA which is

133
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,000
a molecule very similar to DNA but on

134
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,120
the outside of that information is like

135
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,199
a coding that keeps the genetic

136
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,800
information or the DNA RNA safe um from

137
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,759
the outside environment um and that

138
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,160
outside coating is generally made of

139
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,960
proteins or fats or both um and that's

140
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,840
that's um the same if we're talking

141
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:47,918
about funguses bacteria or even viruses

142
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:50,038
they all have um a coding like that so

143
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,758
viroids are incredibly unique in the

144
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:54,038
sense that they basically say I don't

145
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,160
need any of that protection stuff and

146
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:59,918
they're just literally free floating

147
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,800
information so um when you think about

148
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,799
viroids it's much more helpful to think

149
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,199
of them like um like an inert molecule

150
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,918
or contamination at a crime scene

151
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,560
instead of like a living

152
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:16,159
organism um and they're incredibly

153
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,199
incredibly small um and this makes them

154
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,479
very very contagious um and very easy to

155
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,319
pass from plant to plant um they are

156
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,199
very specific to land plants so for the

157
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,720
most part except for a few kind of

158
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,199
outlying Publications viroids are

159
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,280
exclusive to plants so they can't hurt

160
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:38,160
people if you were to consume a vroid or

161
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,478
you know smoke something like a tobacco

162
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,639
cigarette or something like that with

163
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:44,240
vroid in it um but they can be

164
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,079
incredibly damaging to plant development

165
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,680
and especially plant flowers got it now

166
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,359
people are hearing the word vroid and

167
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,280
I'm sure there's uh quite a few people

168
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,280
out there like viroid you mean virus so

169
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,719
totally different and you kind of

170
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:59,239
explained it is there anything else to

171
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,919
be said in regards to the difference

172
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,478
between a virus and a thyroid yes

173
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:08,279
absolutely so because thyroids are so

174
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:10,800
incredibly uh simple they don't actually

175
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:13,918
have the ability to do any type of

176
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,319
metabolism or even information to code

177
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:19,758
for a metabolism that allows them to

178
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,080
replicate so viruses have a unique

179
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,560
biology to them um which is why we can

180
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,000
make things like antivirals for example

181
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,319
because they're targeting something that

182
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,038
is different in in viruses than in the

183
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,000
organisms that the viruses infect but

184
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:38,598
viroids are so incredibly simple that

185
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,439
they don't have um that unique biology

186
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:44,279
so everything that they do is hijacking

187
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,519
the biology of the plant which makes

188
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:49,478
them incredibly difficult to Target

189
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,680
because it's very difficult for the for

190
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:53,918
whatever we're targeting to

191
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,240
differentiate between um the vroid and

192
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:59,079
the plant's normal biology um and so

193
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,680
that's why as opposed to a lot of other

194
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,800
things um there aren't really any

195
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,840
effective treatments or you know

196
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,400
anything that would would specifically

197
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:11,638
Target the viroid um at least yet so

198
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:14,318
they're very difficult to treat because

199
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,720
of that wow and taking a step back and

200
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:21,080
looking at the big picture what's the

201
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:25,400
economic impact from this vroid outbreak

202
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:28,079
yes yeah so um it's huge um there's an

203
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:30,359
estimate that uh for cultivation

204
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,679
facilities um acoss the board there's

205
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,440
more than a $4 billion loss um annually

206
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,918
and that's you know those estimates are

207
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,360
just mostly what's going on in the

208
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:42,718
United States um we found at Tumi

209
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,240
genomics that this particular vroid is

210
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,720
present on pretty much every continent

211
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:52,120
um we've tested plant material from

212
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:55,040
Canada um Africa Asia Europe um and it's

213
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,519
it's pretty much everywhere um and like

214
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,399
you mentioned at the beginning it's in

215
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,039
70 to 80% of cultivation facilities

216
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:05,879
ities um and you know you can see up to

217
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:08,919
a 30% loss uh with plants when they are

218
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:12,439
infected with this which um you know

219
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:14,879
accounts to a huge amount of money and a

220
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,200
a pretty prevalent risk for every single

221
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:21,078
cultivator out there so um it's it's

222
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,040
truly a pandemic at this point um in the

223
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:26,519
industry that's incredible um mostly on

224
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,078
the homeg grow side of things I think a

225
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,959
lot of my audience is but we do have

226
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:32,239
folks that are in commercial facilities

227
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,799
for example but y I can only imagine

228
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,959
what the impact is on the homeg grow

229
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:38,958
side of things yes there is a lot of no

230
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,719
testing happening you know particularly

231
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,559
I know that we're going to get into how

232
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,079
it can be transmitted I know seeds is

233
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:49,119
one of them but um yeah it's got to be

234
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,239
widespread amongst so many folks and

235
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,879
they probably have it they don't even

236
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,039
know that they have it right yes

237
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,480
symptoms let's get into that next plants

238
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,719
that are infected with hopl and vroid

239
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,200
what are the symptoms that you can see

240
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,680
on the plant yes absolutely so HL en

241
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,000
vroid has U we call it what it's called

242
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:11,319
as plyopic which means that there are a

243
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,399
ton of different symptoms um and it it

244
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,079
basically affects every system um of the

245
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:21,360
plant so different things that you can

246
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:23,838
see um it affects uh the the growth of

247
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,278
the plant so you can see the uh stunting

248
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,760
of the plant it also can affect the

249
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:31,600
shape of how it grows so as opposed to

250
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,639
like a normal Al 45° angle of the

251
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,040
branches coming off that main stem when

252
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,480
plants are infected with hopl and vroid

253
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:41,439
the stems tend to come out more

254
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,039
horizontally um you can see uh leaf

255
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,240
chlorosis misshaping leaves sometimes

256
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,439
the leaves will

257
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,000
overlap um sometimes they'll look too

258
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,279
shiny or depending on you know the

259
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,679
Pacific specific cultivar you're looking

260
00:10:53,278 --> 00:11:00,559
at they can also um kind of turn a

261
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:02,958
little yellow or curled up um rooting is

262
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,479
another uh major issue for plants that

263
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,359
have hopl and vroid they tend to root

264
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:12,360
very slowly um and the root ball itself

265
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,639
is reduced in uh density um so if you're

266
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,519
you know if you if you plant a clone and

267
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,519
it's trying to root and it just taking

268
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,320
forever that's a really good sign that

269
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,200
that particular plant may be infected

270
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,320
with hopl and vroid um and then of

271
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,399
course it also affects the development

272
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,639
of flowers on plants and so the flowers

273
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,159
tend to be

274
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:36,159
underdeveloped um reduced in Mass um you

275
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:39,759
know reduced in in chemicals and things

276
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:43,240
like that and so um it it it kind of

277
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:46,159
takes down every system of the plant um

278
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,639
and it it it renders it you know

279
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,278
whatever whatever especially if you're

280
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,079
looking for medicinal properties from

281
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:54,519
that particular plant um those those uh

282
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:56,599
different chemicals are not being

283
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,399
produced and so the plant is not nearly

284
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,839
as useful from that standpoint wow so

285
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,639
hits the plant all over and yeah some of

286
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,600
those symptoms that you mentioned can be

287
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,759
done by other things right so you

288
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,200
mentioned like closis for example

289
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,200
there's a number of problems that happen

290
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,600
where you get yellowing leaves you know

291
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,360
hotblade virro is one of them Leaf

292
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,800
overlapping was an interesting one I

293
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,480
actually had a plant that had leaves

294
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,958
overlapping and I was like oh no pop PL

295
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,680
and vroid because I had learned that in

296
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,479
the past and so I actually got that

297
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,278
plant tested and it actually came up

298
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,199
negative so I was a little bit surprised

299
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,078
by that because I hadn't seen that in

300
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:35,000
any other cultiv ours that I had grown

301
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:37,759
but yeah the overlapping leaves was was

302
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,799
a really interesting one and then uh wow

303
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,919
root development slower smaller root

304
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:44,198
ball underdeveloped flowers stunning a

305
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,759
growth there just so many different

306
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:48,919
things that this vroid does to the plant

307
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:51,120
yes yeah but now I should mention that

308
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,278
um one of the trickiest and most

309
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,600
Insidious things about this particular

310
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,039
pathogen is that while all of those

311
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,839
symptoms are

312
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,559
possible um it's possible that either

313
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,760
only some or none will manifest in the

314
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,439
plant and so even if you're looking at a

315
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,159
plant and you're like oh this plant

316
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,680
looks great it looks super healthy

317
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:13,679
everything is fine um it's still

318
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,759
possible that um it's infected it's

319
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,198
definitely possible that it will appear

320
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,639
asymptomatic during the early stages of

321
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:22,319
growth and you're not going to notice

322
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:25,198
any changes until that plant goes grows

323
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,120
up into maturity and goes um into flower

324
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:30,319
and then often you'll see those symptoms

325
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,360
then and so it's important to understand

326
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,399
what the symptoms could be but it's also

327
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,120
important to realize that you may have

328
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,919
an infected plant and it it looks pretty

329
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,159
good and so the only way to be sure is

330
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,719
to get that test like you said so how

331
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,799
does hopl and vroid spread and what

332
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,000
measures can gardeners take to prevent

333
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:53,719
its transmission yes yes so hopl and

334
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,958
vroid like most viroids is spread um

335
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,600
primarily by mechanical means um so that

336
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:02,039
what this means for the most part is

337
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,440
it's spread most efficiently by us so if

338
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,919
you are trimming your plants for example

339
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,759
um and you uh take those scissors you

340
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,319
trim a plant and then you move to the

341
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:14,159
next Plant and you don't clean those

342
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,440
scissors first that um the sap from the

343
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:20,198
potentially infected plant can um infect

344
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,199
the non-infected plant and so that's

345
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:27,240
that's the most common way that hopl inv

346
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:29,479
vroid is spread um other potential ways

347
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,039
that it's spread um it can be spread

348
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,440
through the water so hopl and vroid can

349
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,719
Slough off of root cells or the root

350
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,120
cells Slough off and contain hopl and

351
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,160
vroid um there's a lot of HBL and vroid

352
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,839
and infected plants in the root tissue

353
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:47,360
and so if plants are sharing water like

354
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,880
if they're in a clonal tray or you're

355
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,159
doing some sort of flood and drain or

356
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,320
some system where plants are sharing

357
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:57,439
water you can uh transmit it like that

358
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,959
um it can also be transmitted through

359
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,920
seeds so there there's several studies

360
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:05,638
out now and we've also conducted a study

361
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:08,719
um showing that seed transmission of

362
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,399
this um in medicinal plants is somewhere

363
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,199
between uh 20% to

364
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,919
50% um it can also be transmitted in the

365
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:20,159
pollen to a smaller extent our our

366
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:23,000
numbers put at around 5% of the time if

367
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:26,120
a male is infected it can um cause the

368
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,120
seeds to be infected as well um and then

369
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,318
the final way the potential way is bugs

370
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,360
so this is research that's just coming

371
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:36,679
out of CSU um here in Colorado in Fort

372
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,919
Collins showing that there there are

373
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:42,159
bugs um I think their research was done

374
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:44,599
on aphids if I'm correct that um are

375
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:48,360
capable of transmitting hopl and virid

376
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,920
from plant to plant so um pretty much

377
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,680
the seeds water and anything that moves

378
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:56,039
plant sap from one plant to another is a

379
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,879
potential way that this thing can spread

380
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,439
uh through a facility or you know

381
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:03,360
between between plants in a in a home

382
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,480
situation so it's extremely easy to

383
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,360
spread yeah it is very it is very

384
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,720
contagious and it's it's very Insidious

385
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,159
because you can spread it and not notice

386
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,560
for several Generations like if you're

387
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,240
cloning a plant um sometimes you're not

388
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,278
going to see any symptoms until like you

389
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,680
know the second or third cloning and

390
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,240
then all of a sudden everything goes to

391
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,278
hell and you don't understand um yeah

392
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,079
and that that happened to us it we have

393
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:33,000
plants as well well and um before we

394
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,439
knew about this I think like everybody

395
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,240
else out there all of a sudden you know

396
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,639
the plants weren't weren't flowering

397
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,600
correctly they didn't look right and we

398
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,799
had no idea what was going on so it's it

399
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,639
happens all over from huge cultivation

400
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,679
facilities down to you know someone

401
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,919
who's who's growing at home wow and

402
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,399
that's where testing can be so important

403
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,479
and we're going to get into testing here

404
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,639
in a little bit but first I do want to

405
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:02,079
ask you how long can viroids survive for

406
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,439
yes yeah so um even though they don't

407
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,198
have that outside protective coat that I

408
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,679
was discussing they're actually

409
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:12,360
incredibly robust um the the shape of

410
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,880
viroids is it's a circle so it's like

411
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,399
closed at the end and it's kind of like

412
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,919
Velcro so you can think of it like a

413
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,600
velcro Circle that's smooshed onto

414
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:23,480
itself so it's more like a rod shape

415
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,719
than than some sort of free floating

416
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,360
like a noodle or something um and that

417
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,759
shape affords um a lot of stability so

418
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,119
studies right now show they only went

419
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,519
out to 24 hours but they're definitely

420
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,759
stable for 24 hours or more on most

421
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:42,759
common surfaces so that would be wood

422
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:48,000
plastic metal cloth whatever um they can

423
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:49,879
survive for uh up to 7 weeks in water so

424
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,519
um if you have water that's been sitting

425
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,280
around and you keep putting plants in it

426
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:57,319
that's um a potential spread there um

427
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:59,399
and they can last for um 3 months or

428
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:01,480
more in dried up plant material material

429
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,679
so it's really important that if plant

430
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,159
material falls on the ground or you get

431
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,000
sap on something that you're cleaning

432
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:10,240
that up right away um and then in seeds

433
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
we've we've tested seeds at this point

434
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,759
that were more than 2 years old um and

435
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,839
it does it does tend to decrease in

436
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:21,240
frequency of a of a Seedling that's

437
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:23,399
infected over time but you can still you

438
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,038
can still transmit it in the seed for a

439
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,360
long time years so it's very stable

440
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,158
incredible yeah I actually listened to

441
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:32,038
one year talks actually a couple of your

442
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:33,720
talks at Utah State University when I

443
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:36,519
attended there for cultivation

444
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,679
certificate that I have and um I took

445
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:41,319
notes on your talks and uh yeah you

446
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,320
nailed it on there a couple other things

447
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:45,759
you mentioned there was uh greater than

448
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,200
90 days in fermented compost and then

449
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,839
you also mentioned several months in

450
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:54,038
soil or growing medium yes yeah wow yeah

451
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,759
Y and it's part of the the hardest part

452
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:58,480
about soil is that HP and viid is

453
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,359
incredibly High concentration in the

454
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,558
roof and so when you're removing plants

455
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,639
from soil it's really difficult to not

456
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:09,279
leave some root material behind and so

457
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,120
um that's that's one of the hardest

458
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,960
things about growing in soil is is that

459
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,719
you it's difficult to remove those

460
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,600
infections once they once they've

461
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,519
established in there now are there any

462
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:24,319
plant species or cultivars that are more

463
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:28,240
susceptible to infection yes yes so hopl

464
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:30,639
and vroid um so in the wild so in nature

465
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,839
it has a pretty narrow Host range

466
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,880
compared to most other viroids um it's

467
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:39,158
uh infectious obviously in hops that's

468
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,039
where the name came from um it can also

469
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:47,520
infect stinging nettle and it can infect

470
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:50,038
um Industrial Hemp so um in lab settings

471
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,279
they've shown that they can also infect

472
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:57,319
uh things like uh pea plants and tomato

473
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:59,079
plants there is yet to be any um uh

474
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:01,319
literature showing that that's happening

475
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:04,599
out in nature but it is a

476
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:08,038
possibility um we also just completed a

477
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:11,359
study um looking at the susceptibility

478
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:13,440
of different cultivars to hopl and vroid

479
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,918
um and what we found was it was pretty

480
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,360
interesting there's some cultivars that

481
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,880
are incredibly sensitive so they're very

482
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:23,639
easy to infect they have really

483
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,559
pronounced symptoms um and there's a

484
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,799
huge amount of yield loss when they're

485
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,359
infected um there's also a battery of

486
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:32,960
cultivars that are what we call

487
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,240
resistant which means they were

488
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,558
difficult to infect the vroid didn't um

489
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,359
rise to a very high concentration until

490
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:44,879
like the very end of the plant's uh life

491
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:48,000
cycle or or when it's like finishing

492
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,320
flowering um and then there was a few

493
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,079
outliers um which I honestly find

494
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,759
slightly scary that were tolerant um so

495
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:59,079
there these were plants where they had

496
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:01,558
an incredibly high level of infection um

497
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:03,759
super easy to infect spread very quickly

498
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:07,639
but the plants didn't show any obvious

499
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:09,798
symptoms and there was no yield loss so

500
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,440
um it's great I mean it's wonderful to

501
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:14,000
have those plants because then you don't

502
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,720
notice any problems but they also are

503
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,400
basically a trojan horse so you might

504
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,798
think everything's great CU that plant

505
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,360
doesn't have any symptoms but then it

506
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:25,119
spreads it um to everything else so um

507
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:29,158
it it can go all over the map depending

508
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:30,278
on cultivar geez now in regards to test

509
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,039
what are the current methods for

510
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:35,159
diagnosing HL viroid infection in plants

511
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,798
and are there any advancements in the

512
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:42,080
detection technology yes absolutely so

513
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:44,639
um so the first important point about H

514
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:47,439
virid and viroids in general is because

515
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,159
they are only that genetic information

516
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,038
the only type of test that is capable of

517
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,919
detecting them is um basically a

518
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,240
molecular test if people were used to

519
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:58,120
thinking about covid there was the

520
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,839
antigen test and the molecular test

521
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:04,959
which was the PCR so for viroids it has

522
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:08,599
to be one of those molecular tests um

523
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,038
and the major the two major types of of

524
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:11,918
tests that are out there right now

525
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,879
there's a few exceptions to this but the

526
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:18,159
two U tests that you're most likely to

527
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:21,360
run into are what's called a PCR test or

528
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:24,919
um an isothermal amplification or a lamp

529
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,798
test um so uh both of these tests the

530
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:29,120
way that they work is they they find the

531
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:32,359
vroid in a tube

532
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:35,879
and um once it's identified the test

533
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:37,879
creates a ton of copies of the viroid so

534
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,640
if you if your there's two copies in the

535
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,120
tube what the test will do is make four

536
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:46,080
copies then eight copies then 16 then 32

537
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:48,199
and on and on and so at the end of that

538
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:51,798
uh copying you can have billions of

539
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,600
copies and then it's easy to detect um

540
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:56,278
the difference so they both do that PCR

541
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,839
and lamp the difference between those

542
00:22:56,278 --> 00:23:02,119
two is that PCR um is a much more High

543
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,480
complexity test it requires very

544
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:07,038
expensive equipment that can cycle in

545
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,319
temperatures and it generally require

546
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:13,679
specialized expertise to understand the

547
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,918
results um lamp tests on the other hand

548
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,480
are much simpler they all run at a

549
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,679
single temperature and so that type of

550
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,679
test or isothermal amplification is

551
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:28,960
really appropriate for like a onsite or

552
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:31,919
an at home type of test um currently uh

553
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,440
PCR tends to be more sensitive more

554
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:39,120
accurate more reliable um and lamp tests

555
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,480
um Can often throw false positives false

556
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,199
negatives um you know and and a lot of

557
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,880
them don't contain an internal control

558
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,240
which means that you you can't tell the

559
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,240
difference between a failed result and a

560
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,839
negative result um

561
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,720
so what we've been working on at Tumi

562
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:58,798
genomics is kind of addressing that

563
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,440
particular issue um because what we what

564
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,519
we've been working on is trying to give

565
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,798
an option to uh you know people that

566
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:09,480
want something at home or on site that

567
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,720
can allow them to find the vroid in

568
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,880
their plants um but with a test that has

569
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,558
the type of accuracy and sensitivity

570
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,880
that you would need to be competent um

571
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,759
so one of the things that we just

572
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,320
launched at Tumi genomics is an onsite

573
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:27,319
testing platform called Tumi glow so

574
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:29,359
it's based onpo isothermal amplification

575
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:31,599
but um what we've able to do with that

576
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,759
particular test is increase the

577
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:36,798
sensitivity to the same range as the PCR

578
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:40,240
um the accuracy to the same range is the

579
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:42,119
PCR and it include an internal control

580
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,558
so um if you can tell the difference

581
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:47,158
between the test is negative and I

582
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:50,440
forgot to put plant tissue in the tube

583
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:52,520
or something like that so um yeah we're

584
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,720
really excited about about releasing

585
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:56,079
that or or having people uh look into

586
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,839
that because I think this can be a very

587
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,918
powerful tool in fighting back against

588
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,918
this path

589
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,240
that's awesome sounds convenient for the

590
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:04,360
average hom grower to get testing done

591
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,278
now like I mentioned earlier in the

592
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,319
podcast I actually got a test done on

593
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:10,519
one of my plants and I like to walk

594
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,798
through the testing process with you if

595
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:16,200
you don't mind sure so if I remember

596
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:18,398
correctly this was last year I had to

597
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,600
take Leaf samples off of I believe two

598
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:23,000
or three parts of the plant assume I

599
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,798
think it was top and bottom maybe middle

600
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,798
and also I had to take a sample of the

601
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,319
route as well and then send in for

602
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:32,440
testing can you kind of walk us through

603
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:34,678
that is that just for PCR or is that for

604
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,519
the isothermal test or what's the

605
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:40,519
testing process what would a hom grower

606
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:44,319
do to submit in a test yes absolutely so

607
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:47,158
um so uh to submit a test at least with

608
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:49,000
Tumi genomics um so we have specialized

609
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:51,120
collection tubes that we mail out to

610
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,319
people um the reason we do this is

611
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:56,319
because those tubes contain um a a

612
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,839
buffer in there that stabilizes the

613
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:59,398
sample so we don't have to worry about

614
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,158
stuff to grading it doesn't have to be

615
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:05,319
sent on Ice nothing like that um when

616
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,278
people are collecting samples so we used

617
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:08,960
to actually request that people collect

618
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,038
some samples from the foliage and

619
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,159
samples from the root but we've recently

620
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:17,519
switched to just requesting root um the

621
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,720
reason this is is that we've done um a

622
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,278
pretty comprehensive study that was then

623
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,720
confirmed by a bunch of different groups

624
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:26,839
that the most reliable and accurate

625
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,120
tissue to detect this particular

626
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:31,879
pathogen is in the roof

627
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:34,158
so um in the foliage if you're looking

628
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,480
for hopl and vroid you have a somewhere

629
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,880
between a 12 to 60% success rate

630
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,960
something like that um in The Roots at

631
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,679
least in our studies and what it appears

632
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,240
to be in the other studies is that um

633
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,880
it's close to 100% if a plant is

634
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,839
infected you're going to find it in the

635
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,200
root first it has the highest level um

636
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:57,639
and it's the most reliable spot so um

637
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,600
when people are uh testing it with the

638
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,960
PCR um they'll take root tissue put it

639
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:04,398
in a tube close it shake it up and

640
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,880
that's all they have to do they'll mail

641
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:09,599
it back to us um we can run the PCR in

642
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,640
the lab and then send them results um

643
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:15,359
for our on-site test it's exactly the

644
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,520
same we require root tissue for hopl and

645
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,000
vroid specifically you put it in the

646
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,720
tube close it Shake It Up um and then

647
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,200
you take some of that liquid out put it

648
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,839
in the reaction yourself let it sit in a

649
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:30,360
heat block um for some time and then you

650
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:32,879
know look at the look at the tubes and

651
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:34,839
um if you if it's positive the tube will

652
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,600
glow red to Yellow somewhere in that

653
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:38,879
range either red orange or yellow

654
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:40,599
depending on the the vroid load with

655
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,320
negative it'll glow green and if the

656
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:45,519
test didn't work it just won't glow at

657
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:47,839
all um so for both situations we focus

658
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,640
on root tissue because that's um your

659
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,599
best chance of catching it if the plant

660
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:56,200
is infected okay and then what's the

661
00:27:51,599 --> 00:28:00,278
cost for testing yes yeah so um right

662
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:03,640
now for the PCR test um for the uh the

663
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:05,319
cost is $25 a test um we do have bulk

664
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,559
pricing if people want to get a bunch of

665
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:11,240
tests but the base cost is

666
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:14,599
25 um for the at home test those start

667
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,240
at 18 but come down very quickly um you

668
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:20,278
know if you buy uh multiple tests or or

669
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,919
buy in bulk so um yeah it just kind of

670
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:23,278
depends on which of those two options

671
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,960
you like better but those are the

672
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:29,038
pricing for those okay yeah 25 bucks

673
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,798
isn't bad I actually the other company I

674
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,919
went through was doubl in the price so

675
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:36,679
I'm GNA have to go through you for now

676
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:39,120
hunt so that's yes Tumi genomics. and

677
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,000
then you can c order tests I'm looking

678
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,518
at it right now do you do any tests for

679
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,960
anything besides hop lighton byid yes we

680
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,000
do we do we test um we also test for

681
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,840
ferium all the pathogenic forms of

682
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
ferium in medicinal plants as well as

683
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,639
the pathogenic forms of pythium in

684
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,079
medicinal plants and so those are root

685
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,960
pathogens that um quite honestly can be

686
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:03,278
just as damaging and in the case of

687
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,360
ferium perhaps even more damaging than

688
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:08,798
hop PL and vroid um and if you have if

689
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:12,719
you're growing indoors then those three

690
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:15,599
are the most likely 99% of all of your

691
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,600
pathogen issues um so we have we also

692
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,398
have tests that you can order one test

693
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,839
and it'll test for all three of those at

694
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:24,518
once which if you're if you're bringing

695
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,558
in a plant um you know whether it's you

696
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:28,720
whether you have a facility or you're

697
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,119
you grow things at home it's really

698
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,360
important to test and make sure that

699
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:33,879
it's not infected because the you know

700
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:35,879
the amount of time you're going to spend

701
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,640
you know months and all this material in

702
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,880
your personal time growing it um and

703
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,640
then to have it you know dieye a ferium

704
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,440
or or not produce well because of hot

705
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,720
plant um it's absolutely worth getting

706
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,480
tested um we do off also offer a whole

707
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:56,278
battery of viruses those that are known

708
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,038
to infect um uh medicinal plants those

709
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:00,599
are much more common if you're GR

710
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:03,079
growing outside so if you have a big

711
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,879
buck issue or you're growing you know

712
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:06,678
even in your backyard or something like

713
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,840
that then those are are significantly

714
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:12,360
more common because they're spread by uh

715
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:15,558
insects um and then we can also test

716
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:17,798
water growing medium and air so if

717
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:19,759
you're having an issue like if you have

718
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:21,278
a facility and you you have some sort of

719
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,158
fungal issues and you think that it

720
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,359
could be in your water we can help you

721
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,159
with that as well or in in cocoa or

722
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,359
growing medium or however you're growing

723
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,559
it um so the in lab we have a whole

724
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,000
bunch of different things that we can

725
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:34,879
help you with okay awesome good to know

726
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,640
now talking about strategies for

727
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,919
managing or controlling hopl and vroid

728
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,480
right so it's infected a plant what do

729
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,600
you do from there yes yeah so um

730
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,240
unfortunately in the case of hopl and

731
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:51,240
vroid there is no um cure there's

732
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,079
nothing you can spray on the outside of

733
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:57,519
the plant um to like make it go away or

734
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:59,960
fix it or suppress it um if you have a

735
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:05,079
plant that is highly infected your two

736
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:07,360
options are to either um toss it or to

737
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:10,480
submit it for a process called uh tissue

738
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:12,119
culture um which basically means that um

739
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,759
they clean up the plant by putting it

740
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:17,959
through a series of you know um tissue

741
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:21,519
culture steps um tissue culture does

742
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,639
work not 100% it doesn't work on every

743
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,399
single cultivar and it's a very

744
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:28,000
difficult procedure so um I know that

745
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:29,678
there are you know at home tissue

746
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,880
culture kits and things like that this

747
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,278
is probably not one of those situations

748
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:39,559
where um you'd be able to do this at

749
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:41,038
home um the best way to prevent it uh or

750
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:43,158
the best way to deal with it is to

751
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,839
prevent it allog together um and that

752
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:48,679
just involves not being afraid of it per

753
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:50,879
se but being aware that it that it's out

754
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:52,880
there and that there are certain steps

755
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,840
that you need to take to keep it from

756
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,200
entering into your facility or your home

757
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,119
or spreading from plant to plant

758
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,480
honestly this is one of the things that

759
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:05,638
really prompted me to clean my trimmers

760
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,599
every time between plants you know and I

761
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:09,158
was doing it a handful of time you know

762
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,678
now and then you hear about it you hear

763
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:12,679
it's the best practice going to prevent

764
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:15,000
pathogens and virus from spreading and

765
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:17,200
so on and so forth but you know as a

766
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,079
homeg grower you just go plant to plant

767
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,080
trimming doing your your your training

768
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:23,319
high stress training or defoliation or

769
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:25,240
whatever and using trimmers and not

770
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:28,240
cleaning them from plant to plant but

771
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,038
now knowing that the H vroid is present

772
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,440
cleaning the trimmers between every

773
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:35,119
single plant is something that I've been

774
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,200
doing religiously now yes and uh very

775
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:39,398
important yeah just to confirm what you

776
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,240
should be using for a solution now some

777
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:42,678
people say Okay isop Purple alcohol

778
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,679
that's going to be good enough other

779
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:47,840
people say no isop pural alcohol isn't

780
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,240
going to kill off the vroid you want to

781
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:53,000
use a bleach cleaning solution instead

782
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,240
and dilute it at a one to 10 one part

783
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,880
bleach 10 parts water what's your

784
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,798
recommendation for that yes absolutely

785
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,159
so um when we're talking about viroids

786
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:06,000
isopropyl alcohol or any alcohol is

787
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:08,480
probably the worst thing that you can do

788
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,079
um so it's not effective at all in

789
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,120
killing viroids and it actually um

790
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:15,480
alcohol is one of the things we use to

791
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:18,518
stabilize uh free floating genetic

792
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,798
information in the lab and so um it

793
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:22,759
actually increases the transmission of

794
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,960
the vroid from plant to plant if you use

795
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:28,638
alcohol so um when they they did these

796
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,919
studies um in I believe it was tomato

797
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:32,638
plants with a vroid and they showed that

798
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,120
if you do nothing absolutely nothing

799
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:37,079
there's a 75% chance if you don't clean

800
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,359
those scissors of spreading it if you

801
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:41,278
dip the scissors in isopropyl and then

802
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:45,278
cut the plant it goes up to

803
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:47,759
95% so um just throw the isopropyl

804
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:50,919
out use it for something else because

805
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:54,158
it's um it's not a good idea for viroids

806
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:56,038
and to be totally honest it's not 100%

807
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:00,080
effective on bacteria or fungal

808
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:01,919
pathogens either um um so you're exactly

809
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,319
right if you're trying to limit the

810
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,159
spread bleach is incredibly effective um

811
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:08,838
and that's that 10% solution that you

812
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:12,559
were talking about which is one part

813
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:14,279
bleach nine Parts water um when you are

814
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,918
going to get bleach you want to grab

815
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,359
that bleach bottle from the Super

816
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,679
Walmart or whatever and make sure that

817
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:22,639
it has 6% of sodium hypochloride or

818
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,599
higher so that would be the active

819
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,919
ingredient um and then when you get that

820
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,079
bottle home put a date on it and at 6 6

821
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,118
months uh you should toss it and get

822
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:36,079
another one because the activity will go

823
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:38,519
down over time um It's very effective at

824
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,839
killing vroid so all you need is 60

825
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:42,679
seconds um it's probably less but we

826
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:44,799
recommend 60 in case there's like goo

827
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,800
and stuff on the scissors that it just

828
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,800
needs to sit in there um and then the

829
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,200
viid is completely

830
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,440
deactivated um usually I recommend if

831
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,598
you're trimming a bunch of plants just

832
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,119
have several pairs of scissors you can

833
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,240
just grab one the others are in the

834
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,920
bleach when you're done with one plant

835
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:01,919
you put it in the back then you grab the

836
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,320
next one in the front um and so you're

837
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,200
always you always have a supply of

838
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,760
scissors that are clean um it it is kind

839
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:10,358
of CTIC on your cutting tools so if

840
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,280
you're concerned about them or they're

841
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,279
very valuable to you put them in there

842
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,280
for 60 seconds and then move them into

843
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,000
like a a cup of water tap water is fine

844
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,320
um that will that will keep them from

845
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,119
rusting very good info I appreciate you

846
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,160
sharing that with us yes absolutely now

847
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,599
you mentioned earlier it can last up to

848
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,039
seven weeks in water and IV Vision those

849
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:33,400
folks that are doing deep water culture

850
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,279
for example like a recirculating system

851
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,358
so hypothetically right if one of their

852
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,000
plants has up plade vroid it's in the

853
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:43,400
roots it gets dispersed into the water

854
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,760
all the plants are kind of being

855
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,920
infected there are there any best

856
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,400
practices in regards to like changing

857
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,119
out the reservoir or is it pretty much

858
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,440
like almost immediate and there's no

859
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,160
kind of getting around it as far as

860
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,358
infecting the plant via the water in a

861
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:01,679
deep water culture system

862
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:04,119
yeah so um there's no way to stop the

863
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,039
virid from sluffing off the root tissue

864
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,838
and then entering into the water and

865
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:10,719
like you said it's very stable in the

866
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,039
water um the amount that is going to

867
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,039
come off those roots is going to be

868
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:17,400
really dependent on how infected that

869
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:18,838
plant is so if it's a lowlevel infection

870
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,880
then obviously your risk to the other

871
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:23,119
plants is lower if the plant that is

872
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,079
sing off hbling thyroid is basically on

873
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,160
fire with thyroid then um a massive

874
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,200
amount is going into that water and your

875
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,318
chances of infecting the other plants is

876
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:36,759
much much higher um recirculating

877
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:39,559
systems deep water culture that's very

878
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,680
difficult and honestly if you're growing

879
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:43,358
that way the the best way to protect

880
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,519
yourself is to just make sure that any

881
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:48,639
plant you put in that system you test

882
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,838
first um that it's negative for hop

883
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,598
latent and honestly um pythium and

884
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:56,880
ferium as well which also spread

885
00:36:53,599 --> 00:37:00,519
incredibly easily in water pythium is a

886
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,160
water mold it loves the water so um it

887
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:05,039
on those types of systems prevention is

888
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:07,118
critical I mean it's critical for

889
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,199
everybody but for for those types of

890
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,960
things it's even more important that you

891
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:14,879
test first okay so I got to ask what are

892
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,400
commercial facilities doing about this

893
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,079
right so they they have an effective

894
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,519
plan are they just killing off that

895
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,960
plant and all their plants and starting

896
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:23,159
fresh are there some commercial

897
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,440
facilities that are continuing to grow

898
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,519
out the plant because you said you know

899
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,838
there is a reduction in yield but

900
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:32,800
they'll still be able to get to harvest

901
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:35,199
and it doesn't harm the consumer you had

902
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,318
mentioned earlier it's like there's no

903
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:38,078
you know when you're consuming it when

904
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:40,920
you're smoking or whatever it's not

905
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,440
being transmitted to a human for example

906
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,400
so our commercial facilities are they

907
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,159
killing off plant population and trying

908
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,440
to keep their facilities clean or you

909
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,639
finding some facilities are actually

910
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,559
just like oh well okay let me segregate

911
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,440
this plant to a different room let me

912
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,078
continue to grow it out and then I just

913
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,079
won't keep any of the Clones off of

914
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,280
these plants yeah so that's a great

915
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,440
question and the answer is it's kind of

916
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:06,280
all over the map um and part of this is

917
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,838
because there aren't clear regulations

918
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,200
for cultivation facilities on how to

919
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:16,119
handle this kind of thing um you know or

920
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:18,799
or guidelines either and so um we work

921
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,880
with some facilities that are incredibly

922
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,200
diligent about testing everything gets

923
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,960
tested every mother you know just very

924
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:29,000
very on top of it all the way to

925
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:32,440
facilities that don't to test it all um

926
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,719
and just aren't concerned with it um if

927
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,800
you if there's a cultivation facility

928
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:39,598
where plants are identified that have

929
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,079
hopl and vroid um we have helped these

930
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,920
facilities deal with this issue without

931
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:48,119
having to basically you know blowtorch

932
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:51,119
everything and start over um and so the

933
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:54,160
the best way to deal with this is to um

934
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,318
consolidate your genetic Library so that

935
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:59,118
um you have two to three plants of each

936
00:38:56,318 --> 00:39:01,079
cultivar um um and you segregate those

937
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,079
plants into a different space in the

938
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,760
facility which we call like the Garden

939
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:09,599
of Eden or your like nuclear stock um

940
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,520
and those plants are tested religiously

941
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,680
and protected from the rest of the

942
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:17,599
facility so um what you can do is slowly

943
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:19,639
move plants from your genetic library

944
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,119
that are clean into this special Garden

945
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:24,358
of Eden while you continue your

946
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:27,519
operations Downstream and some of those

947
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:29,960
plants may be infected um but you

948
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:32,559
basically kind of let them fall off the

949
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,280
end and go into flower and you're slowly

950
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,239
building up this genetic Library um and

951
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,800
eventually all the plant material will

952
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:41,519
come from this Garden of Eden and um it

953
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,359
will start clean and hopefully stay

954
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:46,000
clean through the entire process um

955
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:47,440
there are definitely facilities that

956
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,559
they don't have a choice they have to

957
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,480
flower the sick plants because they have

958
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:54,719
quotas to meet and it's a business and

959
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:57,599
they have money to make um but a lot of

960
00:39:54,719 --> 00:40:00,239
times you know if you you

961
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,920
you know getting like lower quality type

962
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:06,719
stuff it's probably infected um because

963
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,680
it's it's incredibly common so that's

964
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,399
that's what if you if it's you know the

965
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:12,078
lower quality kinds of things it's

966
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,318
probably because it's infected with hopl

967
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,359
and virid okay and then on the homeg

968
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:18,239
grow side of things would there be any

969
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:19,598
different advice like what advice would

970
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,039
you have for those gardeners who receive

971
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:25,240
a positive test for hot PL envid on one

972
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:27,358
of their plants in their Garden yes so

973
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:29,078
from a homeg grower perspective because

974
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,318
because tissue culture is so expensive

975
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:35,039
and extensive um I would just get rid of

976
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:38,199
it it's not worth your time or your

977
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,239
money to grow that plant um and we we

978
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:41,679
did do a little experiment ourselves

979
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:44,598
where we just went out and bought a

980
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:46,960
bunch of clones and um just to see what

981
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:50,640
you know what we would get um from a

982
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,559
from different spots and um pretty much

983
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:55,639
every single one of them was infected

984
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,039
with something um now granted we were we

985
00:40:55,639 --> 00:41:00,598
were probably picking ones that didn't

986
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:03,039
look terribly happy but um if I would

987
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:05,400
definitely when you bring in any type of

988
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,279
new material test it right away

989
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,680
quarantine it don't plop it right next

990
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,280
to your favorite plants or your favorite

991
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,440
strains or cultivars test it first in a

992
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,720
separate area um if it comes back

993
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,480
positive just go back to where you

994
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,399
bought it and say hey plant is sick with

995
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,480
something I you know give me another one

996
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,680
or my money back or whatever um but

997
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,880
whatever you do do not start growing

998
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,159
that uh with the rest of your plants

999
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,838
don't start sharing tools and water or

1000
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:35,679
whatever until you confirm that it is

1001
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:38,239
negative um and just to be incredibly

1002
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:41,759
safe I would try to get two negative

1003
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:43,479
tests um two to 3 weeks apart 3 to four

1004
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,079
weeks apart some are in that range just

1005
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,000
to make sure that um they didn't have a

1006
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,440
low level infection in the

1007
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,880
beginning it's just not worth growing it

1008
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,960
if you calculate the amount of money it

1009
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,760
takes to grow up a plant your time and

1010
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,720
and the lights and the electricity and

1011
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,000
the nutrients and then what you have to

1012
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:01,838
do if it fails you know and and and

1013
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,358
doesn't produce any any you know

1014
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:07,400
medicinal properties then it's just not

1015
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:09,440
worth the money to not test got it and I

1016
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,280
should asked this earlier when we were

1017
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,880
talking about testing but are you able

1018
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,640
to test seeds yes yes we can we can test

1019
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:22,119
seeds as well um and seeds are an

1020
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:24,519
interesting thing because um the the the

1021
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:28,760
flower of the plant tends to have one of

1022
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:30,679
the highest levels of vroid and so um if

1023
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,640
you have a package of seeds you don't

1024
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:34,759
have to test you know all of them it's

1025
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:37,279
you know because sometimes they're

1026
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,079
pretty expensive for one package so one

1027
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,559
seed from that package um is sufficient

1028
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,280
for us to determine whether or not they

1029
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:47,000
were they came from a mother or a father

1030
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,920
that had hop PL and thyroid um but I

1031
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,599
would I would definitely test uh your

1032
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,039
seeds as well because that's another way

1033
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:54,440
that it can get into your your garden

1034
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:55,920
great to know is there anything else

1035
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:00,720
that we need to know about hopl and

1036
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:03,680
vroid um you know I would say just that

1037
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:06,000
um I think there's a lot of fear out

1038
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,759
there right now in the industry about

1039
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,199
this particular pathogen um and it's

1040
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:14,280
important to know that um this isn't

1041
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:17,879
something that people need to be afraid

1042
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:20,640
of um this is just something that people

1043
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,440
need to educate themselves on understand

1044
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:26,679
how it works um understand how it's

1045
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:29,800
spread understand how to prevent it um

1046
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:31,199
and then just put those uh systems into

1047
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,440
practice you know make sure you're

1048
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,919
keeping everything sterile and clean

1049
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,119
don't let anything into your garden

1050
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,240
unless you've tested it um if you're

1051
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,079
growing a lot of plants routine testing

1052
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:44,358
is probably a good idea um you know you

1053
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,240
know if you're just growing a few you

1054
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:47,759
know in your house or your garden then

1055
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:49,199
you know at least test them before you

1056
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,280
start growing them to make sure that

1057
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:53,318
they're going to yield what you're

1058
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,200
looking for um you know just remember

1059
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:58,880
prevention is the smartest way to go

1060
00:43:55,199 --> 00:44:00,318
about um uh keeping this thing at Bay um

1061
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,838
stopping it from entering in the first

1062
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:05,480
place is a whole lot easier and a whole

1063
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:08,599
lot cheaper than fixing a problem after

1064
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,400
it's happened so um yeah there's a

1065
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:13,838
solution to it there's no reason to be

1066
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:17,079
afraid of it just um protect yourself

1067
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:19,318
and uh you know it's it it's manageable

1068
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:22,000
some good advice now there are many

1069
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:24,440
other pathogens whether it be a virus a

1070
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,800
vir viroid that's out there that can

1071
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,400
infect a wide scale of plants right yeah

1072
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,480
we won't get into them here but can you

1073
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,800
kind of leave the audience here with a

1074
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,639
little bit of cliffhanger what are some

1075
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,519
other like pathogens out there that

1076
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,400
people can look into and research like I

1077
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:41,239
know there's beak curly top virus

1078
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,000
there's lettuce mosaic virus there's

1079
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:45,519
tobacco mosaic virus do you have maybe a

1080
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,719
few more that you can list off that

1081
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:50,440
people can look into yes absolutely so

1082
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,439
some of the other viruses that have

1083
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,440
published evidence to infect medicinal

1084
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:58,519
plants are um like you mentioned beet

1085
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:02,519
curly top virus lettuce closis virus um

1086
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:06,719
uh tobacco streak virus Alfalfa mosaic

1087
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:08,880
virus um um tobacco mosaic virus a lot

1088
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:11,358
of people are afraid of this one um

1089
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,680
there's no published evidence that it

1090
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:16,279
infects medicinal plants naturally and

1091
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:19,318
no published evidence that it can cause

1092
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,720
symptoms in plants in in medicinal

1093
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:24,639
plants so

1094
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:27,919
um um I would say that those four that I

1095
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:30,279
mentioned are the biggest threat current

1096
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,240
um they're all spread um almost

1097
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,599
exclusively by insects so this is

1098
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:37,318
something that's much more like I said

1099
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:42,640
on point if you are growing plants

1100
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:46,358
outside um other potential pathogens um

1101
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:48,000
especially viroids that exist in hops um

1102
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:51,519
which have the potential to jump over

1103
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,159
into other plants are um apple fruit

1104
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:57,559
crinkle vroid pop stunt vroid and

1105
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:00,519
crackling bark vroid so all three of

1106
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:03,839
those um while there's no evidence there

1107
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:06,719
in uh medicinal plants right now it is

1108
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:10,799
highly possible that those things um

1109
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:13,279
could uh jump across species so what's

1110
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,480
most important is that you identify a

1111
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,119
lab um where you're where you're getting

1112
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,920
things tested that is kind of monitoring

1113
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:24,280
that stuff and has the scientific chops

1114
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:26,960
to um develop tests quickly if those

1115
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:30,839
things become a threat in the industry

1116
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,440
so um yeah once basically the the

1117
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:35,400
important thing to remember here is no

1118
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:37,639
matter what you're facing if you prevent

1119
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,880
entry if you're careful with

1120
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:42,159
sterilization if you're paying attention

1121
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:45,680
you can protect yourself from both the

1122
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:47,960
known pathogens as well as anything that

1123
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,558
might be coming down the pike um it's

1124
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,519
just important to put those Protections

1125
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:54,559
in place and um it'll be all right all

1126
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:56,280
right well so much good info in this

1127
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:58,160
podcast episode today thank you so much

1128
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,800
for coming on here this is actually a

1129
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:02,639
topic that we haven't gotten into on

1130
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,960
this podcast yet so I'm really honored

1131
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,279
to have an expert on here that can break

1132
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,240
it down for us and give us all the

1133
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,760
details and what we need to know and how

1134
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:13,199
to test symptoms and all that stuff so I

1135
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,040
appreciate your time today can you tell

1136
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:16,239
the listeners how they can find you and

1137
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:18,159
maybe talk about some things that you

1138
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:21,399
have upcoming in the future yes

1139
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:24,639
absolutely so um you can find us at

sequencing type diagnostic so um what

1163
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:19,199
this can do for you is instead of you

1164
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:20,920
knowing what's wrong with your plant you

1165
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,199
can say this plant doesn't right I'm

1166
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,240
going to send in some tissue and we can

1167
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:28,879
basically agnostically look at it and

1168
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:31,159
tell you um what's there so you don't

1169
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,680
have to know that it's hopl and vroid or

1170
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:35,558
know that it's lettuce chlorosis or

1171
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:38,279
whatever um we can we can kind of test

1172
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:39,960
