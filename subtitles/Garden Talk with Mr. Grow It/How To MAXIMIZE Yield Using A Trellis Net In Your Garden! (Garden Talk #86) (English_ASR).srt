1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,640
coming up on Garden talk the scrog

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:10,019
technique means utilizing and maximizing

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:12,058
my light and the space of my grow area I

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,160
like to use masonry 22 because it does

5
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,919
sometimes have that wax coating and it's

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,359
tough and it's nice and thin so those

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,820
are the three that I use to string up

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,100
the actual frame they're gonna get

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,300
bigger right at your screen level which

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,278
you don't really want because they're

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,599
not up as full as the light so there's

12
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:28,859
going to be a lot of little node sites

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,559
that you want to defoliate in your

14
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,600
flower defoliation so I want to talk

15
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,039
sooner so that means that my hole sizing

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,539
is going to be a little bit smaller so I

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,939
can talk sooner

18
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,439
you're definitely gonna probably yield a

19
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,439
bit more scrogging than you would

20
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,479
typically off a normal kind of plant but

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,718
only because you're going to be growing

22
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:51,179
top dense colas on your screen and every

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,920
bud you have is going to be a top Colo

24
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,920
that has density to it

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,539
what's up everybody if you that don't

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,040
know me my name is Chris aka Mr Grow it

really blown away at what you do in the

90
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,519
garden and that's kind of what we're

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,040
going to get into today is your style of

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,780
plant training more particular what

93
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,039
you're well known for is the scrugg

94
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,318
technique we're gonna really get deep

95
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,699
into it and what I mean by that is I

96
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,000
want to get into the Nitty Gritty

97
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:44,339
details of it so we'll ask some of those

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,620
deep detail-oriented questions so people

99
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,598
can learn your Technique and potentially

100
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,158
implement it in their Garden perfect I'm

101
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:51,238

124
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,120
worries you deserve it how about an

125
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,560
introduction can you tell us a little

126
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,259
bit about yourself and how you got into

127
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,240
gardening yeah up for sure well

128
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,939
um what happened to me was I was

129
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,579
introducing at a very young age my

130
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:50,879
family actually used so I got I grew up

131
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:52,198
like knowing it seeing it a lot

132
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,060
um so when I was actually younger

133
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,460
probably about eight years old maybe 10

134
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,079
years old I followed my parents out to

135
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:00,719
the garage where I wasn't supposed to go

136
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,240
and I stumbled into like a kind of a

137
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,919
grow up just like what you see back here

138
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,720
it was just a white plastic sheets and I

139
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,120
opened up the plastic sheets and I saw a

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,400
few a few medicinal plants sitting there

141
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,139
and like that just kind of

142
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,299
that you first it was shocking but it

143
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,860
was really kind of cool to see right

144
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,220
so um

145
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,699
since then as I grew up in life I became

146
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,380
one interested in in this and uh

147
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,240
my mom started showing me a few little

148
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:29,519
tips and I was younger about how to grow

149
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,319
this product and uh and she was a

150
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,719
stronger kind of cool right so that one

151
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,699
taught me how to strong as I got older I

152
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,580
threw a few little of my own tips into

153
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,379
it and uh and things just took off from

154
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,060
there I just kept on stronging ever

155
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:45,060
since then I don't really grow anything

156
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,680
else uh naturally I'm the stronger so

157
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,418
yeah that's just I just called myself

158
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,939
other and stronger because I live in

159
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:52,620
Canada and uh in a little bit of the

160
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:54,600
northern region of Canada I'm not quite

161
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,459
north of Canada but we call ourselves

162
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,979
Northern Canada so I call myself an

163
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,839
order in scrogger that's so cool and now

164
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,699
you have a YouTube channel you have a

165
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,758
pretty big Following over there and

166
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:08,280
Instagram how'd you get into wanting to

167
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,080
produce content well yeah that's pretty

168
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:13,079
neat what happened to me was

169
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,579
during our covid when covet first came

170
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,219
out everyone kind of got laid off from

171
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:19,079
their jobs and I was one of them but I

172
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,300
always had a scrog going I I was always

173
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,680
a scrogger so that's when I was like you

174
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,720
know what I'm going to start showing my

175
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,220
strongs on Facebook groups I'm just

176
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,960
going to show my scrogs and I'm gonna

177
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,699
add a little tip to help people learn

178
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,339
how to scrog

179
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,900
and so I did that well one tip and that

180
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:35,038
one tip kind of blew up and a lot of

181
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:37,318
people liked it and a lot of people ask

182
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,639
me for more so like a week later I took

183
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,319
another picture of my grow and I was

184
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,960
like this is another tip this is when

185
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,220
you should talk and and like I added

186
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,418
that tip and that kind of blew up and

187
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,100
then people started telling me like you

188
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:48,899
should make your own group on Facebook

189
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,520
your own group so then I created my own

190
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:53,219
group called strongers which is my hat

191
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,379
here and that's on Facebook

192
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,360
um and then then I got told by people

193
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,759
that make an Instagram so I created an

194
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,740
Instagram called Northern instructor and

195
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,939
since then that that got deleted and I

196
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,639
have a new one called the northern

197
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,879
scragger on Instagram but but really

198
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,620
what happened was the initial Facebook

199
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,240
reactions was got me thinking like wow I

200
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,399
could really help a lot of people in

201
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,680
this technique and I should just keep

202
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,538
pushing and try to become good at it

203
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,280
good at creating content to help help

204
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,719
new Growers and help even experience

205
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,758
Growers they want to learn how to strug

206
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,759
that's awesome that's really really cool

207
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,280
so are you just an indoor grower or you

208
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,439
also do outdoors are you organic or

209
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,959
synthetic are you in soil cocoa Hydro

210
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,379
yeah I used to uh I used to do outdoor

211
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:39,060
grows but um once it became legalized

212
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:41,639
more so in Canada

213
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,019
I got right into the indoor girls like

214
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,280
steadily

215
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,258
um I like the indoor grows more because

216
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,779
I can control my environment the outdoor

217
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,340
grows I always like you do good but I

218
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,318
feel like later on in the season the

219
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:55,500
environment changes sometimes it's too

220
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,939
too humid for the for the like what the

221
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,259
plant needs stay late in flower and

222
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:59,759
you're not like high humidity and it's

223
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,520
pouring rain every day like I just got

224
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,919
sick outdoor growing so I just took it

225
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,538
right to the indoor and I am a synthetic

226
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,859
grower

227
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:11,098
um right now I use future Harvest

228
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,139
nutrients for all my satanic growing and

229
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:15,598
uh I want to learn how to organic grow I

230
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,918
just I just don't like the bug aspect of

231
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,719
it like sometimes there's a lot of bugs

232
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,339
with organic growing I know some bugs

233
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,020
are good bugs but I just I'm just not

234
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,939
there yet with wine bugs to be in my

235
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:25,500
space I just like uh

236
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,060
I'm just I'm good with synthetic right

237
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,740
now and I honestly feel that fans don't

238
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,598
tell the difference from like organic to

239
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,800
synthetic so I know there's a lot of

240
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:33,299
difference in like all the bottles you

241
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,099
have on the time it takes to mix the

242
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,838
nutrients like I get that part of it and

243
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,580
that is a that's a huge deal it's time

244
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,039
saving right there so

245
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,560
there's so many ponds or pros and cons

246
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,539
to each but I do gotta get into it and

247
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,179
destroy it and like expand my knowledge

248
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:49,079
that makes sense yeah outdoors in

249
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:51,599
particular it's a whole different

250
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,920
Battlefield right now luckily the plant

251
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,259
that we're growing that we all know and

252
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,539
love is a very resilient and it's going

253
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:59,220
to be able to adapt but yeah it's it has

254
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:02,039
its own unique challenges indoor versus

255
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,899
outdoor and organic for synthetic and

256
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,399
all that stuff but definitely like to

257
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,278
hear about you know what the guests

258
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,139
growth style is because uh yeah I can

259
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:13,559
definitely help lead the conversation

260
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,240
and I guess to start really basic

261
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,278
question I do have beginners that tune

262
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,580
into this podcast as well so when we say

263
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,980
scrog what is the scrub technique in my

264
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,778
mind well a lot of people mind the straw

265
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,879
technique is called like the screen of

266
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:30,000
green so this screen behind me would be

267
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,399
just full of colas eventually

268
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,399
um but really in my mind the scrog

269
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,879
technique means utilizing and maximizing

270
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,639
my light and the space of my grow area

271
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,980
so I'll build my screen the size of my

272
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,439
grow space that will work my light so if

273
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,200
I have a 5x5 flowering footprint light

274
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,240
I'll build a 5x5 screen and I'll

275
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,700
maximize that screen by filling it full

276
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,220
of colas as much as possible and then

277
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,019
I'll maximize my light to feed all of

278
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,720
these colas at the same height as each

279
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,580
other with a full canopy uh so really

280
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,800
that that's that's what strong is in my

281
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,480
mind is maximizing my light and my space

282
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,519
okay and then you answer my next

283
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,959
question which is what size net do you

284
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,899
use you just mentioned if you're in a

285
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:15,419
5x5 space that net size is going to be

286
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,860
five feet by five feet same thing with

287
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:19,319
the smaller spaces I assume that you

288
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,120
grow in your the lights coverage area

289
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,260
will be the size of the net is that

290
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,759
correct yeah

291
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:25,500
yes what you want to aim for but if you

292
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,539
have a screen that's like say four by

293
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,940
four screens you're only a four by four

294
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:32,338
ten I can still use lights that are

295
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,720
capable of a five by five stays in a

296
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,220
four by four tent you just don't have to

297
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,980
have it like turned up all the way or

298
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,959
dialed up all the way so so yeah like

299
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,399
that goes with each other

300
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,899
um

301
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,159
I just definitely wouldn't build the

302
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,539
screen much bigger than five by five

303
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,519
because most of our lights that we use

304
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,799
these days are a five by five footprint

305
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,899
uh you can you can't find much more than

306
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:54,778
that right now with the LED world

307
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,700
so um that's that's pretty much like

308
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:58,559
yeah you just gotta just kind of gotta

309
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,360
not use your head but just think about

310
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,559
your footprint of your light and the

311
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,720
size of the screen that you want to

312
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,699
build that's that's the main that's

313
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,120
that's really like what it is that makes

314
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,759
sense and then in these nets right

315
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,740
trellis net is often used there are

316
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,240
different size trellis Nets as far as

317
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,879
like the holes

318
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,139
what size holes do you go for I mean I

319
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,759
think there's three inches I think it's

320
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:22,799
four inches there might be some other

321
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,480
sizes as well but like what size holes

322
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,759
do you prefer in your net

323
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,360
in my net see I don't buy

324
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:32,039
trellis met I build my own screen

325
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,759
um so what I do is I build my own

326
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:39,539
screens anywhere from 2.5 inches to 3.5

327
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:42,360
inches and why I do that is because if I

328
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:44,699
go any smaller than 2.5 inches then

329
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,220
sometimes when your plants grow the nose

330
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,320
spacing gets tight and if you have a two

331
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,200
inch hole space then your nose will get

332
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,839
trapped and as your plant gets more into

333
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,700
flour those nose faces become Buds and

334
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,620
that's when they get fat and they expend

335
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,480
and if they're all stuck underneath the

336
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,278
screen that only has two inch hole

337
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,320
spacing you're going to get problems

338
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:05,639
like pm and mildew and no air move

339
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,339
basically because you're just you're

340
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:11,399
growing a real tight carpet so I like to

341
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:14,220
use like say 2.5 to 3.5 because now I

342
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,078
can like have space for each node to

343
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,980
grow up through a separate hole on my

344
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,319
screen

345
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,940
it's easier to talk when your holes are

346
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,220
a little bit smaller compared to say a

347
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,200
four inch hole size because if you have

348
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,420
four inch hole size then you gotta wait

349
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,519
for your branch to grow up at least four

350
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:30,479
inches before you can tuck it underneath

351
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,159
again

352
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,039
I don't really want my branches to grow

353
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,539
four inches because by that time they

354
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,919
are going to get a little bit thicker

355
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:39,838
they are going to develop more of their

356
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,000
nose lights are going to start thinking

357
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,680
like they're on a vertical growth path

358
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,419
instead of being on a horizontal dive

359
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,759
horizontal that I want

360
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,199
so I want to talk sooner so that means

361
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,720
that my whole sizing is going to be a

362
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,019
little bit smaller so I can talk sooner

363
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,680
so also why I tie my own strings on my

364
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,778
strong frames is for harvesting purposes

365
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,519
I like to cut my string when I harvest

366
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:04,740
and if I was to buy them every time

367
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,720
they're not cheap well they are

368
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,100
relatively cheap but not cheap in a way

369
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,200
right people want to kind of wrestle

370
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,639
their screen off and save that screen

371
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,680
for the next run

372
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,680
what I do is it's cheap so I'll just cut

373
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,599
down two sides of my frame and then I

374
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,399
just pull the twine it it just slides

375
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,379
right out perfectly whatever I use just

376
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,659
slides right out and the plant doesn't

377
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,700
just fall down it kind of just kind of

378
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:28,980
like mushrooms and just sits there ready

379
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,139
for me to chop it at the base

380
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,639
so so yeah I kind of went in a little

381
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:36,360
bit detail there but yeah the screen

382
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,919
hole sizing is just like 2.5 3.5 that's

383
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,019
my preference and that's what I would

384
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,458
use and I I build my own and I have

385
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,139
videos on YouTube on how to build your

386
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,939
own and it's really really easy and it

387
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,820
takes 10 minutes to string one of these

388
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,839
frames up once you have the frame built

389
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,879
understood yeah thanks for explaining

390
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,220
the pros and cons for the different

391
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,659
sizes I wasn't you know some of these

392
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,220
things you don't think of like another

393
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,860
reason why I like to string my own

394
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,500
scrogs strings

395
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,419
when I talk a branch I can actually grab

396
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,980
this one the twine that I use and I can

397
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:06,838
slide it with my fingers a little bit

398
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,000
and I can tuck that Branch under Slide

399
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,440
the twine and it'll hold the branch with

400
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,120
like one of the one of the fan leaves

401
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,459
will hold that twine and I can let go

402
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,500
and it'll sit there if you buy if you

403
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:19,018
buy a store-bought twine you can't slide

404
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,700
that position it at all it is it's there

405
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,620
like you can't move it over you can't

406
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,240
slide it this way so that's that's

407
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,220
another good tip right there it's like I

408
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,379
do move my screen around sometimes to

409
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,420
pull it closer when I talk so like I can

410
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:32,399
make it reach that's a good tip right

411
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,919
that I want to throw in that's a good

412
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,320
call out so using twine that you

413
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,659
purchased I assume from a local store or

414
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,879
online can you talk to us about like the

415
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:45,919
actual building of the frame by using

416
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:49,019
PVC what size PVC how are you actually

417
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,159
fixing the twine to the PVC so on and so

418
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,940
forth you talk about like the build of

419
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:56,039
it yeah so what I do is I use three

420
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,500
quarter inch PVC

421
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,958
and then and then I buy uh these little

422
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,179
tees that are called three-way tees but

423
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,359
what I advise new Growers is to buy

424
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:08,698
four-way pvcts that just gives you

425
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,399
another extension on the top if you ever

426
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:14,338
need a second trellis okay so what I do

427
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:17,278
is I build these screens three quarter

428
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:20,220
inch PVC and then whatever I want my

429
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,620
bowl sizing to be is I run

430
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,480
screws down the top of my screen three

431
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,919
inches right now all my screens are

432
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,500
three inch hole spacing so every three

433
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,838
inches I'll put a black mark then I just

434
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,240
get top tap drilling screws and I just

435
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,980
screw in every black mark that tapes it

436
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,079
pie takes me like to build a five by

437
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,000
five screen it'll probably take a good

438
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:40,859
like one hour it takes some time but you

439
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,659
have it forever and when you're not

440
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,240
using this Frame I can just take it all

441
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:47,159
apart into pieces and I can I can like

442
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,659
wrap it up in tape in a nice little neat

443
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,980
little bundle and I can store it

444
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:51,419
somewhere for when I want to start over

445
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,940
again I just pull it out put it all

446
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:55,979
together do my twine again which takes a

447
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,300
few minutes and then I'm ready to rock

448
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,940
so

449
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:02,698
I like to use twine I like to use

450
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,860
masonry rope and I like to use hemp

451
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:06,359
twine but there's a difference between a

452
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,278
lot of them if you're going to use a

453
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,039
twine you want to try to get a wax coat

454
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,958
of twine because the hairs Fray off it

455
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,419
and you'll have a bunch of like fraying

456
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,159
hairs on your on when you take pictures

457
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:20,578
you see a bunch of hairs on your twine

458
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:22,379
exposed if you use hemp twine it also

459
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:24,958
frays so you have a bunch of hair

460
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:26,759
exposed like fraying hairs off the twine

461
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,198
but hemp point is not bad because it's

462
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,639
biodegradable and you can actually

463
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:31,859
probably even smoke a little bit how big

464
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,320
it gets caught in there

465
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,360
um I I like to use masonry 22 because it

466
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,940
does sometimes have that wax coating and

467
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,560
it's tough and it's nice and thin so

468
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,019
those are the three that I use to string

469
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,638
off the string up the actual frame

470
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,980
that's good to know good good

471
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,799
information there now how many plants

472
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,079
are you doing underneath the net there

473
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,299
are you doing a a plant per square foot

474
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,859
or like how do you go about it yeah so I

475
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:58,379
like to do what I like to have at least

476
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,720
two by like two feet by two feet square

477
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:02,578
feet for one plant so if I'm like doing

478
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,919
a five by five strong I'll probably grow

479
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:07,859
like four plants under it

480
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,660
um if I'm doing like a like a like a two

481
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,399
by two strong frame because there is two

482
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,980
you can grow one plant under a nice two

483
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,259
by two frame and one plant it works

484
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,000
perfect or if I had a four by four frame

485
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:19,078
I'd probably do like two or maybe three

486
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,660
plants

487
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:23,698
so I decided to keep like yeah like two

488
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,798
foot area kind of for one plant at least

489
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,079
because I do veg for only like I know

490
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:30,240
people think I veg for a long time but I

491
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,759
really do only veg for two months from a

492
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,319
Seedling so really it takes a ceiling to

493
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:36,058
take off it takes out about three weeks

494
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,159
just for a ceiling to really start to

495
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:39,418
take off right that's three weeks right

496
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,980
there and then I'm then I'm talking

497
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,500
underneath this screen for like a month

498
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,839
and a little bit then flipping oh God

499
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,940
that makes sense and what would you say

500
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,939
the measurement is between the top of

501
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:53,279
the grill pot and the screen

502
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,259
yeah that's another good question what I

503
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,359
what I this is just what I do I'm just

504
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:59,220
going to tell you things that I do so

505
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,979
the way that the way that I strong is I

506
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:05,100
like to keep my screens six to eight

507
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,440
inches off the top of my pot I don't go

508
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:09,659
any more than eight and I really don't

509
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,000
even go eight anymore I just recommend

510
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,100
that is the maximum height and I only

511
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,200
say eight inches for like the elderly

512
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:17,579
people or people that like have to

513
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,740
really get under there and work on their

514
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:22,019
plants have really big arms you want a

515
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,319
little bit more space under there but I

516
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:28,259
like to go six inches that's my spot so

517
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:30,119
I like to keep my screen low as possible

518
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:32,759
because that's going to shorten my veg

519
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,859
time got it yeah I've actually heard as

520
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:37,140
high as 18 inches from the top of the

521
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:39,058
pot six inches actually the lowest I've

522
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,220
heard but it it makes sense you know

523
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:43,259
because exactly what you just said it

524
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,839
you can reduce the amount of veg time

525
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:48,179
you have your your real squat to the

526
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,759
actual net and uh yeah that's that's

527
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:52,380
it's good to know I get I can go into a

528
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,879
little bit of that if you want me to a

529
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,919
little bit why I keep my screens low

530
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,200
yeah sure and actually another question

531
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,179
would be when do you start the training

532
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,880
are you just bending branches down are

533
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:05,400
you doing any topping first or filming

534
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,520
first and then starting to get into the

535
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,160
screen or what yeah so good what I do is

536
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,660
um first I have my cups and or my plants

537
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,000
in like a solo cup

538
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,620
I wait about two weeks two weeks and a

539
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,819
couple days ish I put them in my five

540
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:19,139
gallon pot

541
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:20,639
and then I'm going to let them be in

542
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,700
that five gallon pot for like maybe one

543
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,160
a day twos one or two days just to like

544
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,140
kind of recuperate from a transplant

545
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,419
right just give them a couple days

546
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,340
soon as that plant is like enough for me

547
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,538
to start tying onto I'm going to start

548
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:36,298
training it

549
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:38,038
I might not top it right away I'm first

550
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:40,200
I'm going to bend it over I'm going to

551
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:42,359
put a little tie on its bottom stock and

552
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,100
keep the main stem coming from my soil

553
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:45,839
keep that straight then I'm going to tie

554
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,959
off to the top and I'm gonna I'm gonna

555
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,579
bend the top as I as I keep the main

556
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,900
stem firm and straight because a lot of

557
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:53,939
people a lot of people miss that step

558
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,820
they just tie from the top and their

559
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,080
whole plant comes on a lean now you're

560
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:59,460
like ripping the roots around you don't

561
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,779
see it but you're really like hurting

562
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,279
the bottom of the plant there so like

563
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:05,279
you really want to tie off this bottom

564
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:07,980
of your plant and then tie down

565
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,538
then yeah and then after I do after I do

566
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,460
that I will

567
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:13,140
keep on training that plan all the

568
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,000
individual branches that start growing

569
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,100
up I'll tie them to the sides of my pot

570
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,319
I'll do that for the first month of the

571
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:21,178
plant's growth so even from seedling

572
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:24,119
right for the first month I'm just tying

573
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:26,759
down the branches once I transplant it

574
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:29,699
and then after one month I put my

575
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,099
screens on and I get my plants all ready

576
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,660
for the screen and I just and I untie

577
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:35,339
all the branches from the pot and I let

578
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,538
the plant just kind of push off into the

579
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:38,699
screen

580
00:20:36,538 --> 00:20:40,859
and then I continued tucking it for

581
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,538
another month so that this is where I

582
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:45,240
keep my screens low because my screen is

583
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:47,339
only six inches off the top of the pod

584
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,440
so that happened the plant will reach

585
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:51,178
that six inches real fast usually within

586
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,980
a month of growth it's up six inches

587
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:55,080
high

588
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,298
that now I'm not I'm not waiting for it

589
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:59,519
to be 18 inches high I'm using every

590
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:01,558
node on that plant even the first note

591
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,119
on that plant that most people trim off

592
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:04,918
in defoliation they trim off the first

593
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,259
few nose so they can expose the top of

594
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,360
their plant well I'm using every note on

595
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:11,519
my plant so I'll start training every

596
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,500
node all around my Branch all around my

597
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,179
screen for another month

598
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,400
and then that's when I will flip the

599
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:19,019
flower I always split the flour on two

600
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,120
months no matter what because I figured

601
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,980
out I'm strugging for a long time and

602
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,538
the size of screens that I use but we

603
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,480
just talked about how much I have for

604
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:30,058
per plant two feet by two feet per plant

605
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,339
I know that in two months it's it's

606
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:34,200
pretty much time for me to flip and I'm

607
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:36,480
going to continue tucking for that first

608
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,400
two weeks of me flipping the flowers so

609
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,038
during the flower stretch I'm still

610
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,080
tucking my branches underneath my screen

611
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,119
that's that's one of my main tips of

612
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:48,298
scrogging is keep on talking during the

613
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,579
flowering stretch now are you waiting to

614
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:53,879
flip the flower until every single one

615
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:56,158
of those squares is full or you like 95

616
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,460
full and then you do the flip to flower

617
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:02,400
or what no what I do is

618
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:06,538
I just I flip I flip at no matter what

619
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,100
at two months but I have um like I've I

620
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:10,619
figured out that like

621
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:12,959
it only takes two months to fill that

622
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:15,298
size of the screen that I use if I had a

623
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,640
big big screen with one plant I could

624
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:19,619
have veg for longer and try to fill more

625
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,419
of the screen up

626
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,158
you don't run you don't want to run out

627
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:25,440
of space on your screens because if you

628
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,600
run out of space on your screen then

629
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,580
you're gonna have runoff branches that

630
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,740
are taller than other branches on your

631
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:33,298
screen and now you're not maximizing

632
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,038
your light anymore because you got to

633
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:37,139
work your light to the top of that

634
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:40,859
runoff Branch you can't work it on the

635
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:42,960
whole canopy anymore so I I try to have

636
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,579
a little bit of space on my screen still

637
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,380
when I'm when I'm going to harvest I

638
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:48,298
want to see the edges still exposed

639
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,520
because I don't aim to fill my screen

640
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:53,339
and I don't aim for yield I aim for

641
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:55,619
Quality I'm here for quality over

642
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:57,178
quantity so that's why I do the two

643
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:59,519
month veg

644
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:01,740
um to fill up each hole in the screen is

645
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:05,038
actually really easy you're probably

646
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,259
gonna have two two bun sites purple the

647
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,599
way that I scrog so against against

648
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:11,460
really it gets really packed in a

649
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:12,959
certain way like but that's why you want

650
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,340
to have the three inch hole spacing

651
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,538
because if you don't have the three inch

652
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:18,538
roller spacing your three and a half

653
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:20,339
you're not going to fit two nodes two

654
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:22,440
Bud sites in that hole

655
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:23,399
to get too cramped with two of them

656
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,980
right

657
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,559
so yeah that's why I say three to the

658
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,798
three to four inch or three to or sorry

659
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:34,200
2.5 3.5 inch hole size on your screens

660
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:37,200
you mentioned some branches coming up

661
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,659
and and kind of outgrowing some of the

662
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,980
other branches in the net how do you

663
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:43,260
manage that is there things that you can

664
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,880
do in order to kind of control the

665
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:46,740
height like I know some people will do a

666
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,020
super copping for example so they'll

667
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,579
super crop that Branch allow the other

668
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,619
branches to grow up what do you

669
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:54,058
typically do for when when some of those

670
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:55,918
branches grow out of control and they'll

671
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:58,558
grow the other branches well typically

672
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,140
what I do is I tend I honestly I keep up

673
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,940
on my screen I'm usually there and I'm

674
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,500
working it every other day and I'm

675
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,440
talking branches so like I don't

676
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,599
normally have that many runoffs but if I

677
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,400
was to go away for say a while and I

678
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,259
came home and it was there was a lot of

679
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,880
runoffs I would like do the super crop

680
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:18,000
technique I like kind of pinch that

681
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,940
Branch stunt it a little bit if I was

682
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,460
still in like say vegetation I would

683
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:26,220
maybe top that Branch low and then start

684
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,779
talking the nodes that come off come off

685
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,339
where I topped it I start talking them

686
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:31,740
again and start working them into my

687
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:34,259
screen but yeah if I'm in if I'm in late

688
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,120
flower and and I have a runoff in late

689
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:37,558
flower then I you just kind of just

690
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,819
gotta ride it out there's not much you

691
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:41,099
can do in late fireworks you're not

692
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:43,019
going to Super crop that Branch it

693
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:44,819
because that could stress the plant out

694
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:47,460
too much you're not going to top it and

695
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:49,259
leave flowers so that that's that's in

696
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,759
my mind I'd be like oh I kind of messed

697
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:52,740
up on this drug because I let it get

698
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,700
away from me I've had that loss I've had

699
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,319
plans

700
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,298
they just keep on stretching in

701
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,939
flowering I'm like holy like it's just

702
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:01,500
it's just crazy girl you know but for

703
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,600
the most part I like to keep up on it

704
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,519
another thing is in late flour you'll

705
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,199
notice on your screens that sometimes

706
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,139
the center of the screen is pushing up

707
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,240
more so it looks like it looks more like

708
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,860
higher on a canopy than everywhere else

709
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,960
what I would do is go underneath my

710
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:18,240
screen and I'll just tie a piece of

711
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,819
string to at the actual string of the

712
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,460
frame and I'll pull it down and I'll tie

713
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:25,619
it to a weight as I look at my canopy

714
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,600
I'll pull it down so it's level again

715
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:29,459
and then I'll tie it a weight on and

716
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,839
I'll hold it there so I'll because like

717
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,038
once you use the screen like this you

718
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:34,019
can pull your screen down your whole

719
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:36,480
canopy will actually Flex up and down as

720
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:38,099
you pull on the screen so I'll pull on

721
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,740
my screen until it's perfectly level

722
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:43,019
again tie it off and then now I'm

723
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,940
maximizing my light again interesting

724
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:47,099
yeah the reason why I ask I know you

725
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,840
mentioned that you tuck for the first

726
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:50,519
week of flower and then after that

727
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,740
you're kind of letting the the branches

728
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:54,538
grow up so like as generally said that

729
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,038
the plant stretches for 21 days after

730
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:57,720
flipping the light cycle now of course

731
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:59,400
that's gonna depend on some factors

732
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,640
genetics what light cycle you actually

733
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:05,038
on and so on and so forth but uh that 14

734
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,140
days is what I was kind of mentioning is

735
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,538
like if you have branches growing out of

736
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,580
control within that 14 days what do you

737
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:13,980
do and you pretty much answered it there

738
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:16,079
so so at what point do you add a second

739
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:19,620
layer of a trellis you mentioned that

740
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:21,418
you have your net set so you can and add

741
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:23,158
in a second layer when would you add in

742
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:24,778
the second layer what would the distance

743
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,799
be between the first layer and the

744
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:29,960
second layer

745
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:29,960
so if I was the kind of stronger that y

746
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:33,000
EP you're strong and there's a lot of a

747
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:34,619
lot of Growers out there that like to

748
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,798
have that for sure

749
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:39,719
I would um what what they like to do is

750
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:41,819
like they like to fill their four their

751
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,558
first screen full and veg so they keep

752
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:46,558
on talking until everything is

753
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:49,500
completely full on that screen and then

754
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,259
they flip the flower once it's all full

755
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,700
and then they stopped tucking so that's

756
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:55,679
what that's the difference that I don't

757
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,720
do is I always keep talking when I

758
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,120
switch the flower they don't keep

759
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,038
talking they now let their plant their

760
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,778
buds rise up or their colas their

761
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:06,900
branches start rising up

762
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:08,519
but at this time now they're too like

763
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,620
from the from the training that they've

764
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,819
had you're gonna get a lot of skinnier

765
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:13,379
branches you're not going to get a lot

766
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:15,359
of those thick firm branches because you

767
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,400
keep on talking in your branches right

768
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,079
so the ones that are coming up now if

769
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,538
the screen are kind of flimsy they're

770
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:23,399
not as like strong and sturdy so you're

771
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:26,700
gonna have to add a second cellist for

772
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:29,400
support so I would recommend it to be

773
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,380
around like say six to eight inches off

774
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,820
your second screen once you flip the

775
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,860
flat once you flip because they're

776
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:37,079
probably going to be around they say

777
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:38,399
12 inch colas all together so if you're

778
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:40,500
sitting around eight inches you're going

779
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,600
to be supporting that pretty good

780
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,038
but I I sometimes like doing that

781
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:46,019
because if you don't have a lot of good

782
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:47,940
air movement within that Center canopy

783
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:49,679
and you don't have a lot of good light

784
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,000
penetration that's penetrating on those

785
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,100
inner buds

786
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,480
then I just feel like sometimes it's a

787
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:56,339
waste and like you're not now you're not

788
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,019
now you're not growing like nice pure

789
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:00,240
colas off the screen you're actually

790
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:01,980
just throwing branches with like with

791
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,839
like Buds and then like a stick and then

792
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,058
a bud down here maybe a bud but all the

793
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,558
buds are getting less like quality as

794
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:09,058
you go down

795
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:10,980
so

796
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:12,720
there is pros and cons to everything and

797
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,278
everyone has their technique and like I

798
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,319
appreciate all of them really I it's

799
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:17,940
just in my mind I just I just I just

800
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,798
don't see why why a lot of guys would

801
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,778
like to or girls would like to do the

802
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,759
double decker strong just just for the

803
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:25,679
reason of like exfoliating the center of

804
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:28,079
it and keeping it clean for the airflow

805
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,340
and quality of the light to penetrate

806
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,038
and stuff like that

807
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:34,439
got it I've made the mistake of talking

808
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:38,278
for too long before I took for like the

809
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,500
first 14 days and uh after that I didn't

810
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:42,079
get much stretch and so like that was a

811
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,038
that was a mistake because then

812
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,899
everything's kind of flat in your buds

813
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:47,700
are like mixed in within the net and

814
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,700
it's like what the heck I did this wrong

815
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,960
so like yeah that seven day Mark that

816
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,759
you do is probably something I'm going

817
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,380
to be doing in the future it seems like

818
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,359
it's a sweet spot you know you don't get

819
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,559
too much stretch to where it grows out

820
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,899
of control and you need that second

821
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,899
layer but you know you just got the 14

822
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:06,419
days of stretch and then um you know

823
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,340
those buds will hopefully be able will

824
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,778
be even across the canopy and be able to

825
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:12,778
stay up on their own without that second

826
00:29:09,778 --> 00:29:14,460
layer exactly I aim for a six to eight

827
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:16,440
inch rollers off the top of the screen

828
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,940
so if you have an eight inch Cola it's

829
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,919
gonna support itself that's not going to

830
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,600
flop over that as long as you have fans

831
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,038
and your space blowing them around like

832
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,538
not blowing the hardcore but as long as

833
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,158
you have air movement always moving them

834
00:29:24,538 --> 00:29:28,500
and dancing your branches around they're

835
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,940
gonna get they're gonna get strong if

836
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,278
you don't have air movement they're just

837
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,960
growing in a like a still environment

838
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:36,119
and nothing's moving they're gonna get

839
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,278
heavy and then they're gonna fall you

840
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:41,519
need to build the muscle and that's by

841
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:44,038
moving wind right and another thing is

842
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,740
like you just said I mean when you

843
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:49,259
scrubbed and you talk for so long

844
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,759
what happens is yeah you're going to get

845
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:52,919
a bunch of those little buds on there

846
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,720
but the way that I do it is that you'll

847
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,640
see all the all like the little branches

848
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,440
coming up then you'll see you'll notice

849
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,299
the ones that are caught and you can

850
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,860
snip them off you can snip off certain

851
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,379
nodes that you can tell aren't going to

852
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:06,058
make it up to the screen and so that

853
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,380
that's not like that's another thing if

854
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:09,839
you want to talk about exfoliating like

855
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,880
I get into exfoliating and I sniff off

856
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,619
all those that's what I actually was

857
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,899
going to ask you next is do you do any

858
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:18,839
sort of defoliating and adding into that

859
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:20,519
would be having that net there it can be

860
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:22,678
difficult to kind of get underneath the

861
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:24,960
net to water the plants or kind of

862
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,460
hovering over the net I know you can see

863
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,200
your setup you can actually have walk

864
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,120
all the way around but there's a lot of

865
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,240
people in grow tents and so do you have

866
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:35,158
any tips on defoliating under and above

867
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,440
the net and as well as watering and

868
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:40,140
feeding underneath the net yeah for sure

869
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,120
so what you can do is

870
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,620
if you're if you're someone that is not

871
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:45,599
good at bending down and getting

872
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:47,519
underneath the screen and like just

873
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:49,558
working in like on the ground basically

874
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,000
you can build a platform scroll kind of

875
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:52,740
like what I have behind me here you can

876
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,538
build it on like a table

877
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,519
and build it to your height where you're

878
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:57,720
comfortable to like you got you can like

879
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:59,158
you can build them as high as you want

880
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,600
as long as you have a good ceiling

881
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:03,778
distance right so you can build it

882
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:05,099
almost your height I high level I've

883
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,200
helped a lot of people in wheelchairs

884
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:09,719
build strong frames they can't stand up

885
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,798
so what what they do is they'll build it

886
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,179
to their eye level and they can just

887
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,339
stand there and reach in and work on

888
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,140
their plants just by sitting here and

889
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,740
reaching in

890
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,038
um

891
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,480
I use like a watering wand to water my

892
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:23,339
plants nowadays I just stick a little

893
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,500
wand in there and I can just water them

894
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:27,359
easily but I used to use a little bucket

895
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,099
like a little like a little yeah like a

896
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,298
little um jug

897
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:32,459
kind of like this truck right here

898
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:34,019
actually a jug just like this and I

899
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,038
would just water my plants just like

900
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:37,980
that

901
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,599
so it takes time doing that

902
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,919
and now I don't have the time just to

903
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,719
hand water like that so I have a cool

904
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,100
little water wand and they're a dime a

905
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,019
dozen these days you can find a water

906
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:47,759
wand but I got Canadian Tire or Home

907
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:49,740
Depot or whatever wherever your like

908
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,079
local places to shop you can buy them

909
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:56,460
everywhere now

910
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:59,339
um so yeah for defoliating is like

911
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:02,038
like I like to defoliate two major times

912
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:04,678
so one week before I flip my plants to

913
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:07,259
flower I will defoliate below my screen

914
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,820
everything below my screen

915
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,079
um all the leaves that are weighed

916
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:12,178
talked under there they're gone I'm

917
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,859
stripping all my all my stems that are

918
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:16,798
being stripped there if they haven't

919
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:19,619
made the top of this screen yet

920
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:21,960
and then after that I wait a week before

921
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:24,959
I flip the flower so I do it one week

922
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,600
before the flower exfoliate a lot of a

923
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,120
lot of stuff under my canopy that I wait

924
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,980
a week let them heal let them heal from

925
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:34,019
that defoliation because it does stress

926
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:37,200
them out a little bit once they get back

927
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:40,200
in their groove I flip the flower and on

928
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,360
day 19 I do another major defoliation on

929
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,640
day 19 of flower I clean up everything

930
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:46,379
below my screen one more time because it

931
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,720
all comes back

932
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,760
so I'll do another major cleanup and

933
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,679
that's my two defoliations but during my

934
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,079
second defoliation I'll look up in my

935
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:57,298
screen and you'll see nodes on the

936
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:58,980
bottom of branches that you scrog that

937
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:01,440
are trying to wrap around the branch to

938
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,640
reach the light but those ones just

939
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,080
aren't going to quite make it you're

940
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,580
gonna have to snip off a few of them

941
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,079
because they're gonna get they're gonna

942
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:09,418
get like like I just said they're gonna

943
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:10,740
get bigger right at your screen level

944
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,778
which you don't really want because

945
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,919
they're not up as full as the light so

946
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:15,599
there's going to be a lot of little node

947
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,600
sites that you want to defoliate in your

948
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,859
uh in your flower defoliation okay so

949
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:21,240
you're sacrificing some of those

950
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:23,459
branches that aren't going to make it up

951
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,259
and grow the six to eight inches above

952
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,600
the net which is kind of your ideal

953
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:29,220
height yes now are you doing any

954
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,319
defoliation so people do it towards the

955
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,960
end of flowering they'll do one last one

956
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,519
so like you can get down and ripen the

957
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,380
buds for example are you doing anything

958
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,538
around like day 45 I think is a common

959
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:43,080
day where people do a defoliation before

960
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:45,058
Harvest nothing major but I do remove

961
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:47,639
fan leaves here and there if there's a

962
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:49,980
big fan Leaf blocking a nice Bud site I

963
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,200
will sometimes take that fan Leaf off or

964
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,480
sometimes I even like just take like a

965
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,519
fingerling off a fan Leaf I won't remove

966
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,099
the whole Leaf I'll just snip off like

967
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,960
let's say the middle finger of that leaf

968
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:02,639
because sometimes it's just just a leaf

969
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,380
that's rubbing on a bud site or covering

970
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,419
a bud site and I'll take off just that

971
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,338
little tingling of it

972
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:10,079
um yeah that's that's something I do is

973
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,759
I do walk around and remove fan leaves

974
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,679
here and there tuck them under my screen

975
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,200
if I can tuck a fan Leaf I'll tuck it

976
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,619
under my screen before I remove it

977
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:21,000
uh yeah so there's always those little

978
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:23,039
once in a while pluck a fan Leaf here

979
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,838
and there but nothing major I just did

980
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,960
two major defoliations one week before

981
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:29,039
and 19 days after I flip okay and I want

982
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,240
to back up for a second because I don't

983
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,800
have a question that should have been

984
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,138
asked a little while ago which is

985
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,580
positioning the plant underneath the net

986
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:38,039
now you mentioned that you typically run

987
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:39,838
four plants underneath the net but you

988
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:41,279
also mentioned that when you're you're

989
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,259
training you're letting that plant grow

990
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,960
up right and then you're doing that one

991
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:47,280
Bend towards the side are you

992
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,619
positioning the plant directly

993
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,000
underneath like the center of the net I

994
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,200
don't know how to explain this like you

995
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,699
know what I mean like are you

996
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,378
positioning towards more like towards

997
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:58,379
the corner so that plant can grow

998
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:59,699
upwards towards the center yeah you're

999
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,619
you're getting you're getting close

1000
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:03,838
there so I should I should have

1001
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:06,539
elaborated a bit more of when I taught

1002
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:09,239
my plants that I do top my plants once

1003
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:10,440
okay when I do when I do bend that main

1004
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:12,719
top over

1005
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,119
eventually I'll get to that top say

1006
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,578
after I transplant it a couple weeks

1007
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,700
after I transplant it I'll top that main

1008
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:23,760
stock that's growing I won't top that

1009
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:25,559
means I won't top it to create two new

1010
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,320
tops because those tops they're already

1011
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:30,420
there I'm not creating two new tops

1012
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,539
they're just two nodes below that top

1013
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,820
right but now I'm going to what I'm

1014
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:38,460
going to do now by topping is those two

1015
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,140
new nodes or nodes that are exposed are

1016
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,139
now going to grow and they're not going

1017
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:45,000
to be as firm and stiff as the top that

1018
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:47,039
I just topped off right because that

1019
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,838
main stock is always going to be thicker

1020
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,880
than the side branches that are coming

1021
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:53,519
off it the main one is always going to

1022
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,980
be thick so I top that main one just so

1023
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:59,338
I could have flexibility and work the

1024
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,500
two new branches into my straw so when

1025
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:03,599
you were when you said I top and direct

1026
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,579
that top somewhere I don't do that

1027
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,800
because eventually that becomes two and

1028
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:10,680
they split off in their own Direction

1029
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,440
but what I do is I position my plants

1030
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:16,259
under my frame so they have enough space

1031
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,639
to come up and turn into a mushroom and

1032
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,220
I try to keep it so they have enough

1033
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:22,500
space on every side of each other of

1034
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:24,959
like the plant so against my frame here

1035
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,519
it has to have enough space here as it

1036
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,079
does on this side of my frame beside

1037
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:30,838
this plant here

1038
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,940
so I see that mistake a lot in my in my

1039
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:35,099
scrubbers group people positioning their

1040
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,260
plants on the side of their frame so

1041
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:39,180
when the plant grows up they have all

1042
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,160
this room to tuck over here but now

1043
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:42,779
they're already running out of space

1044
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:45,299
here because they position their plant

1045
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,980
too far into the corner so you

1046
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,500
definitely want to give your plants room

1047
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,000
to become like a mushroom that's what

1048
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,219
you got a vision in your head is that

1049
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,019
plant becoming a mushroom

1050
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:57,539
and it's a lot about like future

1051
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:58,980
business visualization really like when

1052
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:00,239
you when it comes to scrubbing you got a

1053
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,699
picture like when it's going to be in

1054
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,679
the end and yeah you gotta think of a

1055
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:06,299
big mushroom happening that's a good way

1056
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:08,279
to put it yeah I never heard anybody say

1057
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,079
it like that but it makes sense and you

1058
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,180
can visualize once you say mushroom you

1059
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,579
can certainly visualize how it'll be

1060
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:17,699
yeah

1061
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:19,800
now harvesting you already said one tip

1062
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:21,960
which I think is fantastic which is you

1063
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,180
cut the twine and then you basically

1064
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,338
just pull out the twine and then are you

1065
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:28,319
just cutting from the base to harvest

1066
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:29,338
are you cutting individual branches a

1067
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,079
lot of people get caught up because

1068
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:35,460
they're using Nets and uh things get

1069
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:37,200
intertwined you know and it's difficult

1070
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,539
to remove the branch because you got the

1071
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,879
net there so um backing up do you have

1072
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:44,579
any like just general advice for

1073
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,220
harvesting yeah the way I honestly

1074
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:49,200
Harvest is I what I said is like yeah I

1075
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:51,719
cut all the twine on just two sides of

1076
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:54,118
my frame I pull it all out and then I do

1077
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:57,239
I cut right from the base of my plan

1078
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,039
and then I cut individual branches from

1079
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:01,199
the main stalk of the branch I'll just

1080
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,300
start cutting big branches off

1081
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,219
because I now I want to like open up my

1082
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,660
plant as much as possible when I when

1083
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:08,519
you scrog that you're always like kind

1084
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,440
of close together you're still gonna get

1085
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:12,059
air movement but it's not like

1086
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,679
it's real dense I want to get air

1087
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:17,039
movement happening everywhere around

1088
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:19,019
these around my buds now so yeah I cut

1089
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:21,300
them into like just nice big individual

1090
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:23,820
branches hang them all in the side of

1091
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,500
tent or inside a nice room

1092
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,660
and I'd let them hang just just like

1093
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,519
that individually so I don't hang I

1094
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:30,179
don't hang just big scrog plants I

1095
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:32,820
definitely

1096
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:34,199
a little bit how long do you drive for

1097
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,760
and what are your drying conditions

1098
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:37,799
temperature and humidity

1099
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,800
I like to keep my temperature anywhere

1100
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,560
from like say 60 to

1101
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,800
4 degrees Fahrenheit and anywhere from

1102
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:50,578
like say 60 to like or I should say like

1103
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,780
from 58 to 63 degrees or percent

1104
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,420
humidity

1105
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,400
so and I'll let them hang up in there as

1106
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,019
long as I keep those conditions in that

1107
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,820
environment they can sit there for as

1108
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:01,619
long as they want to

1109
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,500
because pretty much they're going to be

1110
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:06,838
carrying themselves in those conditions

1111
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,460
after I like like first I'll okay I

1112
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:10,259
should go back a little bit like when I

1113
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,300
do Harvest I take off the big fan leaves

1114
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,220
right away so I'll break down into

1115
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,720
individual branches take off those big

1116
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:17,098
huge fan leaves that I don't want but

1117
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,358
I'll leave like the little sugar leaves

1118
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:20,519
is what people call them the sugar

1119
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:22,920
leaves I'll leave them on there and then

1120
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,179
I hang all the branches and then I go

1121
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,940
back about

1122
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:29,039
I'll go back like say eight days nine

1123
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,079
days later and I'll do another dry trim

1124
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:33,719
just trim off all my branches

1125
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,579
and I'll I'm usually like I have a nice

1126
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:37,618
environment that I dry in so I'm not in

1127
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:39,539
a tent I go right up into my space I can

1128
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:41,519
sit there at a desk so I just keep on

1129
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:44,759
hanging them and I let my let my plants

1130
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:46,858
cure in the environment that I hang them

1131
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,660
to dry in right after harvest you

1132
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:50,400
letting them cure so you're you're going

1133
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:51,899
through the dry period but then they're

1134
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,059
just continuing it on through the Cure

1135
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,039
how long are they caring for and when

1136
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:58,259
you put them into containers yeah so

1137
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:59,579
like I'll hang them I'll let them hang

1138
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,079
up there for like

1139
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:03,420
I've had them hang up there for like

1140
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,859
over two months before like as long as

1141
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,240
it's dark and it's it's at the right

1142
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:08,819
conditions I'll let them sit up there

1143
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,279
for as long as they want until I need

1144
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,900
that space and then I'll jar them up but

1145
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,640
particularly what I want to do is I'll

1146
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,160
leave them in there like if I had like

1147
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:18,779
if I had to like get going I leave them

1148
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:21,179
in there for at least say 14 days

1149
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,160
hanging up there drying in the dark and

1150
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:25,078
then I would jar them and then I would

1151
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:27,358
burp them every single day for at least

1152
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,400
say probably half an hour and I would

1153
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:31,619
get the humidity packs to put in my jars

1154
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,480
at like probably like 60 humidity just

1155
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:35,820
to keep it safe in there

1156
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,260
but yeah like I always found that it

1157
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,599
works out just to keep them in my space

1158
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,880
so they keep nice and cold and a nice

1159
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,820
humidity and daycare in there for me

1160
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:49,019
just like that okay got it have you ever

1161
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:51,960
tried using those uh Grove bags

1162
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:53,219
I've used the Grove bags before too

1163
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,199
uh

1164
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:57,239
I I do like them

1165
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,919
but I honestly like I do prefer the jar

1166
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,139
method if I was to pick a method I'd

1167
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,180
probably go back to the jar method I

1168
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:04,799
didn't do the grilled bags quite 100

1169
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:07,319
you're supposed to do it you're supposed

1170
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,420
to like uh heat seal the top of the rim

1171
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,640
like of the bag and I didn't I didn't do

1172
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,599
that state that step so I can't really

1173
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:16,440
like

1174
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:18,180
give my opinion on them fully but um I I

1175
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,500
did I did like them I know that they

1176
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:20,940
they probably did their job but I might

1177
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,079
have left them in the bag too long it's

1178
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,059
not something that you want to leave in

1179
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,680
there for a very extended long period of

1180
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:27,000
time you want to let them kind of cure

1181
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:28,618
and then take them out of that bag and

1182
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,440
put them into like jars or something

1183
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:34,320
that was my that was my experience but

1184
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,960
like I said I didn't heat seal the bag

1185
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,519
so that might have messed it up that's

1186
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,559
interesting yeah you actually just got

1187
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:42,000
the Grove bags that's funny I was I

1188
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:43,619
forget what video I was I think it was

1189
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,480
on the from the stash podcast because I

1190
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:47,640
have another podcast and we we talked

1191
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,559
about it and the comments would just

1192
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:52,078
flooded with people that are like jars

1193
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:53,759
are outdated this is 2022. everyone use

1194
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,079
good Grove bags and I was like what the

1195
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,720
heck are these grilled bags so I went

1196
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,160
and bought some and I just started using

1197
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:01,259
them so I didn't really have an opinion

1198
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:03,899
on them yet but it sounds like a game

1199
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:07,500
changer I mean supposedly you you put

1200
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:09,780
your dried bud in there and then it it

1201
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,760
cures itself it gets no burping you

1202
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,560
don't need to burp it all apparently and

1203
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,060
that kind of cures in the bag you don't

1204
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:17,219
even need to open up the bag or anything

1205
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:18,779
so um yeah I'm definitely gonna have to

1206
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:21,480
try that out a little bit more I'm using

1207
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,859
a storage right now and I want to see

1208
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,420
particularly I live in a very dry

1209
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:27,000
climate and I want to see if it's

1210
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,559
sucking up the humidity some people had

1211
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,420
said that they live in dry climates and

1212
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:33,299
they're humidity at you know their blood

1213
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,619
turns crumbles up over time so I want to

1214
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,180
prevent obviously prevent that from

1215
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,680
happening but yeah I just wanted to get

1216
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,239
your opinion on the on the Grove bag

1217
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,539
since they seem to be a hot product here

1218
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:44,759
in 2022. yeah they are did you uh did

1219
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:47,400
you heat seal the top of your bag

1220
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:50,220
no I just just sealed up the bag with

1221
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:53,039
the and then put it into max in my wine

1222
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:54,719
fridge I have it set to 60 degrees and

1223
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,820
actually I did put a packet there I put

1224
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:59,219
some uh those humidity packs in some of

1225
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:01,079
them and I put the I didn't put the unit

1226
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:02,399
packs in other ones so I'm going to kind

1227
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,039
of see the difference on that as well

1228
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,318
yeah well I did I actually talked to the

1229
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:09,420
girl big like the manufacturers like

1230
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:11,818
right at the company themselves I met I

1231
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:14,099
met some guy at some conference and he

1232
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:16,079
told me that he highly recommends that

1233
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:18,000
you need to heat seal that top of those

1234
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,980
rims it even says that you have to heat

1235
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,539
seal those for them to work the way that

1236
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,818
they are designed to or else they will

1237
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:25,858
not that dry air end in the bag

1238
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:27,599
so you need like you need to heat if you

1239
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:29,219
want to really do a proper test you got

1240
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,740
to heat seal it and what he said to me

1241
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:34,259
was use your girlfriend's hair

1242
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:36,239
straightener and just go and just clamp

1243
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,980
it on the bag and just warm it up a

1244
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,019
little bit and it'll stay tight I'm like

1245
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,880
okay man like I'll try it my next round

1246
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:44,338
but I'm not gonna go do that now but

1247
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,838
yeah he said he he said you got to heat

1248
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:47,460
seal them or it's not going to do what

1249
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:49,619
you think it's going to do

1250
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:52,079
oh man I didn't know that yeah so I was

1251
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:53,460
doing it wrong but uh let's get back to

1252
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,720
the scrog I do have like one more

1253
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,358
question and then we can kind of wrap

1254
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:59,039
things up yield a lot of people are

1255
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:01,019
trying to do this drug technique

1256
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:03,300
specifically specifically for yield

1257
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:05,159
purposes have you ever measured yield

1258
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,839
when doing the scog technique like do

1259
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:08,519
you have like a yield per square foot or

1260
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:10,500
anything like that like

1261
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:12,059
to measure yield when I was younger when

1262
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,739
I was actually growing it for the reason

1263
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:15,059
of

1264
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:18,479
quantity

1265
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:20,400
but um ever since probably say like the

1266
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,219
last 10 years I don't even I don't even

1267
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,960
weigh my Harvest anymore but what I can

1268
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:27,480
say is like I used to always use a five

1269
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,000
by five screen and I used to always roll

1270
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,800
four plants under it and I typically

1271
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,380
would get say like

1272
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,280
eight ounces per plant on a two-month

1273
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,039
veg

1274
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,920
so I'd be like over a pound per pound

1275
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:43,019
per run on my five by five frame I would

1276
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,440
always get over a pound per run

1277
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:49,920
out of four plants over a two-month veg

1278
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:52,440
so like the longer that you veg the

1279
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,119
bigger your yield will be but in my mind

1280
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,338
nowadays

1281
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:58,318
the bigger your yield the less your

1282
00:44:56,338 --> 00:45:00,059
quality because I just feel like the

1283
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:03,179
bigger the plant is and the bigger the

1284
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:05,460
buds are the less quality is there I

1285
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:07,679
always now I find that my smaller plants

1286
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,720
are actually more potent and more

1287
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,338
powerful and more dense and they just

1288
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,098
smoke a lot better compared to my big

1289
00:45:11,338 --> 00:45:16,078
huge plants that yield like say 15

1290
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:18,059
ounces per plant like yeah that's

1291
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,859
amazing but look at like it just doesn't

1292
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:22,318
smoke that nice it just feels like it

1293
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:23,818
just got like just fed a lot and like

1294
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,400
it's just not as nice as my little

1295
00:45:23,818 --> 00:45:28,318
plants that that only veg for two months

1296
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,240
that you know what I mean like that's

1297
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:32,519
just where I came to now so but with

1298
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,858
that being said like you're definitely

1299
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:36,599
gonna probably yield a bit more strong

1300
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:39,719
than you would typically off a normal

1301
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:42,359
kind of plant but only because you're

1302
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:44,818
going to be growing top dense colas on

1303
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:47,460
your screen and every bud you have is

1304
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:50,639
going to be a top Colo that has density

1305
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,679
to it a lot of plants a lot of ways that

1306
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,139
people grow is they'll have a lot of Bud

1307
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:56,578
but a lot of those lower buds are not

1308
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:58,199
going to be dense and they're not going

1309
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:00,300
to be that much quality to it because

1310
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:02,759
it's going to be fluffy mud

1311
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,280
uh so yeah I just find that with the way

1312
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,800
that I strong I have about 70 top

1313
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,980
collars per plant that's the average 70

1314
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,140
top colas and they're all about like say

1315
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,900
around six to eight inches tall and

1316
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:18,779
they're all dense and and yeah I

1317
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,818
definitely yield a lot off one plant

1318
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,440
but I don't measure it anymore I'm not

1319
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:24,358
I'm not there to do that I'm there just

1320
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,700
to just enjoy it myself and my family

1321
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:30,420
really I agree that there's definitely a

1322
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:32,879
balance between yield and quality and if

1323
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:35,700
we pack up for a second quality is so

1324
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,579
subjective right equality to me can be

1325
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:40,318
different to you to the next grower to

1326
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:43,440
the next grow so some people might think

1327
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:45,358
that non-dense buds are quality

1328
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,519
that could be quality to them right the

1329
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:49,739
area stuff that might be quality to them

1330
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,679
and they might say the dent stuff isn't

1331
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:54,419
good quality you know so it's really

1332
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:56,639
really subjective is what I found

1333
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,380
because in the comment section it's just

1334
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,000
people debate about it all day long on

1335
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,220
what's quality and what's not quality

1336
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,460
and it's just it's funny yeah like some

1337
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:07,199
people love flowers that foxtail with

1338
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,880
like so much box tails on them they love

1339
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,519
that they see the trichome production on

1340
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,740
the foxtail but like I wouldn't like I

1341
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:17,039
don't like foxtails so much I like a

1342
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:19,139
nice indicate density flower compared to

1343
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:20,338
like a sativa Fox tailing plant so like

1344
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:22,559
yeah you're right like everyone has

1345
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,940
their own preference even in styles that

1346
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,559
they grow

1347
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,019
um everyone everyone has preferences in

1348
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:30,059
every way they do things in life so and

1349
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:32,159
they all work really everything works as

1350
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:33,900
long as it works for you absolutely and

1351
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:35,639
just like today talking about the scrog

1352
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,500
technique I mean this is just one way to

1353
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:39,059
go about it it's your style of doing it

1354
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,800
there could be a whole bunch of other

1355
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:42,719
people that do it differently than the

1356
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,760
way you do it and it's not really a

1357
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:45,959
right or wrong right there's just it's a

1358
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,339
different way to do it and that actually

1359
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,019
brings up a question for the folks

1360
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:50,578
tuning into this do you do this drug

1361
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:52,739
technique let me know in the comments

1362
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:54,359
how do you do it do you do it the same

1363
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:55,559
way that Troy does it or do you do it

1364
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:57,179
differently I'd love to hear your

1365
00:47:55,559 --> 00:48:00,299
techniques down in the comment section

1366
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:02,519
below is there any other things about

1367
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:05,039
the scrog technique that we missed or do

1368
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:06,239
you have any general advice for new

1369
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:08,039
gardeners

1370
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:09,539
um well for yeah for new gardeners one

1371
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:11,699
thing that I always try to tell every

1372
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:13,679
one of them is don't over water your

1373
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:15,960
seedlings like when you first start

1374
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,759
growing that's one of the main things

1375
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,500
that people mess up on is just over

1376
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,240
watering their plants

1377
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,818
plants don't need to be over watered

1378
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:25,799
they need oxygen so your little plants

1379
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:27,599
let those pots dry out before you add

1380
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,460
more water to them that's that's a

1381
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,440
that's a really important step for a new

1382
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,818
grower because I've that's what I

1383
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,679
stumbled upon when I first started a

1384
00:48:32,818 --> 00:48:36,900
long time ago and everyone I teach they

1385
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:39,239
stumbled upon that as well they drown

1386
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,880
their plants basically they need oxygen

1387
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:43,259
and uh and for the straw technique the

1388
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,240
only thing that I can advise people with

1389
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,660
if you want to try this out is to build

1390
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:50,159
your frames of on a platform or even on

1391
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:52,440
the ground if you're comfortable but you

1392
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:55,019
need to build it to make yourself have

1393
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:57,539
accessibility around it and able to work

1394
00:48:55,019 --> 00:49:00,119
on your frame so if you're you're in a

1395
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:03,300
if you're in a 4x4 tent and it only has

1396
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:05,220
one door in that tent you might not want

1397
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,560
to scrog the way I do because you're

1398
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:09,779
going to need to get to the side of it

1399
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:11,699
and you might need to get behind it a

1400
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,160
lot of tents have two doors so that

1401
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:16,679
works or you can buy tents like I have I

1402
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,659
have tents that have like it has one

1403
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:21,118
main door and then two side doors that

1404
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:22,679
come that flap down so you can work on

1405
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,358
each sides or the front you need to be

1406
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:26,639
able to access at least three sides of

1407
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:28,078
your straw that's that's important for

1408
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:29,279
anyone who wants to get into this and

1409
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,380
you want to make your screen size

1410
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,440
comfortable for you to work on with your

1411
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:36,420
hands and water good tips so wrapping

1412
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,039
things up how can the listeners find you

1413
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,380
and what do you have upcoming in the

1414
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:41,880
future well right now I

1415
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,800
have something really exciting happening
