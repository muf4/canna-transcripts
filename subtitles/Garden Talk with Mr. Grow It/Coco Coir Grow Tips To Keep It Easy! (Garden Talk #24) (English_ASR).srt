1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,759
coming up on garden talk as soon as a

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,919
root busts out

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,918
and exposed to the air it's getting

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,240
colonized by bacteria so whether it's

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:10,879
negative bad bacteria like pythium root

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,120
rots

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,160
or it's positive bacteria like bacillus

8
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,558
that are actually going to feed the

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,399
plant

10
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,839
you've got to give some kind of place

11
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:21,118
for those guys to grow

12
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:23,518
60 cocoa 20 percent pearlite 20

13
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,359
castings and then i will put a little

14
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,919
bit of rock dust in there like that

15
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,240
azomite or just glacial rock dust

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,840
there's very specific mycorrhizaes that

17
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,799
work for very specific

18
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,679
plants you know so like you'll see

19
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:37,279
ectomycorrhizae on some labels

20
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,039
unless you're growing pine trees

21
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,719
ectomycorrhizae ain't going to help you

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,759
i want people to have success you can

147
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,319

148
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,000

you i was hanging out last night i

151
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,479
watched vader and the painted lady with

152
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,478
yes

153
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,079
man there's not that much great content

154
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,639
to absorb at least

155
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,000
not if you turn on the tv so youtube is

156
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,680
that double-edged sword you've got to

157
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,800
watch yourself on there but i'll be

158
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,360
damned that there isn't

159
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,960
a ton of great information to consume or

160
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,160
just people to hang out with the idea

161
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,519
with our show

162
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,439
is to have people to hang out with

163
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,959
hopefully you got some like-minded folks

164
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,240
that are hanging out half the time we're

165
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,000
talking growing

166
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,918
and half the time we're just talking

167
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,360
culture you know having someone to hang

168
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,198
out with whether you're in your grow or

169
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,479
in the greenhouse or

170
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,160
in your car exactly

171
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,439
so before we get to our topic today

172
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,000
we're going to talk about kind of the

173
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,160
easiest way

174
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
to grow simplify growing can you tell us

175
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,880
a little bit about yourself and kind of

176
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,400
how you got into gardening

177
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,519
i got into gardening by trying to make a

178
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,239
better product

179
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,359
i saw you the medicine that i that was

180
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,400
out there

181
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,560
just it didn't even remind me of a plant

182
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,560
it reminded me of a product and i

183
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,439
thought to myself how can i

184
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,759
uh it comes with seeds you know how can

185
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,680
i

186
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,280
do a better job with this how can i make

187
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,038
better medicine for me

188
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,399
and to share with my friends it really

189
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,519
is medicine to me

190
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,599
it always has been so uh yeah that

191
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,519
brought me to a heck of a long journey i

192
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,199
started in 1991

193
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,839
basically learning you know going to the

194
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,360
the grocery store buying the hyphen

195
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,599
you know potting mix what you could find

196
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,560
at kmart or walmart whatever it was back

197
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
then

198
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,399
and uh you know literally just just

199
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,439
starting from scratch

200
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,439
like that and it took uh

201
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,038
it was actually a journey i started with

202
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,279
putting a seed in uh

203
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,519
you know in some soil and then i started

204
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:14,799
getting enamored with the technology

205
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,318
hey there's you know is this uh is this

206
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,919
there's a machine that will grow this

207
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,960
for you and it'll grow these you know

208
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,279
beautiful beautiful quality flowers and

209
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,560
that

210
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,478
uh you can't really treat

211
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,600
flowers or something living like a

212
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,560
machine you know

213
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,039
it took me 20 20 years to figure that

214
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,519
out

215
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,240
you know that i would grow in deep water

216
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,318
culture

217
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,478
i would grow in all these different uh

218
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,520
unnatural systems i treated a plant like

219
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,519
a machine

220
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,719
and i would grow decent quality but it

221
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,359
just wouldn't uh

222
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,199
it was just missing something and uh

223
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,520
yeah when i learned how to treat

224
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,038
uh plants like plants like something

225
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,799
living you know whether it's more like a

226
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,639
pet than a machine

227
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
i was really able to to get better

228
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,199
that's when i really hit my stride of

229
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,000
growing

230
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,800
and uh yeah i've been doing it was 30

231
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,240
years

232
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,520
jeez 30 years man it's a long time for

233
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,439
sure

234
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,519
yeah and it's been an evolution i mean i

235
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,759
am i was originally

236
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,279
growing medicinal herbs and then i kind

237
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,038
of got enamored by

238
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,318
i went to i bought my first house and i

239
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,079
went to go buy a

240
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,479
privacy fence and somebody says you know

241
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,560
what if you actually put bamboo up

242
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,079
it's natural and it's a natural privacy

243
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,800
fence and i was like bamboo who the hell

244
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,240
heard of that

245
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,120
you know i heard of palm trees i'm from

246
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,918
south florida but a bamboo was a niche

247
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,120
and i ended up buying 20 acres taking

248
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,439
the very simple

249
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,478
uh lessons that i knew about growing

250
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,719
from

251
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,240
uh you know from growing medicinal herbs

252
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,599
and bringing them into bamboo

253
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,759
and it was kind of funny i really

254
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,439
actually got my butt handed to me

255
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,280
because i would go like first thing i

256
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,000
wanted to do is put 20 acres on liquid

257
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,598
feed

258
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,038
you know just like we do we go buy

259
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,639
bottled nutrients where they were like

260
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,759
you're going to go broke buddy you know

261
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,319
what do you want you know

262
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,280
a thousand liters of of three containers

263
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,919
of liquid feed

264
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,839
so very quickly you kind of learn how

265
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,680
how things scale up and what works and

266
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,359
what doesn't work in those situations so

267
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,478
it was a heck of an education man

268
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,720
that's pretty cool i didn't know that

269
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,399
about you so let me ask you

270
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,319
uh you know a lot of people want

271
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,198
different things out of growing right

272
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,400
like some people

273
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,919
i think a lot of people jump to the

274
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,279
assumption that everything's about yield

275
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:18,878
everybody just wants the biggest

276
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,559
possible flowers

277
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,680
it's not really the case for everybody

278
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,399
though i know some people that chase

279
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,800
after

280
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,239
taste smell there's some people i know i

281
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,598
mentioned in a past podcast

282
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,319
one of the things i strive for is

283
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:33,200
efficiency having a deficient grow

284
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,918
for you what's the goal with growing to

285
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,879
get the harvest

286
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,079
i say that really it's a tie between to

287
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,278
get clean medicine

288
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,639
for me and my friends to enjoy but when

289
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:45,200
i'm talking to other people about

290
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,360
growing

291
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,399
even when i'm thinking about myself it

292
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,000
is to get to

293
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,039
harvest it is not that easy to

294
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,278
uh provide your plants with 100

295
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:02,319
110 115 days worth of very consistent

296
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:05,439
uh environment food watering

297
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,200
uh ipm all that stuff to go for

298
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,279
you know you know three months three and

299
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,959
a half months it's not easy

300
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,320
i mean if you're just hand watering and

301
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,479
you miss uh

302
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,560
what two days you know [ __ ] i wasn't

303
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,720
feeling so well a couple days ago

304
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,719
and i just didn't have the energy to get

305
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,160
up and water my plants

306
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,839
and i was like if i don't get up and

307
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,039
water my plants it's 11 50

308
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,000
you know it's 11 35 my uh lights go off

309
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,278
at midnight

310
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,360
and i better go out there and water them

311
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,240
or they're gonna all die you know

312
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,159
it's like uh it's not that easy to have

313
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,639
120 days of success

314
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,399
so that is what i really tried the whole

315
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,000
growing simplified thing

316
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,559
i want people to have success you can

317
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,200
grow the biggest damn tree you want

318
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,559
but if it wilts on you know five days

319
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,959
before harvest because you forgot the

320
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,719
water

321
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,199
guess what you know that really is the

322
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,600
goal

323
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,000
growing big plants and growing all that

324
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,159
stuff is really a matter of strain

325
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,159
now what you pick if you want to pick i

326
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,159
don't think they still make big bud

327
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,319
you know a blue dream or gorilla glue

328
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,039
one of those giant ones you can grow

329
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,440
you can pick what you want um but

330
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,799
there's

331
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,800
all sorts of things some people want to

332
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,719
do that some people just want

333
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,838
what i want which is to share great

334
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,360
medicine with

335
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,600
our friends our family those in need

336
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,399
it's it happens here in colorado and it

337
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,879
is a joy

338
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,759
and it is such a different experience

339
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,078
than it is

340
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,519
in commercial markets i'll say that

341
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,599
makes sense

342
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,440
all right now let's get into indoor

343
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,519
gardening and your style of

344
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,560
keeping things easy let's start with the

345
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,240
medium what

346
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,679
medium do you like to grow in when

347
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,079
you're keeping things simple

348
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,919
excellent and cocoa i love telling

349
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,039
people about cocoa

350
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,759
cocoa core first of all it is well it's

351
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,719
renewable

352
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,838
i was in costa rica recently and between

353
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,519
there and florida

354
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,360
you'll never see so many coconuts

355
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,200
coconut palm very easy to grow it

356
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,200
doesn't take a ton of resources

357
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,278
grows the coconut the world's biggest

358
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,120
seed first of all i think that's a trip

359
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,879
but when you peel that thing all that

360
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
pith and all that stuff that comes off

361
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,360
it

362
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
is great growing media i mean if you

363
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,240
think about it that just came out of the

364
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,679
earth

365
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,759
you know that was just growing your

366
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,759
growing media was just grown

367
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,200
as opposed to pete where i used to live

368
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,639
uh uh

369
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
have a place in florida when i would

370
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,399
drive by there was a peat bog

371
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,359
and they would actually be mining the

372
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,039
peat they would actually have a

373
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,039
bulldozer going and they were tearing

374
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,799
out the earth that pete takes

375
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,078
you know i don't know millions of years

376
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,399
to become pete

377
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,559
and it kind of if i got my choice of a

378
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,600
year to get coconut husks you know

379
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,119
out of uh off of coconut or you know

380
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,720
millions of years of peat that they're

381
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,720
mining from the earth i'd rather do the

382
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,278
coconut but that's just

383
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,320
that's just honestly ethically i guess

384
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,759
the performance is

385
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,040
way better man coco core holds moisture

386
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:56,399
and air way better than pete does

387
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:58,480
peat will compact and it's really hard

388
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,159
to get a lot of air into pete or at

389
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,240
least you better aerate it well

390
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,360
as to where cocoa you can take just

391
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,240
cocoa with no

392
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,839
aeration no perlite anything like that

393
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,959
and use it as a media

394
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,760
and it works awesome and so it uh it

395
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,799
holds a lot of

396
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,639
air but the best thing about it is even

397
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,639
when you let it dry

398
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,759
it re-wets very easily i don't know if

399
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,360
you've ever used

400
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,278
i'm sure you've used peeps but for the

401
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,120
listeners peter's one of those things if

402
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,799
you screw up and let it get a little bit

403
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,519
too dry as to where you can kind of see

404
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,199
the

405
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,440
you know it's pulled away from the side

406
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,278
of the container you are going to have a

407
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,839
difficult time or it's going to take you

408
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,159
a very long time of just dropping a tiny

409
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,160
bit of water on there letting it absorb

410
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,000
until that peat re-wets and they call

411
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,120
hydrophobic it becomes

412
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,240
scared of water man it's just so much

413
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,039
easier to re-wet cocoa and uh

414
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,799
yeah i love cocoa when i first came to

415
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,879
colorado i was fairly intimidated i came

416
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,039
here in 2009

417
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,200
i was the backpack days and you really

418
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,039
had to have your act together

419
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,639
and uh when i came here i looked for

420
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,000
anything i could i talked to my buddy

421
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,320
corey over a way to grow

422
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,240
is the owner there i said come on give

423
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,600
me any advantage i can

424
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,720
and he said can a coco can a and b

425
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,600
and uh 10 gallon smart pots pretty damn

426
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,920
easy system

427
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,839
and you pour equal parts a and b in

428
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,199
there you know you test it to a thousand

429
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,079
ppm you make sure your

430
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,200
ph is okay you pour that water on there

431
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,199
a couple times a week

432
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,800
and uh you get the harvest it's pretty

433
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,200
damn cool

434
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,159
so you're using the bagged cocoa instead

435
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,600
of the

436
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,319
bricked cocoa and then and then

437
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,360
hydrating or what yeah we can talk about

438
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,278
that i've tried

439
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,360
all sorts of ways i have definitely

440
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,919
ordered the brick cocoa off amazon i've

441
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,519
been like

442
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,360
yeah come on let's see how cheap i'm

443
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,480
telling you i want to see how

444
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,399
inexpensive simple we can make growing

445
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,240
for people so that somebody can say dude

446
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,480
i've got a balcony or i've got a porch

447
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,879
and i've always wanted to grow something

448
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,399
i tell you what this looks so damn easy

449
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,838
you know you water it you know for some

450
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,278
of these bottom feeding buckets you

451
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,320
water them once a week or you water it

452
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,000
every 10 days

453
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,600
i can leave it outside on my patio i

454
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,639
didn't know that and i'll actually grow

455
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,959
something that i can use that's kind of

456
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,360
what

457
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,239
that is the the message that i want to

458
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,240
put out there

459
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,000
you know if i can get if i can inspire

460
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,639
someone me and uh my buddy soup the

461
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,879
gardener shout out to growerslove.com

462
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,879
he's a really smart guy really great

463
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,559
with organics

464
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,559
we want everyone to have a two by two

465
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,919
tent whether it's a two by two or four

466
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,198
by four but you just have

467
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:33,679
one plant even if it's just to

468
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,319
experience what it's like to care for a

469
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,838
plant

470
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,920
so you know i don't know if it's as

471
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,839
intense as caring for a dog or

472
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,679
maybe similar to a cat i would say you

473
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,519
know

474
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,519
but man to care for something like that

475
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,360
it really does uh

476
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,799
it really does something to you

477
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,000
absolutely

478
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,519
now with the cocoa are you amending

479
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,799
anything in it to begin

480
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,000
or are you just taking it straight out

481
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,879
of the bag and then putting into the

482
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,720
container

483
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,320
you know in the beginning i was just

484
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,278
taking it straight out of the bag i was

485
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,760
relying on

486
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,278
it becomes really nutrient dependent i

487
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,480
think when you do that when i bought

488
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,639
canna

489
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,480
nutrients i definitely bought can of

490
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,320
cocoa i do believe there's something i'm

491
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,240
not a chemist i've never i've never even

492
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,680
made it to chemistry class

493
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,839
but uh from a guru grow guru is uh

494
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,599
uh my co-host on the do grow show he's

495
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,560
the guy that that went to college for

496
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,839
all this stuff

497
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,239
there are different buffering agents and

498
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,160
coach

499
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,919
cocoa has a bunch of potassium in it so

500
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,078
they they buffer it

501
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:33,599
and so it works with the nutrients

502
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,519
that's why when you get a nutrient line

503
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,519
they usually have a cocoa

504
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,198
i that's where i started with of course

505
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,959
when you when you're baking a cake you

506
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,399
start out with a recipe right and then

507
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,319
you start saying hey let me put a little

508
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,639
more sugar in it let me put some

509
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,720
purple food color no i'm just kidding

510
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,320
but uh you start with a recipe so after

511
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,480
like i like cocoa

512
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,639
it didn't remind me of soil though when

513
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,560
i would look at it i

514
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,159
started learning about soil microbes i

515
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,439
started learning that

516
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,759
nature fills a vacuum so i would have

517
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,079
problems i tried all sorts of stuff

518
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,879
deep water culture straight up cocoa

519
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,919
which is

520
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,919
which is hydroponics and what i find is

521
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,039
when i didn't have a real media in there

522
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,039
when i didn't have something that at

523
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,599
least resembled soil

524
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,719
i left myself open to pathogens i left

525
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,480
myself open to

526
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,600
pythium just different root rots i

527
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,278
didn't even know what they were i just

528
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,278
know i'd show up one day

529
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,519
and one of my plants was just dead dead

530
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,120
from the inside you know so

531
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,560
i was just trying to figure that out and

532
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,039
what i learned was

533
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,239
like i said nature fills a vacuum if i

534
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,399
cut my finger

535
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,480
and i sterilize you know sterilize the

536
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,919
cut and then i sterilize some soil like

537
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,440
i just bake it bring you know

538
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,039
bring it out of the of the oven where

539
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,720
it's baked and sterilized

540
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,639
if i stick my finger in there my fingers

541
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,480
not gonna stay sterile it's gonna

542
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,039
there's gonna be infection pathogens

543
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
that come

544
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,319
where do they come from i don't know

545
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,560
bacteria is everywhere

546
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,720
so my point is it's difficult it's

547
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,679
impossible to keep something completely

548
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,560
sterile i mean it takes a lot of

549
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,078
of uh equipment to do that you know it's

550
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,000
like a scientific thing as soon as you

551
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,000
bring things out as soon as a root

552
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,078
you know busts out and exposed to the

553
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,038
air it's getting uh colonized by

554
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,959
bacteria

555
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,959
so whether it's negative bad bacteria

556
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,199
like pythium root rots

557
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,240
or it's positive bacteria like bacillus

558
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,439
that are actually going to feed the

559
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,679
plant

560
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,360
you've got to give some kind of place

561
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,798
for those guys to grow

562
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,119
you know those microbes those living

563
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,119
soil microbes to grow

564
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,279
rockwool pretty difficult rockwell's

565
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,000
like spun stone so it doesn't want to do

566
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,319
it you can maybe

567
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,279
get mycorrhizae on there but it really

568
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,960
doesn't want to

569
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,119
colonize on rockwool on the expanded

570
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,840
coco the expanded pellets the clay

571
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,479
pellets it's really difficult to grow

572
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,119
any kind of beneficial bacteria on there

573
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,720
so

574
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,159
the only things that will grow on there

575
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,079
or what loves to grow on there and

576
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,919
colonize is the bad stuff the root

577
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,879
eating stuff the pythium and

578
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,200
the rots and what's not so i really

579
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,120
started learning that the key to

580
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,679
whatever you're growing is to add some

581
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:03,918
kind of to emulate soil to add some kind

582
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,038
of

583
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,280
organic material to it so for me it was

584
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:11,200
earthworm casting so earthworm castings

585
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,359
loaded with microbes it's either loaded

586
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,880
with microbes it's dead microbes it's a

587
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,719
home for microbes

588
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,640
and even when those microbes die they

589
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,798
just turn into soil organic

590
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,720
matter just just more organic that's

591
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,960
what you want that's what soil makes

592
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,919
is it makes organic matter it breaks

593
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,919
down

594
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,600
you know leaf tissue and whatnot and it

595
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,038
takes that organic matter but turns it

596
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,798
into soil organic matter

597
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,079
food from the microbes home for the

598
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:35,839
microbes

599
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,000
uh so that that's what i learned i

600
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:42,480
started adding more and more castings in

601
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,960
i'm to about 20 castings uh to about

602
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,000
trying to think i want to say it's about

603
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,759
67

604
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,919
about 60 i don't really measure that

605
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,879
hard you know i might forget as i'm

606
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,840
i'm dumping the bucket but about 60

607
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,600
castings 20

608
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:58,959
perlite uh shoot i'm forgetting

609
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,119
something i know i'll put a little bit

610
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,440
of biochar in there hang on i wrote this

611
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,719
down

612
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,759
60 cocoa 20 pearl leg 20

613
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,600
castings and then i will put a little

614
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:10,480
bit of rock dust in there like that

615
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:12,719
azomite

616
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,919
or just glacial rock dust and all that

617
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,759
is it's just a little bit of

618
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,559
micronutrients in there that the plant

619
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,640
can't access or the microbes can access

620
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,480
uh just a tiny bit of that works you

621
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,160
need literally parts per billion or some

622
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,599
of some of those things

623
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,440
uh and then one thing i've been playing

624
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,279
with is biochar

625
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,279
you've been messing with biochar lately

626
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,798
yeah i've had uh i had my hands on

627
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,319
biochar i mixed it in

628
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,160
on a couple different grows i love that

629
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,079
stuff yeah i've been getting a shout out

630
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,840
to biochar now which is a colorado

631
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,599
company that actually makes a really

632
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,119
good biochar you can kind of sometimes

633
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,798
it looks like charcoal

634
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,239
or you know something that came out of

635
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,599
the bottom of the fire

636
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,240
but there's a beautiful little

637
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,000
pelletized activated biochar and

638
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,440
what that does it's just got a bunch of

639
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,640
little holes just like the carbon

640
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,960
filters

641
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,759
excuse me the carbon filters have a

642
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,600
bunch of

643
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,200
they're very porous the carbon is in

644
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,599
there so as the

645
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,120
uh odors go through it they're captured

646
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,359
there's just a whole bunch of air in

647
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,678
there well all those air spaces can also

648
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,119
be used as homes for microbes

649
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,600
so by just adding a little bit of

650
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,038
biochar in there a it air rates but bike

651
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,678
is such a great

652
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,879
great home for microbes so yeah that's

653
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,480
that's kind of what i've been playing

654
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,280
with lately and just been having

655
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,400
great results man awesome yeah i looked

656
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,599
at one of you i watched one of your

657
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,880
recent videos

658
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,319
and uh man you grow some massive plants

659
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,360
indoors i was looking at i don't know

660
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,359
how tall you are

661
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,719
but these plants were had to have been

662
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,119
just as tall as you if not

663
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,200
taller than you uh i'm only four foot

664
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:42,000
tall so i mean there i knew that

665
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,519
no i'm just kidding but you got some big

666
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,200
plants i was wondering what what size

667
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,679
containers are those plants in

668
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,600
those are in five gallon hempy buckets

669
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,798
and uh i'll get into that in a second

670
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,599
the reason i grow

671
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,200
uh plants is just because of of how the

672
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,079
laws work and the reason i grow very

673
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,200
large plants

674
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,960
is how the laws work you know um i want

675
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,000
to show people that you can take a two

676
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,798
by two or a two

677
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,119
by four tent and it's going to take you

678
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,558
you know 100 120 days whatever it is

679
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,519
three four months

680
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,000
uh to get through to that harvest but

681
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,400
that

682
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
that is a worthy investment that you can

683
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,038
make that worth your while that you

684
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
can uh create a make your own

685
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:24,480
very clean medicinal or medicine uh

686
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,519
without going to a store without

687
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,440
uh you know having to you know venture

688
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,519
in the unknown i mean we're talking

689
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,279
medicine here i mean you can wink about

690
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,440
it all you want people might and

691
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,440
you know might make them feel good but

692
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,360
this is real medicine for people and

693
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,159
especially for sick people

694
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,959
uh if they're inhaling you know somebody

695
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,480
wanted to

696
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,558
make sure that they got the harvest so

697
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,200
they sprayed eagle 20 on there which is

698
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:49,599
a

699
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,480
pesticide that's for ornamental use only

700
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,158
or they

701
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,919
had spider mites and they didn't do the

702
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,440
right thing or you know didn't you know

703
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,880
maybe they needed to cull their crop and

704
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,480
they didn't and he just sprayed some

705
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,559
poison and middle claw bridge

706
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,319
poison on it none of those things have

707
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,240
been tested for us to

708
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,359
ate eat i mean maybe they haven't tested

709
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,038
for us to eat

710
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,599
but they have not been tested for us to

711
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,839
smoke you know so that's a

712
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,519
really uh frightening thing and that's

713
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,639
what makes me want to

714
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,158
uh want to control my own supply chain i

715
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,520
guess you know in the supply chain for

716
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,520
other people who i help

717
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,038
gotcha so five gallon heavy buckets

718
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,000
we'll talk about the empty buckets

719
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:27,440
in detail in a little bit but i i know

720
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,839
you do start in the small

721
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,440
solo cups and then you kind of you must

722
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,959
transplant up eventually into those

723
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,919
containers can you talk about your

724
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,840
you know when you transplant yeah um i

725
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,520
have a kind of unique system i'll try it

726
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,000
i hope it's not too complicated i'll try

727
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:42,558
to share

728
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,599
it but it's a it's a 12 plant system it

729
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,240
basically has four

730
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,839
stages so the idea is to harvest three

731
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,159
nice plants a month

732
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,439
i have a little six by twelve so it's

733
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,280
something that i think people could

734
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,400
accomplish with a couple tents or

735
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,798
something like that

736
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,679
i have a two foot by i'm sorry i have a

737
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,879
six foot

738
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,798
by two foot veg so just a length of

739
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,080
the width of a closet and then two foot

740
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,240
is my veg

741
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,158
and in there i grow solo cups i have a

742
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,960
couple mothers i actually use a shelving

743
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,480
unit

744
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,480
and i grow a couple mothers on the

745
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,360
bottom uh i will

746
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,558
propagate those into cups just into the

747
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,240
cup and cup method

748
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,918
i'll let them grow for about it's all

749
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,599
predicated on a month so

750
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,960
i'll take the clone let it grow in the

751
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,038
cup for a month

752
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,240
uh then i'll transplant that to a three

753
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:30,319
gallon keep it in veg for another month

754
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,319
then after that i transplant it to a

755
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,319
five gallon which is called a a hempy

756
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,000
bucket or a sip bucket it's basically a

757
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,839
bottom feeding bucket just a little bit

758
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,679
more forgiving with the water

759
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,359
i'll transplant it to a five gallon and

760
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,240
i move it into flowering

761
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,119
very shortly afterwards the idea is

762
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,278
every month

763
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,439
i'm harvesting three plants and moving

764
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:52,640
three new plants into flowering

765
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,038
and it's uh for a 6 by 12 it is

766
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,240
a yielder i mean that that system will

767
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:57,679
really push it

768
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,220
i keep on forgetting the original

769
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,038
question it was transplant

770
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,880
[Laughter]

771
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:04,879
solo and usually i try to do month

772
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,039
interval solo to a three gallon to a

773
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,200
five gallon out to flowering

774
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,359
uh 60 days and they're gone and and

775
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,759
every month i'm continuing to do that

776
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,038
and it's a perpetual harvest gotcha that

777
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,240
makes sense that's a pretty cool system

778
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,240
that you got in place there

779
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,400
i'm trying man i'm trying to do this to

780
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,240
where i use slow release fertilizers

781
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,679
where i incorporate just a simple slow

782
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,558
release fertilizer in there

783
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,919
i mean it is it's gonna say it's so easy

784
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,519
that my friends can take care of it

785
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,960
while i'm on vacation but

786
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,000
i guess it's not that easy

787
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,360
and that's what we're going to talk

788
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,119
about next you know we talked about your

789
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,038
mix your initial mix

790
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,798
kind of getting going what containers to

791
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,480
use transplanting now

792
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,400
nutrients let's talk about what are you

793
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,480
using for nutrients space nutrients

794
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,440
additives microbial inoculants can you

795
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,000
talk to us about that

796
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,440
yeah i mean i've been growing since 1991

797
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,720
so i've been through the mix

798
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,440
and i don't know if a ton has changed uh

799
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,200
three-part

800
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,720
general hydroponics i heard you and i

801
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,159
think was painted lady laughing about

802
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,519
back in the day like that was that was

803
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,720
the only option you went to the grocery

804
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:03,759
store you got three part general

805
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,240
hydroponics

806
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,919
it worked it left you wide open for

807
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,480
pathogens it was the kind of thing that

808
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,720
it wasn't

809
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,558
kind of addressing the roots or any soil

810
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,000
organic matter or that kind of stuff it

811
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:15,599
was basically either

812
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,240
a rockwool it was designed for a

813
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,399
rockwool slab system or hydroponics but

814
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,919
it worked you know worked it was fairly

815
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,320
no frills

816
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,320
uh but then i started going to a little

817
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,158
bit more boutique stuff i've tried i'll

818
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,879
skip fast forward to

819
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,400
when i went to uh colorado started doing

820
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,039
a little bit more boutique stuff i think

821
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,120
that was the

822
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,278
canna a and b which i think i would

823
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:40,319
consider that a boutique brand though

824
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:43,200
sure yes it's certainly not

825
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,480
uh you know bargain basement price but

826
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,038
went to that

827
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,278
uh play hung out there for a few years

828
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:50,960
as far as a very simple system goes i

829
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,640
mean they're by no means a sponsor or

830
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,640
anything like that but just

831
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,679
canon is clean product you put equal

832
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,278
parts a and b

833
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,000
in there you used to match it up with

834
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,720
their cocoa and it's pretty easy to have

835
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,880
success

836
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,679
you know as long as you water them and

837
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,880
have good watering practices which

838
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,480
i don't know if you ever talk about that

839
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,120
it's so damn easy to teach people how to

840
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,240
water

841
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,319
you pick the plant up when it's

842
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,599
saturated and then you go back and you

843
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,918
water when it's about half

844
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:18,158
that weight i mean i love being able to

845
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,679
because over water and underwater

846
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,880
that's those are things that keep people

847
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,240
from getting the harvest and then they

848
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,120
end up throwing the equipment

849
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,480
in the uh you know in the closet and

850
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,199
there's their growing career down the

851
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,640
tubes

852
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,240
yeah that's a that's a good way to put

853
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,799
it i don't think i've heard it that way

854
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,640
before to to saturate it and then to

855
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,639
would you say let it go to halfway and

856
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,000
then water it's about halfway you won't

857
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,278
get in trouble you can't play with

858
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,960
it there but yeah i mean that's a just a

859
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,240
simple rule of thumb i like that i like

860
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,798
to talk to people about

861
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,319
and that's specifically in cocoa in your

862
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:49,679
method right so if soil you'd probably

863
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,599
do something different right

864
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,000
it's a rule of thumb you know it's meant

865
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:54,639
to be it put it this way it'll probably

866
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,640
keep you

867
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,080
keep you from grossly over watering

868
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,000
whatever you're growing

869
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:02,639
that is the biggest problem i think is

870
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,400
people want to love things to death

871
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,559
you know for me i would do you know i

872
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,720
had the general hydroponics three part

873
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,639
and then i would uh get root rot and i'd

874
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,400
be like oh my gosh what can i do for

875
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,000
that man i better go get some hydro

876
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,519
guard and put that on there

877
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,278
i better go get this product and put it

878
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,398
on man they're still not looking good

879
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:22,398
let me put some more on more on and

880
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,319
you're more on for putting more on okay

881
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:25,918
you need to listen to the plant man the

882
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,960
planet you can't just keep what's like

883
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,720
if i'm

884
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,480
just so stuffed i just got back from the

885
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,159
buffet and i feel terrible and i'm like

886
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,610
i feel terrible guys and you go

887
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,320
eat more here here's a steak

888
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:38,079
[Laughter]

889
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:39,599
it's not going to help man so actually

890
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,199
that's where it comes back to understand

891
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,959
that plants are alive

892
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,720
and understanding that they need balance

893
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,000
they need the right proportions

894
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,480
of air water carbon dioxide

895
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,200
in that air which really is the

896
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,000
macronutrient

897
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,960
uh but air water and just a little bit

898
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,200
of nutrients

899
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,240
i mean just that just they don't need

900
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,840
when i say a little bit

901
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,919
a thousand eight hundred nine hundred

902
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,558
parts per million but compared to how

903
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,880
much

904
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,558
carbon it's taking in and it's not that

905
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,200
much you know an air and water it's

906
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:09,599
using

907
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,319
the nutrients are just a little a little

908
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,398
bit there

909
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,798
so you following their feeding schedule

910
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:15,439
for that just doing like a reduced dose

911
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:17,278
and then

912
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,558
are you doing any additives or just the

913
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,640
the base nutrients

914
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:21,759
you know this was a bit ago i will tell

915
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,720
you i'm kind of

916
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,679
i forgot my last year or so i did want

917
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,600
to get some content

918
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,120
so i was doing pretty good with whether

919
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,558
it was kind of a and b that kind of

920
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:33,599
stuff i was doing pretty good with

921
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,678
it commercially no complaints was i

922
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,398
going to win any competitions with it

923
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,320
no and when i started talking and i

924
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,278
started talking to really great growers

925
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,839
i was like hey man

926
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,599
how can i step it up a bit more and you

927
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:46,879
know one guy his name is jaron from new

928
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,639
millennium you should actually see if

929
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,760
you can have him on the show is a wealth

930
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,240
of knowledge

931
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,798
but he would come over and he would just

932
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,720
show me

933
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,398
that he was at the next level and i

934
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,000
asked him he said how do i get there i

935
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,759
actually ask a lot of growers when they

936
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,398
show up and they're at that

937
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,079
9 10 to where i'm just salivating i'm

938
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:04,719
like what's going on there what are you

939
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,879
doing

940
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,960
and so jaren gave me a unique answer he

941
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,960
says it's the nutrients he's got

942
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,720
new millennium is quite a bit different

943
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,640
than what i'm used to i'm used to a

944
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,000
slow release fertilizer that you you

945
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,399
know incorporate in

946
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,200
and kind of get a couple additives from

947
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,599
there

948
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,759
just just to kind of tweak it his is i

949
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,359
want to say it's nine or ten bottles

950
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,158
there are some interesting things there

951
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:30,798
but you control the cow mag you control

952
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,278
uh you can add more p and k if you want

953
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,960
there's

954
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:36,640
fulvix there's uh that winter frost

955
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,079
product which is an actually interesting

956
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,679
thing actually that's a good tip it's

957
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:40,798
winter frost even if you don't use new

958
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,120
millennium

959
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,038
that product will make your uh plants

960
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,879
all finished different strains finish at

961
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,480
the same time it's really valuable for

962
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,159
someone like me that's doing perpetual

963
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,519
harvest things got to be out of there in

964
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,159
a month

965
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:56,000
so i was playing with that but for me

966
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,320
i'm i'm not trying to i had to make a

967
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,200
decision am i really trying to

968
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,879
uh grow top-notch you know 10 flower

969
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,240
that's going to win competitions and

970
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,520
going to have people beating my door

971
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,278
down

972
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,119
no i'm really not i don't have a lot of

973
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,679
ego in it i just want good medicine i

974
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,119
want people to grow good medicine

975
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,880
that they can enjoy that their friends

976
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,398
can enjoy the more the better the more

977
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,880
people that enjoy

978
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,759
good medicine the better this world is

979
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,320
going to be

980
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:24,398
so it doesn't have to be nine or ten you

981
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,000
can grow a plant that's a six or a seven

982
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,000
and that's and that's great you know for

983
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,200
you and your friends it's great for me

984
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,480
that's great for the world man so yeah i

985
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,080
was just thinking that uh

986
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,159
it's a little bit complicated for me it

987
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,038
was nine bottles and so

988
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,240
i went back to just my uh slow release

989
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,359
fertilizer controlled release

990
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,159
fertilizers

991
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,519
gotcha gotcha and then one of the

992
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,360
products which i assume

993
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,798
is in your garden is something i got

994
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:52,240
right here so uh

995
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:53,679
recharge these are microbes and you are

996
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,359
the owner of this company right can you

997
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,880
talk to us a little bit about recharge

998
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,000
and kind of how you incorporate in your

999
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,320
garden

1000
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
yeah absolutely it brings such a smile

1001
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,798
on my face that product does that was

1002
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,759
something i i formulated with uh

1003
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,359
i was in the bamboo and learning at the

1004
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,759
bamboo nursery there's 20

1005
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,879
i have 20 acres tens of thousands of

1006
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:17,278
plants and the fertilizer costs on there

1007
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,480
are unbelievable i mean you're talking

1008
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,480
you know

1009
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,159
six digits in fertilizer to keep

1010
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,960
everything really pumping out of there

1011
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,039
a year and i started hearing about red

1012
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,000
tide i'm from florida red tide the fish

1013
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:29,599
were dying it

1014
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,599
has a lot to do with the sugar

1015
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,119
corporations releasing their fertilizer

1016
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,199
into the oceans

1017
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,038
and it made me not i'm a farmer i have

1018
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,360
20 acres i'm spending 100 plus thousand

1019
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:41,599
dollars on fertilizer every year

1020
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,439
i am part of that problem so i started

1021
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,119
figuring out i don't have the organ i've

1022
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,000
got like two percent organic matter in

1023
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:47,839
my soil there's no

1024
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,679
way that i could have a could do what i

1025
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,359
do uh just using

1026
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,720
organics it would take me 20 years to

1027
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,119
build that soil and there's no way i

1028
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
could have

1029
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,798
have production on it like that so i'm

1030
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,960
kind of locked in i'm in sand

1031
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,319
so with my bamboo nursery i'm locked

1032
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,480
into

1033
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:04,480
using synthetic nutrients so if i'm

1034
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,960
locked into that at least let me keep

1035
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,440
them

1036
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,798
in my field at least let me keep them at

1037
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,000
the root zone

1038
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,240
and that's where i really started

1039
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,398
studying first you know the first

1040
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,798
microbe that everybody learns about or

1041
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:17,839
that i learned about was mycorrhizae

1042
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:19,359
which is that

1043
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,439
that funny sounding word it's

1044
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,879
essentially a root fungus though and i

1045
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,759
don't have anything but

1046
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,120
gross analogies but if you get a fungus

1047
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:28,960
on your finger now

1048
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,959
and your fingernail grows does the

1049
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,679
fungus just magically go away

1050
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,759
no it keeps on you know keeps on growing

1051
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,159
on the fingernail as it grows

1052
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,079
well that's a pathogenic fungus now

1053
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,360
let's talk about a beneficial fungus

1054
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,558
let's talk about something that

1055
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,479
mycorrhizae

1056
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,398
is a fungus that's actually a coating i

1057
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,240
think of a bare wire and i think how

1058
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,839
dangerous a bare wire is

1059
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,240
and then i think about a coating if you

1060
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,918
just put a coating on that wire

1061
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,000
and that's what it does it coats the

1062
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,000
roots except it's like a fuzzy coating

1063
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,919
and it had all the the mycorrhizae has

1064
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,038
this fuzz it has these root hairs that

1065
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,480
come out

1066
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,558
and that's where the nutrient is

1067
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,839
absorbed and the nutrient is absorbed on

1068
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:09,119
those root hairs

1069
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:11,038
so not only do you create much massive

1070
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,278
thousands a thousand times more

1071
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,038
absorption points for the nutrient

1072
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:16,798
but you've also increased the whole

1073
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:18,879
surface area of that root

1074
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:20,798
so it's huge man so finding the only

1075
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,600
thing is that mycorrhizae

1076
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,319
like llamas and eradices there's very

1077
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,879
specific

1078
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:27,678
mycorrhizaes that work for very specific

1079
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,679
uh

1080
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,798
uh plants you know so like you'll see uh

1081
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,200
ectomycorrhizae on some labels

1082
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:36,960
unless you're growing pine trees ectomy

1083
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,000
ectomycorrhizae ain't gonna help you you

1084
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,720
can see 60 different

1085
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,119
species of mycorrhizae if you're growing

1086
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,640
you know

1087
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,639
specific plants you know specific

1088
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,399
medicinal plants you need iteratives

1089
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,200
that's the one that that

1090
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:50,239
forms that bond so there is a lot of a

1091
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,640
lot of fluff

1092
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,399
on a lot of labels and whatnot but

1093
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,000
that's the one you want to look for

1094
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:59,038
uh what i really learned about what

1095
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
keeps the nutrient in the soil though is

1096
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,079
the bacteria

1097
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,599
another gross analogy that i got i don't

1098
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:04,798
know i need someone to clean up my

1099
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,798
analogies but

1100
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,079
when you wake up in the morning you got

1101
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:09,679
stuff stuck on your teeth that's

1102
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,679
bacteria stuck on your teeth

1103
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,878
you can't just wash them out with water

1104
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,079
you can't just take a glass of water and

1105
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:14,878
be like all right i'm all good i'm ready

1106
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,960
to go to

1107
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,319
to my day you'll have a lot of bacteria

1108
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,679
still stuck on your breath

1109
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,919
you have to brush them off you have to

1110
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,159
actually take something you know a brush

1111
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,158
and

1112
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,280
you know with some toothpaste some you

1113
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,720
know aggregate

1114
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,480
and brush those things off because

1115
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,239
that's the glomulin the bacteria make

1116
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,000
this glommula and they stick

1117
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,479
so they stick to your teeth guess what

1118
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
else the bacteria will stick to roots

1119
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,960
soil particles specifically in the soil

1120
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,960
if you've got these sticky bacteria

1121
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,159
things can get absorbed which you know

1122
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,079
it goes inside or

1123
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,919
adsorbed which it just sticks adsorbs

1124
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,440
just a d instead of a band it means it

1125
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:51,358
just sticks to the outside here instead

1126
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,480
of being on on the inside here

1127
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:56,078
these bacteria get these uh

1128
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,079
these nutrient particles even these

1129
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,640
synthetic neutral particles they stick

1130
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,640
to them

1131
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,400
even if they die in the soil whether

1132
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:03,679
they move to the root zone or they just

1133
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,559
die in the soil

1134
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:08,399
these basically it's like a sink it's

1135
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,159
like your soil is the battery my buddy

1136
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,720
soup the gardener invented that

1137
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,920
your soil is the battery and the the

1138
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,559
more nutrient you can

1139
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,240
hold in it whether it's through usually

1140
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,078
through bacteria is the way you

1141
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,358
uh or soil organic matter is the way

1142
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,760
you're gonna hold it

1143
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,598
but the the stronger your soil is you

1144
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,000
know the more nutrient dense your soil

1145
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,200
is

1146
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,960
and uh i also the last analogy i got is

1147
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,838
if you're thinking think about coco core

1148
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,039
or something like that

1149
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:36,719
or you're thinking about whatever soil

1150
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,480
it's when we use these synthetic

1151
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,199
nutrients they're salts

1152
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,920
right they're that's what they are the

1153
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,239
hydro

1154
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,480
ionic form of nutrients whether it's

1155
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,399
general hydroponics or any of the brands

1156
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,920
they're all salt based

1157
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,000
uh when you go to the beach and you have

1158
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,039
salt all over you and you wash off on

1159
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,119
those showers

1160
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,719
it's complete the opposite experience of

1161
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,240
brushing your teeth right you don't to

1162
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,000
brush stuff out all you got to do is let

1163
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,199
that water touch you the salt runs right

1164
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,119
off that's why it's so

1165
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:04,879
easy to leech soils that's why when you

1166
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,760
deal with soils without microbes they

1167
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,480
tell you to

1168
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,000
water till 10 runoff and all that stuff

1169
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,440
because they're trying to just very

1170
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,800
easily all takes 10

1171
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,400
extra water to wash all those salts out

1172
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,480
and where they go and they go down the

1173
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,960
drain if you're in a commercial

1174
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,480
you know facility 20 acres or whatever

1175
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,760
it is they go down and they become

1176
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,119
somebody else's problem

1177
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,440
and if you're buying those for 30 40 50

1178
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,960
a gallon why not keep them in the root

1179
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,838
zone and keep them where the plants can

1180
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,760
use them

1181
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:34,799
that makes sense for sure yeah a lot of

1182
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,240
good information there there's some

1183
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,000
definitely some things i didn't know

1184
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:40,319
so definitely appreciate you dropping

1185
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,039
those knowledge bombs there for us

1186
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,440
but recharge great product i am i've

1187
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,239
been using this since 2016 in my garden

1188
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,960
off and on

1189
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,319
um i need to use you know if i use the

1190
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,320
same thing over and over again in my

1191
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,838
videos my people just get bored so

1192
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,359
i've been using this kind of off and on

1193
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:57,199
in videos this is something that i

1194
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:59,119
really get a lot of value out of in my

1195
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:01,919
garden i mean it has everything from

1196
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,079
beneficials uh you know bacteria

1197
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,838
mycorrhizae kelp molasses

1198
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,160
humic and fulfilling acids and even

1199
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:09,759
amino acids so it's really loaded

1200
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,440
with a bunch of good stuff in there

1201
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,040
definitely recommend it for sure

1202
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,559
man you mind if i say something about

1203
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,480
that good

1204
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:17,059
sure okay see i even asked before i

1205
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,119
started again

1206
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:21,519
[Laughter]

1207
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,280
when i got into the industry everything

1208
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,239
was separate there are separate bottles

1209
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,960
you know for a

1210
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:27,838
and b and fovic and humic i remember

1211
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,079
when

1212
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,679
i hope it's it's okay to say this no

1213
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,440
begrudging to anyone that comes in

1214
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,598
marketing products but

1215
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,679
when advanced nutrients came in there

1216
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,838
was 30 bottles i want to say

1217
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,759
maybe it was 20 bottles and it was

1218
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,759
everything was priced 30 40

1219
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,200
i don't even think it was a gallon she

1220
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,960
was expensive and i just started

1221
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,639
thinking to myself this

1222
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,880
starting to smell [ __ ] here man i

1223
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,159
have a 20 acre bamboo nursery and

1224
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,320
not even the world i know some

1225
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:57,118
world-class growers of some very

1226
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,079
hard to grow ornamentals nobody's using

1227
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,440
20 bottles

1228
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,280
so i just started thinking about it and

1229
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,920
i said what can you combine you know i

1230
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,440
started

1231
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,079
can you combine mycorrhizae with

1232
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,960
bacteria yeah you actually can

1233
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,680
uh can you instead of growing them uh on

1234
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,559
whatever

1235
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,078
on clay can you grow them on kelp yeah

1236
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:16,000
yeah you actually can man

1237
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,440
can you provide a food for them a

1238
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,599
molasses yeah

1239
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,760
okay cool uh you know it was all these

1240
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,240
extra things okay hey well amino acids

1241
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,880
if we add add an amino acid uh k complex

1242
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,199
in there will it

1243
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,960
will it uh affect anything or will give

1244
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:31,039
us any beneficial

1245
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,039
results yeah it actually will we test it

1246
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:33,519
and it will all these things to be able

1247
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,440
to

1248
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,199
you know make a product that actually

1249
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,880
adds some value that actually separates

1250
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,358
you from going and buying

1251
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,960
uh four or five different bottles it was

1252
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:46,239
kind of my

1253
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,559
homage to making this industry a little

1254
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:51,598
bit more honest man a little bit more

1255
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,279
you know following what growers do in

1256
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,359
commercial growth settings

1257
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,440
it did bother me man they when they

1258
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:58,960
separate you know when it's humic

1259
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,559
and you're buying that for forty dollars

1260
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,480
a bottle and then fulvic you're buying

1261
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:03,759
for forty dollars a bottle

1262
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,358
and they don't bother telling you that

1263
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,079
phovix is just a lighter fraction of

1264
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,159
humic

1265
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,599
it's uh you know it's i don't like when

1266
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,838
when people promote

1267
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,119
ignorance for for profit that's what i'm

1268
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:14,400
hoping we can change in this industry

1269
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,800
and by the way it is changing

1270
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,320
it absolutely is yeah i've seen it as

1271
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
well it definitely is changing for the

1272
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,359
better

1273
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,640
absolutely cool i want to ask you about

1274
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,078
a couple other things when growing in

1275
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,118
cocoa so

1276
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:30,720
some folks they'll monitor the ph

1277
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,920
ppm or ec are you monitoring those

1278
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,159
values and if so

1279
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,838
what do you aim for when i use liquid

1280
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:37,440
nutrients i do

1281
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:39,279
right now i'm using these it's fairly

1282
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,200
new for me i'm taking

1283
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,560
some of the lessons i've used over at

1284
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:45,598
the bamboo nursery

1285
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:47,440
which is liquid feed for dessert and

1286
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,838
then your steak and potatoes just comes

1287
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,079
from

1288
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,358
a uh for me it's a controlled release

1289
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,440
granular

1290
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:58,480
but uh when i'm doing liquid feed

1291
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,280
pretty easy rule of thumb uh just in

1292
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,320
containers

1293
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,640
about a thousand ppm when i'm doing a

1294
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,400
bottom feeding or a hempy bucket

1295
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:07,920
that they're sitting in that nutrient

1296
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,639
water so i'll go down to

1297
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,079
seven to eight hundred ppm down there

1298
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:13,440
because they're constantly just being

1299
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,400
bathed in it

1300
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,400
uh but yeah uh ppm pretty easy i have

1301
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,079
one of those blue lab truncheon meters

1302
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,880
it's easy enough to measure

1303
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,200
ppm if you're doing liquid feed i will

1304
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,920
say ph a little bit more of a pain in

1305
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,960
the butt

1306
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,440
uh do you have a ph meter sir oh yeah of

1307
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,159
course

1308
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,720
the blue lab with uh i have one where

1309
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:35,279
it's

1310
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:37,199
which one you got i got the uh a para

1311
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,040
okay i'm going to take a look at it i

1312
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:40,399
had for years and years i'd have these

1313
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,159
blue lab meters

1314
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,599
i want and they're like laboratory

1315
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:45,118
equipment i'm sitting there in my grow

1316
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,200
and this is legit laboratory equipment

1317
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,880
there's calibration solution that you

1318
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:49,919
have to put in there there's storage

1319
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,838
solution

1320
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,920
there's all this stuff that made it a

1321
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:56,318
pain in the butt and a guy like me

1322
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,400
was buying new probes every six months

1323
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,159
150 dollar probe i'm buying because i

1324
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,400
the water ran out in mine or whatever

1325
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:04,159
you know the solution ran out

1326
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,440
so i have been able to get away from

1327
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,440
that thankfully

1328
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,838
thankfully when i started learning about

1329
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,760
microbes and started using recharge

1330
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,039
i kind of noticed that the plants were

1331
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,079
less sensitive

1332
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:17,679
to ph and i started using my ph meter

1333
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,519
less and less and then i was just like

1334
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:21,279
everything's going fine there's a

1335
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,119
problem i'll pull it out

1336
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,040
and what i learned was that microbes

1337
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,559
remember they're lining the roots

1338
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:28,400
and they're buffering the nutrient in

1339
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:30,960
the soil so they can

1340
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,639
absorb or adsorb nutrients at a much

1341
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,199
wider range of phs

1342
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,000
than just the roots the roots those bare

1343
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,960
roots

1344
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,838
was it like a five five to six eight ph

1345
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,318
range and there's

1346
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,078
there's nutrient-specific nutrients that

1347
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,838
are absorbed as those ph

1348
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,599
fluctuate a little bit so it was uh

1349
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:50,400
really a joy for me to be able to throw

1350
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,880
out the ph

1351
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,240
pen and i'll say that and granted you

1352
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,318
need to know what you're starting with

1353
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,919
everybody you know i make it sound too

1354
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:58,800
easy throw out your ph pen and use

1355
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,318
microbes

1356
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,760
if you're starting with water that's

1357
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:03,679
nine or you're starting with water

1358
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,119
that's super acidic of course you need

1359
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,358
to address that

1360
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,640
but for us in here over here in the

1361
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,318
rockies man it's

1362
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,639
some great water here so it comes in

1363
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:16,079
about neutral right about seven

1364
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:17,759
and uh yeah i'm able to just actually

1365
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,119
the new millennium nutrients that i'm

1366
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,440
using and i think you were talking about

1367
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,680
this

1368
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,358
painted lady there's something they get

1369
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:23,919
the nutrient guys got it down to where

1370
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:26,559
when you

1371
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,400
mix it to a thousand ppm usually your ph

1372
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,639
is is pretty stable or at least it's

1373
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,200
formulated for you know somewhere around

1374
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:33,598
neutral

1375
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,719
so i don't use a ph pen anymore i let

1376
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,480
the microbes

1377
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,078
you know kind of be the fudge factor

1378
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,159
buffer them for me

1379
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,599
and i've had good results and it has

1380
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:43,440
been that's been a challenge for me is

1381
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,880
to look people in the face and say

1382
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,720
man you don't have to use your ph pen

1383
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,640
anymore yeah they're full

1384
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:50,239
yeah both i don't know about that scotty

1385
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:52,318
but it's true yeah

1386
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,519
i've used blue planet nutrients and then

1387
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:56,880
a mixture on that

1388
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:57,759
comes out to be 5.8 ph and that's what i

1389
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,000
like for cocoa

1390
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,280
so that it was kind of hands off really

1391
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,679
didn't have to use a

1392
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,960
a ph pen at all when growing in cocoa

1393
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,358
specifically because

1394
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,960
my water came in at whatever it was but

1395
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:11,199
when i added the nutrients it would drop

1396
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,599
it down to 5.8 ph is the perfect

1397
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,318
and i would just do 5.8 ph going in

1398
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,960
every time

1399
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:18,239
and just completely ignore the runoff ph

1400
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,559
and that worked great for me

1401
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,559
so um yeah it can definitely be

1402
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,000
simplified on that avenue for sure

1403
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,559
you talk about that real quick the

1404
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,480
runoff ph people always talk about

1405
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,880
collecting your runoff and testing the

1406
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,719
parts per million and ph on it

1407
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,000
um that can be particularly with parts

1408
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,799
per million that can be

1409
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,639
very deceiving you know it's like we

1410
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,079
talked about the shower washing the salt

1411
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,239
right off you

1412
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,839
i mean if you're i've had runoff before

1413
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,199
where the plants are just because i

1414
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:46,880
hadn't uh

1415
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,639
water till runoff for a while where

1416
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,680
they're off the chart you know it's

1417
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,519
over 2000 ppm but the plants are still

1418
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,239
looking good and it's just it really is

1419
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,039
a

1420
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,279
that's a deceptive one i think yeah i

1421
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:01,119
mean we can get into real deep on this

1422
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,160
right so it's not going to really the

1423
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,358
nutrients aren't going to show up unless

1424
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,078
they're in an ionic form

1425
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:08,239
right so right if people are putting in

1426
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,720
top dressing nutrients for example those

1427
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:10,479
aren't in

1428
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,159
a ionic form just yet the microbes have

1429
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,920
to break it down so

1430
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,358
some people will get a runoff number and

1431
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,119
they'll realize it's way higher than

1432
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,159
what they put in well there's nutrients

1433
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,119
in there they're breaking down in the

1434
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:20,239
meantime

1435
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,079
and then there's folks that are out

1436
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:24,719
there they're like oh i have a 2000 ppm

1437
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:27,359
or 2 500 ppm but my plants look fine or

1438
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,959
i need to flush well how big is your

1439
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:30,159
plant how big is that root system right

1440
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
i mean because you're you're measuring

1441
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:32,799
the runoff

1442
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,079
but if you're real small plant in there

1443
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,039
with the small root system that hasn't

1444
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,400
reached everything

1445
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,239
well then you probably are going to be

1446
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,720
fine so yeah i totally get what you mean

1447
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:42,479
by it can be deceiving i know the runoff

1448
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,318
ppm values it kind of just

1449
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,519
get a guesstimate of what could be in

1450
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:47,199
your medium

1451
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,719
and there are general ranges that people

1452
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:50,799
can follow

1453
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,559
to kind of help ensure that they're not

1454
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,000
over feeding or underfeeding so you can

1455
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:56,559
break it down to kind of like a

1456
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,159
a beginner to simplify things but yeah

1457
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:58,559
certainly can go outside of those ranges

1458
00:44:58,159 --> 00:44:59,920
and

1459
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:01,838
genetics are going to be able to take it

1460
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,358
some will be uh be able to take

1461
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:05,599
higher than other you know what i mean

1462
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:09,358
so there's there's a lot to do with that

1463
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,160
but um as far as ph um you know checking

1464
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:11,920
the runoff of

1465
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:13,519
that again it gives you a general idea

1466
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,119
of the ph in the future you could do a

1467
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:15,519
runoff test or you could do a slurry

1468
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,280
test

1469
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:19,199
some people will take off some of the

1470
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,920
top layer of soil put it into

1471
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,639
a cup or something add in some distilled

1472
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,400
water

1473
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,318
let it sit there for however long and

1474
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,838
then take a test that way

1475
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:29,119
so there's two different ways to kind of

1476
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:30,960
to measure it but it's really just to

1477
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,480
give you a general idea of what's

1478
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,318
in the medium you know i mean to make

1479
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,719
sure you're in those proper ranges

1480
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,480
because

1481
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:37,919
i think you and i both know if your ph

1482
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,838
is off it

1483
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,760
inhibits uh some of the nutrients from

1484
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,838
being up taking right if it's too low

1485
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,000
it inhibits some nutrients too high it

1486
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:47,039
inhibits some nutrients so so

1487
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,480
yeah that's why i was just kind of

1488
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:49,599
curious on your avenue if you did

1489
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,599
monitor the ph

1490
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,200
or ppmec in any value in any way i mean

1491
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,280
so it's interesting to hear how you go

1492
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,199
about it yeah i've gotten quite lazy

1493
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,519
about the ph maybe i just have you know

1494
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:02,799
i've been here for 12 years now as far

1495
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:06,000
as in this town

1496
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,079
i'm familiar with the water and uh yeah

1497
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,760
i'm just able to dial it in i guess but

1498
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,680
i don't use a ph meter anymore and i

1499
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,000
will say for i've been growing since

1500
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,199
1991 i definitely wasn't growing to the

1501
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,838
point where i had 300

1502
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:19,199
to sink in a ph meter for a long time i

1503
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:21,119
would use those little you can get them

1504
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,960
it's like a little five dollar ph test

1505
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,200
kit it's got the little bottle of

1506
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,639
of droppers and you drop a couple drops

1507
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,719
in there and it gives you

1508
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:30,559
essentially just a color whether it's

1509
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,598
red for a super acid

1510
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:35,358
almost blue for uh super basic

1511
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,280
believe it or not if you're on a budget

1512
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:38,078
you can certainly test your ph and get

1513
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,240
it within

1514
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,200
you know a half of a point a quarter of

1515
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:43,199
a point

1516
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:44,399
within uh you know with something really

1517
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,759
simple like that like

1518
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,680
i'm trying to make gardening really

1519
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,359
accessible to anyone

1520
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:51,358
you know under 100 bucks you should be

1521
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:52,719
able to put together a little system for

1522
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:53,838
your balcony anyhow

1523
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:55,679
yeah i completely agree you can

1524
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:56,078
definitely get away with those those

1525
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,239
small

1526
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,839
test kits i actually have the same thing

1527
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:01,199
for my pool my swimming pool i use that

1528
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:02,239
to test the ph and make sure that's

1529
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,799
balanced the same

1530
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,639
same stuff as being done there i'm from

1531
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,519
florida i definitely managed my family's

1532
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,879
pool for uh

1533
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,599
since i was eight years old it's fun it

1534
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,599
can be fun

1535
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,440
but anyways let's get back on topic of

1536
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,880
uh hempy buckets i know you wanted to

1537
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,960
talk about those can you talk about

1538
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,920
uh can you like explain in detail of

1539
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,240
what hempy buckets

1540
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,000
are and how you grow in them it's just

1541
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,078
super simple concept i learned

1542
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,400
about it i think there is a guy named

1543
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,920
tempe or at least there was

1544
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,519
and it's just a sip bucket i don't know

1545
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,358
if you ever go when you go to walmart or

1546
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,519
home depot most of the buckets

1547
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:37,119
they don't they have like a little they

1548
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,079
have like a little lip on the bottom

1549
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,240
that you can actually

1550
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,200
water there and then the idea you water

1551
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:43,118
from the bottom

1552
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:45,279
there's maybe a couple inch reservoir

1553
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,318
that holds that water and then it slowly

1554
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,640
wicks up

1555
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:50,639
and it uses capillary action of the soil

1556
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:51,598
to wick up and feed the roots and it

1557
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:53,920
always

1558
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,720
keeps those roots at an even once once

1559
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,639
you dial it in

1560
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,480
keeps those roots at an even moisture

1561
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:59,838
it's the perfect moisture i'll dig down

1562
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,679
into a hempy bucket

1563
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:03,519
i'll grab some soil that's in there or

1564
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,118
some cocoa i'll squeeze it

1565
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:07,280
just a little bit of water will come out

1566
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,960
it's just that perfect moisture and

1567
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,800
likes that plants need

1568
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,440
air they need air for those roots to

1569
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,359
breathe for those microbes to live

1570
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,519
they need water and they need nutrients

1571
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,920
so uh yeah

1572
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,759
giving them giving them plenty of air is

1573
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,720
uh definitely definitely a big deal

1574
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,000
definitely cool um a hempy bucket is

1575
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:27,439
just

1576
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,639
so we'll say this is the size of a

1577
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,480
container right here let's say it's a

1578
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:32,719
normal container just go

1579
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,400
two inches up two inches up and you just

1580
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:35,279
put a little hole in there you can use a

1581
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,559
drill

1582
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,319
if you don't have a drill you can use a

1583
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,839
damn steak knife don't sue me

1584
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:41,838
but you're just basically taking i take

1585
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:43,519
a five gallon bucket and just one of

1586
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:45,838
those home depot buckets if you find a

1587
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,920
black one from the the grow store

1588
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,519
it's better just because it uh you know

1589
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,280
it protects the roots a little bit you

1590
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,039
don't want light getting to your roots

1591
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,519
but two inches up you just drill a

1592
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:57,838
little hole in there maybe a

1593
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:59,199
3 8 inch hole the idea is you're gonna

1594
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:00,558
fill

1595
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:02,639
right to the hole two inches you're

1596
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,319
going to fill it with perlite just

1597
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:06,159
i like the chunky pearlite but just

1598
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:07,519
pearlite right to two inches

1599
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:09,440
and then you just fill the rest with

1600
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:12,400
soil that's the simply heavy simple

1601
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,318
hempy bucket i use cocoa modified cocoa

1602
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,000
and then the idea is you just water it

1603
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,920
until water comes out that little

1604
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,358
hole basically what that means when you

1605
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,760
water the water comes out that little

1606
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:21,838
hole

1607
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,760
you've filled up that little two inch

1608
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:25,358
layer of perlite on the bottom

1609
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,800
you've given yourself a little two inch

1610
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,838
reservoir you go

1611
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,640
you know you go back and your soil is

1612
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:33,039
perfectly

1613
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,318
moist until that reservoir goes and then

1614
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:36,079
you just want to water it again and

1615
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:36,880
maybe gives you an extra couple days or

1616
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,880
something

1617
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,559
but the most important thing is it keeps

1618
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,280
that the soil

1619
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,519
evenly moist almost it it doesn't take

1620
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,079
very long for it to balance out

1621
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:49,920
and it's just such a simple way to grow

1622
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,359
just a five gallon bucket

1623
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,960
it gives you a little you can go away

1624
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:55,440
for the weekend and

1625
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,960
uh it just affords you sports a little

1626
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,599
bit of extra

1627
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,079
extra time between waterings and it

1628
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,599
keeps that soil at a nice evenly moist

1629
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,559
level which is really important when

1630
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,318
you're

1631
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,920
don't know and you're trying maybe over

1632
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:09,759
watering underwatering

1633
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,599
it's pretty cool that is pretty cool i

1634
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,720
remember reading about empty buckets way

1635
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:17,039
back when i first started in like

1636
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:19,199
2010-ish um i think

1637
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,800
i've seen people doing a hundred percent

1638
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:22,558
perlite in theirs

1639
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,400
have you done 100 perlite or you just do

1640
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,280
the the bottom bit

1641
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,358
perlite and then above that cocoa i just

1642
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,040
do the cocoa i have been experimenting

1643
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:32,078
honestly it's pretty cool we actually

1644
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,199
started this thing

1645
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,119
my newest project is called 420 grow lab

1646
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:38,719
it's an open source challenge basically

1647
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,640
to the growers community

1648
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,558
we've got a great community called the

1649
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,879
dgc that hangs out and

1650
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,319
shares all their growth tips with us but

1651
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,039
it's just an open source project to come

1652
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:49,920
up with the

1653
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:50,480
simplest system for growing good quality

1654
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,960
medicine

1655
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,519
and it's it's you know the goal is to

1656
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,920
just

1657
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:58,079
i put my basic hempy system up there and

1658
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,079
everybody's coming up with mods we

1659
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,640
it's so much of my emails busting open

1660
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,800
you know it's uh overloading my email so

1661
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:05,838
we're making this site but the idea is

1662
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,200
that you can spend

1663
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:08,960
whether it's you know you go buy one of

1664
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:10,399
those monster garden kits or five or six

1665
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,480
hundred dollars for kind of

1666
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,920
everything you need to get started but

1667
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,358
just to be able to go

1668
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,960
or whether you go to your hopefully go

1669
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,880
to your local grow store and support

1670
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,400
them and spend a few hundred bucks get

1671
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,280
you know a two by four

1672
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,400
light and fan you spend what seven eight

1673
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,800
hundred bucks and you're

1674
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,960
able to start growing i mean that's

1675
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,880
that's the idea behind it so

1676
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,358
i have the simple hempy bucket system

1677
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,440
there's all sorts of mods there's

1678
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:36,639
uh folks that are cutting 55 gallon

1679
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,760
drums out

1680
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:41,039
and instead of using uh perlite as a

1681
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,599
media

1682
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:45,838
they're using geez one guy's using sand

1683
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,720
shout out to ray with the hemp buckets

1684
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:49,599
man he's using

1685
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,879
sand as a wick and then there's a

1686
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,318
difference in a hempy bucket between

1687
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,240
what you use in the bottom

1688
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,679
and then what you use as far as the

1689
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:59,039
cocoa media you know the

1690
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,318
the media up top so the wick is really

1691
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:02,000
seems to be what coco

1692
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:03,519
where a lot of the innovation is coming

1693
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,159
whether you're using perlite whether

1694
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:05,920
you're using

1695
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:07,838
sand there's all sorts of people trying

1696
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,920
to little expanded clay balls

1697
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:12,480
but people are kind of playing with that

1698
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,000
uh the best media up top though is coco

1699
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,280
as far as i'm concerned some kind of

1700
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,880
amended cocoa

1701
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,319
that's cool sounds like it makes things

1702
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,838
a lot easier off to try out heavy

1703
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:20,639
buckets sometime in the future i think

1704
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:22,799
that would be

1705
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,000
really fun you know do something new

1706
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,039
plants haven't been

1707
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,960
growing in perlite for millions of years

1708
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:30,558
you know billions of years they've been

1709
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,960
growing in soil right

1710
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,319
yep yeah so the symbiotic relationships

1711
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,199
you know the relationship like i said if

1712
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,639
you

1713
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,239
think about what perlite is we like it

1714
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:40,639
because it lets so much air in

1715
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:41,519
what we talk about bacteria you know

1716
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:43,920
bacteria is

1717
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:45,519
it's it finds a way you know nature

1718
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,800
fills a vacuum like we said

1719
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:49,358
so you're leaving those roots with a lot

1720
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,960
of

1721
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:53,598
of you know places to get pathogens from

1722
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,358
the air

1723
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,720
so it's a bit more dangerous than if

1724
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:58,719
you're surrounding them

1725
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:00,000
a with a mycorrhizae coating but still

1726
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,838
we put cocoa in there

1727
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,760
and then we put a bunch of organic

1728
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:04,880
material to at least simulate soil with

1729
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,720
the castings

1730
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,000
yeah that makes sense it's a good point

1731
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:08,879
it's a really good point all right

1732
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,239
scotty so

1733
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,119
kind of wrapping things up we've covered

1734
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:14,799
a lot of easy things to do when growing

1735
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,800
in cocoa in particular

1736
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,839
a lot of good information here how can

1737
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,880
those students find you

1738
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:21,279
and what do you have upcoming in the

1739
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,200
future dude grows dude grow show

are we are we have this goal

1758
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,960
of simplifying growing i got banner

1759
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,280
growing i traded him for a website about

1760
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,760
five

1761
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,920
six years ago got him started growing

1762
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,720
and it's so much fun to see the

1763
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,800
evolution

1764
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,558
of him into a great grower it's like i

1765
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,720
want to spread that that's what the dude

1766
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,240
grow show is about

1767
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:17,039
and that's what hopefully i'm doing this

1768
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,799
420 grow lab 420 grow lab.com but

1769
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:21,199
like i said it's just an open source

1770
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,119
project to make the simplest growing

1771
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:24,078
system we can we're going to crowdsource

1772
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,519
it

1773
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,519
we're going to share these mods like i

1774
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:29,920
said i'm going to put up a uh

1775
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:31,679
my basic system and let people mod it

1776
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,960
from there i'm actually actively working

1777
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,440
on some mods right now

1778
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,960
so that's actually what got me mostly

1779
