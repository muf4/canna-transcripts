1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,080
coming up on Garden talk you have people

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,339
that are growing synthetic and they're

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,980
still you know coming out with the same

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,839
outcome as you so I stay kind of

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,820
open-minded in that aspect like I'm not

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,218
opposed to synthetic or organic I don't

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,560
think one is better than the other same

8
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:18,778
thing I'm sitting around 5.8 is being

9
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,879
optimal to me so I'm always like right

10
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:23,460
away I'm mixing my nutrient solution and

11
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,899
I'm phing it right to 5.8 because I like

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,219
to do everything for my phone all lights

13
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,959
and everything are hooked up to Smart

14
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,698
plugs so I could just control it from my

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,800
phone so I was like I get notifications

16
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,000
if something's down if the Wi-Fi goes

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,439
out like I know like hey this light

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
isn't going to cut on I need to manually

19
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,159
go do it because something just happened

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,539
like an outage happened in my area I

21
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,979
don't think we'll ever maintain what's

22
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,719
perfect to us because as soon as we hit

23
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:44,339
what we think is perfect then there's

24
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,300
going to be another goal set in stone so

25
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,059
we're always going to be chasing

26
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,839
something as far as perfect goes

27
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:50,839
foreign

28
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,739

79
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,400
Talk podcast today I am joined with

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,719
doosa Farms how you doing today I'm

81
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,539
doing pretty good man how about yourself

82
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,219
I'm doing good good thanks for asking so

83
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,620
you have been gardening for a couple

84
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:16,080
years now and I really like talking to

85
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,420
gardeners with one to two years of

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,640
experience because it's somewhat of a

87
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:22,079
fresh set of eyes and I feel like things

88
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,699
can be learned from that and new

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,080
approaches can potentially be identified

90
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,238
I also think it can be helpful for

91
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,219
beginner Growers hearing about potential

92
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,019
problems that they can come across and

93
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:32,580
solutions to those problems and that's

94
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,560
what we're going to get into in today's

95
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,200
episode but first one thing I like to do

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,219
with all guests is in introduction can

97
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,560
you tell us a little bit about yourself

98
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,818
and how you got into gardening for sure

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,400
so

100
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:45,958
um like you said doosa Farms

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,000
um I've been gardening just under two

102
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,479
years now come December it'll be two

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,818
years exactly I got into it literally

104
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,318
just kind of like everybody gets into it

105
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,119
you know I wanna well not everybody else

106
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,158
say but I wanted to yield you know I

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,200
smoked already but I was like you know

108
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,419
what let me grow it I can just get

109
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,859
pounds and pounds so that's what I went

110
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,439
with and I started growing right away

111
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,000
quickly learned that you know not

112
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,579
everything is going to be what you

113
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,280
expect uh started the YouTube right away

114
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,079
for the first grow which is kinda

115
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,060
uh I feel like it keeps me true to

116
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,918
myself but you know the critics out

117
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,839
there not a lot of people the viewers

118
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,639
you know the first episode I State like

119
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,899
I'm a new grower but after that people

120
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,460
like quickly like they don't know

121
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,258
they're tuning in maybe in my week four

122
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,719
video and they don't know like hey this

123
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,639
is his first girl so like oh you suck so

124
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,919
you know so just battling just starting

125
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,680
right off with YouTube right away and

126
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,399
then going through that but

127
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,699
um

128
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:45,000
pretty much as far as like growing um

129
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,560
I think I've I try to like uh I got into

130
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,660
the content creation because I'm like

131
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,300
more of uh I've always I used to game

132
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,620
and I I was like you know what I was

133
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,419
already wanting to do YouTube I've done

134
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,340
it before let me do the same thing and

135
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:57,839
apply that to the plant starter you know

136
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:01,258
Channel I was already watching people

137
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,339
like yourself Mr Canucks pigeons uh CLTV

138
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,439
I was already watching a lot of these

139
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,299
people so I was like well let me just

140
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,459
start my own and let me start it from

141
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,100
day one and let everybody just see my

142
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:13,019
growth so when I'm maybe you know on the

143
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,180
same you know as far as subscribers or

144
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,620
level or whatever like when I'm 200

145
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,540
subscribers in people are looking back

146
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,519
like whoa look at those like this is

147
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,560
where he started at it's you know he's

148
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,299
come a long way like so I can go that

149
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,800
you know it kind of motivates people I

150
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,538
feel like if I if I show them that

151
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,240
they're like okay not everybody starts

152
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:31,199
as being the best or whatever but I feel

153
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,000
like that's where I can kind of come

154
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,038
into play and just show my progress

155
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,199
through that entire thing I certainly

156
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:40,680
have to be somewhat Brave in order to

157
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,020
upload your grow to the internet and Sir

158
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,100

159
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:46,740
backseat Growers right those are the

160
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,080
ones people who just tell you how to

161
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,780
grow your plants without you even asking

162
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:54,180
about it so like for like the community

163
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,619
in general I feel like I feel like it's

164
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,840
pretty positive for the most point I

165
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,340
will say like 99 with one percent being

166
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,019
like negative here and there which I

167
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,819
hear a lot of people say that so I think

168
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,439
we can all agree that is pretty positive

169
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:06,060
for the most part

170
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:07,860
um because then like are you going to a

171
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,240
gaming page and you see a lot of hate

172
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,740
under those comments or people that do

173
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,538
pranks you'll see a lot of hate under

174
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,680
the comments and stuff like that but it

175
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,899
seems to go pretty well for our

176
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,800
community uh like this morning I get one

177
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:22,318
it's uh people like oh if I you know if

178
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,538
I grew for you know if I grew plants for

179
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,879
this long and yielded this much like I'd

180
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:28,439
kill myself or you know like the you

181
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,560
know typical hey but I get one this

182
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,300
morning and then I I like I said I try

183
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,339
to keep things pretty transparent I try

184
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,780
to show everything you know being a

185
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,638
content creator

186
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,619
I know sometimes things can get lost in

187
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,780
there we might not record everything but

188
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,280
when it comes to growing plants I you

189
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,258
know I put the days in there I put where

190
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,899
I'm at on the footage and someone sees

191
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:51,660
like I'm in veg uh during my plant's

192
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:53,879
growth at day 89 and they're like no way

193
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,620
you're you know a good grower can never

194
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,120
be great growing like that and I was

195
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,740
like I never claimed I was good nor

196
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,120
great I was like but I appreciate it and

197
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,220
I was like they're like I lost all

198
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,538
respect from you I was like okay that's

199
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,160
a silly way to lose respect for someone

200
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:06,899
but you know to each its own you have a

201
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,340
great day yeah I agree with you and like

202
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,560
the the community just creates there's a

203
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,418
lot of positive people 99 positive

204
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,160
anyways that's besides the point it's

205
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:15,899
cool that you're actually

206
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,939
a content creator now and you're

207
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:20,038
uploading your grow to YouTube so people

208
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:22,079
can view and you know show off what you

209
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:23,759
have maybe ask for advice and that's one

210
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,560
of the reasons why I got into it but uh

211
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,699
what would you say is your gardening

212
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,500
style right there's so many different

213
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:32,038
ways to grow this plant are you indoors

214
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,978
Outdoors are you organic synthetic soil

215
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:36,779
cocoa what's your style okay so I am an

216
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:38,699
indoor I am an indoor Gardener I haven't

217
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:41,579
done any outdoor yet as much as I would

218
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,319
love to I'm just not look once I move uh

219
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:45,598
into my house once I buy my house I do

220
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,539
plan to do some outdoor stuff but as of

221
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,240
right now I've only done indoor

222
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:53,519
um as far as my style I feel like I like

223
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,259
to say I try to keep it simple but

224
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,818
sometimes you know I have to keep it as

225
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,160
simple as I can because I do record

226
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,479
video I do footage you know but at the

227
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,860
same time I have to like do certain

228
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,478
things here and there to show the

229
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,060
audience uh things that I wouldn't

230
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:07,500
normally do like it's just adding the

231
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,759
camera to the mix I'm not saying like

232
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,259
I'm just doing something because of the

233
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,538
camera but I do have to add certain

234
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,740
things here and there just to make you

235
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:14,879
know I'm battling too you know I'm

236
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,500
fighting two fights I'm trying to make

237
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,839
sure I get some footage for this and

238
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,339
make sure I Garden so but I do try to

239
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,978
keep it as simple as possible to make

240
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:24,538
that uh have to add in the YouTube stuff

241
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:25,680
and the content creation making that a

242
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,538
little bit easier and just having fun

243
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,939
but yeah I do try to keep it as simple

244
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:32,759
as possible have as much fun

245
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,979
um organic and synthetic uh so I've only

246
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,740
done synthetic I did I want to do

247
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,479
organic because a lot of people

248
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,180
um this is my take on organic I feel

249
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,459
like uh I do have some guy green uh I do

250
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,859
have guy green on my shelf and I did try

251
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:49,500
to use it but how I feel about people

252
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,720
that some people that do organic

253
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,980
gardening is they uh there's there's a

254
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,139
few of them out there like when I first

255
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,420
found out about the organic gardening I

256
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:58,679
see a lot of people like pushing it and

257
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:00,059
there's a few of them out there where

258
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:03,000
they're just like that's the only way

259
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:05,099
you know that's the best way and they

260
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,559
put so much faith in everything into it

261
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,519
which I you know I feel like organic I

262
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,639
feel like you should try to be as

263
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:14,580
organic as possible but it's just to me

264
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,439
I relate it to people that do keto in

265
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,820
the fitness world for uh for the viewers

266
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,800
out there that into fitness and know

267
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,940
about people that on the keto diet you

268
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,979
know some people that are on the keto

269
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,420
diet they'll like really push keto like

270
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,778
it's the only way to get in shape the

271
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:28,919
only way to lose body fat and I feel

272
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:30,419
like I've relate that to some of the

273
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,278
people that do organic gardening because

274
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:33,838
it's just like those two personalities

275
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:35,399
like some other sometimes they can get

276
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,019
like I feel like that's the only way

277
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,580
well it's like you have people that are

278
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,320
growing synthetic and they're still you

279
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,839
know coming out with the same outcome as

280
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,399
you so I stay kind of open-minded in

281
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,980
that aspect like I'm not opposed to

282
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,080
synthetic or organic I don't think uh

283
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,759
one is better than the other like if

284
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,500
they they both they both get the job

285
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,200
done yes I would like to do organic just

286
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,120
for the sake of you know cutting back on

287
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,339
you know the footprint of uh pollution

288
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,278
and stuff like that but as of right now

289
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,220
I've only been doing synthetic and uh

290
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:07,259
I've ran started off General Hydroponics

291
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,339
I think that's like the typical that was

292
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,659
like the only thing I thought out there

293
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,120
that's the only thing I could find at

294
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:14,039
first was like General Hydroponics it

295
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,720
was like 30 bucks for three bottles so I

296
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:18,480
was like I go with the trio the floor

297
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,240
Trio and then since then I've only I've

298
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,459
tried some more General hydroponic stuff

299
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,620
but as of lately I just started for my

300
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,838
every girl I have one right now I've

301
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,639
been running Athena so those are the

302
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,459
only two you know bottle nutrients I've

303
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,220
used I did start off of one of my grows

304
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:36,719
right away I was the first Coco Grill I

305
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,160
was like I'm gonna do organic I really

306
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,839
wanted to do organic just to say I've

307
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,000
done it and I want to try everything I

308
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,260
want to see what exactly works for me so

309
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,578
I can because I don't know what I like

310
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:46,740
right now like I know what I like

311
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:48,778
currently but in a year from now I might

312
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,100
not like what you know I might not like

313
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:51,299
the same growth style I might have a

314
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,278
totally different growth style might

315
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:54,719
think this product is way better than

316
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,078
that product

317
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,639
so I started I bought the guy green got

318
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,239
some cocoa

319
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,819
um

320
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,500
that train I grew my plants you know

321
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,240
started them in a humidity Dome once

322
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,799
they got to a certain size they were

323
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,940
already kind of showing some uh like

324
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,199
they needed some nutrients they were

325
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,640
showing a little deficiencies so I was

326
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,079
like all right go and get them

327
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,838
transplanted so I could start you know

328
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:17,578
top dressing and feeding them well I

329
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,860
didn't know an organic with the organic

330
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:21,838
or with organic gardening and top

331
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,480
dressing it takes like a week maybe like

332
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,980
around a week to break down and when I

333
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,600
put them in there you know they're going

334
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,879
through that shock of transplant I don't

335
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,680
see any signs of recovery I'm just like

336
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,720
oh what is going on I'm asking people

337
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,219
they said yeah you should have like went

338
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,720
ahead and top dressed it before putting

339
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,759
them in there so the nutrients were

340
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,860
readily available so I was like you know

341
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,838
what maybe not this run maybe the next

342
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,220
run I was like I just mixed up some

343
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,959
bottle nutrients I was like and they

344
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,420
bounced back I was like all right I was

345
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,278
like you know cynganic or whatever yeah

346
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:52,259
they definitely take time to break down

347
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:54,600
and that is a common mistake that folks

348
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:57,000
make another common mistake would be to

349
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,079
keep the medium moist a lot of folks

350
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,940
don't do that when they're growing

351
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,919
organic and there needs to be that

352
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,019
moisture you're in there for proper

353
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,759
nutrient breakdown you know so common

354
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,500
technique when growing with synthetic a

355
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,379
bottled nutrients would be to let the

356
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:13,019
medium dry out between waterings so

357
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:15,179
they'll feed their plants let the medium

358
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:17,220
dry out and then once it's at a certain

359
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:19,500
point they will water in their plants

360
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,240
again and then kind of repeat that cycle

361
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,039
so they'll be doing dry backs or

362
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,839
somewhat drought stress I guess you

363
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,879
could say which can be beneficial to the

364
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,980
plant but with Organics you could

365
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,679
seriously be missing the boat on things

366
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,539
as far as breakdown and not providing

367
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,458
the proper nutrition to the plants

368
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:37,980
because the nutrients aren't available

369
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:40,259
so yeah I think that's a great tip to

370
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,680
some people call that like charging the

371
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:45,838
media or letting the media cook for a

372
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,819
while for that breakdown to happen so

373
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,980
yeah it's definitely could be helpful

374
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,079
now taking a look back at the last two

375
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,820
years that you've been gardening what

376
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,219
would you say has been your biggest

377
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,519
challenge that you've come across

378
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,560
um really I would say

379
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,778
so for my biggest challenge I would say

380
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,699
is really just chasing that being too

381
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:07,259
hard on myself I feel like I feel like

382
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,060
that kind of sums it up

383
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:10,740
um because a lot of us we are our

384
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,659
biggest we are our biggest critic and I

385
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,579
feel like I was you know stressing

386
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,620
letting comments get to me letting you

387
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:18,419
know he say she say just all letting

388
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,459
that affect me at first you know outside

389
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:22,379
of I'm already doubting myself I'm

390
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,299
already feeling like I suck I can't do

391
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:25,919
this and on top of that add in some

392
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:27,539
other negative stuff from the outside so

393
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,458
it's like other people see that I can't

394
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,379
do it but then I kind of like sat there

395
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,578
and it's like I can do it like you know

396
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:34,799
this person's doing it this person's

397
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,719
doing why can't I and then

398
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,120
so I just feel like you know really just

399
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,860
being that critic you know just kind of

400
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,320
like appreciating like I just did a post

401
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,700
uh on Instagram where you know I was

402
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,680
talking about

403
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,820
um it was it was an Instagram reel in

404
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:49,199
like the

405
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,000
it was kind of just like I said when

406
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,339
you're hard on uh when you thought your

407
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,078
Harvest was the worst uh but everybody's

408
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,399
like saying it's actually good and

409
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:58,199
you're just like surprised you're like

410
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,278
is it good like I don't know but like

411
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,259
everybody's telling you it is so it's

412
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,600
like okay like I did a good job and it's

413
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:05,278
just that that self-doubt uh and just

414
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,320
chasing perfect I feel like you know

415
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,480
everybody wants that you know the

416
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,278
perfect run and it's just gonna be like

417
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,139
in the rock of Eternity you'll just

418
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,458
continuously you know Chase perfect I

419
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,959
don't think we'll ever maintain what's

420
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:18,239
perfect to us because as soon as we hit

421
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,679
you know what we think is perfect then

422
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,700
there's going to be another goal set in

423
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,439
stone so we're always going to be

424
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,959
chasing something as far as perfect goes

425
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,600
I can totally relate to that now have

426
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,638
you come across any like deficiencies or

427
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,680
toxicities in your plants over the past

428
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,320
couple years

429
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,199
um yes so for deficiencies and

430
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,320
toxicities um I came across like of

431
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,879
course uh the typical like nitrogen

432
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,199
deficiency at first it was hard for me

433
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:44,939
especially being a new grower I'm not

434
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,099
the best at identifying stuff right away

435
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,199
like now as you go through them like

436
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,839
it's hard to relate to Google and tell

437
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:54,359
Google like hey my plants Leaf is this

438
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,519
like you know Google can't see it

439
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,019
um so I'm over here trying to explain to

440
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,060
Google but I'm a new grower so I don't

441
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,198
know these certain terminology I don't

442
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:02,458
know how to use certain words I don't

443
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,139
know I'm just like hey the leaf is

444
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,759
yellow I don't know how to explain like

445
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,680
it's wilting I didn't I don't I don't

446
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,059
even think to use that word wilting and

447
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,500
just really like related to where I

448
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:12,899
could find an article but okay this is

449
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,120
the problem but so I've run into like a

450
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,919
nitrogen deficiency

451
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,839
um I've run into like a you know low

452
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,000
light having low light light deficiency

453
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,980
because uh my lights went out and I was

454
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
just kind of like taking a step back I

455
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,379
was like you know I'm not going to

456
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,940
breathe down the plant's neck I'm gonna

457
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,799
take a step back and then like the day I

458
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,440
take a step back I don't know all my

459
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,359
lights are on automatic so

460
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,500
when that when I took that step back I

461
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,839
didn't go in there and check them for

462
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,519
like two three days come back in and

463
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,899
then I was like oh the lights are off

464
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,639
and I'm looking at the plans got some

465
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,019
you know yellowing at the top so I was

466
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,639
like okay turn as soon as the light

467
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,659
kicks back on they're good they bounce

468
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,720
back

469
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:51,360
as far as other deficiencies

470
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,699
um I have run into

471
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,180
I've run into like a

472
00:15:53,698 --> 00:16:00,359
was a pH uh I've run into like a lockout

473
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:02,399
I run into like a nutrient lockout due

474
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,100
to pH and

475
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,720
honestly when I ran into that I didn't

476
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,920
really I didn't know like it was hard

477
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,420
for me to really tell what I was running

478
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,059
to when I because I originally started

479
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:13,919
in soil and there was a lot of mistakes

480
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:15,719
I made I didn't check my runoff I didn't

481
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,278
think it was that important I'm like hey

482
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,139
this is what I'm phing this is what I'm

483
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,120
running everything should be good that's

484
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,740
what's going into it well what's coming

485
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,440
out of it you know is that the same what

486
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,539
I put into it is that what's coming out

487
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,800
so I ran into stuff like that nutrient

488
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:30,299
build up

489
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,740
um you know the salt buildup and stuff

490
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:34,078
and the plants just not being able to

491
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,299
absorb getting you know the plants

492
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,559
burning wilting and just kind of dying

493
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,939
off that way because they just don't

494
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,939
have that optimal environment because

495
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:44,459
I'm allowing them to sit and pretty much

496
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,560
you know terrible condition

497
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:48,719
so when I kind of I kind of gave up on

498
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:52,258
soil because I didn't know that and

499
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,540
started dwc which is as like it was a

500
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,980
different ballpark right there

501
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:58,620
um and but that actually helped me

502
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,720
figure out like because and and dwc you

503
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,459
don't have uh the runoff you don't have

504
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,039
an actual runoff everything's in that

505
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:06,418
Reservoir um even in rdwc I mean the

506
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,279
runoff is circulating throughout

507
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,839
everything everything's all there the

508
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,099
water's just sitting there I mean it's

509
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,418
moving through Bubbles and stuff like

510
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,659
that but there is no runoff there's

511
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:17,400
nothing no drainage so once I realized I

512
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,839
started running into problems in dwc I

513
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,079
kind of related that back to soil I was

514
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:25,500
like wait you know I'm my pH is rising

515
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:27,659
or PPM is rising in uh dwc so I was like

516
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,759
maybe I was running into like some

517
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,798
problems with soil so I ran another soil

518
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,240
plant I checked I'm like start checking

519
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:36,058
the runoff and that's when I realized I

520
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,798
was like I'm over feeding you know I I

521
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:39,480
didn't know how big the runoff was I was

522
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:41,099
I was to see people say like hey check

523
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,079
your runoff but I didn't think it was

524
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:45,058
important so I I ran into uh you know

525
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,339
how to learn the hard way

526
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:49,379
um but I haven't run into too many

527
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:50,639
deficiencies most of the times it's

528
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,100
literally just like some sort of

529
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,200
nutrient deficiency uh you know the Cal

530
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:57,480
Mag is uh especially since I'm growing a

531
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,880
cocoa now which I learned that through

532
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,480
one of the garden talk uh episodes I

533
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,919
didn't realize the cocoa actually like

534
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,839
pulls some of that cow mag and it kind

535
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,160
of like takes you have to like up the

536
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:10,019
cow mag a little bit when growing in

537
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,240
Cocoa I didn't know that at first but I

538
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:13,918
previously watched one of your garden

539
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,538
talk episodes like a couple weeks ago

540
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,400
and then I found out and

541
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:20,279
huge difference in the girl right there

542
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,900
you mentioned low light deficiency

543
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,099
and I think what you're actually

544
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,780
referring to this first time I ever

545
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:26,939
heard anybody say low light deficiency

546
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,740
record I don't know why I said it like

547
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,120
that

548
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,919
uh I I think what you're referring to is

549
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:35,579
actually iron deficiency and that's

550
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:38,038
something super super common what it is

551
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:39,720
is basically it's a yellowing that

552
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:41,400
starts at the from the petiole so let's

553
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,798
get the base of the leaf and it works

554
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,538
its way up to the top of the leaf and

555
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:46,918
you see that a lot with new growth so

556
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:49,019
you mentioned that like your lights were

557
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,580
off for a day or two or whatever and

558
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:51,779
then you opened up your tent and then

559
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:53,759
you notice that the yellowing this

560
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:55,019
happened at the top of the leaves it

561
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,599
just hasn't received the light in order

562
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:59,400
to convert it to green and typically

563
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,259
what will happen is you put your lights

564
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,900
back on and with a matter of hours

565
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:06,538
you'll see those leaves turn from yellow

566
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,519
to Green I see this a lot with new

567
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:11,099
Growers they will they'll have their

568
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,918
their seedling it'll Sprout from The

569
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:15,480
Medium once the lights are off

570
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,620
so then the lights will come on and

571
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,599
they'll open up at 10 they'll be like

572
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:20,459
why is my lead why is my seedling yellow

573
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:22,439
completely yellow what's going on what

574
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,700
am I under feeding but little did I know

575
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,679
all they needed was that little bit of

576
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,298
light and it will convert over to Greens

577
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,798
so I thought that was a good call out

578
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:31,259
there they've seen a lot in the stretch

579
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,240
phase like after you flip the plant to

580
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:35,460
flowering those first three weeks

581
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,859
sometimes you get really heavy stretch

582
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,840
and so when your lights are off for that

583
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:42,058
12 hour period for example when you're

584
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,500
growing photo period plants you'll see

585
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:44,579
right when you turn the lights on you

586
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,919
open up your tent you'll see there's

587
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:49,019
some yellowing on the top leaves and

588
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,700
again there's no problem there that's

589
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:53,160
normal it's just with the new growth

590
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,200
it'll start off yellow if it's not

591
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,460
receiving light right away okay see

592
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,900
that's totally perfect makes it a little

593
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,640
bit simpler because I know whenever

594
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,720
whenever I get to flower I know that

595
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,900
they're stretching I know they're

596
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,460
demanding a lot more so with it being

597
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,840
like that I always seem like I got some

598
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,980
yellow growth I'm like hey maybe I need

599
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,359
to take this picture from like a

600
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,880
different angle so people aren't just

601
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,619
like oh your plants look yellow but you

602
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,840
know and I didn't really think about the

603
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:17,099
fact that uh that's I know in flower I

604
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,899
don't really typically worry about I'm

605
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:20,519
like oh it's common but at the time when

606
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,019
I wasn't when it was happening in veg I

607
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,779
was like sitting there like oh it's the

608
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:26,460
lights being out so I'm actually I'm I'm

609
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,019
glad to know that it's actually from the

610
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,519
iron and the plant's ability to like

611
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,918
actually break it down and turn green

612
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,379
yeah easy fix on that one and a common

613
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,299
misconception for for Growers for new

614
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,120
Growers I should say so you also

615
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:42,240
mentioned pH lockout now is there a

616
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:45,839
specific PH range that you're aiming for

617
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,400
uh yes with um when I was running soil I

618
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,339
was I think I was fluctuating anywhere

619
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,440
between 6.2 and 6.8

620
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:53,819
um but I'm no longer a soil grower I

621
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,440
probably the only time I've ever grown

622
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,939
slow again is maybe outside eventually

623
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,580
but I don't really plan on doing soil

624
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,320
anytime soon but for me I'm all

625
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:03,500
Hydroponics now I'm running Coco just

626
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:07,259
started my first cocoa run and then dwc

627
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,960
and same dwc and uh Coco

628
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:11,640
um same thing I'm sitting around 5.8 is

629
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,319
being optimal to me

630
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,538
um so I'm always like right away I'm

631
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:18,659
mixing my nutrient solution and I'm PhD

632
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:20,160
in it right to 5.8 and then that's where

633
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,019
that's where I try to stay I let it

634
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,779
fluctuate a little bit I may bring it

635
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,980
down to somewhere around 5.5 up here a

636
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:27,779
lot of people recommend that so

637
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:31,140
sometimes I'll you know Let it go down

638
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:33,359
to 5.5 or you know 6.2 being high but I

639
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,120
typically just 5.8 throughout the entire

640
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:39,119
thing I've always had good luck in Cocoa

641
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:42,839
in particular doing 5.8 pH so I'll mix

642
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:45,538
up my nutrients in my reservoir pH to

643
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,220
5.8 and then give that to the plants and

644
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:49,079
I've always had just really good growth

645
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,819
really good luck with that so it's no

646
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:53,099
surprise that you're having good luck as

647
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:55,139
well I feel like that's perfect and I

648
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:56,279
actually starting off in Coco say I'm

649
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,840
going to call back to another one of

650
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,700
your uh episodes it's the same exact

651
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,500
episode I do not remember his name but

652
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,058
he was talking about Coco and I feel bad

653
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,720
for not know his name but it's probably

654
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:08,759
doggo the Hut okay so I was watching I

655
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,919
was watching that video and me I

656
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:12,900
previously ran soil I'm thinking Coco is

657
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:14,159
the same thing as soil you know I didn't

658
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,019
really think I need to look anything up

659
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,700
different for Coco I'm like well I you

660
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:20,339
know I know what to do I just go in

661
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,620
there I'm phing to around 6.5 that's uh

662
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,119
that's what I was doing and I was still

663
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:25,500
kind of like having some the growth

664
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,939
wasn't what I thought it would be and

665
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,200
just things were being a little off I

666
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,580
was like what's going on you know

667
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,100
everything should be going well right

668
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:33,779
now and then I'm watching that uh

669
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:37,199
watching that uh episode on the podcast

670
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:38,819
and I found out I was like 5.8 when when

671
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,159
started doing I was like pretty much the

672
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:43,200
same because of my plants in dwc were at

673
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,640
the same growth stage so I was like I'm

674
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,340
making two batches of nutrients I'm

675
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,320
doing 5.8 for my dwc but going to do 6.5

676
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:51,119
for Coco but after watching the episode

677
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:53,220
I was like I could just saved myself so

678
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,259
much time by just doing one you know one

679
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,819
reservoir full of 5.8 and then just

680
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,679
doing I'm just saving myself so much

681
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:01,079
time so I started doing 5.8 right away

682
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,880
after that episode and from there I was

683
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:06,418
like you know 5.8 from here on out it's

684
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,640
all 5.8 nice now have you mixed anything

685
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:09,900
in with the cocoa like some people take

686
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,080
the cocoa and I don't know if you're

687
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,580
using brick or the bagged cocoa and some

688
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:16,859
people will take that and they'll mix in

689
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:19,079
like air some form of aeration whether

690
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:20,459
it be like perlite or Palmas or

691
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,538
something like that are you doing any of

692
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,519
that at all

693
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:25,079
um no but I have also seen some people

694
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,240
say that um

695
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,619
uh I've actually been doing right now

696
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,779
I'm just doing the cocoa breaks I want

697
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:32,339
uh the floor Flex cocoa breaks I just

698
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:34,440
found that to be like super easy when I

699
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:36,480
was looking online I didn't have a store

700
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,038
near me that just carried cocoa or maybe

701
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,779
they didn't carry the cocoa that I would

702
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:42,119
like so I was like you know go online

703
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:43,859
I'm looking at prices and I was like you

704
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:45,899
know what this these floor I keep seeing

705
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:47,279
these floor effects uh cocoa bags and

706
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,200
just other different varieties but I

707
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,058
kept seeing the floor Flex ones so I was

708
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,220
like you know what I'm gonna try that

709
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:54,779
out it seems pretty simple I've had

710
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,700
reptiles before I've messed with bricks

711
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,798
of cocoa so it should be the same you

712
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,200
know concept so that's what I want I

713
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,940
want the cocoa bricks and I just pretty

714
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,558
much you know prepped them that way I

715
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,600
didn't add anything to it just left them

716
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,178
exactly how they were and just you know

717
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:11,219
uh because they come dry so I just put

718
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:13,080
add some moisture they expanded and then

719
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,120
from there that I just kept it at that

720
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,819
all right so you didn't do any rinsing

721
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,619
or buffering of the brick it's common

722
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:22,019
technique that people do is they'll

723
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:24,839
rinse it out because it's a lot of these

724
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:26,519
come with a high salt content and that's

725
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,678
really really not needed for plant

726
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:32,579
growth well let me take that back there

727
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:34,380
is some plants that can take sodium but

728
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:37,558
some of these cocoa bricks just have an

729
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,360
excess amount of sodium in it so they'll

730
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:41,700
rinse that out and then they'll buffer

731
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,759
it in with like those they'll soak the

732
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,798
brick in with Cal Mag for example and so

733
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:49,619
that basically the cocoa particles

734
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:52,079
retain cations so think of it like a

735
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:54,479
magnet so that calcium magnesium those

736
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,579
are cations they stick to those cocoa

737
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,500
particles did you do any rinsing or

738
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,720
buffering or was it straight out of the

739
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,640
brick that you just grew in yeah well

740
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,319
right right away I guess I kind of rinse

741
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,640
a little bit because I had a friend they

742
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:06,899
told me as soon as they saw that I had

743
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,820
the cocoa breaks I was like hey I'm

744
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,500
getting ready to do these I knew that he

745
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:12,480
had already done some cocoa in the past

746
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,220
the same floor Flex bricks he hits me up

747
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,079
he's like right away he's like hey make

748
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,240
sure you like really um

749
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,859
you know rinse them off they like you

750
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,058
said the salt he said they're pretty

751
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:23,519
high like when I get them they're always

752
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:26,038
like already at like a three e uh three

753
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,839
uh three EC so I was like I was sitting

754
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:30,179
there nervous about that I was like uh

755
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,439
um okay so I I did kind of rinse it in a

756
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:33,240
way right away

757
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,558
um but once I like got it I didn't rinse

758
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,019
it too much I just kind of filled the

759
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,879
bags up and I had a lot of runoff so it

760
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:41,819
kind of got uh rinsed out but I didn't

761
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,100
really stress it uh rinsing too much and

762
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:45,599
I would check the runoff after you know

763
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:47,099
watering my plants and I've seen that

764
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,719
everything what I was putting in it was

765
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,119
roughly around the same

766
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,679
so I didn't have to worry about that too

767
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:54,359
much but I was nervous about that when

768
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,000
he told me that I was like oh no like

769
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,139
I'm gonna like burn my plants or you

770
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,819
know whatever I was like all the salt

771
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,320
build up I was like super nervous about

772
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:03,359
that so I did a little bit of rinsing

773
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:05,819
got it and you talked about pH a little

774
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,199
bit but let's get into EC and PPM that's

775
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:09,240
another thing that people will check

776
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,240
whether it be the EC or PPM of the

777
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,179
nutrient solution going in or the runoff

778
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,980
value are you monitoring the EC or PPM

779
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:21,600
at all

780
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:23,460
um yes uh with dwc I was I monitor I

781
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,719
used to monitor daily I would constantly

782
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,700
go in there and check daily but then

783
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,558
that kind of gets played out when I have

784
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,480
like seven different buckets and I'm

785
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:33,058
have to I don't have rdwc so I'm

786
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,278
checking seven individual buckets and

787
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,720
that's kind of like once I stopped like

788
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,400
I took a step back I stopped stressing

789
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,140
that portion so much I'm constantly

790
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,159
checking it because that was my con uh

791
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,840
that's what I was under the

792
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,278
interpretation that like I literally had

793
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:46,740
to check it every day and had to make

794
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,240
sure everything stayed in line but once

795
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,579
I kind of like you know I check it every

796
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,679
I check it two three times a week I'm

797
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:55,740
not really stressing it as much

798
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:57,720
as far as the dwc uh Coco anytime I see

799
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,579
some runoff you know I'll I'll check the

800
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,440
runoff just to make sure but yeah I

801
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:05,099
don't I don't typically uh check it all

802
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,679
too often for the PPM I go by PPM uh not

803
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:09,119
the EC I just feel like PPM is just to

804
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,860
me EC is just like the smaller number

805
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,798
and I feel like the PPM to me is just

806
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:14,639
it's a lot easier to uh understand and I

807
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,740
was like you know I'll just stay with

808
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,480
PPM because some some people like some

809
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,460
people only do EC so they'll refer to

810
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,079
everything as EC and like I just don't

811
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,700
have any knowledge of it like I could

812
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,259
look at a chart and like you know look

813
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,140
at a side-by-side comparison like okay

814
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:29,819
this PPM should be around this EC

815
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,679
um but I don't I don't typically uh

816
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:34,439
refer to the EC result at all even

817
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,778
though my meter does check EC I just uh

818
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,080
stick strictly PPM

819
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:41,759
which I do check uh the dwc I want to

820
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,500
make sure you know if my if it's

821
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,000
lowering if the PPM is lowering I'm like

822
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,640
okay everything's good the plant's

823
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,259
absorbing those nutrients properly uh if

824
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,759
the PPM is rising might hold on

825
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:52,740
something's wrong

826
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:54,538
um maybe I need to feed a little bit

827
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,640
lower dosage maybe something else is

828
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:58,859
going on for the you know maybe the uh

829
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,538
the mix wasn't right maybe something was

830
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:02,038
just off and I know there's some sort of

831
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:03,000
problems where the plants not absorbing

832
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:06,240
it

833
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,740
so I try to I do check it uh here and

834
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,599
there I do try to check my PPM and stay

835
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,038
on top of it but I'm not stressing it as

836
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,139
much as I did right away when I first

837
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,000
started okay yeah and there are

838
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:19,080
conversion charts that you can google

839
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,900
and find EC to PPM and you know some

840
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:23,460
people use EC some people use PPM I

841
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,140
wouldn't say one way is right and one

842
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,940
way is wrong right this one's a

843
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:31,080
conversion of the other right there's

844
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:32,640
also 500 scale and 700 scale meters so

845
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:34,859
you just have to be careful there and

846
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,220
and know what your meter is whether it's

847
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:39,899
a 500 scale TDS tester or a 700 scale

848
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,778
TDS tester because those are different

849
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,120
calculations from EC and just like that

850
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:47,759
I just learned something

851
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:50,819
yeah usually I think it's Europe is

852
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:53,940
usually using the 700 scale U.S I think

853
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:55,859
it's a mix between 700 and the 500 scale

854
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,000
so yeah the best way to go about it in

855
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,619
my opinion is to contact the

856
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,538
manufacturer if you're buying off Amazon

857
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:03,538
for example sometimes it'll somebody

858
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:05,700
will ask that question in the question

859
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:07,140
section on the Amazon listing so

860
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,120
sometimes I'll search that to see if

861
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,919
they reveal if it's 500 scale or 700

862
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,199
scale or you can ask the question see if

863
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,460
somebody responds or just contact the

864
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,000
manufacturer and they'll tell you what

865
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,740
what scale it's on and um also since we

866
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,898
talked about the pH just to touch back

867
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,298
on that because I talked about it with

868
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:26,219
the PPM but uh for my pH like I said I'm

869
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:27,898
keeping that 5.8

870
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,700
um but I used to stress it a lot like

871
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:31,739
I've already said I was trying to make

872
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,899
sure my every every day it had to be at

873
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,599
5.8 I'm constantly you know adding ph up

874
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:40,500
or PH down to make sure in my dwc system

875
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:42,359
that it was at 5.8 and once I stopped on

876
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,919
the my two previous girls I stopped like

877
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:46,439
doing that I just let it I was like you

878
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,000
know what I start day A1 I prep my you

879
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,580
know I prep my nutrient solution added

880
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,440
to the plants and then from there

881
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:54,658
I just I was like you know what I check

882
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,700
it the next day I see it went from 5.8

883
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,679
to like 6.3 I was like whoa what is

884
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,019
going on because I mean dwc it's common

885
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,580
so I'm like what's going on and it but I

886
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:04,980
was fighting the urge to pH it back down

887
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:07,099
to 5.8 so I was like you know what take

888
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,778
a step back I'm gonna see what happens

889
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:12,538
the next day it's at six this is like

890
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:14,038
almost like 6.1 6.2

891
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:15,658
um and then by time I just let it go

892
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:17,278
until the next water change which was

893
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,080
like a week later I come in there to

894
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:20,519
change the water was at 5.9 so I was

895
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,439
like okay the plant you know the plant's

896
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,940
gonna it fluctuates and you know the

897
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,679
plant it didn't seem like everything was

898
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,899
wrong with the plant so now I don't

899
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,340
really Chase my pH at all anymore

900
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:31,259
um I check it still but I'm not really

901
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:32,398
chasing it to make sure it stays at 5.8

902
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:33,599
I kind of let them fluctuate and do

903
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:35,339
their own thing as long as there's no

904
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,719
problems what type of water are you

905
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:38,398
using let's get into that a little bit

906
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,558
okay um

907
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,898
so I'm right now for the water I'm using

908
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:46,859
tap water uh which my tap water comes

909
00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:49,319
out pH around 7.6 7.7 sometimes

910
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:50,699
um with the PPM being around 137

911
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:52,798
actually just I'm actually doing a video

912
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,580
today so I just checked it so it's at

913
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:59,278
137 as of today my PPN was at 137. I

914
00:30:56,579 --> 00:31:02,398
would like to do some uh Ro reverse

915
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:04,558
osmosis I see like you do ro and a lot

916
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:05,819
of people do ro but I was like you know

917
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:07,678
what I'm in an apartment right now I

918
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:08,819
don't want to set up you know that I was

919
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,798
like you know I'll wait till I get to my

920
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:11,939
more permanent spot once I get to the

921
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:13,319
house once I buy the house I'll start

922
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,080
running some Ro but as right now I've

923
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:17,939
only ran tap water okay and then in

924
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,558
particular when you're in Cocoa how do

925
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,960
you know when to water what do you use

926
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:24,898
to determine when to water

927
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,640
um yes so when I'm watering uh at first

928
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:28,739
I was I didn't need I thought I was

929
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,360
needing water to run off like I don't

930
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,558
have like the best draining system I

931
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,178
just haven't been flitch I don't have

932
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:35,220
like a flood table I just haven't flood

933
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:37,200
trays so I have you know seven different

934
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,720
cocoa plants so I'm having to you know

935
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,038
keep moving plants out of the way and

936
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,778
you know just move the plants and then

937
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:44,099
dump the actual tray out itself so that

938
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:46,380
can kind of become a little work when

939
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:49,079
especially as the plants get bigger

940
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,059
so I try not to do too much as far as

941
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,500
the uh the runoff but I still do get run

942
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:54,000
off I just try to make sure I don't get

943
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,099
too much runoff but I'll still move the

944
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,558
trays and drain them or actually have

945
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:59,939
like some suction uh that I'll just get

946
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:01,200
all the water up with like a shop back

947
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,580
so I don't have to move the plants

948
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,019
around

949
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:06,119
but

950
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:08,579
um I started at first I was only

951
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,139
watering maybe once a day and then as of

952
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:11,819
recently the plants started they started

953
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,880
and taking a lot more they start really

954
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:16,678
around like week three around week three

955
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,840
of veg they really start picking up the

956
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,820
consumption so from there ever since

957
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:23,158
then I've been doing two times a day I

958
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:24,898
do it right uh write a little bit after

959
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:26,940
lights on and then right at lights out

960
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:28,319
I've been running like that and so far

961
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,419
it's been good

962
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,859
uh the runoff I don't really get too

963
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,600
much runoff and when I come in there

964
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:35,519
sometimes I knew I've had to start

965
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,259
increasing the the amount of water I've

966
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,119
given them so far because sometimes I

967
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:40,859
come there and it'll it'll it'll be the

968
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:42,178
the cocoa will be a little bit more dry

969
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:43,558
than it was the day before and I'm like

970
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,600
hold on let me now I need to start

971
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:46,918
adding more because we're in that uh I'm

972
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:48,480
still in that stretching phase of flower

973
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,759
so I've been you know up in the water

974
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,980
but I still do two times a day common

975
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,980
question that you get from beginners a

976
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,899
lot is how much water do I add in and

977
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,940
you know the answer to that is just it

978
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:01,798
depends right there's so many variables

979
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,538
when it comes to it what size is the

980
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:05,158
plant if you're watering a small

981
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:07,619
seedling you're obviously going to give

982
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:09,600
it less water than you would a

983
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:11,639
full-blown plant that is in the

984
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,619
flowering stage for example so I always

985
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,720
get that question it's so hard to answer

986
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:17,398
it I usually have to find out more

987
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,919
information about how far along is the

988
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:22,739
plan how big is it what container size

989
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,200
is it in how moist is the medium to

990
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,000
begin like there's just so many factors

991
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,399
so it's so hard to to answer that

992
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,200
question yeah I I get asked that like

993
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:33,359
I've been asked that a few times we're

994
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,980
like how often should I water them like

995
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,898
I would like explain break everything

996
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,579
down to me I need all the information uh

997
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:39,719
how you know your light the light

998
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:41,460
intensity

999
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,500
um do you have any fans going are the

1000
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,480
fans blowing directly at it like is it

1001
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,240
drying up uh what's going on with what

1002
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,038
is the live stage because you know me

1003
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,259
starting off I got a Seedling I don't

1004
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:53,819
want to just like just gouge it with

1005
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:55,319
water I was like I don't need that much

1006
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:56,939
that's just a waste I'm wasting my

1007
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:58,859
nutrients at that point you know we got

1008
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,480
to be you know save as much as we can so

1009
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:01,319
it's like you don't you don't need all

1010
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,120
that

1011
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:04,500
um but like you said there is so many

1012
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,479
factors that come into play and that's

1013
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,039
where we you know just gotta relay that

1014
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,838
information like so I can kind of help

1015
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:11,398
you in because I can only see so much

1016
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,739
from like a camera or just from the

1017
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:14,819
message that you said like it's it's so

1018
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,378
vague you know you got to break it down

1019
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,940
we got to get it because I'm not there

1020
00:34:16,378 --> 00:34:19,440
so you have to really give me that

1021
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,659
information so I could try to help you

1022
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,918
because I'm still learning myself so one

1023
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,599
thing that can really help is the

1024
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:26,338
moisture meters I'm not sure if you used

1025
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,260
one of those before but you can buy one

1026
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:30,000
of those for like 10 bucks 15 bucks

1027
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,339
those work pretty decent you get some

1028
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,679
mixed results on them you do need to

1029
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:36,898
calibrate them there's also the digital

1030
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,700
moisture meters I know sustainable

1031
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:40,500
Village makes a digital moisture meter

1032
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:43,678
they're the company that makes blue mats

1033
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,539
the automated drip system and so I

1034
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,918
haven't used the digital one yet I've

1035
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:49,259
actually been wanting to get my hands on

1036
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,179
one I think they're around like 85 bucks

1037
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,859
or something like that and they can

1038
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,139
certainly be valuable if you're like if

1039
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:57,239
you're unsure about how much moisture is

1040
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,160
in the medium you can get one of those

1041
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:01,379
and that way you can really dial in your

1042
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:03,239
watering that way yeah I haven't I

1043
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,280
haven't personally uh I was looking into

1044
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:06,779
the moisture meters at first because I

1045
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,099
was running to problems like this looks

1046
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,540
like over watering or this looks like

1047
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:11,700
underwater and I'm like I don't really

1048
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:12,838
know where is that you know that meat I

1049
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:14,699
need to be in that like the perfect

1050
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:16,619
little area where is that at so I was

1051
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:17,879
like I thought about buying a moisture

1052
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:19,858
meter but then I kind of just like

1053
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,720
figured it out but I do want one just

1054
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:23,519
for the sake of having it it's kind of

1055
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,838
cool so I could see like maybe what I

1056
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,338
thought was enough it might not be

1057
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:28,500
enough or maybe I thought was too much

1058
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:30,719
might not be too much yeah it can

1059
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,460
certainly be helpful on that Avenue

1060
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,500
let's flip it up let's get into

1061
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,338
environment now there are so many

1062
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,599
different things that we could talk

1063
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:38,699
about when it comes to environment

1064
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:40,680
temperature let's start with that what

1065
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:43,500
do you typically aim for in regards to

1066
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:44,578
temperature yeah so for temperature

1067
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,739
um

1068
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:49,200
for dwc temperature is like a huge

1069
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:50,879
factor that is one of the factors I

1070
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,379
would say top three factor I put it at

1071
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,160
number one but

1072
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,559
um

1073
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:58,319
temperature is definitely I keep it

1074
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:00,000
round for for the entire room depending

1075
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,720
like the actual room itself I aim for

1076
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,219
around like Max 75 degrees but with uh

1077
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:07,618
that's when I was running like soil or

1078
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:09,000
if I was just running cocoa 75 but in

1079
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:11,338
the 70s would be cool with me just

1080
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,380
keeping it in 70s in general but because

1081
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:15,838
of dwc I'm having to keep everything

1082
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,280
down and at first I was originally you

1083
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,199
know making sure my entire room was like

1084
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,240
68 I was making sure it was at 68

1085
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:23,759
sometimes 65 you know I was trying to

1086
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,618
make the entire room cold that way my

1087
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,180
plants roots that way I can keep them in

1088
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,619
that Optimum range the temperature so

1089
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:31,019
I'm not running into things like root

1090
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:32,579
rot so but then since then I've actually

1091
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:35,099
so I don't have to have the entire room

1092
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:36,660
you know electric bill skyrocketing

1093
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:38,880
because that AC unit is trying to keep

1094
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:40,799
the whole room cool since then move the

1095
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,720
AC unit because I have all dwc plants

1096
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,579
inside of one tent and I've been able to

1097
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:47,098
move that AC unit into that tent alone

1098
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:50,760
and I keep the actual temperature around

1099
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:52,920
like 65 to 68 pretty much inside that

1100
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,780
tent and then how about humidity a lot

1101
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,059
of people will track the relative

1102
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:00,060
humidity and adjust that is there a

1103
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:02,460
specific humidity that you aim for

1104
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:04,259
um yes I do typically stay I kind of

1105
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,780
throughout the entire process I guess

1106
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,980
starting off I'm around like like for

1107
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,140
seedlings well they're in the dome so

1108
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,460
like a 90 plus but

1109
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:13,679
throughout the rest of the grill I'm

1110
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:17,338
aiming I'm just keeping that 50 I just

1111
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:19,078
keep my dehumidifier set 50 sometimes if

1112
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:20,519
it's a super humid day and I see like

1113
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,320
the the water is building up or I'm

1114
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:24,719
going to be gone and I want to extend

1115
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,700
the life because I don't have uh the

1116
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,139
dehumidifier draining outside I have a

1117
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:30,358
draining against just to a bigger bucket

1118
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:31,920
which I know it takes a couple days but

1119
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:33,000
sometimes if I want it to last just a

1120
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,039
little bit longer if I'm going to be

1121
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,539
gone I'll crank it up to like 60 so it's

1122
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,639
not fighting too hard to keep it at 50

1123
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:40,619
percent but around 50 is where I stayed

1124
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,838
throughout the entire grow okay yeah

1125
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:44,760
General range specifically for beginners

1126
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:47,400
now we could get into VPD Vapor

1127
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,920
pressures episode which is the ideal

1128
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,740
humidity to be at for what temperature

1129
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,720
that you're at and that helps to ensure

1130
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:56,879
that the stomata on the leaves are fully

1131
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:59,338
open and then taking that CO2 release

1132
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,920
that water vapor so on and so forth but

1133
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:03,960
putting VPD to the side the general

1134
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,539
range that is often recommended for

1135
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,599
beginners is between 40 and 60 percent

1136
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:12,000
relative humidity so you could certainly

1137
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,099
stay within the that range and get to

1138
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,539
harvest you know no problem and staying

1139
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:17,338
under that sixty percent is generally

1140
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:19,679
recommended in order to prevent things

1141
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:22,440
like poultry mildew from forming for

1142
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:24,539
example now air circulation is going to

1143
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,880
be a big impact to that there are lots

1144
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:29,338
of benefits to air circulation what do

1145
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,960
you do for air circulation uh so for my

1146
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:33,779
air circulation I'm running I actually

1147
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,980
have a tower fan inside of one well on

1148
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,619
one side that's in I'm running a tower

1149
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,539
fan I actually want to get more tower

1150
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:42,119
fans and just run solar tower fans

1151
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:43,739
because I just like the at any stage

1152
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,000
it's good you know it's still going to

1153
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:46,979
be blowing an even amount of air

1154
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,960
throughout the canopy uh but I do have

1155
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,000
one tower fan and the rest is just like

1156
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,619
I believe like six inch oscillating fans

1157
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,139
I'm not sure the exact size but I have

1158
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:56,579
oscillating fans and I'll have to prop

1159
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:57,960
them as the plants grow sometimes I'll

1160
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:00,119
have to like prop them up on something

1161
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,619
or hang them from the ceiling but as of

1162
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,900
right now that's like the only uh thing

1163
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:06,480
I'm running for uh fans and osculating

1164
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,280
and then well I have a air pulling out

1165
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,199
from the AC Infinity I do have that

1166
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,420
pulling air out but as far as fans goes

1167
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:14,639
it's just a few oscillating fans and a

1168
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,280
tower fan most recently I've been using

1169
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,019
the AC Infinity clip-on fans I clip onto

1170
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,700
the side of the grow 10 and oscillate

1171
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:22,019
those things are pretty cool I want to

1172
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:23,939
get I want to get one I want to get one

1173
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:26,940
I saw it yeah because it makes it so you

1174
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,820
can just ride onto a pole yep I actually

1175
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:32,579
have four of them and uh you know the

1176
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:35,460
way of positioning the fans in your

1177
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:37,680
growth spaces something that not a lot

1178
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,539
of people talk about and some people say

1179
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:41,940
there is a right and a wrong way to do

1180
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:43,619
it and I'm not here to say that this is

1181
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,599
there is a right way and a wrong way to

1182
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:47,760
do it but a common technique people will

1183
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,280
do is they'll put like two two of those

1184
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,780
clip-on fans towards the lower part of

1185
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,060
their grow tent for example so it's

1186
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,640
blowing underneath the canopy and then

1187
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:59,699
on the other side of the grow tent up

1188
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:02,159
more they'll have the fans blowing above

1189
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:05,759
the canopy through the canopy so you

1190
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:07,500
have this constant whirl around in the

1191
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,599
actual grow tent or growth space now

1192
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,679
some people will just they'll say oh you

1193
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,599
can do that or you can just position

1194
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:14,399
them anyway so air is just whipping

1195
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,599
around in all different directions so a

1196
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,579
couple different ways to go about it

1197
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,920
some may say one way is better than the

1198
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:22,800
other but both ways is is going to

1199
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,260
actually move the air around so that it

1200
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,599
the plant does have access to that CO2

1201
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:29,339
which is needed for plant growth and

1202
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,440
then yeah air exchange like you talked

1203
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:33,900
about I'm using the AC Infinity one as

1204
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,880
well where it's just it's so awesome

1205
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,220
being able to be hooked up to a

1206
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,480
controller and now it's actually on your

1207
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:41,819
phone as well so you can actually

1208
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,099
control the airflow on your phone with

1209
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,859
the controller 69 they have a Bluetooth

1210
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:49,140
Edition a Wi-Fi Edition which I just got

1211
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:50,578
my hands on it makes things a lot easier

1212
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:51,838
because right now I'm just running with

1213
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,339
the remote but I definitely want to get

1214
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:54,659
one where I'm able to control because I

1215
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:55,920
like to do everything for my phone all

1216
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:57,539
lights and everything are hooked up to

1217
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,220
Smart plugs so I could just control it

1218
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:01,139
from my phone so I was like I get

1219
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:02,759
notifications if something's down if the

1220
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:04,139
Wi-Fi goes out like I know like hey this

1221
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,940
light isn't going to cut on I need to

1222
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:07,500
manually go do it because maybe

1223
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,838
something something just happened like

1224
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,699
an outage happened in my area so I know

1225
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,259
I need a prep for that so it kind of

1226
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:14,578
gives me that listing to worry about

1227
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,200
when I'm away and then I also have like

1228
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:18,420
a camera hooked up so I can like kind of

1229
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:19,799
watch just in case I'm like oh it looks

1230
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,838
like there's a problem happening over

1231
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,460
there yeah that helps I mean I remember

1232
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,920
back in the day none of this stuff

1233
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,320
existed I was like open up the tab and

1234
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,119
you know disturbing that environment and

1235
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,280
I live in a very dry climate so I'm like

1236
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,680
opening up the tent humidity is escaping

1237
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,660
you're seeing a drop in humidity and you

1238
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:37,739
know closing it up and it's so much

1239
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:38,819
easier to just be able to look at the

1240
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:40,799
phone and see what the temperature and

1241
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,720
humidity is there looking at the camera

1242
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,119
and being able to see that the plants

1243
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,980
are okay that the lights are on like

1244
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,900
they should be so on and so forth so

1245
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,579
yeah automation is just

1246
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,079
I know there's some people against it I

1247
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:53,519
was like I know some people prefer like

1248
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,539
everything manual because like those

1249
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,980
factors like power outages and stuff but

1250
00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:01,380
it's I guess it's just the generation

1251
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,539
but it's just I like like I like to make

1252
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:05,338
life easy I like to I like to enjoy

1253
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:08,338
everything I'm very tech savvy I like to

1254
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:09,960
use my phone I'm on it 24 7. so if I

1255
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:11,880
could add one more thing to this to make

1256
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,099
that just a little bit easier then I'm

1257
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,780
cool with it I did I did use the for

1258
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:17,880
timers at first I didn't know smart

1259
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,400
plugs were a thing I just went and had

1260
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,160
seen the ones where you uh it's like a

1261
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,358
dial uh and you just you pull uh you

1262
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:26,219
just pull the pins out whatever it's

1263
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:28,019
pretty much just it's what you just plug

1264
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:30,239
and salad and it just spins until it

1265
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:32,219
gets to that dial and then it cuts off

1266
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,078
so I did use that at first but I was

1267
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,639
like I don't know I don't like it I was

1268
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,140
like I prefer to like see the time and

1269
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:38,759
know exactly which time it's going to

1270
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:41,400
cut on yeah it's funny you mentioned

1271
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,339
that those timers you know went from

1272
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,019
that style to the digital style which I

1273
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:48,059
still use and then a lot of people using

1274
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:50,159
the smart plugs now they don't even use

1275
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:51,599
timers anymore those digital timers that

1276
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,759
are made specifically for you know

1277
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,400
Hydroponics for example yeah I feel like

1278
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,960
eventually well now they have I've seen

1279
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,880
recently speaking of automation I've

1280
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,019
seen uh hey Abby

1281
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,240
um I'm not sure if you're familiar with

1282
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:05,460
that but it's pretty much uh it's a dwc

1283
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:07,559
system and it's pretty much a full setup

1284
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,240
like tint a light is inside of it and

1285
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:10,739
it's a machine it's like the size of

1286
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:12,479
maybe like a two by two tent maybe

1287
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:14,338
smaller than that but it's pretty much

1288
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,079
just for one plant or you can probably

1289
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:18,299
run smaller plants inside of it or they

1290
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,818
may have different sizes but I've seen

1291
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,619
one and it's it's fairly expensive it's

1292
00:43:20,818 --> 00:43:25,739
like a thousand bucks but

1293
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:28,440
it's literally a whole automatic system

1294
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:30,899
everything temperature controls it has

1295
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,039
AC built in everything is just automatic

1296
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,900
about it you can control everything you

1297
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:36,300
can feed it from your phone you just put

1298
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,800
like little food Tide Pods inside of it

1299
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,079
and I was like all right that's like

1300
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,880
another step like I was like I would try

1301
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,740
it out if it was like reasonably priced

1302
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,599
but I was like I'm not paying that much

1303
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:47,459
just to you know put a thousand bucks

1304
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,960
into one plan I was like I'm cool on

1305
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,699
that like I don't need to go that far

1306
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,079
into automation I'm not that lady I'm

1307
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:54,299
not that lazy

1308
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,740
you know there have been a handful of

1309
00:43:54,300 --> 00:44:00,180
those systems out there in the past

1310
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:02,818
decade and uh all of them suck for for

1311
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:06,239
uh medicinal plants I mean lettuce you

1312
00:44:02,818 --> 00:44:07,679
know or leafy greens sure but uh people

1313
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,000
have been trying these systems he's been

1314
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:11,098
spending the thousands of dollars and

1315
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,318
realized hey it's better to just spend a

1316
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:16,200
thousand dollars on a grow tank kit and

1317
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:17,940
than it is to send on one automated box

1318
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:19,679
which yeah it's supposed to control the

1319
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,480
pH this is a Reservoir in there there's

1320
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:24,719
Lighting in there but they're all just

1321
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,880
terrible so yeah it is it it didn't even

1322
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,618
look good I'm looking at it I get like a

1323
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,059
little the person I've seen the video

1324
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:31,500
from they like show inside of them

1325
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:33,539
looking at like the aeration the bubble

1326
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,039
output and I'm like is it most likely

1327
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:37,440
going to run into root rot I was like

1328
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,059
he's gonna run into real ride no it's

1329
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,440
terrible I want to go back to lighting

1330
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:42,179
issue you talked about have you ever had

1331
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,338
like a power outage that you had to deal

1332
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:46,739
with at all or no

1333
00:44:44,338 --> 00:44:48,059
um as as far as long term like for some

1334
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:49,439
reason like you know there comes times

1335
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:50,880
there's like maybe a week where it'll

1336
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,980
happen like a couple times but it'll

1337
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,720
like be quickly back on there was one

1338
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,000
time where my lights were out for maybe

1339
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,980
a two three hours and at that point

1340
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,599
after like usually when they go out

1341
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,219
there out for a couple minutes and they

1342
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:03,599
may just pop right back up within like

1343
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:05,519
five minutes but when they were out for

1344
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,079
like after like 30 minutes of being out

1345
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,179
I'm sitting there like okay anytime now

1346
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,859
an hour I'm just like I don't see it

1347
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:13,019
storming outside why is the power out

1348
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:15,420
and I'm just I was sitting there like

1349
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:17,579
super nervous I was like oh no like this

1350
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,139
is like what do I do like I don't have a

1351
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:21,900
generator I don't have any sort to get

1352
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:24,239
my my lights back on and then with dwc

1353
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,800
if I have like soil plants they they can

1354
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,439
make it a couple of days with no light

1355
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,839
and bounce back fine but like if power

1356
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,400
out being a dwc like their oxygen is

1357
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:33,719
gone I'm like what do I do do I just

1358
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,160
like sit there grab the air stones and

1359
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:36,299
start blowing in my mouth I was like I

1360
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:37,920
don't know what to do I was just sitting

1361
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,140
there like scared I was like I don't

1362
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,559
know where to go about this uh but after

1363
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:44,759
like three hours they cut back on uh I

1364
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:46,500
didn't actually run into root rot that

1365
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,839
run I was surprised I was thinking I was

1366
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,639
like oh no it's the plants are going to

1367
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:52,799
be done but they didn't even they

1368
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,000
weren't even bothered they they just

1369
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,200
kept growing they kept doing their thing

1370
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,300
once the lights go as soon as I heard

1371
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,219
like the beep I had uh I think my

1372
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,200
dehumidifier the AC unit it beeps every

1373
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:03,239
time it comes on I heard the beep and I

1374
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:04,739
was like yes I just like screamed I was

1375
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:06,838
like so excited I was like power is back

1376
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:08,338
on and I was like I'm so good but since

1377
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:09,420
then I was like when I move into like a

1378
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:10,920
more permanent setup I was like I'm

1379
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,358
gonna like invest in something like a

1380
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,858
generator or something where I could

1381
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:15,779
temporarily or you know just get my

1382
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:18,779
power back and running while the outages

1383
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:20,700
uh taking place it can be worried so I

1384
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,680
have a lot of people reaching out to me

1385
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:24,960
talking about how their power went out

1386
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,399
and now the lights came back on and they

1387
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,220
were off for a certain number of hours

1388
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,139
and they're really worried about well we

1389
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:33,059
know that light leaks and light

1390
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:34,799
interruptions cause plants to go

1391
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:37,078
hermaphrodite right so that's the main

1392
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,000
concern for a lot of these people so

1393
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,460
like the question is if your lights are

1394
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,019
out for 30 minutes what do you do like

1395
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,940
is that enough of a light interruption

1396
00:46:43,019 --> 00:46:46,739
in order to cause your plant to harm or

1397
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,960
not there's some people who their lights

1398
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:51,959
will be out for three four hours

1399
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,519
and then they'll go right back on and

1400
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,260
their lights will be on for three hours

1401
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,239
and then they'll be off for the 12 hours

1402
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:59,520
and things just get all out of whack

1403
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:01,078
General recommendation that I've been

1404
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:03,420
told and what I've been doing whenever

1405
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,880
I've encountered a power outage is if if

1406
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:09,180
the lights are off for 30 minutes or

1407
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,519
longer you may want to consider keeping

1408
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:13,078
the lights off as if you were starting

1409
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:14,818
your dark period

1410
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:16,318
so for example if your lights are off

1411
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:18,599
for five hours you have a power outage

1412
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:20,159
for five hours you may just want to and

1413
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,660
then your power comes back on you may

1414
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:24,059
just want to keep the lights off for

1415
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:26,399
another seven hours and then you've

1416
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:28,199
completed your 12 hour dark cycle now

1417
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,660
they're going back onto a 12 hour light

1418
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:31,799
cycle and then hopefully your plants

1419
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:35,279
aren't stressed out but there's really

1420
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,960
no firm technique that's gonna say for

1421
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,940
sure no your plants aren't going to harm

1422
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,260
out

1423
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:42,960
it really becomes a tricky situation

1424
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,520
yeah like what that said with the outage

1425
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,720
that's that's like one thing that kind

1426
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:48,480
of like taught me the lessons like you

1427
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:49,739
know what dwc it may not be the best

1428
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,358
thing in the world like because that's

1429
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:53,039
Alice preaching I was like I love dwc

1430
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,679
but that made me realize I was like you

1431
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:58,619
know what it is a very you know it need

1432
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:01,019
everything about it it needs it needs

1433
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,160
electricity and it needs it doesn't it

1434
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:04,380
can't you know go through it can't

1435
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,179
withstand an outage so I was like you

1436
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,200
know what I kind of like sort of dialed

1437
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:09,299
back on I was like you know I'll do

1438
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:10,559
fewer plants fewer bigger plants and

1439
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,300
then everything else I'm just gonna do

1440
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,679
cocoa that way I have that buffer if

1441
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,440
something like that happen and I don't

1442
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,818
have to solely rely on electricity yeah

1443
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,980
yeah that's definitely a good way to go

1444
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:21,838
about it so we did talk about a ton of

1445
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,760
problems that you can come across in

1446
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:26,039
your grow and solutions to those

1447
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,240
problems coming up towards the end of

1448
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:30,179
the episode here one of the questions

1449
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:32,279
that I could ask is getting advice for

1450
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:33,659
new Growers you know you've been growing

1451
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,400
for a couple years now you've gone

1452
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:36,779
through kind of the beginner stages of

1453
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:39,000
it some may say you're still kind of in

1454
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:41,519
the beginning stages but what general

1455
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,980
advice you have for folks that are new

1456
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:45,780
to gardening that main thing is going to

1457
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,760
be not uh not being that critical in

1458
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,619
yourself and really just sitting there

1459
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,359
and trying to learn you know

1460
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:53,039
you don't have to reach out to someone

1461
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:54,480
and learn from them you could learn from

1462
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:57,179
you could learn through just research

1463
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,920
reading a book you know yourself you

1464
00:48:57,179 --> 00:49:00,659
have a book you could you know keep it

1465
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,880
simple really just keep everything as

1466
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:04,379
simple as possible and you don't have to

1467
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,019
know everything that's like the biggest

1468
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,338
concern is like as a new grower I feel

1469
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:09,960
like I've reached a point where I was

1470
00:49:08,338 --> 00:49:11,880
like you know what it was like a big

1471
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,318
drastic change I was like growing I felt

1472
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,300
I felt new I felt like I didn't know

1473
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:17,699
anything and then I really just started

1474
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:20,400
focusing on like not trying to know

1475
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:22,500
everything not know the terminology and

1476
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,240
just like sitting there like uh it's

1477
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,619
strained I don't have to say cultivar I

1478
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:27,299
don't have to like you know just there's

1479
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:29,400
so much information out there I just

1480
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,720
need to know what I needed to know and I

1481
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,940
feel like that's where it comes into

1482
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:34,318
play just know you the core stuff no if

1483
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:37,019
you can make it from seed to harvest

1484
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:38,940
you're good you know you can it may be a

1485
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:40,440
bad Harvest you may not produce the best

1486
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,720
you may have harvested two or you may

1487
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,519
have ran into several issues but really

1488
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:46,318
just learning and being able to correct

1489
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:48,539
those issues the next time just trying

1490
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:50,699
to constantly improve and fix those

1491
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:52,500
things and pick those little tweaks here

1492
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:54,598
and there rather than

1493
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,639
just stressing yourself out about not

1494
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:59,039
knowing everything like it just

1495
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:00,239
continuously keep it simple just make it

1496
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,980
simple on yourself and you're going to

1497
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:03,659
save yourself a huge headache you're not

1498
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:06,119
gonna you're you can't compare yourself

1499
00:50:03,659 --> 00:50:07,618
to someone uh some people I don't have

1500
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:09,240
much Growing Experience but I'll have

1501
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:10,500

1518
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:44,760
um

1519
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:47,160
short for Medusa but doosa farms uh as

1520
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,319
far as what's upcoming

1521
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:51,779
um it's really just folk I'm gonna do

1522
00:50:49,318 --> 00:50:53,400
more lives of course more growing stuff

1523
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:55,559
I'm I'm really starting to get into that

1524
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,280
I feel like I've hit that point where I

1525
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:57,960
could

1526
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,519
teach some stuff because I'm teaching

1527
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,659
people privately so I feel like I

1528
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:02,639
reached a point where I can kind of

1529
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:04,500
publicly say some things that I feel

1530
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:05,519
like I know so I'm I'm getting to that

1531
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,838
point where I'm like I'm starting to put

1532
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:08,639
some information out that I've come

1533
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:10,259
across or something that's helped me at

1534
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:11,578
first I try to avoid doing that because

1535
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,260
I didn't want somebody like hey he

1536
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:14,339
taught me this and it didn't work but

1537
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,839
now I feel like I reached a point where

1538
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:17,639
I've helped enough people in private

1539
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:19,078
that I could publicly say it so I don't

1540
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:20,219
have to have too many people hit me up

1541
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,559
privately it's already public

1542
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:24,779
information out there so a lot of that

1543
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,119
stuff's coming

1544
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:29,220
um it's just honestly it's going to be

1545
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,019
huge I'm going to be getting a full room

1546
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:32,459
growth set up once I once I move into a

1547
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:34,139
house I'm just gonna deck out a full

1548
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,579
room similar to somebody like turkey

1549
00:51:34,139 --> 00:51:37,019
high so stay tuned today I'm going

1550
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:38,640

1551
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:40,079
maybe some people here and there can

1552
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:41,519
give me some pointers and help me in the

1553
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,440
right direction show me what I should do
