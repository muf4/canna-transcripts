many benefits to companion planting

78
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:53,759
which we're going to go over but I think

79
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,360
the main ones are that people can think

80
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,399
of is to help achieve a better quality

81
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,840
and to help achieve a higher yield we're

82

going to get into those details Plus

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,920
plus more in this episode but first can

84
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,439
you tell us a little bit about yourself

85
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:09,798
and how you got into gardening uh yeah

86
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:12,598
so for for me uh gardening was all

87
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:15,120
medicinal in in in many ways whether it

88
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,719
was like uh you know growing my own

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,039
medicinal herbs and things like that or

90
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,000
if it was just the mental space of being

91
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,840
able to go out and get into the garden

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,519
but uh I had a I had a horseback riding

93
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,438
accident um we're closing in on maybe

94
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,280

97
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,319

the FCP channel can you talk a little

124
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,759
bit about those things uh yeah well I

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,319
just I just kind of started in on the

126
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,520
YouTube it it's just Vlogs long winded

127
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,279
Vlogs I got a good gift for gab so I

128
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:51,038
kind of uh I've been doing the Instagram

pretty successfully uh I really enjoy it

131
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,959
but it's really hard to capture that

132
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:00,279
like the true personality of somebody in

133
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,879
like you know 10 to 30 seconds clips and

151
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,680

voice uh I mean I've heard that once or

166
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:07,759
twice yeah yeah I'm going to be right

167
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,080
conscious of it now right welcome to

168
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,080
another episode of garden

169
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,759
talk that's uh yeah that's uh that's

170
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,120
something that that honestly has only

171
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,439
been with me for the last few years I

172
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,399
had no surgery to open up uh I had badly

173
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,839
deviated septum and when I open it up my

174
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,279
voice plummeted wow that's interesting

175
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,560
yeah yeah yeah it's a nice thought

176
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,239
effect

177
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,280
[Laughter]

178
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,439
so let's get into uh companion planting

179
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,839
now can you break it down for the

180
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:39,360
audience I know we've got a lot of

181
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,359
beginners in here we do have some

182
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,120
intermediate and advanced folks as well

183
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,439
but good amount of beginners in here

184
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,639
some might not even know what companion

185
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,759
planting is can you talk to us what is

186
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,240
companion planting and also I'm not sure

187
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,439
if you know the history behind it if you

188
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,960
can get into that a little

189
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:58,918
bit uh

190
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,959
so first off I'm also consider myself a

191
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,318
beginner or maybe like intermediate or

192
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,359
something like that you know what I mean

193
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,039
I I love what I'm doing I love learning

194
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,360
about companion planting but I'm I'm by

195
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:10,079
no means an

196
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,120
expert um compan planting is is actually

197
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,000
something that we use a fair bit you'll

198
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,680
see in indoor and outdoor some people

199
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,519
might not even really know they're using

200
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,360
like cover crop would be one of like a

201
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,279
prime

202
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,720
example uh but companion planting is

203
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,279
planting groupings of plants together

204
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,479
for Mutual benefit whether they're

205
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,399
helping each other through the soil

206
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,560
through the rizosphere whether they're

207
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,799
they're providing protection or pest

208
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,918
control or or shelter or whatever it may

209
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,158
be they're mutually benefiting from each

210
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:47,758
other being there um in terms of History

211
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:51,519
I think probably the most wellknown

212
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:55,360
uh example would be the three sisters so

213
00:07:51,519 --> 00:08:00,038
the three sisters are corn beans and

214
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:03,439
squash so the corn grows super tall uh

215
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:05,959
but is a really heavy nitrogen feeder so

216
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:09,439
it goes really tall that gives a place

217
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:11,359
for the beans to actually travel up uh

218
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,759
and they'll actually they're nitrogen

219
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,960
fixers so things like legumes right like

220
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,520
beans and peas and other things they're

221
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,399
actually taking atmospheric nitrogen and

222
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:23,519
pulling it back down into their uh into

223
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,598
their nodes right and that's giving it a

224
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,598
place for the corn which is a heavy

225
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:31,278
feeder to feed off of the squash are

226
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:34,479
then planted around the base and the

227
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:36,879
Squash uh create this really nice ground

228
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,158
cover which then of course keeps in

229
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,799
moisture prevents a lot of soil erosion

230
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,799
uh and and obviously corn once again

231
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,359
heavy feeder right so they're kind of

232
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,199
feeding off of each other they're

233
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,039
providing the nitrogen providing the

234
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,759
water retention uh keeping that top soil

235
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,240
really happy and healthy uh and in turn

236
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,838
they're all giving each other what they

237
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,759
need to be able to grow so then you have

238
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,800
these this very successful crop of corn

239
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,360
beans or peas and squash right so that's

240
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,719
probably the most prime example that's

241
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,399
from uh that is like uh let's like

242
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:14,560
Native American agriculture for for you

243
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,679
know Millennia at this point right yeah

244
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,359
I'm glad you got into that that's

245
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,439
exactly what I was kind of hoping that

246
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,159
you would mention asking about the

247
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,640
history there is the three sisters and

248
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,879
yeah it's fascinating it's fascinating

249
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,639
that that that's kind of where it

250
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,799
started at least as far as we know that

251
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,600
it started and uh how it's evolved there

252
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:35,479
and there's so many different benefits

253
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,440
of companion planting and uh could you

254
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,800
get into the primary benefits of

255
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,760
companion planting for both not only

256
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:44,519
just the plants themselves but the

257
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,559
overall Garden ecosystem soil as well

258
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,399
right also what are the downsides if

259
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,439
there are any we'll start we'll start

260
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,240
with some of the downsides cuz like the

261
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,560
the pros are so many I think uh in terms

262
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,320
of downsides really like most of the

263
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,159
downsides would be if you plant the

264
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,120
wrong thing if you plant the wrong

265
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:05,039
pairings uh so then something is

266
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,200
fighting for nutrients right if you

267
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,679
plant all night shades down here right

268
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,360
your tomatoes and things like that are

269
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:13,319
all fighting from the same

270
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,320
nutrients uh if you're planting

271
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,560
something that's invasive H it might be

272
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,519
something you're not supposed to plant

273
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,518
in your state or in your Province or in

274
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,600
your country so you always want to check

275
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,720
those things out or it might be

276
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,720
something that you have a heart time

277
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:30,000
removing from the garden uh mint would

278
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,040
be a prime example I love mint

279
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,679
uh but that can get out of control

280
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:35,759
really really quickly and if you don't

281
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,120
love mint and you don't want to be

282
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:41,600
constantly chopping it and dropping it

283
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:44,000
and trying to maintain it and contain it

284
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,759
it can get out of hand so I mean like in

285
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,078
terms of downsides those are like you

286
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:52,039
know they're they're not exactly like

287
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:53,759
the worst things ever um but uh but in

288
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:56,120
terms of the benefits like there's so

289
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,360
many to that um and like you're saying

290
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,320
too right it's it's for for all aspects

291
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,360
of that that entire Garden ecosystem and

292
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,519
there's there are some serious rabbit

293
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,159
holes to go down especially when you

294
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,919
start getting into like what's going on

295
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,240
in the risos spere in terms of like

296
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,039
exudates and things like that but like

297
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,799
some of the main things uh obviously

298
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:22,759
like soil erosion um nutrient cycling is

299
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:25,519
fantastic uh soil Hydraulics the um

300
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:26,720
obviously nitrogen fixation is a big one

301
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,839
and something that like a lot of us

302
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,920
would Fair probably be fairly common

303
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,959
with ESP especially with cover

304
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:37,278
crops uh control of like the moisture

305
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:40,319
retention obviously uh weed suppression

306
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,958
pest control and pollinators pollinators

307
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,959
pollinators bringing in the right

308
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:47,638
pollinators into and bringing in the

309
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:49,199
right beneficial Predators that's like

310
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,560
yeah there's so many things right it's

311
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,320
but like that's what you're trying to do

312
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,439
is like you're just trying to cultivate

313
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,360
this entire ecosystem that's how it

314
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,360
would work if you're out in the woods

315
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,159
that's how it works right like you go

316
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,120
and look around you like nobody's out

317
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,600
there feeding nutrients to everybody

318
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,720
like you know nobody's out there top

319
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,720
dressing the woods it's everybody's

320
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,320
working together to break down material

321
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,600
to cycle nutrients to hold water to

322
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,560
provide cover to do all these things so

323
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,959
that those ecosystems can Thrive and

324
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,239
that's kind of what we're trying to do

325
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:21,439
is is you're trying to you know benefit

326
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,198
from canopy to rizosphere right so

327
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,320
awesome yeah that was a good recap there

328
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:27,599
so it could be so beneficial in so many

329
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,959
different ways and I'd like to narrow

330
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,639
down on some of those points

331
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,759
you know you mentioned pest control

332
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,399
that's one thing we can get into next

333
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,399
after that we can touch on like weed

334
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,159
suppression pollination which you

335
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,759
touched upon soil ecosystem beneficial

336
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,958
insects and crop productivity so yeah

337
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:46,799
yeah let's start with a pest control can

338
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,159
you tell us how does companion planting

339
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,919
contribute to Natural pest control and

340
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:54,360
can you give some specific examples yeah

341
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,719
yeah uh also I'll I'll try to touch on

342
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,919
like some of the ones that like are a

343
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,480
little more easily accessible to a lot

344
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,919
of us and some things that we're pretty

345
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,079
familiar with and you could probably

346
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:06,958
grow it in in whatever Zone you're in um

347
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:08,319
but in terms of like they do it a couple

348
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,799
of different ways so they have like

349
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
scent so through essential you know

350
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,639
essential oils the release of certain

351
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:19,199
smells that deter pests uh bringing in

352
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:22,600
beneficial Predators trap cropping uh or

353
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:24,359
even trap confusion so in terms of

354
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,639
scents uh

355
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,680
marigolds uh basil lemongrass a lot of

356
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:33,159
the herb hers that you would use in

357
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:34,638
culinary things or in medicinal herbs

358
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:37,838
and things like that a lot of those are

359
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:41,399
actually usually also great at repelling

360
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,240
pests so like mint rosemary garlic basil

361
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,278
marold all these things that you can

362
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,440
plant that you're either going to you're

363
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,879
going to probably consume them yourself

364
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,680
as well they're also very good at

365
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:56,600
deterring pests uh so a lot of them

366
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:59,319
release their essential oils like basil

367
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,800
fantastic uh mirold would probably be

368
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,839
the one that a lot of people would

369
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:06,599
associate with companion planting you'll

370
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,079
see that indoors and Outdoors so the

371
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,440
marold itself does release uh an

372
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:14,559
essential oil right a smell that'll

373
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:19,560
deter things like aphids uh White flaws

374
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:22,239
and some others but it also has uh um a

375
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:25,958
compound that it releases into the soil

376
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:29,639
called thop and that actually deters

377
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,638
predatory nematodes so and and they can

378
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,159
you know there's other things like

379
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,440
mirold can also be like a a trap crop as

380
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:38,759
well so that like it'll attract uh other

381
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,199
things to come eat it before they make

382
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,639
it to your plants but some of the major

383
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,719
benefits for that yeah like I'm saying

384
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:49,240
are are just the the the deterrence of

385
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,639
the smells so which is cool because like

386
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,399
these all have like multiple uses right

387
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:57,120
you could grow basil and Rosemary and

388
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,000
Thyme uh lemongrass all these things

389
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,600
that you can use in culinary use in

390
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
medicinal herbs and things like that but

391
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,480
they also deter gats white flies aphids

392
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,240
and other

393
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,959
bugs um I think another a great example

394
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,759
of that would just for even in just your

395
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,719
garden or just in your backyard alone

396
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,639
citronella plant something that we're

397
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,480
all very you uh we find very commonly in

398
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,399
like Walmart or wherever you're going

399
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,320
you can get like citronella candles and

400
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,198
citronella sprays you can plant the

401
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,759
citronella plant around the perimeter of

402
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,359
your property and that deters things

403
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:32,800
like mosquitoes and and other knats

404
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,240
right so like you know so in terms of

405
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,838
scents you have a lot of different

406
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,159
options there uh but there's also like

407
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:42,920
like trap cropping so uh one of my

408
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:46,799
favorites probably if you if you've seen

409
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:50,479
me grow indoors or Outdoors Nast jersam

410
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,799
I love nashers so we plant nashers

411
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,920
around the outside of like a standup bed

412
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,439
or it around the perimeter uh and a lot

413
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,240
of PL a lot of these like pests and

414
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,120
stuff they'll go and they'll probably

415
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,839
consume the nastri from first they just

416
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,600
kind of get lost in it they go they eat

417
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,199
this first and they don't make their way

418
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,560
into your Tomatoes or into your cabbages

419
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:12,519
or whatever it is they're making their

420
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,000
way to um that's probably one of my

421
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,600
favorites CU you can eat the entire

422
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,278
thing right you can eat the leaves you

423
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,560
can eat the stems you can eat the flour

424
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,439
plus it's it's trapping other ones and

425
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,518
they kind of make a home there first

426
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,160
before they ever make their way into

427
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,839
your precious crops right so um plus

428
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,559
they're just they're pretty and they

429
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,360
make a great ground cover right they

430
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,159
have a lot of extra like kind of uses

431
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,159
that citronella tip you mentioned is

432
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,559
gold for a lot of people man I know I

433
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,480
used to live in Massachusetts and

434
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:43,559
mosquitoes were crazy and they have the

435
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,039
citronella candles and sprays and all

436
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,439
that stuff it's like planted around your

437
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,198
property you know what I mean like the

438
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,279
perimeter of property and help get rid

439
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,359
of those I don't know how how well

440
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,838
that'll work I mean guess depends on how

441
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,600
big your property is and stuff like that

442
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,480
but I can imagine some of that stuff

443
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,319
working really really good and Mar golds

444
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,000
one you didn't name which I'll throw out

445
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:06,000
there is peppermint so peppermint is

446
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,759
another one that kind of Falls in that

447
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,318
category of pescat control I use that as

448
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:13,400
IPM spray so essential oil mix up with

449
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,480
water and surfactant and spraying that

450
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,759
on the plants around the plants and soil

451
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,199
stuff like that once a week well every

452
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,679
other week you know kind of rotating

453
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,519
sprays Rosemary mentioned and yeah so

454
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,880
there're a ton of different things like

455
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:28,240
that that going to help with pest

456
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,120
control and I'm glad you got into them

457
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,079
and yeah you you'll find those in like

458
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,798
you're saying in a lot of your you know

459
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,960
your organic sprays and stuff are

460
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:39,759
usually some form of like peppermint

461
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,679
oregano Rosemary uh cloves cinnamon any

462
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,558
of those kind of like essential oils and

463
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,919
stuff and you find a lot of those uh in

464
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:47,200
some of your natural herbs and stuff

465
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,759
that you can grow so they have like

466
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,120
multiple uses they could be Ground

467
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:53,079
Covers they could be pest deterrents or

468
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,599
they can you can pick them off and throw

469
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:57,038
them in your throw them in the frying

470
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,279
pan so that's awesome yeah you get

471
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,519
multiple uses out of it yeah yeah let's

472
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,038
get into weed suppression next How Can

473
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:07,679
companion planting suppress weeds so in

474
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:10,400
terms of weed suppression uh simply they

475
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,519
just out compete so low-lying Ground

476
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,919
Covers can just out compete weeds uh

477
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,400
things like like like we're talking

478
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,520
about like cover crops and things like

479
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,519
lentils are usually in there L lentils

480
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:23,558
are a very low line kind of cover

481
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,319
they'll they'll grow very quickly

482
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:29,200
they'll Vine across and that usually

483
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:31,079
chokes out any other kind of uh weed

484
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,080
trying to get through same thing with

485
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:34,918
like the

486
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,720
Noms uh the squash and other things that

487
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,520
can like create a really good ground

488
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,159
cover um and create like a lot of shade

489
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:45,359
they're they're choking out those weeds

490
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,080
right uh really hard for weed to get

491
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,319
established when that's when that's

492
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,759
happening but uh that's also like that's

493
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,200
it's kind of leads into something else

494
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,720
is like sure they're choking out the

495
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,519
weeds and they're creating this really

496
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,079
nice ground cover but that's also then

497
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:01,679
creating a really nice place for for

498
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:04,759
like beneficial mites and predators and

499
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,080
other things to come in right so it's

500
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,558
it's hard to talk about one thing

501
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,038
without having to talk about all of it

502
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:11,079
because there's so many like benefits

503
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,480
but that's pretty well when it comes to

504
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:15,158
suppressing weeds you're for the most

505
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,679
part you're just choking them out very

506
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:18,080
quickly and you have a lot of options

507
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,640
there right you can do

508
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,359
lentils uh and things that are also

509
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,159
helping with like nitrogen and stuff but

510
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:25,558
you can uh if you want to get like a

511
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,039
little prettier with it with ground

512
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:29,279
coverage you can do like creeping thy or

513
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:31,359
flocks

514
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,399
uh crimson clover is another one that

515
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,678
we're usually fairly familiar with and

516
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,640
like Lamb's ears things like that they

517
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,480
create this really nice ground cover low

518
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,919
Ling great in of course for for like

519
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,919
water retention and things like that but

520
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:46,960
they're they're just out competing right

521
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,360
making sure that those weeds just cannot

522
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,480
get a foothold in your garden right I

523
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,798
appreciate you mentioned a bunch of

524
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,679
examples there yeah I have a buddy here

525
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,359
in Las Vegas that's where I live it's

526
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,759
very very hot out here you know it's uh

527
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:04,918
let's see right now it's 100° and it

528
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:08,720
often reaches 110° F and Freedom Units

529
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:11,080
yeah what is that 110 Fahrenheit to to

530
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,360
Canadian units you got to do the

531
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:14,199
calculation there I don't know what it

532
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:16,519
is in Celsius I'm because I'm I'm from

533
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Labrador so yeah so that's uh that's

534
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:23,839
like yeah mid 40s which is like I so I'm

535
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,120
in New Jersey right now I can I could

536
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,959
barely handle it when it hits like like

537
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:30,359
mid-30s right I'm from I'm from New land

538
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,480
Labrador which is like one of the

539
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:37,199
coldest provinces like a big change for

540
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:40,000
you it's a it is a massive change

541
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,519
man but I have a buddy that lives here

542
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,919
who uses melon as a cover you know I me

543
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,158
the melon they grow so so big the leaves

544
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:52,038
are just so massive that it really

545
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:54,000
covers almost this entire bed and it

546
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:56,640
helps with water retention really cuz

547
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,558
like it's D soil drives out so quickly

548
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,759
so easily here in such high temp that

549
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:04,480
having that cover over it helps

550
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,879
tremendously so fig I call that one out

551
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,200
yeah and that's and that's that's great

552
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,000
because that's like like we're talking

553
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,600
about with the three sisters right the

554
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,880
squash so like squash melons anything

555
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,959
that's got those large leaves that are

556
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,080
growing over the top right like they're

557
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,079
they're creating that really nice like

558
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,798
canopy there where there's they're

559
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,839
holding in that moisture the sun's not

560
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:25,639
able to get down and penetrate it's

561
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:28,879
keeping the soil from becoming like

562
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,360
hydrophobic and yeah I uh and then of

563
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,080
course if you start to compare it with

564
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:34,719
like beans and peas and other things now

565
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:37,759
we're pumping nitrogen and other things

566
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,480
back down into the soil it's yeah I see

567
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,240
I get like this is one of those topics

568
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,400
where there's so many like benefits that

569
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,640
it's hard to just like it's hard to just

570
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,880
be like yeah let's just talk about this

571
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,038
one thing cuz it's you're creating such

572
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,200
an amazing ecosystem that feeds the soil

573
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,720
feeds the plants feeds the air and they

574
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,640
all protect each other and they work out

575
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,200
each other and it's just yeah it's

576
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,278
something that it's always been pretty

577
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:03,519
exciting for me I got inspired from

578
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:05,759
uh Niagara homegrown CB tree and Nikita

579
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,759
green Thom they were accounts that were

580
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,480
either doing like big beautiful gardens

581
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,798
Outdoors that were just like Lush from

582
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,000
one end of their backyard to another or

583
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:17,879
in like niagar homegrown case he had a

584
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,200
100gal pot in his basement uh with

585
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,559
living soil and he would you know he

586
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,919
would switch out his electric lettuce

587
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,798
throughout his time but there was always

588
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,600
like nashum and peppers and beans and

589
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,480
peas and things hanging off the side

590
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:34,000
that's kind of what got me into it and

591
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,519
now I I can't help but grow like that

592
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,919
like first time I ever did it with uh

593
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:43,558
seven gallon pots four S gallon pots and

594
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:48,679
a little 2 and 1 half Square uh um tent

595
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:52,000
indoors I grew th Dill chamomile nrum

596
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:55,519
and a few others that was the easiest

597
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,960
grow I have ever had I use less

598
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:02,240
nutrients less water the tarpine uction

599
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,000
on everything was through the roof and

600
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,079
just the visuals and just opening it up

601
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,880
just opening up that tent that rich

602
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:12,918
Botanical smell would come through

603
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,960
everybody was happy healthy pest free it

604
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:17,278
was the easiest grow I've ever done and

605
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,120
that's I try to incorporate that now

606
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:22,000
into everything that I do and it's pays

607
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:23,319
off in droves for me yeah I feel like

608
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,119
companion plantic is probably one of the

609
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,960
most

610
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,158
underutilized processes all

611
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,120
underutilized techniques in gardening

612
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,080
you know

613
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,079
like more people should be doing it you

614
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,599
don't see a whole lot of people doing it

615
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,599
I imagine if I took a poll actually I

616
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:38,759
probably will do a poll and figure out

617
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:41,119
how many people do you companion plant

618
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:42,919
yes no type thing and see how many

619
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,199
people do and I would be willing to bet

620
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:47,600
there's got to be at least uh I don't

621
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,319
know I'd say 80 plus percent people

622
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,399
don't do it yeah yeah well I've SE so

623
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,480
many Gardens where people are you know

624
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,200
they they have this new backyard or this

625
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,038
new plot or whatever it is and they just

626
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,759
plant a few crops in there and they kind

627
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:03,038
of struggle it's like well like this one

628
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,519
needs shade this one needs more nitrogen

629
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,278
this one's a heavy feeder this needs

630
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:08,200
this but also the biggest thing is like

631
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,640
the ground like you haven't really done

632
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,840
anything with the ground itself so maybe

633
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,480
it's compacted maybe it's doesn't have

634
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:18,038
as much nitrogen or or anything that it

635
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,679
that it needs just throwing over a cover

636
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:22,000
crop which is something you'll see in a

637
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,880
lot of like agricultural Farm practices

638
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,919
especially in like regenerative uh beans

639
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,520
or oats and uh oats and peas would be a

640
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,080
prime examp we go in and flood an entire

641
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:33,798
field that needs to be turned over the

642
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,678
next year you'll fill it with oats and

643
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:38,879
peas oats grow tall the peas grow up it

644
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,679
it's an amazing source of nitrogen and

645
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,960
proteins and amino acids and things like

646
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,679
that when crimped and decomposed but

647
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,240
it's

648
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,320
also uh creating a lot of nitrogen down

649
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,519
into the soil a lot of nitrogen fixation

650
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:54,519
so the next year when you come to plant

651
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:57,798
on that you've got this uh you know very

652
00:24:54,519 --> 00:25:00,440
rich compost over the top the soil is

653
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:03,119
very like open and very lomy it's very

654
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,720
happy and uh and it's full of nutrients

655
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,839
right and that's I think that's

656
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,278
something that like a lot of people are

657
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,678
missing it's like oh you could bring a

658
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:13,200
lot of life and vitality and soil

659
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,600
fertility back by just like a few simple

660
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,798
Companions and if you're having problem

661
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:19,240
with pest throw some basil a there throw

662
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:22,359
some lemon grass throw some mint do a

663
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,679
few of those other things but yeah it's

664
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,879
hopefully we'll see more people get into

665
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,038
it I don't think people quite understand

666
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,679
some of the real benefits of it as well

667
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:32,359
you know cuz it's it's a lot of it maybe

668
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:33,798
you're just throwing asri and you think

669
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:35,839
they look pretty but they're serving you

670
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:38,599
know like multiple purposes in there

671
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:41,038
right so yeah great Point pollination I

672
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:43,319
want to get into that next now there are

673
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,119
many fruits vegetables plenty of plants

674
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:47,480
out there that need to be pollinated in

675
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,519
order it to produce right a good example

676
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,120
would be Peppers right now you can do it

677
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:55,319
by hand sure Peppers melons citrus trees

678
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,479
the list goes on how does companion

679
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:59,720
planting help with pollination

680
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,240
pollinators pollinators we all we all

681
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,519
love our pollinators uh whether that's

682
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,440
bees uh you know bumblebees honeybees

683
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:11,119
butterflies hummingbirds moths whatever

684
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,759
it is you're you're creating a home for

685
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:17,239
them to come in uh so we bring them in

686
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:20,038
with things like cingula lavender uh

687
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:23,599
nusum once again right like the so many

688
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:25,879
of these are are interchangeable your um

689
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,319
creating a home for them to come in and

690
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,960
if they're drawn and attracted to the

691
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,200
you know potential pollinate uh you know

692
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,120
flowers and things that are in your

693
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,278
garden then you've got more pollinators

694
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:38,119
kicking around they're going to be able

695
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,159
to pollinate your cucumbers your melons

696
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:43,639
your peppers and all the other things

697
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,960
that are honestly so annoying to hand

698
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,880
pollinate if you've ever hand pollinated

699
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:52,360
cucumbers you will understand how much

700
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,919
you love pollinators to come in and do

701
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:56,119
that job for you um but that's I mean

702
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,880
that's really that's it right you get

703
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:01,439
more of an abundant crop um one of my

704
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,760
favorites cucam melons I don't know if

705
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,640
you ever seen these things these little

706
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,798
these little they're like in between a

707
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,559
cucumber and a watermelon they're only

708
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:12,200
like this big they're most adorable

709
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:14,079
little things but they produce hundreds

710
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,120
of little flowers and every day when you

711
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:19,158
go out they would be full of bees doing

712
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,519
their thing it brings them in but for me

713
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,520
that's like uh that's like a little

714
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:24,558
garden snack so I can walk out get a

715
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:27,119
little get like a pocket full of those

716
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,839
and walk around and check your crops uh

717
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,558
but things like that like bring in your

718
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:33,599
nusum uh your milkweed and all these

719
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:35,879
flowers that like bring in hummingbirds

720
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,519
and pollinators they're just making sure

721
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,520
that there's there's a little more

722
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,000
there's more bees there's more

723
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:41,918
hummingbirds and there's more friends to

724
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,960
go around and make sure you're actually

725
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,278
you know you're actually getting your

726
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,240
crops to pollinate properly and it works

727
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:50,880
you get you get way more of an abundant

728
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,079
crop and it's way easier that way got it

729
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,960
how about the soil ecosystem How Can

730
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,798
companion planting improve soil health

731
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,558
and fertility and what are some

732
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:02,398
effective plant combinations for this

733
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:04,038
purpose oh yeah so this is like this is

734
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,398
like the rabbit hole that you can go

735
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:08,519
down this is like one of my favorite

736
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:10,839
Parts about this uh so you know we're

737
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,919
preventing soil erosion we're retaining

738
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:14,558
water uh obviously you're fixing like

739
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,278
hydrophobic soil and things like that

740
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:21,319
we're feeding the rise of Fear through

741
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:24,519
nitrogen fixation uh exudates we're

742
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:26,960
producing a better nutrient cycle right

743
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,440
so uh some great ones that we're you

744
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,319
know we're very used to anything in like

745
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,120
the

746
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:36,398
legumes uh like green beans and fava

747
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,558
beans and peas and then there's like

748
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:41,359
white clover red clover alala all these

749
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:43,119
things they're they're bringing in

750
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,119
atmospheric nitrogen they're pulling it

751
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,000
in from the atmosphere and putting it

752
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,678
down into their nodules which is great

753
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,359
it's is wonderful for you know uh

754
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,880
anything that is it's heavy feeder that

755
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,240
needs a little extra

756
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,679
nitrogen um which you can like there's a

757
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,038
lot of like cool stuff you can do with

758
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,080
that you don't have to just do like

759
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:04,319
traditional nitrogen fixing crops like

760
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,678
that you can do like there's shrubs and

761
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:09,200
trees and things like that that you can

762
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,440
do like long-term nitrogen fixation like

763
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,080
one of my favorites seab Buckthorn

764
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,240
berries I love seab Buckthorn one of my

765
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:19,000
favorites it's a you know a super food

766
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:23,038
kind of thing but it's uh a beautiful

767
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,079
Bush that can obviously fixate uh

768
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:28,919
nitrogen one thing I think that we're a

769
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:31,678
lot of people are very common I find

770
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,880
very commonly is comrey comfrey is a

771
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,880
dynamic accumulator with a really big

772
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:41,320
tapr so it it drives this really big

773
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:44,080
tappery way down and pulls all kinds of

774
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:47,480
nutrients up making it a little easier

775
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:49,839
for other uh shallower root zones to be

776
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,278
able to achieve some of those nutrients

777
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:52,798
but it also makes a really good green

778
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:55,038
mulch because it pulls it into these

779
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,319
giant leads you chop and drop those

780
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,119
around of course now we're we're laying

781
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:01,599
out this nice green mulch which is

782
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,798
better for soil erosion once again water

783
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,678
retention but you're feeding the

784
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:08,200
rizosphere and you're feeding the fungal

785
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:11,278
life and it can reinvigorate your your

786
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,880
your area pretty quickly so things like

787
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:16,798
um obviously beans and peas and things

788
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,960
like that are great uh barley and oats

789
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,798
and things that can help with uh like

790
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,600
nitrogen lock out and things like that

791
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,038
as well um but then of course if you

792
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,119
chop them they make a really good mulch

793
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:29,839
cover so it's you're all about like like

794
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:32,000
soil is is that's where everybody's

795
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,720
going right so if it's if it's

796
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,440
hydrophobic and it's sad and it has

797
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,319
really shallow root zones like you want

798
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,080
deep root zones you want like you want

799
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,599
to keep that moisture in there you want

800
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,199
to cycle those nutrients um and that's

801
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:48,519
kind of where we start getting into that

802
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:51,679
that that that um uh the Wormhole that

803
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:53,079
that that rabbit hole of exudates

804
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:58,679
because then we start looking at like

805
00:30:53,079 --> 00:31:00,839
like basil exudates or uh uh your

806
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,759
marol and other things like that that

807
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,720
are not just like putting nitrogen into

808
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:09,000
the soil but can be dropping like uh

809
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,038
polysaccharides amino acids uh they're

810
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,679
signaling to each other they're they're

811
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:17,960
releasing mucilages that can uh retain

812
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,798
more moisture in the soil like there's

813
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,798
so many benefits to being able to have

814
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,278
this diverse rizosphere and this

815
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,519
ecosystem in there that just feeds the

816
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:30,599
soil and keeps that not only that top

817
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,960
soil happy but like deep down into the

818
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:35,038
soil you're you know preventing the

819
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,278
compaction you're you're bringing

820
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,879
nitrogen and other nutrients and stuff

821
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:40,278
that we couldn't get we're bringing them

822
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,440
up to the surface with things like

823
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:44,159
confrey so that's one of those things

824
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,639
where like there's so many benefits to

825
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,039
the soil in terms of like how we can

826
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:52,119
cycle nutrients water retention or even

827
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:55,200
produce our own compost and mulches that

828
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:57,158
can better feed that soil uh and that

829
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,080
that top soil throughout the year so

830
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:00,559
it's yeah that's one of those ones where

831
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:03,759
like I feel like you do a whole episode

832
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:06,519
on just like exudates like those

833
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,679
melage that's produced in there cuz they

834
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:11,038
they can signal to each other like when

835
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:12,480
like if one PL plant is being eaten up

836
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:13,759
by whatever it can say hey I'm being

837
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,240
eaten we're being attacked they could

838
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,839
communicate through the root zones and

839
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,759
say I need I need more sugars to be able

840
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,959
to produce more Turpin or I need more

841
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,759
amino acids to be able to create more

842
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,360
whatever I need to be able to fend off

843
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,359
this pest I need more essential oil so

844
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:30,678
maybe then the basil releas is more

845
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:33,558
essential oils like there's there's just

846
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:35,360
so much to that but yeah it's it's

847
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:36,798
amazing what you can do with like Barren

848
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,519
soil which just a little bit of like

849
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,599
cover crops like I said bring in

850
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,960
nitrogen bring in more uh nutrients and

851
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:46,678
and creating like that that mulch layer

852
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:49,200
right so you can you can restore and

853
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:51,919
balance your soil pretty quickly it

854
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,840
truly is incredible Yeah you mentioned

855
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,519
Clover that's something I use I use a

856
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,959
white Dutch Clover nitrogen fixer right

857
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:59,679
so it's going to grab the nitrogen from

858
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,200
there like you mentioned put it down in

859
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,519
the root Zone and cck if I'm wrong but

860
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,798
the it'll hold that in the nodules until

861
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,079
the plan is actually killed off so the

862
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:10,679
plant actually needs to be killed off

863
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:12,519
and then it's kind of released I'm not

864
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:14,759
sure if the microbes need to then cycle

865
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:16,399
those nutrients or what but I'm told

866
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,599
that's not really available as if the

867
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:19,239
Clover is still alive and it's still

868
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,678
growing the nitrogen actually isn't

869
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,038
available till it's killed off now is

870
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:26,720
that true or or false so it does depend

871
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:29,679
on the plant so there's some Clover pull

872
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,038
it into the green leaves and it needs to

873
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,240
be chopped it's like kind of like your

874
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:37,038
barley your oats some clovers need to be

875
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,960
chopped others do pull it down into

876
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:42,398
nodules but there's a bacteria that

877
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,319
reacts with those nodules to release

878
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:48,518
nitrogen right there's several types of

879
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:51,000
like nitrogen releasing bacteria hence

880
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:55,359
not the expert talk right here right

881
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,359
bacteria nitrogen Roots

882
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,398
happy um from what I've from what I've

883
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,399
been reading and I've been doing a lot

884
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:06,158
of stuff on like a lot I get a lot of my

885
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,158
info from like sciencedirect.com

886
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:31,440
reacting with bacteria it's in the soil

887
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,559
that will actually release nitrogen

888
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,079
throughout their life cycle as well

889
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:38,358
right hence why like the three sisters

890
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:40,320
work so well right corn really needs

891
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:42,398
that feed and the beans and peas and

892
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,119
Things release that nitrogen down in

893
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,480
there through that

894
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:49,119
bacterial process

895
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,639
right so it's one of those things where

896
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,919
like you you you would want to look up

897
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,159
like okay I'd like to you know I'd like

898
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,759
to add more nitrogen to the so soil do I

899
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,519
need to do chop and drop all the time or

900
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,920
or can I add something that's going to

901
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,480
slowly release and feed but it's it's

902
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,880
beneficial to have it from all aspects

903
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,760
so that's why you'll see in like cover

904
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,358
crops you'll have like lentils vreek

905
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,200
barley

906
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:17,000
um uh Clover and a few others some are

907
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,679
good for chopping and dropping and

908
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,440
releasing forms of nitrogens others are

909
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,679
are like you say they're holding it down

910
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,000
in those nodules some are releasing it

911
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:29,039
through bacteria and others need to be

912
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,320
killed off in the process but they'll

913
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,880
like clover will almost like Reed itself

914
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,280
as well right so it really good at

915
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,599
fixing nitrogen but then it just th off

916
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,599
and it'll come back in in the spring

917
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:44,000
with new seeds right so okay understood

918
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,599
exr dates episode are you uh

919
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,079
volunteering yourself for because that

920
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,920
would be a pretty cool episode I agree

921
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:50,640
with you I mean yeah that's something

922
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,639
that like you know we could get into cuz

923
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,920
it's it's pretty cool how like I say

924
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:57,239
like you know that's the one thing that

925
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,318
a lot of us think about is nitrogen but

926
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:02,279
we're we're also producing like like the

927
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:06,239
maragold right and um what's it

928
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:08,880
thiophene right this this root exudate

929
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,598
that tells predatory nematodes to go

930
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,838
away but they also communicate with each

931
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:15,920
other and exchange carbon and exchange

932
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:18,400
nitrogen and amino acids polysaccharides

933
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,000
there's mucilages that like protect

934
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,599
things like it's it's huge but it's

935
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,920
amazing and that's that's I mean that's

936
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:25,119
where we're getting all of our our

937
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,800
nutrients from that's where we're

938
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,920
getting our strong resilient plants from

939
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:33,880
is biodiverse ecosystems that are

940
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,039
communicating not just in the soil but

941
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,079
you know in the canopy and wherever else

942
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:40,920
but yeah it's uh that that would be a

943
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,560
big episode for sure that's when we

944
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,200
started getting into I was like man I

945
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:45,599
like I don't know where to like CAU

946
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:47,960
myself off with

947
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,318
exudates but like nitrogen fixation

948
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,400
right that's that's one of the biggest

949
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:53,960
things that we would probably be most

950
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,480
commonly uh like aware of cuz a lot of

951
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,480
people use cover crops and that's that's

952
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,519
one of the the major benefits of it

953
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,480
right so if you want to see an ex dates

954
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:04,199
episode let us know down in the comments

955
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,800
section below just leave it leave it

956
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:07,559
down there on YouTube and we'll uh

957
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,800
there's enough demand we'll we'll get

958
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:12,440
them back on here we we'll do

959
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,960
it beneficial insects I want to get into

960
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,599
that next can you discuss the role of

961
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,440
companion planting and attracting

962
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:21,359
beneficial insects to the

963
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,358
Garden yeah yeah well uh once again one

964
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:26,318
of the ones that we're we're most

965
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:29,519
commonly uh used to would be

966
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:31,599
ladybugs uh or Green Lace Wings pray

967
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,880
mantises things like that but like

968
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:39,400
ladybugs uh we can attract them in with

969
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,720
things like uh Yaro kalindula milkweed

970
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:45,240
some of these other flowers and things

971
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:47,199
like this they bring in your your you

972
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:50,559
know your your predators that are you

973
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:54,358
know beneficial Predators so

974
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,799
uh the ladybugs the Green Lace Wings

975
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:58,358
they're ones that you would see that get

976
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,720
attracted due to flowers so they come

977
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:02,159
they hang out and they make a home they

978
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:04,879
see you have aphids cool they go to town

979
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:07,159
on them um but then you've also have

980
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,280
like let's say our our our cover crops

981
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,960
like the nasams and other things that

982
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,200
are creating a really nice home just

983
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,440
above the soil that's creating a nice

984
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:19,118
place for like beneficial mites and Ro

985
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,720
beetles so you're just really you're

986
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,440
just creating a home you're making a

987
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:24,759
home for things like ladybugs praying

988
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,920
mandes your Green Lace Wings who come in

989
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,599
and eat aphids and eat uh White flies

990
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,800
and mey bugs and other things like that

991
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,480
so it's just it's just another part of

992
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,119
that like yeah just just make a home for

993
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,400
them right and they'll they'll come in

994
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,880
same with the pollinators you're making

995
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,960
a home for them they'll come in they'll

996
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,358
pollinate your crops while they're there

997
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,280
same thing with your ladybugs and your

998
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:46,039
Green Lace Wings make a home they come

999
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,200
in and they'll just eat all the bad

1000
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:50,599
insects while they're there right so not

1001
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:52,559
all bugs are bad some people think jump

1002
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:53,760
to that assumption that oh I got bugs

1003
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:55,838
and how do I get rid of them it's like

1004
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,560
well hold on what is it end up ends up

1005
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,559
being a beneficial you know it's like

1006
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:01,318
what the heck yeah yeah well that's like

1007
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:02,759
the springtails are the one of those one

1008
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:04,800
of those ones that like people see and

1009
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,440
they pot and they Panic like oh my God

1010
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,960
it's full of like little all these

1011
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,440
little white things well I mean like

1012
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,838
they're down there you know breaking

1013
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,280
down breaking down like decomposing

1014
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:17,838
matter so like you know come on in come

1015
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:21,240
hang out right as long as things are not

1016
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:23,519
like an infestation right a balance it

1017
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:25,439
needs to be obviously aphids they don't

1018
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,159
get the balance get out of here go away

1019
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,079
we don't want you you're going to eat

1020
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:33,039
our crops but in terms of like uh you

1021
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,280
know your Ro beetles your springtails

1022
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,559
and things like that like they're in

1023
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,240
there to balance things out they're

1024
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:40,559
breaking down decomposing matter which

1025
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:42,879
then can feed the bacteria the protozoa

1026
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:45,759
the the rapers everybody else that's in

1027
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,400
there the fungal life and once then

1028
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,000
that's right back into like nutrient

1029
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,519
cycling they are able to break it down

1030
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,480
and feed it in and yeah it's just uh as

1031
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:56,480
long as there's balance so you create a

1032
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,440
home for those pollinators and for those

1033
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,639
beneficial back IA and for those

1034
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,480
beneficial mites and predators and

1035
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,799
everybody to come in and it's like I

1036
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,599
said it's like one of the easiest grows

1037
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,280
you'll ever do when you find balance

1038
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,359
where like you're able to repel certain

1039
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,160
pests and bring them what you want you

1040
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:14,799
just got to go and water

1041
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:16,318
it balance is definitely key I'm glad

1042
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,640
you mentioned that because if you have

1043
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:19,679
that imbalance it could kind of throw

1044
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,118
things off right if you have an

1045
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,199
overpopulation of something well that

1046
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:26,400
could you know take over I heard a lot

1047
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:28,039
of people having issues with um roly

1048
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,160
poliy

1049
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:31,639
and just take over it's harmful ends up

1050
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:33,920
being a harmful thing instead of a

1051
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:35,838
beneficial thing yeah yeah and like Roy

1052
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,440
polies can be your friend but if there's

1053
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:41,400
too many the same thing right like

1054
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,639
balance you must find balance and that's

1055
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,079
I mean that you know that goes further

1056
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,719
the companion planting though right

1057
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,160
that's you know how do you water how do

1058
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:51,358
you keep things clean humidity air

1059
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:53,118
that's like yeah that's a whole thing on

1060
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,078
it on itself but that's achieving

1061
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,318
balance like once it's once you find

1062
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,640
balance some of these grows are so easy

1063
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:01,239
I've been doing a lot of my companion

1064
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:05,358
planting and stuff indoors and like it's

1065
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:07,759
so easy to keep those those pots moist

1066
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:11,239
but without having them soaked and water

1067
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:14,319
logged the the surface tension like you

1068
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:17,000
almost never get hydrophobic soil your

1069
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,719
your Leaf sets everybody's happy and fed

1070
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,199
and healthy the entire time everything

1071
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,799
that I put in there the electric lettuce

1072
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:26,960
would be like preing the entire time no

1073
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,359
top dresses just water and good quality

1074
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,000
so o to Startup and oh yeah that's it

1075
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:35,719
makes it so easy and just so like the

1076
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,719
basil is is more fragrant the peppers

1077
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:41,279
you grow are spicier and have more

1078
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:42,959
flavor the tomatoes everything has

1079
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,079
everything just seems so much happier

1080
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,679
and healthier plus you're growing it at

1081
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,359
home that's that's a huge thing right

1082
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:53,199
there yeah you mentioned earlier in the

1083
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:54,960
episode that you amazing tarpine profile

1084
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:57,318
when you do companion pting let's get

1085
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,480
into that a little bit more how does

1086
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:03,000
companion planting actually enhan the

1087
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,760
flavor growth yield of certain crops and

1088
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,079
what are some examples of that yeah well

1089
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,880
that's that's another one where there's

1090
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:11,000
there's so many examples but it's the

1091
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,838
same as like you know the three sisters

1092
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,639
obviously right the corn is a heavy

1093
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:17,358
feeder so that's feeding off of the

1094
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:20,920
nitrogen they're being able to produce a

1095
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:24,358
heavier crop um in terms of

1096
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:27,440
like like at home like indoor growing

1097
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:30,119
whatever it may be uh things like like

1098
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,400
basil Basil's one that they're talking a

1099
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:34,838
lot about like exudates in there are

1100
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,160
producing a lot of like sugars uh

1101
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:40,318
polysaccharides and possibly like other

1102
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:42,920
amino acids and stuff so that the plant

1103
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:45,159
that it's in the same pot with can have

1104
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:48,760
an easier time uptaking those when it

1105
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:50,679
needs to fight off stress drought or if

1106
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,720
it's in the middle of you know making

1107
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:57,759
glandular Tricom heads so it can produce

1108
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:59,239
more essential oils easier uh and it's

1109
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,599
it's got everything it needs in there to

1110
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:02,279
make more

1111
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:05,400
complex

1112
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,760
profiles um and I can you know a lot of

1113
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,480
what I'm saying maybe anecdotal from me

1114
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,839
you can go read this you can go read the

1115
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,159
papers that tell you like what is the

1116
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:16,400
actual actions that go in there but

1117
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:19,639
every pepper of grown at home it doesn't

1118
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,200
even matter if it's if it's a a jalapeno

1119
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:26,838
a jalapeno will hit you like a Reaper

1120
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:29,639
like it's so much stronger the uh you

1121
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:33,480
know the the healing herb the electric

1122
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:37,879
lettuce is is happier and healthier

1123
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:41,519
praise the whole time it reeks it's very

1124
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:43,599
complex tpine profiles it's it's just so

1125
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:46,838
much easier to produce these really

1126
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:50,079
complex smells uh but even our companion

1127
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:52,639
plants so like the basil um man the

1128
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,720
basil like you open up that tent the

1129
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:57,118
smells that come through there

1130
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:59,279
unbelievable but that's all they're all

1131
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,240
doing that through those actions down in

1132
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,920
the risos spere so they're keeping that

1133
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:05,759
root Zone happy and healthy they're

1134
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,559
feeding of course the bacteria the

1135
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,079
protozoa everybody that's down in there

1136
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:11,200
they're feeding it through the root Zone

1137
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:13,599
through these exudates but they're also

1138
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,199
communicating with each other so when we

1139
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,760
start to you know we start to get heavy

1140
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:19,519
into flour or or into drought or

1141
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,119
whatever it may be a little extra heat

1142
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:24,000
stress they say hey I need a little more

1143
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:26,000
whatever amino acid I need a little more

1144
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,559
sugar I need a little more carbon do you

1145
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,318
have that can you feed the roots and

1146
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:33,040
they talk to each other and you get

1147
00:44:29,318 --> 00:44:35,679
these just Lush happy healthy tasty

1148
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:38,000
crops and it's uh you'll see the

1149
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,639
difference you plant you find the right

1150
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,719
pairings you'll you'll see the

1151
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:44,358
difference for sure talking about

1152
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:46,799
pairing can you provide some examples of

1153
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:49,759
kind of classic companion plant Pairs

1154
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,640
and explain why they work well together

1155
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,720
yeah uh well so like basil Tomatoes

1156
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:57,920
would probably be a pretty good one you

1157
00:44:54,719 --> 00:45:01,078
see a fair amount of uh basil repels

1158
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:04,440
like white flaws that would eat the

1159
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:07,359
tomatoes and aphids as well uh and the

1160
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,679
tomatoes provide shelter for the basil

1161
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:12,039
and the basil in turn produces more

1162
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:13,960
exudates to feed it more sugars and

1163
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:18,838
things that it

1164
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:20,159
needs um carrots and onions uh these

1165
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:23,078
actually carrots and onions are actually

1166
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:26,078
a pretty cool one because the carrots

1167
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:28,200
repel onion flies and onions repel

1168
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:32,640
carrot flies

1169
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:33,919
oh wow right um and then if you pair

1170
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:35,279
those of course then with other things

1171
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,400
that are going to be able to feed the

1172
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,040
soil um like you know back into like

1173
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,039
your lentils and your peas and beans and

1174
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:44,239
stuff you're keeping the the soil quite

1175
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,400
healthy because they're usually like

1176
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,118
peas onions and carrots are usually

1177
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,119
planted very far apart from everybody

1178
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:53,519
else right there's a lot of like waste

1179
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:54,838
space kind of in there um I think I

1180
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:57,519
don't know in terms of like you know

1181
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:59,759
maybe cabbage and Dill cage Dill is

1182
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,599
another like really good one where the

1183
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,760
dill uh bring in like lace wings and

1184
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:07,039
they'll and ladybugs and they'll eat

1185
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:10,760
some of the like cabbage eating worms

1186
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:12,558
and and pests right so there's the

1187
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,400
biggest thing is in terms of like

1188
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:16,920
pairings is what are you what do you

1189
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,119
want to grow what is the crop that you

1190
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,960
are going to eat look up the crop you be

1191
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,240
like these are the ones I like and I

1192
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,400
really have a hard time growing them

1193
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,078
they're always getting chewed up

1194
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,760
whatever it is happening so okay I want

1195
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:31,318
to grow carrots well then I'll pair them

1196
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,680
with onions this year I love tomatoes

1197
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:36,119
but I always struggle with them well

1198
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:37,879
then I'll feed my tomatoes uh basil and

1199
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:40,400
like peas and beans or something like

1200
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,480
that to be able to help feed the soil

1201
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,760
and especially those heavy feeders like

1202
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:48,039
tomatoes and corns and melons and bean

1203
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,480
like biggest thing is just look it up

1204
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:51,199
like what are the things that you you

1205
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,000
know you want to grow and you want to

1206
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:55,159
have a successful crop of there's a

1207
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,400
pairing for it there's also a pairing

1208
00:46:55,159 --> 00:47:00,199
that will probably

1209
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,079
not help it as well so you know biggest

1210
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:04,439
thing is just look it up like I want a

1211
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,880
big healthy crop of this this year what

1212
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,639
goes well with

1213
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,559
it I have a couple listed here that I

1214
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:13,000
fig I'd mention although I don't know

1215
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:15,760
why they're good pairs maybe you can

1216
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,760
answer that for me alysum with tomatoes

1217
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,480
lettuce with beans and cucumbers and

1218
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,079
basil have you heard about any of those

1219
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,920
pairs before I honestly haven't even

1220
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,318
heard about those pairings some so one

1221
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,880
thing I have noticed is a lot lot of the

1222
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:33,440
pairings of like why one doesn't work or

1223
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:37,640
why one does a lot of it's anecdotal

1224
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:41,960
it's like old farmer talk kind of thing

1225
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:44,920
um what is it is it Dill dill and

1226
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,039
tomatoes they say that like early Dill

1227
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:50,440
feeds the tomatoes but then when it

1228
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:53,440
grows up tall it stunts the tomatoes but

1229
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,720
nobody says why it stunts the tomatoes

1230
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,400
they don't say if it's stealing

1231
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:57,480
nutrients or what it is so there's a lot

1232
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,559
of like

1233
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,599
there's a lot of anecdotal evidence of

1234
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:03,480
like oh you just we just don't put those

1235
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,440
together cuz they just don't do well and

1236
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:08,679
I'm cool with

1237
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,280
that you know you got a lot of you got a

1238
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:12,799
lot of experience with it and it doesn't

1239
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,040
work together all right I'll take you

1240
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,280
face value for that but there's yeah a

1241
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:17,960
lot of it you might want to just that's

1242
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,440
why I say like do some research look it

1243
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,318
up kind of you know maybe maybe it's

1244
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:26,240
just because it's an old wives tale or

1245
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:29,880
whatever it is but yeah yeah yeah good

1246
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:31,799
advice look it up yeah honestly that's

1247
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,240
it's you know it's 2024 right like get

1248
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,440
on Google look it up see what grows well

1249
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:39,078
in your area uh what kind of crops do

1250
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,000
you want to grow what would pair well

1251
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:42,559
with them and if you want to go like you

1252
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,480
want to get crazy with it like how you

1253
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,640
restore your soil and how we feed the

1254
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,000
soil and what whatever else we're doing

1255
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,838
you can go to like like I say

1256
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,760
sciencedirect I think it's.org or.com

1257
00:48:50,838 --> 00:48:55,599
and you can look up all kinds of studies

1258
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:58,359
of like what is what is the you know

1259
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:02,000
Alfalfa is a cover vreek is a cover crop

1260
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:04,440
barley Nom exu dates like you can you

1261
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,519
can break it down into you know what are

1262
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,960
the absolute best pairings for what I'm

1263
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:10,358
doing right so I mean that's that's

1264
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,559
that's what I

1265
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:14,279
do although you probably do have to be

1266
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,040
careful because I imagine that there's a

1267
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,920
lot of misinformation out there would

1268
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:20,119
you happen to know any specific

1269
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,559
resources any like websites that you can

1270
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:23,160
think of that are in credible that you

1271
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:24,839
would recommend a beginners interest in

1272
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:30,358
learning more about the companion

1273
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:31,960
planting uh honestly no I like I sorry

1274
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:34,000
sorry to not be able to help you but the

1275
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,199
way it works for me is like how I do

1276
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,280
things is I'll take like a

1277
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:42,480
huge pile of information I'll read every

1278
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,319
webs I could possibly read I'll find

1279
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,480
every study I can find and then I'll

1280
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:48,679
just cross reference everything do you

1281
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,079
know what I mean like that's and I just

1282
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:53,279
I just kind of lose myself down like a

1283
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:57,559
you know down a rabbit hole and coming

1284
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:59,640
with the other side like exu like you

1285
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:02,559
so so yeah you know it's the biggest

1286
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:05,480
thing is just you know uh just read a

1287
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,640
lot watch a lot try to you know try to

1288
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,039
decipher in between what's hooy and

1289
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:11,279
what's not

1290
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,798
and and and just plant things and see if

1291
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,880
they work if they don't don't plant it

1292
00:50:13,798 --> 00:50:18,679
again there we go pretty straightforward

1293
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,039
I did want to ask you about your

1294
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:23,078
thoughts on the 12 seed cover crop

1295
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:25,039
there's other types of packs of cover

1296
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:27,280
crops which one of the most common is

1297
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:29,199
like a 12 seed blend

1298
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,760
yeah Builder soil sells it it's on

1299
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:33,919
Amazon that can certainly be used as

1300
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,480
companion planting do you recommend

1301
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:41,200
those or would you say go individual

1302
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:43,719
planting of plants instead uh I like a a

1303
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:47,239
grouping of it like so the cover crops

1304
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:50,558
are great they they only serve so much

1305
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:53,598
purpose right uh so like there there's a

1306
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,400
lot of like lowline cover crops in there

1307
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,880
that are great for choking at weeds and

1308
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,280
good for weed suppression and of course

1309
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,960
that water retention and things like we

1310
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,119
were talking about there's a lot of

1311
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,760
nitrogen fixtures and stuff in there but

1312
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:06,240
there's no like there's no like uh

1313
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,559
there's no Basils and there's no

1314
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,199
maragold and there's no trap crops like

1315
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,680
there's there's things that are missing

1316
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:15,358
from that that is the cover crops which

1317
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:17,159
it's funny you say 12 because it went

1318
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,199
like I think it was like five a couple

1319
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:20,798
years ago and then it was 7 and now it's

1320
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:23,480
12 and I don't know where it's going to

1321
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:26,440
go from there but I love seeing it get

1322
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:28,880
tailored more and more as time goes by

1323
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:32,480
uh um but they can only go so far

1324
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,720
they're fantastic for revitalizing that

1325
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:38,119
to Top Soil establishing your soil very

1326
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:39,959
quickly establishing a good risos spere

1327
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:42,559
and things but of course there's some

1328
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,318
there's some missing things so I I love

1329
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:48,920
cover crop go out there fill in as much

1330
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:50,318
space as you can but you know you still

1331
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,440
want to incorporate your things like

1332
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:54,798
your basil and your yaros and your

1333
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,679
marigolds and lemongrass and other

1334
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:58,480
things like that right you still still

1335
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:00,719
need to find a home for those especially

1336
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,240
in terms of like pollinators and things

1337
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:05,919
like that right so I I like them but

1338
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:07,719
yeah I don't know you can get the fives

1339
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,680
or the sevens or the twelves and still

1340
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:11,838
be still be very happy you bring up a

1341
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:13,679
really great point though that there are

1342
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:15,798
things missing right so I think some

1343
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:17,598
people grab those Blends the 12 seed

1344
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:18,599
blend for example and I think that well

1345
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,680
they're good to go they've got

1346
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:22,880
everything they need as far but no you

1347
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:25,399
can certainly add more things on other

1348
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,079
companion plants to the mix and uh have

1349
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,079
more benefits on it I think for indoor

1350
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:34,000
Growers those cover crops make a lot of

1351
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:35,519
sense um you know like you can you can

1352
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,639
do your basil like I do a little bit of

1353
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:40,679
everything right I've done like corn

1354
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:43,159
indoors I I constantly have like basil

1355
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:45,960
and sunflowers and com freeze and all

1356
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:47,798
cons and stuff but in terms of like if

1357
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,000
you're starting like living soil pots

1358
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:52,480
indoors and you want to establish that

1359
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,960
pot really quickly you want to have a

1360
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:57,079
more evenly dispersed watering you want

1361
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,039
to that nitrogen fixation especially if

1362
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:02,480
we're indoor growing and we're growing

1363
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:04,599
the electric lettuce it's usually you

1364
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,838
know loves its nitrogen loves those

1365
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:09,200
things those cover crops they're great

1366
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:11,199
for you they're fantastic for you if we

1367
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:13,159
start to go outdoors and now we're

1368
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:14,719
dealing with more pests and we need more

1369
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:16,960
pollinators and we don't want to be out

1370
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:18,078
there everyday hand pollinating things

1371
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,519
that's when we started incorporating

1372
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,839
some more of those companion plants so

1373
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:24,358
those those basil those marles those

1374
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:25,838
flowers whatever it may be but the uh

1375
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:27,880
those cover crops still serve a purpose

1376
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:31,000
out there too cuz like companion

1377
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,280
planting it doesn't just feed the soil

1378
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,519
and feed those plants we're also

1379
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,440
maximizing our spacing right because you

1380
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:38,440
can do you can do cover crop you can

1381
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:42,240
also do like intercropping where you

1382
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,519
grow certain crops together um which

1383
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:45,959
they compare you compare with companion

1384
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:49,318
planting but we're trying to just

1385
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:52,199
maximize that space right uh I

1386
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:53,719
personally I got away from monocropping

1387
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:56,039
I always found it so weird that I would

1388
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:58,959
like have all this expensive beautiful

1389
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:00,719
soil oil and these big pots downstairs

1390
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,079
and stuff but I was just growing like

1391
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:04,679
one crop and then when it was done it

1392
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:06,920
was just like maybe add a little cover

1393
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:08,759
crop and then back to this one more crop

1394
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,000
again I like to be able to like you know

1395
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,599
I harvest one and then there's another

1396
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,280
coming behind it where they're all

1397
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:17,039
feeding each other so at the same time

1398
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,680
I'm harvesting like things for my

1399
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:22,798
culinary adventures in the kitchen for

1400
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:24,759
Herbal medications for topicals you're

1401
00:54:22,798 --> 00:54:27,039
feeding the soil whatever it may be I

1402
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:29,520
want that to like I want to Max maximize

1403
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:32,440
every square inch of that soil that I

1404
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,440
have whether it's indoor or out got it

1405
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,599
sounds like a great way to go about it

1406
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,079
man I feel like we're just scratching

1407
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,200
the surface on this talk here I feel

1408
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,480
like we could go so much deeper in so

1409
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:44,078
many different Avenues within this but

1410
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,519
we're going to wrap things up here can

1411

you tell listeners how they can find you

1412

like pick the best things from this cuz

1425
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:20,439
this is such a a broad topic but I feel

1426
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,119
like it's something that hopefully

1427
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,798
people can now see is is a little more

1428
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:25,720
approachable and you can start to

1429
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:27,480
understand why you have cover crops why

1430
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:29,439
we want to comp compion plant and how we

1431
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,798
can get a little bit more out of our our

1432
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,280
indoor and outdoor Gardens so I really

1433

00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,960
my audience did as well you do a really

1437
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:43,639
great job of breaking things down in a

1438
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,440
manner that a lot of people can

1439
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:47,558
understand is what I'll say you know

1440
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,519
well I'm a simple man and I like to keep

1441
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:51,359
it

1442
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:52,639
simple I think you're I think you truly

1443
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:54,598
understand something when you can speak

1444
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:58,199
it in layman terms and I'm pretty good

1445
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:59,798
at breaking it down right

1446
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:01,519
awesome all right well we'll leave it at

1447
