00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,580
thousand LED grow light perfect works

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,230
sent me over this grow light and in this

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,150
video I'm gonna unbox unit I'm gonna

8
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,339
test the power output and I'm also gonna

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,019
do a heat test I'm not gonna go over all

10
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:20,939
the features that this girl light has in

11
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,559
this video but I will leave a link in

12
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,510
the description section below so you can

13
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,579
learn more about it okay here is the box

14
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,039
and the first thing out the box is a

15
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,348
user manual this user manual includes

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,329
installation instructions recommended

17
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,969
hanging Heights and information about

18
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,679
daisy chaining this next sheet is gonna

19
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,509
have some more information on the light

20
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,359
it also includes some information on

21
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:44,939
another model that they sell the RA 1000

22
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,640
and this sheet shows apart test readings

23
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:51,149
at different heights next thing that the

24
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,239
box is a power cord after that is a pair

25
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:57,600
of rope ratchet hangers here is a wire

26
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,000
hanging kit and lastly is the LED grow

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,730
light the power test I'm gonna use the

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,640
apogee mq 500 power meter this meter

29
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,259
measures from 389 nanometers to 692

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,019
nanometers and the measurements are in

31
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,850
ppfd I do these videos just to give you

32
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:13,228
a general idea of what the power output

33
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:15,269
is it's not going to be a hundred

34
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:16,859
percent accurate I take measurements and

35
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:19,590
grow tents which have reflective walls

36
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,118
that could increase the numbers so just

37
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,978
keep that in mind the flower and

38
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,868
coverage area for this grow light is 3

39
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:27,269
feet by 3 feet I'm taking measurements

40
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:29,159
in a 4 foot by 4 foot grow tent so I'm

41
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,649
gonna try to keep my par meter in a 3

42
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,118
foot by 3 foot space I'm gonna take

43
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,070
measurements at 3 different distances

44
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,560
these are the recommended hanging

45
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:40,529
Heights listed in their user manual 24

46
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,118
inches 18 inches and 12 inches I've

47
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,259
plugged the grow light into my kilowatt

48
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:48,569
meter and it shows 1.91 amps pulling 228

49
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,228
watts from the wall alright let's get

50
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:51,228
into the measurements

51
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,459

description section below and I'll leave

63
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,658
