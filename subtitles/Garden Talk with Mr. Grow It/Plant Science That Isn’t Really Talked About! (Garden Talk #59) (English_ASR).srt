1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
coming up on garden talk because after

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,480
the sun comes out and the plant starts

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,000
photosynthesizing the stomata close and

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,440
all that good stuff so you really want

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,519
to harness that

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,439
early on in the day like as early as

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,280
possible before sunrise as the sun is

8
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,759
coming up that's very important to get

9
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,079
the most out of it plants require

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,840
different things at different phases of

11
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:26,879
the plant's life the big thing is imo or

12
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,759
indigenous microorganisms the microbes

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,839
have such a large factor in soil and how

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,920
it all works together you realize that

15
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,238
that's really more important than

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,000
supplementing nutrients natural farming

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,078
inputs within this brew as well and

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,280
you're multiplying those microbes from

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,480
your imo into the water for 24 to 36

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,920
hours usually

21
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,919
nature knows what it's doing and then

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,879
we're trying to observe and mimic that

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,879
as much as possible

24
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,198

farming approach and he's also big into

35
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,758
plant science in this episode he talks

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,000
about plant science that isn't really

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,439
taught or even talked about much thanks

yeah glad to have you on um today we're

89
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,719
going to get into a ton of plant science

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,879
that isn't really taught or talked about

91
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,719
much we have a decent sized list of

92
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,079
things to get into and i think this

93
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,158
episode is going to bring a lot of value

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
to those of you who are big into plant

95
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:26,878
science

96
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,878
but before we get into some of the

97
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,039
topics we have a pretty decent sized

98
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,639
list today that we can go through

99
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,158
can you do an introduction maybe tell us

100
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,878
a little bit about yourself and how you

101
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,479
got into gardening yeah absolutely

102
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,878
so i am

103
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,518
blue or bluegrass green thumb on

104
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:48,079
instagram and a couple other platforms i

105
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,480
am an indoor gardener i am a farmer i've

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,040
grown several plants in many different

107
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,840
scales many different situations i've

108
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:58,318
managed large-scale nurseries

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,319
kind of been hands-on with plants for i

110
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,798
think we said six or seven years now

111
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,958
kind of on my own

112
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,480
farming and gardening and plants have

113
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,759
been in my life for as long as i can

114
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,318
remember

115
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,399
my grandfather was a farmer he's cattle

116
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,438
farmer he did dairy and beef he did

117
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,600
tobacco corn you know kind of everything

118
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,839
he has hands and everything and i got to

119
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,519
be a part of that um you know sitting on

120
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,159
the tobacco center and

121
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,840
helping plan bailing hay the whole nine

122
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,080
you know probably in the way more than

123
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,239
actually help but you know it's kind of

124
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,399
been been part of me for a long time so

125
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,199
it kind of resonates with with my soul i

126
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,359
guess but yeah that's uh that's really

127
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,840
my background right now it's uh i'm kind

128
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,000
of shifting into more of an educational

129
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:45,119
front he's teaching natural farming

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,319
techniques and teaching sustainability

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,759
just kind of

132
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,159
shifting mindsets from conventional

133
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,840
ways into more sustainable

134
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,840
ways and

135
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,159
i feel personally that it builds us as

136
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:01,038
human beings as well and we all know

137
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,600
that the the world might be able to use

138
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,478
some uh some of that good energy right

139
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,039
so that's where we're at right now

140
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,038
absolutely i know that just our short

141
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,959
conversation that we've had through

142
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,959
instagram that you're really big into

143
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,038
the sustainable side of things and the

144
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,359
natural farming um

145
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,199
and so that's what uh the suggestion for

146
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,439
the topics for today and i'm sure we'll

147
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,560
get into a lot of things that relate to

148
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,519
that

149
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,120
awesome

150
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,639
so let's do

151
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,959
let's see we have a long list of topics

152
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,439
like i mentioned where do we start let's

153
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,799
start with talk to us about nutrient

154
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:39,199
cycle theory yeah so

155
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,280
mostly what i do is it comes from uh

156
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,199
korean natural farming is the

157
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,000
methodology the system

158
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,240
uh one of the big philosophies within

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,478
creature farming or k f

160
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,319
is the nutritive cycle theory

161
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:57,199
and this theory basically suggests the

162
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,599
uh that your plants require different

163
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,199
things at different phases of the

164
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,960
plant's life all right so early in the

165
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,680
seedling through vegetative stage you

166
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,159
know they can require more nitrogen

167
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,000
the crossover a transition phase

168
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,680
requires something so like in the the

169
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
korean philosophy is like they compare

170
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,079
it to a woman during pregnancy you know

171
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,560
she craves something sour

172
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,879
and so phosphoric acid

173
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,918
and one of the k nf inputs that we make

174
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,639
is water soluble calcium phosphate so it

175
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,879
kind of it feeds that that sour craving

176
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,519
so to speak in that transition phase and

177
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,519
then you have your ripening phase

178
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,959
so basically it's it's

179
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,599
the theory is

180
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,680
the right nutrients and the right amount

181
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,960
at the right time so

182
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,720
within the sorry within the the k f

183
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,719
system we have all of these different

184
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,360
inputs that are used

185
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,599
at specific times at specific rates and

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,520
it all kind of plays into that nutritive

187
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,918
cycle theory

188
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,598
you mentioned phosphoric acid and i want

189
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,318
to kind of circle back to that really

190
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,240
quick because that's something that is i

191
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,240
mean you mentioned you're using it in

192
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,280
korean natural farming right

193
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,598
a lot of people use it as it's ph down

194
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,318
is commonly phosphoric acid and a lot of

195
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,319
people are worried that phosphoric acid

196
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,240
if they're using those ph down products

197
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,919
they're killing off microbes what's your

198
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,879
take on that

199
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,318
um it's there's a lot of factors in to

200
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,639
play there really

201
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,639
um

202
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,639
you don't like in a living soil type

203
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,919
situation there there's a lot going on

204
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,918
in there with microbiology and humus

205
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,399
humic acids fulvic acids a lot of these

206
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,560
things kind of create a buffer

207
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,359
within your soil and unless you're

208
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,478
applying it in like extreme amounts it's

209
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,720
not going to really affect much

210
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,560
now speaking in terms of like a sterile

211
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,319
grow medium that you're supplementing

212
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,639
only like salt-based nutrients and stuff

213
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,520
with i'm i honestly don't have enough

214
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,160
experience or research into that to

215
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,680
say for sure but i feel comfortable that

216
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,840
if i were to apply something like that

217
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,560
into my soil

218
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,198
the the biology there is going to take

219
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,959
care of it and not going to cause issues

220
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,800
okay that makes sense

221
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,239
now i know an area that you have a lot

222
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,079
of experience on and they really want to

223
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,478
talk about is imo

224
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,279
you talk to us about imo what that is

225
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,560
how you make it so on and so forth

226
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,598
absolutely

227
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,399
yeah so

228
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:29,680
with within korean natural farming the

229
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:33,598
the the big thing the the base of it all

230
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,918
is imo or indigenous microorganisms

231
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
and you'll notice within k and f

232
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,000
like k f there's a lot of abbreviations

233
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,240
so i'm going to try to you know

234
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,600
reiterate these as we go but

235
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,440
yeah imo's indigenous microorganisms um

236
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,720
when people first get into korean

237
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,880
natural farming the first thing they

238
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,080
want to go for is well how do i make my

239
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,200
nutrients

240
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,879
you know because it's just kind of the

241
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,680
standard mindset i need to i need to

242
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,480
figure out where i'm gonna get my

243
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,000
nitrogen or my potassium my calcium from

244
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,440
which you know to a certain extent is

245
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
important but

246
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,320
when you realize that uh the microbes

247
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,519
have such a a large factor

248
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,480
uh in

249
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,799
plants

250
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,759
in general in soil and how it all works

251
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,919
together um you realize that that's

252
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,799
really more important than uh

253
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,799
supplementing nutrients because

254
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,958
look at the the tallest trees in the

255
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,159
world look at the healthiest ecosystems

256
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,559
in the world

257
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,240
who's fertilizing them who's going in

258
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,559
and you know tilling those places who's

259
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,200
spraying them with pesticides

260
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,439
nobody because kind of nature takes care

261
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,759
of itself it adapts it overcomes it's

262
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,440
you know evolutionists the strong

263
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:43,360
survive and they adapt overcome and make

264
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,399
things happen basically so

265
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,240
the thought behind imo

266
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,480
is you want to

267
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,399
collect these microorganisms

268
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,240
from these thriving areas

269
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,080
so you've got a really healthy thriving

270
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,480
forest that hasn't been

271
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,278
you know adultered by man

272
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,278
and

273
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,120
you can find these patches of

274
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,159
leaves that have stacked over years and

275
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,919
years and years under that you can

276
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,319
usually pull that away and find

277
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,479
life in abundance you know visible

278
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,680
fungal strands and a little critters and

279
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,639
crawlies

280
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:17,199
so with imo we're collecting those guys

281
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,480
because those are the strong guys right

282
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,040
those are the guys that are going to do

283
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,600
our nutrient cycling that are going to

284
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,719
make our plants resistant to pests and

285
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,879
disease

286
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,680
and all that good stuff

287
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,679
so

288
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,039
we're collecting those

289
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,399
and we put them in a

290
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,639
a storage

291
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,600
state or as my my mentor chris trump

292
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,600
says

293
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,159
cryo-freeze you know kind of using a

294
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,200
sci-fi term there i've always liked that

295
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:45,120
um you're mixing this collection on

296
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,759
an undercooked rice

297
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,000
basically a simple food for the microbes

298
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,319
to kind of grow up into

299
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,480
and after so many days if you have a

300
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,879
good collection you mix that with brown

301
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,920
sugar and it's it makes it shelf stable

302
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,078
basically

303
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,199
indefinitely if it's stored properly and

304
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,439
then from there we're multiplying that

305
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
out into larger substrates into

306
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,720
different phases of the imo process

307
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,679
there's imo1 which is the collection

308
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,720
phase

309
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,719
imo 2 which is that cryo freeze stage

310
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,240
where you mix it with brown sugar

311
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,720
imo 3 were

312
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,639
growing those out onto a substrate

313
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,759
usually a carbohydrate and a carbon

314
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,120
source like

315
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:27,120
i use rice bran

316
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,560
oats crimp oats rolled oats for a

317
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,159
carbohydrate source and then usually

318
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,239
something like wood chips or leaves or

319
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,519
sticks from the backyard as the carbon

320
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,399
source tube

321
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,679
for that process that's imo 3.

322
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,720
im04 is when you take that and you

323
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:45,838
introduce that to your your native soil

324
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,839
you're kind of creating this

325
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,958
social gathering so to speak of the

326
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,000
microbes you've collected from these

327
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,919
different

328
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,759
thriving ecosystems and marrying them

329
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,278
with the microbes in your soil that

330
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,360
you're growing in

331
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,799
kind of getting everyone a check and

332
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,120
balance type situation everyone's

333
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:04,799
situated sorted out so when you

334
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,240
inoculate your soil with this im04

335
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,719
everything's smooth and balanced there's

336
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,560
no shock there's no you know everyone's

337
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,079
confused and the plant is kind of show

338
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,559
oh i'm stressed out you know there's

339
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,559
chaos going on in the ground

340
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,439
but yeah so if you're essentially

341
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,599
applying these big strong microbes that

342
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,399
have helped these forests and valleys

343
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,120
and

344
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,440
mountain life thrive for so long

345
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,879
and you're growing that out basically

346
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
and applying it to your plant so you're

347
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,799
creating a similar ecosystem in your

348
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,559
soil that your plants are growing in and

349
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,319
those microbes for the most part take

350
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,479
care of everything else and these other

351
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,440
inputs are kind of just supplementing

352
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,360
those microbes to do certain things so

353
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,360
when you make that

354
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,879
imo solution

355
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,800
how long is it good for do you need to

356
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,200
use it right away or can it sit on the

357
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,439
shelf for a period of time or what

358
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,000
so imo that's another cool thing that's

359
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,680
another really cool thing about it once

360
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,480
you get to imo 2 like if you just have

361
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,799
that collection mixed with brown sugar

362
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,079
you can store that indefinitely in the

363
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,799
right conditions you know you don't want

364
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,838
it to dry out you don't nothing like

365
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,159
that

366
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,639
but you can take the serum it turns into

367
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,919
a liquid that brown sugar kind of if

368
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,759
through osmotic pressure pulls all the

369
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,199
liquid out and stores it you can mix

370
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,360
that liquid with water and just water it

371
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,959
in that way that's the most basic way to

372
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,360
use it now

373
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,719
you can once you take its im03 it gets

374
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,800
you know

375
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,079
100 times better it's you know an

376
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,958
arbitrary number but it gets a lot

377
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,359
better

378
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:34,879
imo 3 also can be stored indefinitely

379
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,200
it's dry when it's done it's um just dry

380
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,838
product that's inoculated basically uh

381
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,680
same with im04 indefinitely you want to

382
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,839
store it in something that is breathable

383
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,958
you know like a burlap bag or something

384
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,199
like that you don't want to store it

385
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,198
outside in the rain and nature it needs

386
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:52,078
to there are certain conditions it needs

387
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:54,159
to stay in but um you can use it that

388
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,000
way the imo 3 and 4 you can top dress

389
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,919
with it you can mix it in your soil if

390
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,078
you wanted to you can also make what's

391
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:03,439
called liquid imo

392
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:06,479
with any of these o2 i'm a three or four

393
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,240
and it's basically like a compost tea

394
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,240
but you are using some of the other

395
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,240
natural farming inputs within this brew

396
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,720
as well and you're multiplying those

397
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,519
microbes from your imo into the water

398
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,000
for

399
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,320
24 to 36 hours usually and you can apply

400
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,639
that to your soil implants as well okay

401
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,720
yeah the liquid is what i was kind of

402
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,560
mainly referring to because i actually

403
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,040
had another guest talking about imo

404
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,399
pretty recently greens goddess i think

405
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,399
you might have actually watched that

406
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,360
episode but she had the liquid right

407
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,639
there

408
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,639
and that's one thing i didn't ask her is

409
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,879
how long is that good for um so it's

410
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,879
good to know now i am pretty new to imo

411
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,399
i haven't created it myself

412
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,919
i know there's lots of listeners that

413
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,919
are in the same boat as me there are a

414
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,799
lot of people that take notes during

415
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,679
this

416
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,078
and

417
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,679
a lot of people ask for sources

418
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,439
in addition to it

419
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,559
are there any books that you can

420
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,240
recommend or websites or anything that

421
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,838
any additional sources that you can

422
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,680
recommend that people can learn more

423
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,959
about imo

424
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,679
absolutely

425
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:08,958
so my mentor was chris trump

426
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,719
and chris trump was um one of the

427
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,359
i think he was the first person the

428
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,360
first farmer in america to utilize these

429
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,839
techniques on a large scale

430
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,720
and he actually had master cho who came

431
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,000
up with

432
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,759
korean natural farming back in the 60s

433
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,078
he actually came to hawaii where chris

434
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,399
trump was and kind of taught him the

435
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,638
process and everything but anyway i i've

436
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,519
learned under him i went to one of his

437
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,399
like in person classes he has a lot of

438
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,720
really really great videos on youtube um

439
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,799
explaining each part of the process

440
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,040
how to collect imo how to you know take

441
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,278
it to the next steps all the other

442
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:48,000
korean natural farming inputs he's a

443
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,519
really great teacher if you have

444
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,278
the opportunity to take one of his

445
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,879
in-person classes i highly recommend it

446
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,360
a lot of this is

447
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,799
hands-on and you're you can't really

448
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,440
truly learn it until you experience it

449
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,078
hands-on done correctly because of

450
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,519
olfactory senses right you see something

451
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,919
and you know if it's good or bad smell

452
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,078
it you know our memory with

453
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,838
smell is pretty incredible you smell a

454
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,439
good imo pile one time but you're like

455
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,600
okay you smell it again i know this is

456
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,959
good and also with bad it's good to

457
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,159
experience those things so hands-on is

458
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,198
great now

459
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,519
uh so

460
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,399
chris trump on youtube eric weiner or

461
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,839
drake

462
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,519
on youtube he uh cgnf hawaii there's a

463
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,360
lot of resources there to kind of dig

464
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,198
into

465
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,800
but yeah big thing is hands-on training

466
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,278
if you can get a certified instructor

467
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,599
somewhere highly recommend that

468
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,679
some really great

469
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,399
things to look into as well

470
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,599
not specific to k f or korean natural

471
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,078
farming

472
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,879
the teaming with series it's a series of

473
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:49,359
books teaming with microbes teaming with

474
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,958
fungi teaming with nutrients

475
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,680
jeff lowenfeld is the author and he does

476
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,439
a really incredible job of explaining a

477
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,838
lot of this kind of scientific stuff in

478
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,399
a way that most people can make sense of

479
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,920
and you know i find myself still

480
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,000
revisiting those books frequently

481
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,838
because it's like i learn constantly and

482
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,359
as i go back something else like oh well

483
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:09,599
that makes sense and you think about it

484
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,359
before you know

485
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,438
highly recommend those things big time

486
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,958
is if you're just getting into all this

487
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,640
that teaming with microbe is actually on

488
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,640
audiobook now for anyone who is an

489
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,199
audiobook person i was listening to it

490
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,839
on a recent plane ride that i had

491
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,519
and uh it's definitely an advanced more

492
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,759
advanced like if you're a beginner just

493
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,119
trying to get into it sure go ahead try

494
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:30,319
but i think a lot of things will go over

495
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,599
your head

496
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,879
but still

497
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,480
it's definitely a lot of great

498
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,120
information and you're right it gets

499
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,519
deep into the science on a lot of things

500
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,279
talking about inputs uh you said there's

501
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,079
a lot of misconceptions about the

502
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:46,480
different inputs that are used um i mean

503
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,399
there are so many different inputs that

504
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,839
people put into their soil right what

505
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,559
are these misconceptions that you're

506
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:55,519
talking about on these different inputs

507
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:59,200
yeah so specifically to the the k nf

508
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:01,519
realm uh you know when people first get

509
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,279
involved again they they typically go

510
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,480
for where are my nutrients coming from

511
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:08,960
so they like to go towards the like fpjs

512
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,038
and ffjs you know everyone wants to make

513
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,480
a banana ferment right off the bat like

514
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,960
oh there's there's my balloon booster

515
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,200
there's my potassium and that's not

516
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,038
exactly how it works

517
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,640
please don't go to the store and buy

518
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,400
plant material to ferment for your

519
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,679
plants it defeats the purpose and i'll

520
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,640
explain

521
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,919
but

522
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,120
yeah so like fpj the fpga and ffj are

523
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,720
more of

524
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,918
uh hormone

525
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,880
enzyme supplements um they are microbe

526
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,200
food

527
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,679
as well and they kind of work in a sense

528
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,200
that uh they can they can trigger the

529
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,640
mic the microbial

530
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,038
they can trigger the microbes in your

531
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,880
soil to

532
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,319
respond the way that they need to for

533
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,400
the phase that that plant is in again

534
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,798
going back to nutritive cycle theory so

535
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,440
if you're making an fpj out of the the

536
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,519
shoot tips of a fast-growing plant in

537
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,360
the vegetative phase you're kind of

538
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,400
quote unquote harnessing the energy from

539
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,240
that plant right so when you apply that

540
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,240
to your plant as a foliar and in your

541
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,519
soil those microbes can be like oh this

542
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,839
is what i need to do in conjunction to

543
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,960
or in relationship with this plant to do

544
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,678
what it needs to do i'm going to bring

545
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,240
this nitrogen to the plant or this or

546
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,080
this and those that consortium of

547
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,038
microbes is going to wake up basically

548
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,199
and do what their role is in that plants

549
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,240
phase because the microbes also change

550
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,160
throughout

551
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,279
the life of your plants too you're going

552
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,679
to have a different consortium of

553
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,798
microbes and veg as opposed to you know

554
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,679
light bloom

555
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,279
so these these fpgas and fjs they kind

556
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,679
of

557
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,519
feed and wake up those microbes so to

558
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,038
speak to do what they need to do for

559
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,160
that plants

560
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,119
phase

561
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,798
um so yeah fpga is not a nitrogen input

562
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,678
it's not a um

563
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:56,079
you know it's not that your your

564
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,200
nitrogen your vegetative type feed comes

565
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:01,359
from faa or fish amino acids

566
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,120
um so when you're when you're applying

567
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:06,000
these nutrients

568
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,199
you should also be applying them with uh

569
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,440
these other

570
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,600
inputs that's another big misconception

571
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,240
is well i'm just gonna you know spray my

572
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,759
plant with fpj well you know you don't

573
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,359
want to do that because

574
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:18,798
then you're applying just a bunch of

575
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,279
sugar to the leaves of your plants

576
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:25,359
basically and well you're really setting

577
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:27,599
up a buffet for pests at that point so

578
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,359
if you're applying

579
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,199
let's say faa and veg you want to do a

580
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,199
foliar spray

581
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,400
the nutrient input should also be

582
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:40,798
applied with what

583
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,798
is called maintenance solution by some

584
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,558
sos solution

585
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,640
so anyway that is a combination of fpga

586
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,119
fermented plant juice

587
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,840
brv or brown rice vinegar

588
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,759
any organic vinegar will work

589
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,519
just don't use white distilled vinegar

590
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:01,038
and ohn or oriental herbal nutrient

591
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,558
so all of these

592
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,440
inputs in this maintenance solution

593
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:07,119
actually work together in a sense

594
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,759
the vinegar

595
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,599
it acts as a cleanser it can help with

596
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,679
pests and diseases

597
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,240
but what's really cool about it is it

598
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,320
can actually act as a catalyst for

599
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,279
whatever you're spraying on your plants

600
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,798
the the vinegar itself can

601
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,798
like the amino acids and stuff and it

602
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,119
can attach to these nutrients and

603
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,480
compounds and make them smaller

604
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,079
basically make the water molecules

605
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,159
smaller so they can enter the plant

606
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,319
stomata easier

607
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,679
right and get more out of it basically

608
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,918
there's a lot of benefits to having all

609
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,038
this together ohn

610
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,640
has warming or invigorating properties

611
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:47,599
it's anti-pathogenic it's a prebiotic

612
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,080
basically and again the fpga in there is

613
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,599
kind of steering the microbes to do what

614
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,839
they need to do so if you're applying

615
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,639
faa for veg you want to wake up those

616
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,639
microbes for the vegetative phase right

617
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,679
so that's that's that's very important

618
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,679
you don't want to apply any of these

619
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,759
inputs by themselves

620
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,440
maintenance solution is pretty much

621
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,319
applied with every

622
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,600
nutrient input within the knf system

623
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,759
you mentioned how some of these inputs

624
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,359
can trigger hormones i want to get

625
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,960
deeper into hormones because that's

626
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,000
something that we haven't really talked

627
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,360
about much on this podcast in particular

628
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,119
can you talk to us about hormones you

629
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,558
know what you know why they're important

630
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,439
so and so forth

631
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,839
yeah that's a that's a deep one um

632
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,080
so you know all plants have

633
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,759
plant growth hormones or they're kind of

634
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,759
like natural pgrs so to speak but

635
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:34,640
they're naturally produced um it's part

636
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,558
of

637
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,360
what the plant does you have different

638
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:43,440
things like auxin uh gibberellins

639
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:45,599
cytokinin abscess acid uh ethylene

640
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,720
and each one of these hormones plays a

641
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,480
specific

642
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,600
role within the plant

643
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,279
um

644
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:56,158
so for example what oxen oxen is known

645
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:58,240
for the elongation or shoot growth

646
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,640
basically apical dominance of the plant

647
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,400
so auxin it kind of promotes apical

648
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,799
growth in the plant um

649
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,798
cell cell elongation

650
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,879
is a technical term so it kind of shoots

651
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,720
up and it can help with root growth as

652
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,080
well so one

653
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,400
um majorly known oxen is

654
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,000
endo acidic acid

655
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,038
that's the naturally produced within the

656
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,279
plant so if you go look at a lot of the

657
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,519
like rooting hormone supplements your

658
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,918
gels and dips and stuff like that you'll

659
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,519
see

660
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,080
indole-3-butyric acid

661
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,639
so basically all that is is a

662
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,558
synthesized version of this auxin that

663
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,600
is naturally occurring in the plant

664
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:39,599
right

665
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:42,158
it's been isolated and you're basically

666
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,719
applying this this oxen to your plant to

667
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,679
help promote rooting

668
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,319
so

669
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,000
like with fpga that's that's a lot of

670
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,798
what we're harnessing when we make those

671
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,798
those ferments

672
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,199
and

673
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,600
i'm going to tie all this together now

674
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,679
when you make fpga one of the

675
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,000
the characteristics or one of the things

676
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,519
you need to be mindful of is when you

677
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,720
collect the material to make it out of

678
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:11,200
it's that it's done before sunrise

679
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,720
right and a lot of people

680
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,880
kind of ignore that especially in the

681
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,558
beginning because they don't really see

682
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,600
why it's like i just need the nutrients

683
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:22,720
out you know plants leaves or whatever

684
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,519
so plants have circadian rhythms just

685
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,120
like

686
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,639
humans do

687
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,719
if you've ever noticed

688
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,960
your plants and

689
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,558
when the lights come on or the sun comes

690
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,159
out oh they're usually you know they

691
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,918
start to they pray up and they look

692
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,440
happy and then as you get closer to

693
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,038
those lights turning off or the sun

694
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,640
going down they might start drooping

695
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,319
down a little bit well that's that's

696
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,240
kind of the plant in a sense waking up

697
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,359
and going to sleep with that circadian

698
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,519
rhythm

699
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,158
now with these hormones you know things

700
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,759
like oxen

701
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,278
in the morning time as the sun's getting

702
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,319
ready to come up these plants are

703
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:55,759
expecting

704
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,720
these lights to come on or the sun that

705
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,720
come up

706
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,880
right because of the circadian rhythm so

707
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,400
they take that energy and they shoot it

708
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,159
to the plant's tips get ready to

709
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,360
photosynthesize for the day they're

710
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,600
going to take all this in and do their

711
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,519
job so the hormones are going to be in

712
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,558
the highest concentration

713
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:15,359
at the tips of these plants at that time

714
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,558
in the morning because after the sun

715
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,879
comes out and the plant starts

716
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,480
photosynthesizing the stomata close and

717
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,840
all that good stuff so you really want

718
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,000
to harness that

719
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,839
early on in the day like as early as

720
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,079
possible before sunrise as the sun is

721
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,158
coming up that's very important to get

722
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,960
the most out of it right because these

723
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,760
these hormones play such a huge role in

724
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,840
the

725
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,480
benefits of all this

726
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,319
the oxen again it'll

727
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,400
sell elongation it'll make the plant

728
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,000
basically grow faster and it has that

729
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,440
energy that you harvested from that

730
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,960
plant you're applying it to yours it's

731
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,320
going to make it grow you know you've

732
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,600
got your your gibberellins your

733
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,558
cytokinins they all play a different

734
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,918
role some cause branching some cause

735
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:57,678
cell division

736
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,038
so like actually producing um

737
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,200
plant

738
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,558
basically your leaves your stems and

739
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,000
flowers

740
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:05,038
so you're harnessing all that from

741
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,919
whatever

742
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,679
you're making your fpga or ffj out of so

743
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,278
you also want to

744
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,759
harvest your plant material based on the

745
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,319
phase that that plant is in

746
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,798
right you don't want to take a plant

747
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,720
that is blooming or fruiting

748
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,480
and make a ferment out of that and apply

749
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,640
in the vegetative phase because that

750
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,720
balance of hormones is going to be way

751
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,240
off right

752
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,000
with the way these they all kind of work

753
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,919
together you change the ratios a little

754
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,200
bit between these hormones and it'll

755
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,080
cause your plant to do all kinds of

756
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,240
crazy things i've just with tests and

757
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,960
trials i've tried some of these inputs

758
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,798
intentionally wrong just to see what

759
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,120
kind of results would happen out of my

760
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:47,119
own curiosity and it's extremely

761
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,199
powerful stuff man like i'm not gonna

762
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,759
lie these these inputs are very very

763
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,798
powerful so it is important to do it

764
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,319
correctly in order to get the results

765
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:57,679
that you desire

766
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,319
but yeah

767
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,798
you can get enhanced growth better root

768
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,960
development there are enzymes within the

769
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,119
fpga that play all sorts of roles and

770
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,600
breaking down nutrients and taking care

771
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,918
of pest issues and powdery mildew fungal

772
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,240
diseases all of that so

773
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,278
that's super interesting you mentioned

774
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,120
pgrs i think a common one that people

775
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,000
talk about a lot is

776
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,959
i have trouble pronouncing it but

777
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,278
plaquetrobuterazole tacloban i think i

778
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,558
did an okay job yeah

779
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:28,798
do you know anything about that i mean

780
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:31,278
that's that's one of the ones that uh

781
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,278
are highly frowned upon if people use it

782
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,278
because i believe it contributes to

783
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,640
cancer as a link to cancer or something

784
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,640
like that do you have any info on that

785
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,240
yeah it's definitely a carcinogen it's

786
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,759
made for

787
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,000
ornamental plants

788
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,599
not consumable plants

789
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,359
so right off the bat that should tell

790
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,639
you not to use it on something that

791
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,519
you're going to

792
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,080
ingest in any way shape or form but yeah

793
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,558
it's a synthetic plant growth regulator

794
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:59,839
and basically i believe what it does is

795
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:02,960
it inhibits gibberellic acid production

796
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:07,038
within the plant so that so gibberellic

797
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,278
acid is another cell elongation hormone

798
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,599
you know it kind of makes things shoot

799
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,798
out grow tall big your your stem

800
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,480
basically

801
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,798
it promotes that growth

802
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,640
so when you block those hormones

803
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,759
from being able to function the plant

804
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,360
stays squat short it doesn't grow as

805
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,038
much so it

806
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:28,000
sends more of that energy through other

807
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,759
hormones and sends those nutrients to

808
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,159
the other parts of the plants like

809
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,720
floral development and it can make them

810
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,320
more compact denser heavier weight but

811
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,640
it really messes up a lot of other

812
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,639
things too you know like

813
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,840
don't do it there's so many other

814
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,799
options

815
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:44,879
out there

816
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:48,319
like with even within k nf a lot of

817
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,159
these inputs can kind of promote similar

818
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:52,000
type results without putting your plant

819
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,559
through that without you know putting

820
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,679
toxins into your plant soil and body

821
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,798
yeah so

822
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,200
one of the things you mentioned is a

823
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:01,440
real compact dense buds i think that's

824
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,600
what it's it's mostly known for is

825
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,840
people will receive this bud and it'll

826
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:08,558
be super compact and like why can't i

827
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,558
grow my plants to be this dense of buds

828
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:13,519
right but it's just it's unnatural and

829
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:16,000
it's not healthy so um yeah i'm glad you

830
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,599
you expanded on that a little bit and

831
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,359
let us know exactly what's going on in

832
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,918
the plant and you know why it's bad and

833
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:24,959
so on and so forth

834
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,640
enzymes let's flip into that

835
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,759
what do you know about enzymes

836
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,840
uh

837
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,599
quite a bit well i won't say quite a bit

838
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:34,720
i've surfaced leveling a lot of it but

839
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:37,599
enough to kind of talk about it i guess

840
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,519
enzymes play a very important role in

841
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:44,398
all of this right so microbes produce

842
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,158
enzymes um you know like i said you've

843
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,959
got this big consortium of all these

844
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,039
different bacteria fungi yeast and they

845
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,759
all they all do a different thing they

846
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:57,278
may work in conjunction with each other

847
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:59,038
or whatever but they'll excrete uh these

848
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:02,159
enzymes and what these enzymes do

849
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,879
basically is break down a certain thing

850
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,840
and make it into a like plant available

851
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,640
form

852
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,558
basically so one of the big things right

853
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,520
now is

854
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,440
like soybeans so it being amino acids

855
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,720
right because it's it's it is an

856
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,720
incredible input all of that complete

857
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,960
amino acid profile it has all these

858
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,759
precursors to different plant functions

859
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,399
so

860
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:30,398
one of the ways that that is made

861
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:33,759
is by taking enzymes and converting the

862
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:36,959
high protein content within the soybeans

863
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:39,200
into available amino acids and some

864
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,840
enzymes that are responsible for

865
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,038
that process are things like papain

866
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:47,839
which is the milky latex substance that

867
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:49,839
comes out of a skin of a unripe papaya

868
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:51,119
like if you find a green papaya and just

869
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:52,639
like scrape your fingernail across the

870
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,678
skin you'll see this white oozy stuff

871
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,720
come out

872
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,840
spa pain and that is a protein digesting

873
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,319
enzyme

874
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,480
if you look into like uh gut health

875
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,918
supplements uh digestive enzymes are

876
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,519
probiotic a lot of times you'll see pat

877
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,200
pain in there

878
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,359
or bromelain

879
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,000
uh barmelane is found in pineapples

880
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,119
another protein digester so basically

881
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,200
what they'll do is they'll take these

882
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:18,000
soybeans and they'll add these

883
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,519
protein digesting enzymes to break down

884
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,599
the protein into

885
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,200
amino acids which are then

886
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:26,319
readily available for the plant to

887
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,558
uptake and so with like fermentation and

888
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,558
things going on within the soil

889
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,720
a lot of these similar types of enzymes

890
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,398
are being produced to break down

891
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,038
different things whether it's you know

892
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,398
proteins or carbohydrates and fats or

893
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:40,558
whatever it may be

894
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,319
the more diverse and abundant your

895
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:43,839
little biology is the more these enzymes

896
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,759
are being excreted a lot of them are

897
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,439
responsible for

898
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,119
like pests they can take care of pests

899
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,360
too so if you're spraying your whole

900
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,759
plant your grow area and everything with

901
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,000
liquid imo and these microbes are kind

902
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,919
of living everywhere on the surfaces of

903
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,919
everything you've got all that action

904
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,240
going on you've got photosynthetic

905
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,919
bacteria on the leaf surface that are

906
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,440
converting nitrogen from the air making

907
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,640
it available to your plant right on the

908
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,759
leaf surface

909
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,000
you know

910
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,158
all of these things so enzymes play a

911
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,359
very important role in making

912
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:18,399
things available to our plants basically

913
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,959
from um just organic matter

914
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,798
so that's that plays a huge role in

915
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,200
everything that's incredible so you're

916
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,558
saying that there's some bacteria that

917
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,720
can actually take nitrogen from the air

918
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:30,639
convert it and then the plant intakes it

919
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,278
through the stomata is that right

920
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,720
yes photosynthetic bacteria you can look

921
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:37,278
into that

922
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,319
nitrogen fixing bacteria so things like

923
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,319
legumes you know soybeans or clover

924
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,359
they actually

925
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:47,599
have these microbes that can convert

926
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:50,398
nitrogen that is available in the soil

927
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,959
or air into a form that is available for

928
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:55,759
plants to uptake and that comes from the

929
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,679
bacteria okay yeah i use clover right

930
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,839
now as a cover crop and i've heard it's

931
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,000
good for nitrogen fixation

932
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:04,158
but for my understanding the plant would

933
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,519
create it and release it into the medium

934
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,960
is that incorrect

935
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,960
no you're absolutely right um

936
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:12,798
it's a symbiotic relationship right all

937
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:14,319
of this kind of works in symbiosis like

938
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,319
you can't have one without the others

939
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:17,918
like baking a cake and taking out one

940
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,960
ingredient what do you end up with

941
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,559
usually not cake so um yeah it kind of

942
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,798
works in that sense the the plant can

943
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,639
photosynthesize and take nitrogen from

944
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,240
the air and it shoots exudates down and

945
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,159
uh has a relationship with these

946
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,079
microbes and the exchange that goes on

947
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,760
and takes place and then the mycorrhizal

948
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,038
fungi are like oh there's free nitrogen

949
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:36,240
over here my plant says it needs

950
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:37,919
nitrogen so i'm going to pull it from

951
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,399
over here back up to the for the plant

952
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,880
in exchange for that plants exudates and

953
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,639
or food for me or whatever i may need do

954
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,720
you feel in your opinion clover is

955
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,240
beneficial in both large operations as

956
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,240
well as small operations like i've used

957
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,000
clover in small grill pots before and

958
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,599
somebody said that's pointless it's not

959
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,240
really doing anything for your plant it

960
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,398
needs to be in a large pot or you need

961
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,919
to be outdoors and use clover and have

962
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:01,199
that by your plants what's your take on

963
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,559
that

964
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,960
um

965
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,879
different situations are different but

966
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,878
there there are benefits that you could

967
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,280
still gain even if you're not getting

968
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,838
the nitrogen fixation like uh we're

969
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,839
talking about such as having that

970
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,320
uh mulch you've got a living mulch

971
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,719
basically right so

972
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,559
another very important thing with

973
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,118
within all this is

974
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,239
microbial development and fungi in

975
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,320
particular

976
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,000
and when you have a a cover crop that

977
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,519
you know is an inch to three inches

978
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,280
growing above your

979
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,159
surface of your soil you've got this

980
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,639
micro environment basically

981
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,480
in that area and if you've got a top

982
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,760
dress like amendments or a mulch or

983
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,199
something there

984
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,280
you've got this perfect environment for

985
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,358
these fungi and bacteria to come into

986
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,119
and do what they need to do to break

987
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,440
down this organic matter quicker for you

988
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,919
and to thrive and populate right whereas

989
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,280
if you just have bare soil on top of the

990
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,638
light sitting here baking down on it

991
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,480
those guys don't want to be there that

992
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,400
you know like you you want that that

993
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,400
moisture to stay consistent you want

994
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,880
that environment to stay consistent

995
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,079
um a general rule of thumb is

996
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,440
uh 70 shade 30 light

997
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,599
that's kind of like the the perfect

998
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,200
little environment or climate for them

999
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,119
so you're getting benefits like that for

1000
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,559
sure and as it grows and you're chopping

1001
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,240
it down you're reintroducing organic

1002
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,559
matting into your soil which is

1003
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,639
nutrients which is micro food which is

1004
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,920
eventually going to turn into humus and

1005
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,799
organic acids that can act as chelators

1006
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,599
or

1007
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,599
make nutrients available to your plants

1008
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,920
add carbon all that good stuff so yeah

1009
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,760
it's definitely beneficial

1010
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,119
i will say that

1011
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,000
you really want to make sure that you

1012
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,920
have your

1013
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,559
biology on point if you're going to

1014
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,159
utilize something like that

1015
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,480
i have seen situations i've had

1016
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,639
situations where things like clover and

1017
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,039
cover crops can actually be an

1018
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:53,279
attractant for pests

1019
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,800
you know it can actually bring things

1020
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,519
into the garden because even if your

1021
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,960
plant that you're growing is healthy and

1022
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:00,239
thriving if these clover down here

1023
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,599
aren't exactly

1024
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,838
um

1025
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,160
thriving then you've got a buffet

1026
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:08,000
because pests go after weaker plants

1027
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,679
they're easier to penetrate they're

1028
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,760
easier to get nutrients out of

1029
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:14,078
so just something to be mindful of you

1030
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,320
know keep an eye on it at the very least

1031
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,839
for damage um

1032
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,359
like look at it as much as you look at

1033
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,519
whatever

1034
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,519
main plant that you're growing really be

1035
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,358
observant in all of this observation is

1036
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,920
key i think another concern for people

1037
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:30,239
is that cover crops uh it's often said

1038
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,119
that they're robbing nutrients

1039
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,479
from

1040
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,358
your main plant that you're trying to

1041
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,159
grow

1042
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:38,559
is that a concern at all for cover crops

1043
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:41,039
to rob nutrients or you know use up

1044
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:43,119
nutrients that your main plant is

1045
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,000
going to need at some point

1046
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,760
not really a major concern

1047
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,039
indoors it might be a little bit

1048
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,720
different but

1049
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,159
it shouldn't be to an extent that you're

1050
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:55,439
noticing

1051
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,279
observable effect or impact from it

1052
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,280
especially if you're you know mending

1053
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,519
your soil properly or

1054
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,519
supplying your plant with these

1055
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,159
different inputs that

1056
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,679
are nutritive inputs i don't see it

1057
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,039
being that big of an issue now i don't

1058
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:10,960
have you know experience like

1059
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,039
side-by-side testing it or anything like

1060
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,480
that or can't link you to any studies by

1061
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,679
any means but

1062
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,679
just uh

1063
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:20,078
using the logic that i have i don't

1064
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:22,399
think that that is as big of an issue as

1065
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,440
people make it out to be okay good to

1066
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,720
know

1067
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,200
next up we want to talk about

1068
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,559
hermaphrodites i know you uh that's one

1069
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:30,319
thing on your list that you want to talk

1070
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,920
about talk to us about it what do you

1071
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,039
know what uh what do you want to explain

1072
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,920
to everybody

1073
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,759
yeah and a lot of this is it's it's more

1074
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,000
known knowledge but it still probably

1075
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,240
needs to be brought to the attention of

1076
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
more people so everything that i do

1077
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,759
really revolves around how

1078
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,239
things happen in nature

1079
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,240
um big nature observer because

1080
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,319
uh nature knows what it's doing and then

1081
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,838
we're trying to observe and mimic that

1082
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,240
as much as possible

1083
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:58,559
so i uh i went down

1084
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:02,799
you know a rabbit hole years ago

1085
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:04,960
like why do hermaphrodites happen

1086
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,400
and what it comes down to

1087
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,720
is uh survival just like every other

1088
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,680
plant response basically is some sort of

1089
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:15,199
means of a survival response or stress

1090
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,719
response

1091
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,118
so if a

1092
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:20,639
a plant is growing in the wild

1093
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,039
it's it's

1094
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:25,440
major intention is to reproduce

1095
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,320
just like all other species i need to

1096
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,320
grow up be healthy reproduce so that you

1097
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,880
know my my genes can carry on basically

1098
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,680
and in a situation that

1099
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,640
a plant isn't in ideal situations and it

1100
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:40,239
it has

1101
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,920
factors that

1102
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:46,078
stress it or make it think that its life

1103
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,159
is coming to an end or you know it might

1104
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,119
not make it out on the other side or

1105
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,799
it's not been pollinated

1106
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,680
it can send

1107
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,440
um

1108
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,639
it can

1109
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,200
produce

1110
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:02,159
these different ratios of hormones

1111
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:04,399
within itself basically as a stress

1112
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,838
response like a last minute resort

1113
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,920
basically to

1114
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,838
reproduce and carry on

1115
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,639
the next generation

1116
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:13,358
so

1117
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,598
that for one is something that just just

1118
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:18,480
think about right like

1119
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:21,680
hermaphrodites don't necessarily mean

1120
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,119
that the plant itself is inferior right

1121
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:24,799
so that's that's kind of the mindset

1122
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,119
that we have is like oh those are weak

1123
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,599
genetics you know like well you know

1124
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,280
maybe maybe not we could be looking at

1125
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,519
it all wrong like oh this plant has the

1126
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,440
ability to do what it is intended to do

1127
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,440
in nature really well

1128
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,119
you know it's all about perspective in

1129
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,559
that sense i guess you know we do grow

1130
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,079
for

1131
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,320
production and stuff like that and that

1132
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,280
can hurt our our final product i just

1133
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,960
think that that mentality in general and

1134
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,040
that looking at it that way kind of um

1135
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,920
i don't know it it it changed some

1136
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:58,559
things for me right like um like just

1137
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,400
looking at something as being inferior i

1138
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,920
see a lot of people you know they get

1139
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,079
bashed over you know hello i found a

1140
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,760
hermaphrodite and this pack of seeds i

1141
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,519
know it's the only one out of a thousand

1142
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,440
plants but that breeder ain't doing his

1143
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:13,280
job you know like

1144
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,960
come on man this is nature we're dealing

1145
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,720
with you know

1146
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,159
your plan is trying to survive and

1147
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,598
you've got it in the situation it

1148
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,118
doesn't like

1149
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,480
so

1150
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,400
taking that

1151
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,599
knowledge and thinking about the

1152
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,960
particular

1153
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:32,160
genetics that we're growing

1154
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,599
if you've got a land raised variety of a

1155
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:37,118
plant from

1156
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,838
somewhere let's say close to the equator

1157
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,160
and you put it in a situation

1158
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:45,719
where its environment its

1159
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:47,440
light schedule temperatures humidity the

1160
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:49,598
microbiology

1161
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,838
is so drastically different from where

1162
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,480
it originates from what do you think the

1163
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:55,440
plant's response is going to be

1164
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,318
stress

1165
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,039
right

1166
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,880
so things to factor you know what kind

1167
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,440
of climate is my

1168
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,519
indoor area what kind of you know

1169
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,599
genetics do i need to be aiming for does

1170
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:09,759
in nature did this this particular

1171
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,680
combination of varieties would

1172
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,520
would it prefer you know shorter days or

1173
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:16,078
hotter temperature or more or less

1174
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,759
humidity drier soil what kind of little

1175
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,039
consistency you know what i mean there

1176
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,640
are certain things you can do to get

1177
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,000
close

1178
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,400
but

1179
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,480
again observation think through how does

1180
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,400
this happen in nature and you can learn

1181
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,199
a lot from that that applies to more

1182
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,760
things than you realize such as this i

1183
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:35,919
just finished a cultivation certificate

1184
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,960
at utah state university by dr bruce

1185
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,039
bugbee royal hines mitch westmoreland a

1186
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,880
lot of guys that are deep into the

1187
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,960
science of things and one section they

1188
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,039
had was on hermaphrodites and what

1189
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,960
they're saying is there's no

1190
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:50,800
how do i word this

1191
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,318
it's kind of like inconclusive at the

1192
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,680
point they feel it has to do with

1193
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:55,358
exactly what you said genetic there's a

1194
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:57,358
genetic factor into it and there's a

1195
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:59,199
stress factor into it those are the two

1196
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:01,039
main things but they're still continuing

1197
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:03,279
to study that now you mentioned their

1198
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,440
instagram that some k f supplements

1199
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,440
could potentially prevent it can you

1200
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,200
expand on that yeah so this is

1201
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,679
definitely not hard data and i don't

1202
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:14,078
want anyone to take this as such this is

1203
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,719
some trials that i

1204
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,640
plan to run in the future and i want a

1205
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,399
few more people to get involved so we

1206
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:23,838
can have some more data

1207
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,920
but going back to using these inputs as

1208
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:28,719
hormone supplements

1209
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,639
right so if you've got

1210
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:33,118
a plant in the transition phase and the

1211
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:34,799
reproductive um

1212
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,358
ripening phase

1213
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,160
you're you're using these fermented

1214
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:42,960
plant inputs for that phase

1215
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:47,118
and i i i have a theory that if you had

1216
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,119
a particular plant that was prone to

1217
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,838
throwing pollen sacs or bananas or

1218
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,599
whatever you want to call it if you can

1219
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:56,318
supplement that plant with the right

1220
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,960
ratios of hormones that the plant needs

1221
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:01,199
in that face to do what it needs to do

1222
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,838
that it might prevent it from

1223
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:06,000
shifting its own hormones into oh i need

1224
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,000
to you know change my stuff up to

1225
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,838
pollinate myself to

1226
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
to carry on my generation

1227
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,920
kind of acting as like a precursor so to

1228
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,119
speak to doing what the plant you want

1229
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,280
the plant to do crop steering in a sense

1230
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,960
now i know these are bold statements and

1231
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,880
bold words i'm probably going to get

1232
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,400
blown up for this one but it is

1233
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,200
something that interests me and i think

1234
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,720
there might be something to it so i want

1235
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:30,559
to play with that and see what we can

1236
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:34,000
come up with there because that might be

1237
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:35,279
a natural uh alternative or solution to

1238
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,039
some of these headaches that we're

1239
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,200
dealing with and it might make it more

1240
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,759
enticing for people to really dig into

1241
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,519
the realm of natural farming too so if

1242
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,240
we can get that win then that's a win

1243
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:46,559
for

1244
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,159
everybody that is really interesting and

1245
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,000
i'm definitely glad that you're digging

1246
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,078
down there something that clearly

1247
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,079
interests you and you you're taking

1248
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,680
action to try to experiment and figure

1249
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,720
things out there so that that's cool to

1250
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:57,879
hear

1251
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:00,639
um

1252
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,240
epigenetics this is kind of a hot topic

1253
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,639
i mean there's some people that

1254
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:07,118
don't believe in epigenetic drift for

1255
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:09,279
example can you talk to us what uh what

1256
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,240
you know about epigenetics

1257
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,560
yeah and

1258
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:14,479
not super scientific

1259
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:18,480
uh about it but there are certain

1260
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,960
factors that i've noticed firsthand

1261
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,440
in particular with seeds

1262
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,838
i've noticed that well and you know

1263
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,039
cuttings clones as well

1264
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:31,039
if you've got a variety that has been

1265
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:33,199
especially for multiple generations

1266
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:38,239
developed in a like a living soil

1267
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:40,559
situation with a robust microbiology

1268
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:41,919
it's all proper nutrients and all that

1269
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,400
stuff in the right conditions it's

1270
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,480
healthiest thriving um

1271
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,720
the the thought is that the next

1272
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,480
generation the seed is going to carry a

1273
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:53,439
lot of that information

1274
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,000
uh so that it can it's ready to respond

1275
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:59,280
to a similar situation right it's kind

1276
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,920
of thinking back to taking a land race

1277
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,160
equatorial strain and growing in canada

1278
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,599
you know that that seed it knows like

1279
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,759
what to expect

1280
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,200
you know that that's within its dna well

1281
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,480
i i think that

1282
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:11,358
a lot of this

1283
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,519
uh

1284
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:15,598
tech kind of plays into that too

1285
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:17,759
if you've got a variety or a clone that

1286
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,760
is used to growing and being produced in

1287
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,599
a sterile situation

1288
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,720
and then you throw it into

1289
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,280
a bed that's had im04 inoculated into it

1290
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:29,279
for the last 10 years it might freak out

1291
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,760
it might not do good at all and vice

1292
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,359
versa you know

1293
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,040
all of all of my strains that i've

1294
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:37,119
developed have been developed in living

1295
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:39,440
soil and you know if you throw those

1296
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,519
into a sterile salt based type

1297
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,480
situation i can't guarantee they're

1298
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,159
gonna do real great you know um but i

1299
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,318
have seen that i've gotten seeds from

1300
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:50,318
many different breeders and i do

1301
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:51,759
everything pretty much the same way i've

1302
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,400
experimented with salts and different

1303
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,000
things just out of curiosity

1304
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,160
but i have noticed

1305
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,519
that the breeders i get from that

1306
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:03,679
practice similar uh methods as myself

1307
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:06,318
tend to do a lot better right from the

1308
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,559
get-go you notice it even from the seeds

1309
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:10,239
sprouting out of the soil

1310
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,519
it's uh it's pretty wild they just tend

1311
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:15,598
to be more vigorous and robust and happy

1312
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,679
healthy they don't have as much damping

1313
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,280
off or stress issues and they just

1314
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:20,480
generally thrive

1315
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,079
and

1316
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,000
there was there was actually i did a

1317
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,920
phenomenon 50 seeds and there were like

1318
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,400
five seeds from and all from different

1319
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,440
breeders and there was one that was a

1320
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,838
strictly salt-based grower breeder and

1321
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,280
that was the only strain that none of

1322
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,799
them made it

1323
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,240
you know and that could have there could

1324
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,000
have been several factors involved there

1325
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,519
for sure but i just thought that was

1326
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,039
interesting too

1327
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,039
and that that's really like what

1328
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,279
interests me and what i uh think about

1329
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:49,358
as far as epigenetics is concerned

1330
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,119
i won't get into genetic drift and all
