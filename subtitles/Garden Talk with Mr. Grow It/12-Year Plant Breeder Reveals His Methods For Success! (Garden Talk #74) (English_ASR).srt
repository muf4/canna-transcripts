1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,719
coming up on garden talk back crossing

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,039
really stabilizes the jeanette that's

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,800
how you're able to without femming be

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,240
able to go back to the original

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,120
characteristics

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,320
if you crop out at six week six then

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,160
more than likely you're gonna have a

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,679
higher percentage of undeveloped if you

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,439
allow to go to week eight you're going

10
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,278
to have a better chance of having the

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,320
beans not be developed man people are

12
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:23,600
out here trying to make money left and

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,960

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,720
best product they're just trying to

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,199
produce product so either you're going

16
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,559
to be growing flour for yourself or

17
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,079
you're going to be a breeder and if

18
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,640

be a breeder 100

20
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,239

21
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,078
to be getting rid of more than you are

22
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,558
you're going to be keeping final hunt

23
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,480

also a breeder as well and that's what i

101
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,839
really want to dive deep into today is

102
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,919
really all about plant breeding i've

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,759
actually had a handful of breeders on

104
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,000
this podcast in the past

105
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,079
and one thing i've noticed is that there

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
are so many different ways to go about

107
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,360
it there's so many different things you

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,840
can do within breeding whether it be

109
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,080
inbreeding back crossing self-crossing

110
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,878
you can create feminized seeds so on and

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,719
so forth but not only that but

112
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,719
the characteristics that people are

113
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,359
looking for within plants

114
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,959
males and females vary you know it

115
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,319
really comes down to the breeders so

116
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,640
really eager to jump into this

117
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,399
conversation and find out kind of what

118
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,798
you look for in your plants and how you

119
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,959
do your breeding but first what we do in

120
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,720
every single one of these episodes is an

121
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,000
introduction so can you tell us a little

122
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,759
bit about yourself and kind of how you

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,160
got into gardening yeah man so uh man it

124
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,439
was 1996

125
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,000
and uh

126
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,478
my family and i moved to indiana

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,279
i was 16 years old

128
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,240
and my mother had had a boyfriend at the

129
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,119
time

130
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,519
and and they you know they they did

131
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,720
their extracurricular activities every

132
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,478
single day

133
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,440
and uh while i was watching them i was

134
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,359
like

135
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,519
hey man these dudes these dudes they

136
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,960
they puff a lot you know and i and i i

137
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,198
was like in my head you know coming from

138
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,198
humble beginnings you know my mind has

139
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,639
always been on how can i add one plus

140
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,840
one to equal to

141
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,639
and so the gentleman did blaze a lot so

142
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,799
i you know i i was like hey

143
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,960
maybe i can grow some of these seeds

144
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,600
that he's leaving down in the basement

145
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,399
and maybe i can provide them

146
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,680
you know

147
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,239
because when you come from humble

148
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,240
beginnings my process is is how can i

149
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,639
get by how can i survive how will i make

150
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,759
it you know what i'm saying and so you

151
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,360
know that was my that was the

152
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,360
introduction now that summer i'll never

153
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,720
forget that summer because i was able to

154
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,759
take the seed

155
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,479
um

156
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,600
go outside we live right behind a a corn

157
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,279
field and large corn field and you know

158
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
i had this great idea of taking these

159
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,758
beans and going down the cornfield and

160
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,840
planting them didn't know anything about

161
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,879
anything matter of fact the the bowl i

162
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,959
used

163
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,680
was a bleach bowl

164
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,799
no cap man i used i cut a bleach bowl in

165
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,720
half rinsed it out bro put some soil in

166
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,720
there threw my things in there it

167
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,919
sprouted and it was like the most

168
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,680
amazing thing

169
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,918
then after they got so big i just took

170
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,918
it out and put it in the cornfield

171
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:00,799
now the interesting thing was

172
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:02,240
that

173
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
each day you know i would go out there

174
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,439
and water and i would go out there and

175
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,679
kind of

176
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,519
entertain my thought of raising these

177
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,038
things to make these millions of dollars

178
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,879
off this one thing right and uh

179
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,159
as i continue to water i started to

180
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,199
realize

181
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,960
something

182
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,600
really cool this you know one of the

183
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,000
things is you know when you take care of

184
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,560
something other than yourself

185
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,600
you you build some type of relationship

186
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,079
no matter what it is or what it could be

187
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,600
and uh at that point in time

188
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:37,680
you know watering watering my plants and

189
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,199
being there every single day

190
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,038
talking to my plants i thought i was

191
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,160
going crazy but being able to talk to my

192
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,038
plants be it be a part of my plant

193
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,439
uh

194
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,639
started to grow on me and things started

195
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:53,360
to evolving within myself i started to

196
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,879
learn a lot about myself that summer

197
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,439
it was really interesting because then i

198
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,120
got bit by that bug that summer and it

199
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,120
was something really unique and what was

200
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,038
really unique was you know it started to

201
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,399
take different forms it started small i

202
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,000
started to develop and at this point in

203
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,839
time you know i didn't have a father

204
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,160
figure around there weren't too many

205
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,799
role models around i'm new in a place

206
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,240
and so this plant was really

207
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,199
the only thing that was in front of me

208
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,280
that would watch my tears that would uh

209
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,319
you know what like i said i would talk

210
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,679
to so

211
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,520
it was really a touching moment

212
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,759
throughout that summer and i remember

213
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,598
the time i had to chop it down because

214
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,439
it didn't look too pretty but the time

215
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,240
that came that i it was time to chop

216
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,680
down and uh you know it really touched

217
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,519
me in some type of way but what i

218
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,918
understood is that hey man everything

219
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,399
has a beginning middle and an end

220
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,159
and you know and as long as we continue

221
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,120
to provide ourselves with some of the

222
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,759
best whether it be nutrients or or the

223
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,478
best positive vibes period we can see

224
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,240
ourselves flourish like this plant

225
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:55,439
ever since that day

226
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,079
every single day of my life i've had a

227
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,319
plant around no matter what it was but

228
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,959
you know the the herb plant has always

229
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,280
been a special thing to me and it's kind

230
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,000
of always been a place for me to go hang

231
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,918
out and really spend my time and reflect

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,279
on life and and like i said there's

233
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:12,959
nothing better than taking care of

234
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,559
something else

235
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,560
uh so

236
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,038
you know you you get there's a benefit

237
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,120
that comes along you know with that and

238
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,478
and i remember when we my mom ended up

239
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,280

240
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,360

time i found out what the hps light was

257
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,399
in 1997 and so he brings this huge bulb

263
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,319

264
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,559

lights up the whole my mom's like what

266
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:17,679
the heck is going on back there so you

267
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,399
know i have so many stories of of when

268
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,719
it all started in the journey and how

269
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,159
you know i got involved but you know

270
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,920
realistically

271
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,639
planning that first seat in that field

272
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,120
really really did something special and

273
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,720
uh you know the journey has been

274
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,560
really cool thus far and it's really

275
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,560
helped me out you know as a human being

276
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,439
along along the way man that's deep so

277
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,040
while 1997

278
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,959
9967

279
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:47,360
here all day long and talk for hours on

280
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:50,958
stories that i have from the journey but

281
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,560
uh you know that that's 1996 man

282
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:56,319
1996.

283
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,159
say 1997 is when i started consuming so

284
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,640
that's way back when you started growing

285
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,679
so over 20 years you have experience

286
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,000
there

287
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,199
where did breeding come into play like

288
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,039
you know how long have you been breeding

289
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,800
and what made you get into that

290
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,159
well okay so

291
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:15,278
it was about two it was like around 2001

292
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:17,759
uh you know well at this time 1998 mark

293
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,759
emery from your from your spot

294
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,360
so mark emery was making a lot of noise

295
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,360
in the nights right he was doing a lot

296
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,200
of movement and you know being in the

297
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,440
u.s it was difficult to get any type of

298
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,640
beans from anywhere especially in the us

299
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,480
people were really

300
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,879
and if you had something going on you

301
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,879
didn't talk about it right so

302
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,639
i would order from overseas whether it

303
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,639
be canada or whether it be you know the

304
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,958
uk europe whatever

305
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,838
the biggest problem was that i remember

306
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,039
placing the order like in january and

307
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,519
bro

308
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,360
it was like nine months later when they

309
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,519
showed up i think i had like a couple

310
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,759
kids by then you know but it was like it

311
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,360
was like man

312
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,639
it was like it was like man i didn't

313
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,560
know why it took so long to get to me

314
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,439
now when they got to me the dj short

315
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,000
that i did run was fire this was like f

316
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,440
f2 or something like that f2 or three

317
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
now they're up to five

318
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,600
so

319
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
you know

320
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,320
it was good but there was always

321
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,079
something that wasn't hitting mark emery

322
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,640
had some pretty good stuff before he

323
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,719
ended up you know going under uh with

324
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,159
the law and everything like that so when

325
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,200
they would come over and i would i would

326
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:25,838
continue to grow these flowers

327
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,480
it wasn't what i wanted then i had a

328
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,880
friend from california 2001. he came

329
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,360
over came to pay me a visit and and you

330
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,439
know we started hanging out and and i

331
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,680
said man how come i'm wondering why

332
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,079
doesn't mine taste like that

333
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,799
you know why is it why doesn't it appeal

334
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,239
to me the same way uh so me i always

335
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,439
thought it was my grow hand i always

336
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,039
thought it was something i was doing

337
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,200
wrong in the garden

338
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,278
something i wasn't wasn't working and my

339
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,040
friend was like it's genetics bro

340
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,078
and so this i was really introduced to

341
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,759
genetics in 2001 so so he said yeah man

342
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:02,000
you got to have good genetics to get

343
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:03,838
goods you know get a good product so

344
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,759
i asked him to bring me some sell me

345
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,160
some whatever he ended up going back to

346
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,759
cali i gave him a few hundred bucks

347
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,838
my man sent me like

348
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,278
five beans and i was totally upset

349
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,639
because i've never you know the pricing

350
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,159
in the whole thing so i can't say man

351
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,519
what where's the rest of the beans he

352
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,639
said man that's that's what you get for

353
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,879
good stuff

354
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,120
so ended up growing that and it was like

355
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,639
off the hook right then i knew that hey

356
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,959
i i want to dabble in in breeding now at

357
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,120
that time i dabbled and i was pollen

358
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,518
chucking not knowing what i was doing i

359
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,360
was just crossing crossing and the stuff

360
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,039
wasn't coming out not even better than

361
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,639
overseas and not even better than cali

362
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,559
it just wasn't right i didn't know how

363
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,159
to pick i didn't know how to choose all

364
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,439
the things that come along with the

365
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,958
process i wasn't i didn't understand so

366
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,360
i put it on the back burner and it

367
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:53,039
wasn't until 2000 i think it was 2012

368
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,278
2008 through 2012 when the cookie

369
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,439
dropped out in cali is when i picked it

370
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,639
back up because i started delivery

371
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,880
service

372
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,039
here in arizona i was a caregiver for

373
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,720
about seven years and i took care of a

374
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,759
lot of patients well at that time they

375
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,680
allowed people to caregive now my flower

376
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,039
was just the same flowers everybody else

377
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,479
because we all had like the same

378
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,360
cuttings and everybody was running the

379
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,879
same stuff so i wanted to be different

380
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,839
and i knew that

381
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,838
you know

382
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,920
breeding was a way for me to really

383
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,880
separate myself from everybody else in

384
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,879
the crowd so the first thing i did was

385
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,799
was go on that journey we could talk

386
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,480
about it a lot later and go in depth but

387
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,359
i went on that journey to really start

388
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,680
to experiment and contacted some people

389
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,278
who were able to uh

390
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,120
first of all i bought a cutting for like

391
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,399
two thousand dollars and almost got me

392
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,759
divorced

393
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,078
uh

394
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,000
you know and then the second cutting for

395
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,278
another two grand

396
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,480
yeah i was sleeping on the couch for

397
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,799
like a month

398
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,199
and my wife people around me just didn't

399
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,120
understand what i was doing and i

400
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,039
remember my buddy and cali he said yo

401
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,120
man if you're gonna play this game you

402
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,879
gotta have proper genetics otherwise

403
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,120
you're just you're just another small

404
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,439
fish in in the in in the sea

405
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,879
and so that's that's what i did man is

406
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,199
that i i

407
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,120
bought these expensive genetics

408
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,799
i started experimenting

409
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,519
and then i started to study and really

410
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,399
dig down and try to understand the plan

411
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,399
and

412
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,240
long story short

413
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,320
i had one of the best delivery services

414
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,079
in the valley for many years called

415
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,839
speedy nuggs and you know so it just you

416
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,679
know that's really where it started

417
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,680
because i wanted to be different and i

418
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,679
wanted to have something that nobody

419
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,919
else had in some different type of

420
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,319
varieties that weren't like anybody

421
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,360
else's that's really that's really why i

422
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,680
started

423
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,320
okay so that's how you started getting

424
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,799
into breeding side of things so fast

425
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,320
forward to today talking about breeding

426
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,319
setup you know you can do breeding

427
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,560
indoors you can do breeding outdoors

428
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,480
what do you do like what's your setup

429
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,399
are you indoors if you're indoors what

430
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,920
size room are you in lighting so on and

431
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,879
so forth talk to us about your breeding

432
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,958
setup

433
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:04,000
so i won't give you my entire process

434
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,879
but i will i will share with you that it

435
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,679
takes it takes a lot of people to get it

436
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,078
done the right way obviously you know

437
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:15,439
you can breed within one compound one

438
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:18,479
tint uh one compound whatever but

439
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,880
you know my process utilizes friends

440
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,278
people i have a commercial facility in

441
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,919
oklahoma where we do our actual runs and

442
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,759
we do our actual actual test

443
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,519
to run many more because here in the

444
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,519
state of arizona we're on them we're in

445
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,000
the limit and we're limited to the

446
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,399
amount that we can we can uh the flowers

447
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,198
we can cultivate now the

448
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,320
the the main thing is that

449
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,919
i knew that i was limited at with my

450
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,959
caregiving card

451
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,039
and

452
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,638
and i knew that i want i need i had to

453
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,240
keep moms around

454
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,839
right and then at the same because i

455
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,159
know i know you're probably going to ask

456
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,880
me about the males and and pollen and

457
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:59,439
whatever else but you know i focused

458
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,360
more on the ladies now when i say more

459
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,279
people helping out there's people who

460
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,959
would carry the males so that's one

461
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,559
thing cool about being a friend with a

462
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,479
breeder is that hey you know i can give

463
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,559
cuttings to people who

464
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,720
which i think are going to be

465
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,119
some of the best and they hold on to the

466
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,839
cuttings they keep they flower they keep

467
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,000
around and veg and then if we it is the

468
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,320
winner that we need then i bring it back

469
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,480
and then i do breed within i breed

470
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,120
within a tent so i take the best of the

471
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,120
best females and then work with the best

472
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,679
of the best male

473
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,600
um and and i have a process when i go

474
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,758
through that but but i use the 10 and i

475
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,680
and i solo everything out in the room

476
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,680
you know cut off the delivery service

477
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,799
and just really focused in on

478
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,399
on honing that that craft now when we

479
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,758
when we really want to do a major

480
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:51,039
funeral hunt then we utilize oklahoma in

481
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,278
that manner so we can pop 100 200 beans

482
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:55,759
and like right now we're running the v12

483
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,679
and the v12 we pop i think around 100

484
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,399
beans but usually around 100 mark is a

485
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,719
good mark to for me anyways that's my

486
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,558
thought process 100 to really get

487
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,400
something swell out of there

488
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,879
we don't bring them back from oklahoma

489
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,519
back here but what we do is we're we're

490
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,160
able to to identify and know that hey we

491
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,078
have something special and you know we

492
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,558
possibly may breed out there but we're

493
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:21,119
not breeding out there now so really you

494
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:23,759
know i utilize a few tints

495
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,399
i put the best females in the tent

496
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,000
and then i grab the best male that i can

497
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,880
grab that i find

498
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,319
out of maybe 15 20 males i'll take the

499
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,400
best male from that 15 to 20 uh

500
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,639
depending on the rub the smell test

501
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,038
depending on the the structure

502
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,520
and and then also you know what what i

503
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,640
want to see out of the the crossing

504
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,400
itself

505
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,840
okay yeah i was going to ask you

506
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,240
how many plants you typically are

507
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,319
hunting through and it's funny i was

508
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,480
watching your video where you're talking

509
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,639
about breeding and you had mentioned

510
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,440
that there have been times where you've

511
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,720
gone through 100 and didn't find what

512
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,519
you're looking for so you had to start

513
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,839
fresh

514
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,359
multiple times that has happened to you

515
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,359
so it seems like you have some real high

516
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,759
standards when it comes to finding

517
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,399
exactly what you're looking for

518
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,480
it just happened to me i uh

519
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,720
many people from my network they saw me

520
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,519
go down to costa rica i went landrus

521
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,640
hunting in costa rica and

522
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,319
great experience came back was excited

523
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,038
to do this run

524
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:29,839
i did the run made the crosses started

525
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:32,879
to run some experiments

526
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,959
just just wasn't happening and you know

527
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,480
you know in this game and if you

528
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,558
a true breeder understands you're going

529
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,160
to be getting rid of more than you are

530
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,279
you're going to be keeping

531
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,640
and you know i i i'm big on that and and

532
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,720
it's kind of you know i allow like i

533
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,799
always say i allow the the beans to

534
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,079
speak for me i don't i don't run around

535
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:51,679
the world saying i'm the best and i'm

536
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,439
the greatest or none of that the beans

537
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,720
will speak for themselves

538
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,759
and you know high quality um

539
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,279
health

540
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:03,919
is huge you know and uh so yeah man i

541
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,079
there's it just happened to me literally

542
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,240
a few months ago got rid of

543
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,558
the females that i thought were going to

544
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,000
be the ones and she happened to her

545
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,359
and then when she heard that i'm just

546
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,679
not with that you know what i'm saying

547
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:18,240
i'm not i'm not with the herms and got

548
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,840
rid of that if one of them heard within

549
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,000
20 40 or you know vice versa

550
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,079
i really start to remove those and then

551
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,558
pop more because with you know it's just

552
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:32,240
a process i have but i'm really really

553
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:35,038
picky and anal about making sure uh

554
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,319
you know i i get what i want out of

555
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,960
work

556
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,439
it can definitely be a long long process

557
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,000
like you just said you touched upon a

558
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,000
little bit on what you're looking for in

559
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,200
a pheno right you talk about stem rub a

560
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,679
little bit i want to get a little bit

561
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,120
deeper into that what exactly do you

562
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,720
look for and i know this varies by

563
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,000
breeder right some people looking for

564
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,480
tricho production some people are

565
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,200
looking for the vigor of the plants

566
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,798
the list goes on what are you looking

567
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,279
for in a cultivar when making your

568
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,639
decision on if it's suitable for

569
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,879
breeding or not

570
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,480
we get our stuff tested

571
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,440
so terp profile is obviously a big one

572
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,480
uh

573
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,600
the the levels the th levels making sure

574
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,798
the levels are where i want them to be

575
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:22,558
the structure the smell the rub the rub

576
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,960
smell means a lot to me and i think

577
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,279
that's a special skill in itself because

578
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,640
out of 100 plants i can rub each and

579
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:30,240
every one of them and i kind of know

580
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,240
which way they're going to be rolling

581
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,880
there's characteristics that a lot of

582
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,679
plants carry like the rubber rubber glue

583
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,960
smell like a brand new pair of shoes

584
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,720
smell a grape an apple or fruits some

585
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,558
some of the fruit type stuff

586
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,798
so myself

587
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,798
it's it's it's more than just one thing

588
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,879
it's it's a full collage of what i'm

589
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,079
looking for and what i'm looking to

590
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,640
express

591
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,839
uh for instance i created a one-to-one

592
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,600
that is very rare one to one i mean it's

593
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,798
it was really close like a 17 to 15

594
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,599
on paper

595
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:05,839
and

596
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,359
you know going through that process it's

597
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,798
like okay

598
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,798
that's what makes the journey so long

599
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,200
because even though you run you can run

600
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:16,720
a hundred and doing the rub test smell

601
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,038
test doing all this and that

602
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,759
what i'm looking for on the left has to

603
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,359
make sense to the right so the male the

604
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,279
males that i'm looking for when i use

605
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,678
utilize the males the males i'm looking

606
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,519
for strong characteristics strong

607
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,519
characteristics that didn't help the

608
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,599
female to go where they need to go but

609
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,200
i'm also looking for balance i'm not

610
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,359
looking for one to overpower the other

611
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,519
the other like i'm known for the og

612
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,839
cooking you know the balance of the og

613
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,480
cookie not one being more powerful than

614
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,158
the other so you know that

615
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,519
we could sit here all day and talk about

616
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,400
how in in the different ways that i then

617
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,720
look for the feet the the phenos but the

618
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,519
honest to god truth chris it's it's

619
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,519
truly like you said it boils down to to

620
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,158
what the breeder is looking for

621
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,000
and me i'm known for the og cookie

622
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,480
because i love the og

623
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,558
and i love the cookie right but the

624
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,480
cookie will have you somewhere over

625
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,000
there and i owed you how you sleeping

626
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,880
somewhere so i always look for that

627
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,079
balance and you know and and that's just

628
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,640
what i'm known for and you know

629
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:23,519
i cannot explain how my fingers rub on

630
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,159
something smell rub on something smell

631
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,639
people trip out on it and and it's it's

632
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,520
i believe it's a skill you acquire over

633
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,120
over years of experience you know

634
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,440
because there's different categories and

635
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,719
there's nothing like i recently saw

636
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,080
something with some duck feet i don't

637
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,480
know if you heard of anything about some

638
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,839
duck feet type of genetic

639
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,640
and

640
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:47,199
everything falls within a category

641
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,840
you know and

642
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,919
from there is when i say okay this is a

643
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,678
okay this is that you can start to put

644
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,440
things in the category you know now when

645
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,840
it comes down to looking for that pheno

646
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,519
or what you're working on uh in the prop

647
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,720
for instance a gorilla butter i'm

648
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,960
working on it didn't have size to it

649
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,319
so i already knew i had something that

650
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,919
was able to bring more size to it but i

651
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,558
didn't want the balance i didn't want

652
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,400
the size from the right i wanted this

653
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,798
i'm sorry i didn't want the size from

654
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,798
the left i wanted i wanted the size from

655
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,440
the right but i wanted the left to be

656
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,519
and speaking to be more dominant

657
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,240
so we had to go through many many many

658
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,798
phenoes to find that one

659
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,200
and and so ron hill from our group was

660
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,200
able to showcase that within our group

661
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
and you know the journey's long and when

662
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,120
you find it you're like yes because you

663
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,640
you hit it on the nails now you got the

664
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,719
what's on the left the characteristics

665
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,278
of what's on the left is really shining

666
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,798
and showcasing but you've added extra

667
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:48,400
weight to it

668
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:50,240
without without you know

669
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,000
the plan on the right wasn't what i was

670
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,278
looking for but i needed the size and

671
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,480
destruction

672
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,319
um

673
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,960
you know it's a long it's a long process

674
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,720
and and what i'm dabbling with now is is

675
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,278
uh the crispr

676
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,600
uh and and crispr i'm not sure if you're

677
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,519
familiar with crispr many people aren't

678
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:10,079
familiar with crispr but i'm going to

679
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:13,519
take that journey because you know as a

680
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:15,678
real breeder you're really looking to

681
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,558
work with the dna and that's why we

682
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,360
breed we're trying to get the a b c d f

683
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:24,240
g h i we're working on those

684
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:26,959
those letters and with crispr we're able

685
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,679
to remove the e remove the f add in the

686
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,440
a's the b's the c's and now we it kind

687
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,759
of speeds up it takes two years off of

688
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,960
this process uh so

689
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,879
that's something we're working on but

690
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,120
the final hunt man it's

691
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,200
it's a it is a skill

692
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,278
it's it's truly a skill

693
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,120
and uh you know when you find the one

694
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,919
that you're looking for in your paper

695
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,199
and your numbers match up and then uh

696
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,159
the results

697
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,840
you know

698
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,080
they speak for themselves

699
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:57,359
it'll be interesting to fast forward 10

700
00:24:54,079 --> 00:25:00,000
15 years and see dna editing you know

701
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,439
gene editing and how it actually takes

702
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,640
us you know how far it actually takes us

703
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,519
and what we're able to do with in the

704
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,520
future it's uh scary

705
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,599
and exciting at the same time you know

706
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,720
because uh you get some funky stuff

707
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,359
happening i know they're talking about

708
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,440
crispr with human gene editing which is

709
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,918
just super scary we're not talking about

710
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,798
that but plants i mean it's similar

711
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,360
right

712
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,759
well i believe i believe i believe it it

713
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,918
i not only believe i mean china and few

714
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,558
other countries have shown us results of

715
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,000
tripling and doubling and even mold like

716
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,240
for instance that's why people love

717
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,240
blueberry because it's mold resistant

718
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,599
it's you can grow it outdoor indoor

719
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,480
anywhere and it's not going to collect

720
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,719
any mold now inside of that dna pattern

721
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,038
you know you could take that that dna

722
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,038
strand that helix and add it to another

723
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,798
added to another variety that is lacking

724
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:49,119
that so you can pull that out and put

725
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,558
that in i'm all for that

726
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,798
when it comes to humans that's totally

727
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,879
that's that's totally different but

728
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,798
we're seeing the crispr being used

729
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,720
across the platform on plants in

730
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,879
countries where they're getting low

731
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,400
yield or they need fast turnaround and

732
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,440
faster cropping

733
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,320
i think it not i don't think i believe

734
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,120
and know it will be the future of plants

735
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:13,599
and food and things of that nature uh

736
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,879
yeah you are playing god but at the same

737
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,918
time

738
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,440
i mean

739
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,759
i mean it's no different than taking

740
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,400
pollen and chucking and doing it's

741
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,558
really it's really no no different

742
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,000
you know a huge difference but i mean

743
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,558
it's really you know you're you're

744
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,919
actually making something better and and

745
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,960
and uh much more uh

746
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,200
something geared and you're like you

747
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,519
said cutting off two years of time uh

748
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,960
doing it the way we're doing it now

749
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,400
saves a lot of time yeah it can

750
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,240
definitely make things a lot easier

751
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,400
that's for sure

752
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,798
circling back to

753
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,640
the pollination process i want to get a

754
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,639
little bit deeper into this some people

755
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,880
will collect the pollen from the males

756
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,120
and then pollinate the females later on

757
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,880
or some people will put the males in

758
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,959
with the females in the same room and

759
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,559
kind of let them do their thing pollen

760
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,240
sacks start to open and things start to

761
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,319
fly around the room so on and so forth

762
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,400
what's your style of doing the actual

763
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,240
pollination process you know i've tried

764
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,320
it all and

765
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,278
the one i really enjoy is the natural

766
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:15,119
way of throwing the the bad boy in there

767
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,159
into into with the ladies and let them

768
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:17,519
have fun

769
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,799
um

770
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,480
you know i i've stored pollen and

771
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,960
you know sometimes it doesn't work out

772
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,519
as you know the best you know the way

773
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,000
you wanted to but for myself i

774
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:32,720
definitely enjoy putting the boy in the

775
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,679
tent with the girls let the party begin

776
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,919
at a specific week and man i mean that's

777
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,120
that's the best way now i do i have and

778
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,840
i do

779
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:45,439
uh collect the pollen especially if it's

780
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:47,439
something that i really like and enjoy

781
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,960
then i would do that but at the same

782
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,519
time i will then also tissue culture

783
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,360
so i have friends in the valley who who

784
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,278
tissue culture and they do their thing

785
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:00,319
and when i really want to keep a male

786
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:02,960
around as opposed to pollen i will then

787
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,398
make take a slither of a cutting hand it

788
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,880
to a couple of my buddies and then they

789
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:09,678
will store that for too long period of

790
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,278
time the very slow growth process and

791
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,519
that really helps me out a lot because

792
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,519
then i don't have mounds of pollen just

793
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,679
just everywhere now that's why it's

794
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,278
really important when you you want to

795
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,360
get into breeding or you're breeding in

796
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,599
your room you're right when that

797
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,398
pollen's flying around everywhere man

798
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,398
it's it's it can be it could be a bad

799
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,798
sight for the next breeding or the next

800
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,519
process uh so you really gotta use

801
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,960
utilize the the filtration properly uh

802
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,798
bleach and make sure things are

803
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,200
sanitized properly i actually use like

804
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,278
an ozone and kill everything in the room

805
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,360
at the end of each process like i kill

806
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,359
anything that's living in the room and

807
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,759
make sure that that there's nothing else

808
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:51,038
living and that can jeopardize the next

809
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:53,759
process but yeah me putting the the boy

810
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:55,519
in the in the tent i found to be

811
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,038
i don't know it's like apple trees you

812
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,200
know when you got a male tree outside

813
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,038
and a female tree outside they just seem

814
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,278
to work well together it's nature it's

815
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,640
it's it's the way nature the way it's

816
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:05,519
intended to be

817
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,799
um

818
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,759
but you know i have taken pollen in in

819
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:14,000
dabbled but it doesn't produce as well

820
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,839
as as putting the boy inside of there

821
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,440
something special that happens yeah i

822
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,519
definitely agree with you on that one i

823
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,679
just finished up a run where i had the

824
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,240
mail on there with the females

825
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,640
and uh just you know at a certain day

826
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,480
just shaking the mail over all the

827
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,919
females and just completely covering

828
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,919
them you know and then killing off the

829
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,240
male because i didn't need it anymore

830
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,159
but uh you know i harvested now you know

831
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,679
broke up the plant

832
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,520
loaded with seeds you know what i mean

833
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,519
so if you're looking for like

834
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,798
to yield as many seeds as possible

835
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,319
you'll probably get a better result if

836
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,119
you're shaking the plant in there you

837
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:49,439
know and just you will notice i've done

838
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,719
it with uh you know a little swab and

839
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,880
swabbing different branches and stuff

840
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,720
like that but it doesn't get as much

841
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,240
coverage doesn't produce as many seeds

842
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,319
as keeping the mail in there so i

843
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,519
thought that was a big major call out

844
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,038
and you know

845
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,798
you know what's cool is that you know

846
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:05,278
after you do that because i have a

847
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,798
ritual i do you with my males in there

848
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:08,398
and we do a little

849
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,359
we do our little native

850
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:13,119
thing on it and um

851
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:14,558
you know

852
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,239
you only need to do it a few times and

853
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:17,278
then get them out of there so it's it's

854
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,200
you know then you can start your

855
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,759
cleaning process outside in the room and

856
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,000
you really start to sanitize outside

857
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,158
of the room but yeah it's just just a

858
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,440
little dab all over the entire crop and

859
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,039
man you're

860
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,120
you're good to go because even the

861
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,119
leaves carry some of the pollen so when

862
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,319
your fans are moving around in the tent

863
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,319
you know hey

864
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,000
it's still gonna continue to move around

865
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:40,960
as the plant grows

866
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,440
yep so i got to ask how long is pollen

867
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,720
good for and how do you properly store

868
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,159
pollen for

869
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,278
later use you know i i i've not ever

870
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,760
kept pollen over a year so

871
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:55,599
i i'm not i'm not sure after the year

872
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,079
mark but if i'm going to use something

873
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,558
and work with something i i i usually

874
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,798
give it that year time frame

875
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:05,119
could it be longer i'm not sure because

876
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,879
i i like i said if i'm going to use

877
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,479
something a year later from now or

878
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,880
something later down the road because i

879
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,960
do back crossing as well then i i would

880
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,679
i would go tissue culture and tissue

881
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,720
culture because you're able to the plant

882
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:22,720
continues to grow but it grows at a very

883
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,960
very slow rate uh the male plant that is

884
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,839
that's the way that i keep

885
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,640
my

886
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:30,158
male around as opposed to pollen because

887
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,240
again you can keep the pollen in the

888
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,919
fridge is the best place to keep it it

889
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,278
actually stores longer than if you just

890
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,679
keep it in a room

891
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:40,398
uh at room temperature you keep it in

892
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,640
the fridge and a refrigerator and things

893
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,918
just it works you know what i'm saying

894
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,320
but at the same time you got to be

895
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,200
careful because the pollen if you pull

896
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:52,639
it out the moisture can make the pollen

897
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,200
a bit sticky and gunky you know it can

898
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,360
happen and i've seen that happen so

899
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,159
to me tissue culture is just the way to

900
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:03,038
go if you're really trying to you know

901
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,399
keep the keep the male genetic around uh

902
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,640
and a lot of people

903
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:08,079
they don't understand tissue culturing

904
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,679
it's it's a long process i don't even

905
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,240
teach you culture i

906
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,000
it goes somewhere else and people then

907
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,640
store and do what they need to do for

908
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,880
myself but it's uh that's the way i do

909
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,200
it okay so you've pollinated your plants

910
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,640
they're growing they're producing seeds

911
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,840
at what point do you know when to

912
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,320
harvest

913
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:28,079
number one like i i like to tap i found

914
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,240
out that tapping the ladies in a right

915
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,158
around week three is probably the best

916
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,120
especially if you want to keep your

917
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,360
flower and you want to press the flower

918
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,879
uh you could do one good shake around

919
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,558
week three

920
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,720
you know remove the excess and then

921
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,000
plant then starts to develop now

922
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,440
here's the thing

923
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,200
this the seeds will finish in week six

924
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,000
they can be finished

925
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,919
uh

926
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,558
if you allow them to go any longer which

927
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,600
i

928
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,759
try not to then after about weeks seven

929
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,798
eight they then start to because there's

930
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:04,158
moisture they then start to open up

931
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:06,960
so around six to eight i really i'm

932
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,480
really watching the development of the

933
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,038
of the seeds and watching the

934
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,798
development of everything taking shape

935
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:14,879
i really don't focus on the plant

936
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,278
anymore meaning that i'm not i'm not

937
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,159
looking at the trikes i'm not deep into

938
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,240
the nature of the plant i'm i'm looking

939
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,120
at the creek because not every seed is

940
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,558
designed the same so some some finish

941
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,278
faster than the others the last

942
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:31,038
blueberry we just recreated finished

943
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:32,720
really fast to the point that at week

944
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,720
seven it started already cracking the

945
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,000
seeds started to crack open so i knew i

946
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,679
had a pooler and get her out of there

947
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,079
real fast you know didn't give us time

948
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,240
to flush or any of that but my vibranium

949
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,079
and my v12 you know they can run a full

950
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,679
eight weeks and man them suckers are

951
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:47,359
themselves are like little boulders you

952
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,120
know and then they're really hard then

953
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,599
you have the beans that are really tough

954
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:54,239
and hard you know like my cartier cookie

955
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,158
it's a very very strong bean

956
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,519
which means that it needs to go the

957
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,679
entire process so really from week six

958
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,079
to week eight is when anything after

959
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,798
week eight i think i think people are

960
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:09,838
messing up and um i'm not sure if it

961
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:11,519
hurts the seedling but uh you know

962
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,759
you you can't get the seedling to start

963
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,398
to open up because of the added moisture

964
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,079
and it's like tucked in this ball of

965
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,279
moisture you know what i'm saying so it

966
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,480
may wanna it may wanna start to grow

967
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,440
and i've seen that i'm sure you've seen

968
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,320
that pictures and online uh you know

969
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,079
seeds growing from a plant it's crazy i

970
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,000
actually haven't seen that now usually

971
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,519
the you know i see the calyx open up and

972
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,519
then the sea will kind of drop off the

973
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:38,079
plant and that's one thing that i kind

974
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,759
of heard in the past is like once you

975
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,000
start having seeds start to drop out of

976
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,119
there each day or even if you like touch

977
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,480
the plant a little bit also when these

978
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,679
seeds are falling out of there well you

979
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,599
probably want to harvest the plant at

980
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,119
that time because a lot of the seeds are

981
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,280
probably developed

982
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,960
now my next question would be

983
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,399
when you harvest and you you're breaking

984
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,679
up the buds and you've got your seed

985
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:57,440
there it's

986
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,559
pretty much impossible to have a hundred

987
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,400
percent developed seeds a percentage of

988
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,078
them are going to be undeveloped and

989
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,440
then the other percentage is going to be

990
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,680
fully developed

991
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,920
what is a good percentage in your

992
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:12,078
experience or your opinion developed

993
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,400
versus undeveloped seeds at harvest time

994
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,000
okay so you got to understand you got to

995
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,760
understand what you're working with

996
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,719
because it boils back down to the time

997
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,119
frame and the thing is if you crop out

998
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,639
at six week six

999
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,119
then more than likely you're gonna have

1000
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:29,279
a higher percentage of undeveloped

1001
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,000
if you allowed go to week eight you're

1002
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,400
gonna have a better chance of having uh

1003
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,639
the beans not be developed now people

1004
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,480
talk about white seeds gray seeds brown

1005
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:43,039
seeds tiger stripe all this stuff

1006
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,079
my cartier cookie puts off gray white

1007
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:48,800
seeds so it can trick you into thinking

1008
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,160
that it's not developed but it's really

1009
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,960
developed

1010
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,358
so

1011
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,199
you it boy goes back to

1012
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:57,679
understanding the genetic and what

1013
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:00,399
you're working with so if the if the cg

1014
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:02,799
pop prior were gray whites which i love

1015
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,400
the gray whites i mean people say oh

1016
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,560
they're not developed they're like no no

1017
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,160
no no you're not understanding

1018
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:09,838
because the grays man they put off the

1019
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:11,199
most strikes to me

1020
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:12,880
so when i'm working with that i know

1021
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,118
what i'm working with then i watch that

1022
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,240
time frame because in when comes six and

1023
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,400
seven especially eight i pulled down

1024
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,000
i had there's a better chance of getting

1025
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,599
your your your ratios would be

1026
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,440
definitely better now

1027
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,200
yeah when you make it to the latter part

1028
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,200
of the of the growth cycle yeah of

1029
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:30,960
course the beans are still developing

1030
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,838
but as long as you went and you're

1031
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,559
cropping at the proper time then

1032
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:38,880
you're gonna have a better ratio by far

1033
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,440
you know better ratio in your week seven

1034
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,039
and week eight of cooling down anything

1035
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,880
after that your the plant is still gonna

1036
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,719
continue to grow and continue to flower

1037
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,480
her not herself but the pollen is gonna

1038
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,480
continue to be around and it's gonna

1039
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,400
continue to produce seeds but like i

1040
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,320
said if you crop at week six

1041
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,838
uh which i know a lot of people do

1042
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,960
because they they want they don't care

1043
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,078
about the ratio they're just going to

1044
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,559
pull out the best because they're

1045
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,000
working with limited amounts of time

1046
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:03,519
and you know when you're when you're

1047
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,679
speeding up like that

1048
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,358
you don't get a good pop rate so that's

1049
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:08,480
another thing is that when you do wait

1050
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,639
the time

1051
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,639
and then you do uh then start to

1052
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:15,838
germinate you get a better germination

1053
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,838
rate uh when you wait better better

1054
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,279
percentage as well of of

1055
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,039
beings as well

1056
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,640
okay that makes sense

1057
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,079
and then i know there are so many

1058
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,000
different ways to go about it but kind

1059
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,560
of generally speaking how many

1060
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,440
generations are you going to in order to

1061
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:34,159
get your desired result so you know many

1062
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,400
people have they they work it a

1063
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:39,358
different way i get down to f3

1064
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,960
and

1065
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:44,719
at my f3 mark is really my telltale

1066
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,880
because when you're in your f1 you can

1067
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,598
get many

1068
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,079
varieties from an f1 i mean cousins

1069
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,079
aunties uncles you get you get it all

1070
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,920
right but as you start moving down and

1071
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,160
you start pulling back it's around week

1072
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,000
it's around the f3 where i really start

1073
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,279
to dwindle it down

1074
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,880
and

1075
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,640
that's when you can really start to see

1076
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,559
the prize and stuff happening now

1077
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,039
because it is an f3 and because i'm

1078
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:11,519
constantly in breeding in a way

1079
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:14,000
you know at times the f3 i will then

1080
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,838
bring in an outside to come into the f3

1081
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,800
so i don't hurt

1082
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:21,119
the genetic makeup and create mutants

1083
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,920
and because you can really

1084
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,440
mess up the genetic the makeup of of the

1085
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,159
plant so it really depends on

1086
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,039
where i'm at in f3 but f3 is kind of

1087
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:33,358
where

1088
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:35,279
i'm like okay you know i i know i have

1089
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,519
something good now if i make it to f3

1090
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,000
and it's happened to me before in three

1091
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:42,000
years actually of of working on a

1092
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
genetic i made it to my f3s and nothing

1093
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,400
in the f3s i like

1094
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,760
and you know i mean i i mean hundreds of

1095
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,920
beans later and there's just nothing

1096
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,640
what just wasn't matching up with what i

1097
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,599
like

1098
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:56,400
uh because if i want the if i want plant

1099
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,320
i'm looking for balance and if if i

1100
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,838
don't find that balance then it's not

1101
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,000
worth continuing i might as well run the

1102
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,599
beans that that favor more this side or

1103
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,519
run the beans that favor more to this

1104
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,519
side as opposed to trying to really

1105
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,199
recreate because i do something special

1106
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,519
after f3

1107
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:15,279
f3s are really important to me

1108
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:17,679
um and and into stabilizing the genetics

1109
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,440
really important okay so you go to f3s

1110
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:20,879
and then you cross with something i

1111
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,960
think you mentioned in the past you're

1112
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,800
doing back crossing as well

1113
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,199
talk to us about back crossing what is

1114
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,119
back crossing and how do you do it okay

1115
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,480
back crossing really stabilizes the

1116
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,240
genetic that's how you're able to

1117
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,159
without feminine

1118
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,519
be able to go back to the original

1119
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,920
characteristics

1120
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,039
now my process is whenever i'm working

1121
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,720
on a line

1122
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:43,838
off the f1 i keep the female that i

1123
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:45,519
really enjoy

1124
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:46,960
because that's the staple that's the one

1125
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:48,960
saying hey we're really trying to match

1126
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,039
and get as close to her as possible but

1127
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,599
at the same time the middle is possible

1128
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,599
when i make it down to the f3

1129
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,599
that's when i'm ready to come back to

1130
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,680
the mom

1131
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,000
because when i come back to that mom

1132
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,838
what i've done is there remember i

1133
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,679
started with f1 i'm getting 500

1134
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,599
different looks you know when i get down

1135
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,279
to f3 i've really joined it down to

1136
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,280
specific looks that i'm looking for now

1137
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,000
when i come back to that mama baby i'm

1138
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,119
rocking and rolling because now my my my

1139
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,280
it's like

1140
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,599
here so i'm i'm working with four five

1141
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,800
six really you get around from three to

1142
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,838
twelve

1143
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,599
looks

1144
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:25,759
on the back cross i mean it's not

1145
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,960
exactly the same but each beam you pop

1146
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,400
off of there are really going to be

1147
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,559
within that three to six variety look

1148
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,639
and and that's where it really gets the

1149
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:36,719
magic you know starts to happen is when

1150
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,159
you get back to the bx one right now i

1151
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:41,519
have some problems some stuff that's on

1152
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:44,559
the bx2 bx3s and

1153
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:46,800
bro consistency consistency consistency

1154
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:49,358
because i'm not a feminized type of

1155
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,880
breeder at all i don't i don't rock that

1156
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:52,799
way back crossing

1157
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,599
and that's the thing back crossing takes

1158
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,640
so long that people aren't willing to

1159
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,640
spend the time energy and money to

1160
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,239
stabilize something people are just

1161
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:03,759
trying to you know it's a great market

1162
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:05,598
right now we live in one of the greatest

1163
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,200
markets in the world right now when it

1164
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,240
comes to the flower

1165
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,159
and people right here trying to make

1166
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:11,439
money left and right so they're not work

1167
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,960
they're not trying to produce the best

1168
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,920
product they're just trying to produce

1169
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,199
product

1170
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,639
and that's a difference you know what

1171
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:18,879
i'm saying so

1172
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:21,358
uh back crossing is the way and the only

1173
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,559
way to go uh unless you're using a

1174
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:27,039
crispr program to eliminate that uh but

1175
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:29,358
basically going to f3 is the crisper in

1176
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:32,159
in essence that's what we're doing is is

1177
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:34,799
the natural form of crispr and then when

1178
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,480
you come back to the the original mom

1179
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,318
you got the original mom and then you

1180
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,760
got those other varieties in the damn

1181
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:41,519
you got a closer

1182
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,119
big group of uh

1183
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,280
what you want now what about self

1184
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,079
crossing what is that and how do you do

1185
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,800
that

1186
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,200
you know i stay away from self-crossing

1187
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,480
and i stay away from feminized

1188
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,239
and

1189
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,240
i i have people hit me up all the time

1190
00:41:54,239 --> 00:42:00,078
saying i i would grab from you if you

1191
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:00,078
have feminized and i'm like

1192
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:04,000
self-crossing man

1193
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:05,519
it's two ways that it's done you're

1194
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,719
stressing the plant

1195
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,400
you're stressing the plant either

1196
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,318
hermaphrodite itself

1197
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,280
and and if that's not the form you're

1198
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:13,440
taking

1199
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,599
uh and it's true you will get the same

1200
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,079
almost the same quality or the same

1201
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,680
genetic if you do self you do it to

1202
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,119
itself yeah you're going to get the

1203
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:22,799
offspring that looks just like that but

1204
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,200
what a lot of people don't know is you

1205
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,960
are really deter you are tearing up that

1206
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:29,679
genetic because then it doesn't

1207
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,800
reproduce uh like it should it just

1208
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:32,399
doesn't

1209
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,720
you know of course we would love to see

1210
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,800
lebron james cloned over and over again

1211
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,559
but it let that next lebron

1212
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,800
he might have an ear on top of his head

1213
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,719
you know it's like yo man

1214
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,280
hold up lebron bro you can hear me on

1215
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,480
top of your head bro like you know so

1216
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,480
and that's what we're seeing we're

1217
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,358
seeing and i've seen this happen chris

1218
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,199
i've seen s1s go against my f1s and f3s

1219
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:55,119
and back crosses and i've seen feminize

1220
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:57,679
go against and i don't want to say go

1221
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,838
against but the structure of

1222
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:04,318
an fs1 does not look anything like you

1223
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:06,799
know the original process

1224
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,400
then it boils back down again to

1225
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,720
the marketing side of things when it

1226
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,480
comes to s1 but i know guys at s1 and

1227
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,480
they have great products and they and it

1228
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,960
looks great and all but their plan isn't

1229
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,639
as vigorous it isn't as healthy and then

1230
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,720
when they're ready to clone and they're

1231
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,879
ready to move that genetic down the line

1232
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:24,959
it doesn't happen they the the makeup

1233
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,119
goes like this and the cl and the the

1234
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,960
offspring aren't producing like they

1235
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,559
want them to so it's really like one and

1236
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,519
done once you get it once you do it boom

1237
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,799
it's over you know uh and when it comes

1238
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,880
to films

1239
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,519
hey man i'm not big into you know

1240
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,280
spraying my plant with chemical you know

1241
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:42,639
to make herself

1242
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,480
freak herself

1243
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:46,559
so then she's stressed out that's that's

1244
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,960
how that's how it happens so then people

1245
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,078
ask me well you know my plants aren't

1246
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,960
herming and the office that are not

1247
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,119
okay but i bet you've lost

1248
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,960
a quarter of the weight maybe half of

1249
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,079
the weight or you know some type of

1250
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,159
structural

1251
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,800
uh condition or you know there's just so

1252
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:07,279
much that goes that's in the negative

1253
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,280
and as a breeder myself you know i'm

1254
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,640
from the old school man and i believe in

1255
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,040
mother nature and i believe in the

1256
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:15,118
natural process because then it isn't

1257
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:16,960
lying to us you know what i'm saying

1258
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,920
it's not lying to us

1259
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,838
uh and it it's it's a big market i mean

1260
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,838
you know feminism i mean as a beginning

1261
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:25,920
grower you know

1262
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:28,880
you don't want i mean i hear he wasn't

1263
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,880
oh my god i got four out of 12 four were

1264
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,440
males

1265
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,039
it's it's it's it's the nature of the of

1266
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,400
the regular being

1267
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,159
you know what i'm saying

1268
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,920
and so you know people would dig to the

1269
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,920
films and then then six months later i

1270
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,079
hear how come my plans aren't producing

1271
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,599
like they should or that

1272
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,119
i'm like man i don't even like to speak

1273
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,480
on it because i've already told you six

1274
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,039
months ago what the deal was and what

1275
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,760
the demo was so you know you like i said

1276
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,759
this game is not a game of trial and

1277
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,760
error because if you want to play trial

1278
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,280
and error then if you're going to spend

1279
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,839
a lot of time

1280
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,119
a lot of time you know going 2-3 months

1281
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:05,838
2-3 months 2-3 months of trial and error

1282
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,559
so

1283
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:11,119
it's like yo man uh i i get it i

1284
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,880
understand why people use films i think

1285
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,800
it's great for beginners to get their

1286
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,880
hands in this in the soil and the clay

1287
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,720
and start playing with the stuff but

1288
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,358
when you're ready to get serious about

1289
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,719
your your flower and your genetics

1290
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:24,559
bro

1291
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:28,318
nothing's really going to be beat the

1292
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:30,719
regs man just that's my that's my take

1293
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:32,960
gotcha so we could sit here and talk on

1294
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,239
and on and on but uh we're gonna start

1295
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,480
to wrap things up just got a couple

1296
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:38,479
final questions for you one of them is

1297
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,599
really for the folks that are new to

1298
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,599
breeding

1299
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,240
what advice do you have for those folks

1300
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:47,760
that are new to breeding it takes a lot

1301
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:49,919
of time money

1302
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,520
focus

1303
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,358
and

1304
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:55,199
consistency

1305
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:57,119
and

1306
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,679
becoming a breeder

1307
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,240
you know it's it's a beautiful thing

1308
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,919
but if you're not going to

1309
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,479
lay down the cake

1310
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,318
for awesome genetics to start with i

1311
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,800
always use this analogy you know when i

1312
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:14,480
explain stuff to people you know

1313
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,560
if michael jordan and and let's say lisa

1314
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,639
leslie had a baby

1315
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,039
you're gonna get some pretty good

1316
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:23,118
offspring i mean it's just the way it

1317
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:25,358
may grow i mean you may pop off some

1318
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,920
seven footers who are just jumping out

1319
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:29,920
the gym you know it's just that's just

1320
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,079
the way it goes even with dogs like you

1321
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,760
don't see you don't see breeders

1322
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,800
reaching for the mutt that came around

1323
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,920
the corner

1324
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,359
you know you're not looking for that

1325
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,039
much they came around the corner and it

1326
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:40,639
looks like three four different other

1327
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:42,079
varieties you know and then saying oh

1328
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,920
i'm gonna make a champion out of that it

1329
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,480
doesn't work that way you know i used to

1330
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,400
breed dogs and when i came into this it

1331
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,838
was the same way same philosophy and

1332
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,240
that's why it put me on the couch and

1333
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:54,159
while i was almost divorced because yo i

1334
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:55,279
invested into the proper genetics so

1335
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:56,559
somebody's out there and they're saying

1336
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,319
hey i want to go on this journey and

1337
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,599
become one of the best breeders known to

1338
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:03,920
mankind start it starts with genetics

1339
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,559
and it starts with regular genetics not

1340
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,480
something feminized not something even a

1341
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:09,599
clone get away from the clone game

1342
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,599
because that you know i had to learn

1343
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,119
that as well i can't take in a clone you

1344
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,119
don't know how many times that plan has

1345
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,000
been cloned so you don't know the

1346
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,240
history of that of that situation people

1347
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,400
lie everything lies the only thing that

1348
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:24,558
doesn't numbers don't lie is the only

1349
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,200
thing that's real so

1350
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:30,960
investing to invest into

1351
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:33,598
uh your your genetics number one but

1352
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,159
then also cut out trying to flower in

1353
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,519
the same area as as you're trying to

1354
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:39,039
breathe you got to make a choice you

1355
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:40,639
can't chase two rabbits because you'll

1356
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,119
catch none so either you're going to be

1357
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,480
growing flower for yourself or you're

1358
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,160
going to be a breeder and if you're

1359
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,079
going to be a breeder you got to be a

1360
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:50,719
breeder 100

1361
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,720
24 7 or it doesn't work

1362
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:54,959
you know and and i it's a big it was a

1363
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:57,039
big role of the dice when i decided to

1364
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,559
go full-time breeding and you know the

1365
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:00,480
only reason why i did because there were

1366
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,599
a lot of individuals who were getting in

1367
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,800
pain so much for genetics and yo man i

1368
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,000
just wanted to help people out right so

1369
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,519
that's what i say if you want to be

1370
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,880
someone who helps people out in this

1371
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:15,199
game and give people an opportunity uh

1372
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,838
then hey reach for the best genetics and

1373
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:19,838
go 100 don't go 50

1374
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:22,400
at becoming a breeder and do not

1375
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:24,558
practice pollen chucking

1376
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,800
that's that that will land you

1377
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,800
uh in hot water and a lot of people not

1378
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,720
wanting to purchase anything from

1379
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,920
definitely some good advice there all

1380
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,439
around

1381
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,280
so wrapping things up how can the

1382
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,838
listeners find you and what do you have

1383
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,519
upcoming in the future you know uh

1384
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:41,838
you can google me i've always wanted to

1385
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:42,920
say that

1386
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:45,799
uh

1387
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:48,000
nsgclub.com you can catch me there

1388
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,240
cartiercrops.com you know i help people

1389
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,159
out in the game and and whatever else

1390
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,959
and in the future you know i'm i'm

1391
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:57,679
really focused in on oklahoma right now

1392
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,318
oklahoma you know here in in the states

1393
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:02,639
is really allowing us to do our thing

1394
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:04,159
and you see the brand back here we're

1395
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,838
gonna have it on packages we just

1396
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:07,679
finished our second crop

1397
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:09,519
and uh it'll be distributed all through

1398
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:11,440
the state of oklahoma so this was a

1399
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:14,239
dream in the vision and it was an idea

1400
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,880
that started and so to be able to wake

1401
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:19,519
each day and you know move forward

1402
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,119
because you fail many many times but as

1403
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:22,318
long as you continue to move your feet

1404
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,880
one in front of the other you're a

1405
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:26,480
success every single day and so this

1406
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,960
back here and what's about to happen in

1407
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:32,079
oklahoma is was something that that's

1408
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,318
just been planned and it's working out

1409
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,760
and i'm really excited to see that face

1410
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:40,800
on packages and and have product within

1411
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,319
the market of oklahoma uh but i

1412
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,640
you know there's a conflict with me

1413
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:47,119
continuing to breed i love to breed but

1414
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:48,879
it takes a lot of time energy and money

1415
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,240
not too sure how long

1416
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,519
i'll uh

1417
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,679
do that

1418
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:56,239
but you know as long as i'm here and i'm

1419
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:58,399
breathing and i have the resources and

1420
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:00,879
everything around to continue to breed

1421
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,680
um then then i'm about that life man

1422
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,119
because recreation is pretty dope and

1423
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:06,078
and i want to say this before you

1424
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,838
