1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
coming up on garden talk a mandating

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,240
with like the natural fertilizer so i

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,400
add a lot of the guano the bone meal

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,480
blood meal and i found that just really

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,320
making my own mix turned out to be the

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,160
perfect solution and really just helped

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,679
to cut a lot of cost it just goes to

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,760
show that by having the pearlite and

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,600
creating those little pockets it really

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,359
does help you know the root system the

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,960
plant and the overall health term you

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,439
want something that runs cool something

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,640
that's not too heavy something that does

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,640
not run too hot and is full spectrum and

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,399
has the external dimmer those are the

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,880
main things that i look for when buying

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,799
a light it's not necessarily all about

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,719
like spending loads of money to achieve

19
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,799
a perfect setup plans can't tell if

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,640
you're using like a super expensive

21
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,359
piece of equipment over it or if you're

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,600
using like a three by two frame that you

23
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:51,039
built and made your own scrog net out of

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,039
it just knows it's being trained

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,079

filters to help get clean

48
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,560

contaminants dust and bacteria from the

51

air they use a two inch thick layer of

52
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,519
coconut carbon which is the most

53
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,599
eco-friendly and sustainable source of

54
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,000
carbon it has a significantly higher

55
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,318
density of micro pores compared to other

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,479
forms of activated carbon this results

57
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,958
in it being 50 more effective at

58
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,040

106
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,479
been in a situation similar to a lot of

107
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,479
you listening to this podcast today uh

108
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,598
really having to keep things budget

109
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,119
friendly

110
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,199
he lived in an area where it's difficult

111
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,759
for him to get grow equipment both in

112
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,359
person and even shipped to him so he

113
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,120
learned to do a lot of stuff on the

114
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,360
budget and found ways to take an

115
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,640
alternative approach when needed so

116
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,720
that's really what i want to get into

117
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,238
today in this talk but first can we do

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,680
an introduction can you tell us a little

119
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,119
bit about yourself and how you got into

120
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,000
gardening

121
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,319
for sure for sure um well i got the

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,399
channel but i actually started gardening

123
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,560
long before the channel was created so

124
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,519
my first grow was like a medicinal grow

125
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,759
back in like 2010 2011 it was out in the

126
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,079
uk in southampton you know so shout out

127
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,879
to the uk mad love um it was actually

128
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,359
with one of the hps bugs as well so it

129
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,639
was like a little closet grow

130
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,000
hps bulb really hot um a lot of mistakes

131
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,918
were made i got some nice um magic beans

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,560
and ran those and it actually turned out

133
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:57,039
to be a male variety

134
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,079
so and it was a bit in vain but the

135
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,000
lessons learnt were fantastic um other

136
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,000
than that i grow a lot of other plants

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,079
in my garden as well so i like like

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,639
house plants such as snake plants spider

139
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,198
plants aloes uh even the mother of

140
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,400
thousands that propagates like crazy

141
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,160
i also like like thyme basil mint

142
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,599
oregano those sort of stuff because i

143
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,600
really like to just throw that in there

144
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,400
in my cooking and use that try to be

145
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,000
very self-sufficient so um gardening's

146
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,758
just always been something that i lean

147
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,759
to i mean my mom got me into it when i

148
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,600
was really really you're small so shout

149
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,360
out to her as well you know fully in the

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,039
foundation gotta give credit where

151
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,319
credit is due right

152
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,839
awesome yes 100 dude

153
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,680
so what do you think you're what would

154
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,839
you say your overall style of gardening

155
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,879
is like today are you are you mostly

156
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,758
indoors outdoors you grow in soil cocoa

157
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,879
hydroponics do you use organic inputs

158
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,840
synthetic inputs what's your style

159
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,600
um well mainly a lot of soil i've grown

160
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,279
outdoor and i've grown indoor my

161
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,439
preference is indoor just because you

162
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,519
can really control the environment you

163
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,000
can control what goes in there and you

164
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,000
can control the light the humidity the

165
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
moisture you can control all that good

166
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,600
stuff so that's sort of like my

167
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
preference i did grow outdoors i ran

168
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,000
into some challenges with that uh such

169
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,160
as the past the uh

170
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,079
nature's automatic clock you know from

171
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,400
12 to 12 that sort of stuff it was

172
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,519
always on that cycle for me so that was

173
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,439
a bit difficult in itself um i've grown

174
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,439
indoors now and like i said i use a lot

175
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,839
of soil that's my preferred style of

176
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,719
growing i will sort of amend it with

177
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,439
like natural amendments the bat guano a

178
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,919
lot of organic stuff i did start off

179
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,079
with like the bottle nutrients um but i

180
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,879
sort of veered away from that as i got

181
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,599
more like knowledge behind me

182
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,120
so

183
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,280
that we can get into that a bit more

184
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,280
later on but for now i pretty much say

185
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:53,279
that my main style of gardening is like

186
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:55,758
an organic style which basically

187
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,439
moves around soil it centers around the

188
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,560
soil i like to use potting mix and

189
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,399
natural amendments i'm not big on the

190
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,680
hydrophonics simply because i haven't

191
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,000
tried it yet

192
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,160
i have tried pure peat moss mixtures but

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,279
that turned out to be very acidic and

194
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,520
very hard to like work with so i found

195
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,079
the easiest way and like i said keeping

196
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,079
it on a budget turned out to be soil so

197
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,918
it always just turned back to soil for

198
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,478
me and that was just the easiest way to

199
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,079
to move on a budget you know

200
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,918
i was going to ask you you know first

201
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,639
question what do you use for medium and

202
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,318
containers and that's soil are you like

203
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,598
using the native soil out of your

204
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,598
backyard and like rehabbing it to

205
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,000
you know inoculate with microbes aerate

206
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,959
so on and so forth making it into usable

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,839
for

208
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,439
medicinal plants or are you actually you

209
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,318
know is available locally to where you

210
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,639
can buy soil either by the bag or by the

211
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,639
yard or by whatever fantastic question

212
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,400
well i've actually used like a lot of

213
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,639
soil from the backyard and just sort of

214
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,719
like revamped it so i'll try to like i

215
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,720
said get a lot of the bat guano because

216
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,400
you can get that locally um in the

217
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,240
caribbean that's where i'm from actually

218
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,959
try that in tobago right now i'm in

219
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,439
colorado so back in trinidad and tobago

220
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,279
you did get like a lot of um grow

221
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,360
supplies the nutrients and that sort of

222
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,439
stuff but because it was imported there

223
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,038
was a slight like increase in the price

224
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,478
on those sort of stuff especially if you

225
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,038
want to bring it in yourself you got to

226
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,680
pay customs and taxes and stuff so i

227
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,918
found that um just like trying to

228
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,720
circumvent that using the easily

229
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,478
available organic fertilizers are a

230
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,879
great way to just give the plant what it

231
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,038
needs right so i found myself getting

232
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,800
into that a lot um i don't know if that

233
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,559
actually answers your question but i did

234
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,879
find myself getting into that a lot and

235
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,158
did you have to add in any microbes like

236
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,240
a lot of people don't inoculate with

237
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,399
microbes did you were able to purchase

238
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,240
microbes locally at all it was just not

239
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,720
available for you

240
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,480
um it was not really available uh the

241
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,720
the typical ones that i would get would

242
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,399
be like even just the mycorrhizae

243
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,639
sometimes you get that a lot

244
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,440
but that's more like fungi and bacteria

245
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:02,080
and stuff so it really was necessarily

246
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
that available um back then but now that

247
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,920
i'm in colorado i think it'll be easier

248
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:08,319
to get it but that said uh when i was

249
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,719
growing back in the caribbean a lot of

250
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,560
the fox farm soils and stuff you were

251
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,080
able to get that so i did try to run

252
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,559
with those a bit

253
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,759
and my experience with those was sort of

254
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,159
hit and miss

255
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,639
but i did have great results with like

256
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,719
the regular pro pro-mix and again i go

257
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,879
back to amending with like the natural

258
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,200
fertilizer so i add a lot of the guano

259
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,639
the bone meal blood meal a lot of that

260
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,879
sort of stuff and i found that just

261
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,639
really making my own mix turned out to

262
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,320
be the perfect solution and really just

263
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,240
helped to cut a lot of cost because you

264
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,240
can get a lot of these natural

265
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,480
fertilizers for pretty cheap and you can

266
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,639
get them at a lot of grow shops you know

267
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,879
as opposed to trying to buy and bring in

268
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,799
the brand name stuff so that's just

269
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,320
something that i've learned um but to

270
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,879
answer your question in terms of the

271
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,879
inoculation of microbes not all that

272
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,240
much to be honest with you yeah you're

273
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,320
probably getting a lot of the microbes

274
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,680
from the amendments anyways all natural

275
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,278
balances

276
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,479
you know a lot of that comes comes with

277
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:03,439
it so

278
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,440
that can definitely help with the

279
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,200
breakdown process and such now what

280
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,720
about containers so you mentioned you're

281
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,360
using soil with the amendments but what

282
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,360
do you use for containers

283
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,278
um i've tried a lot of containers that's

284
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,000
a great question chris um i've had a lot

285
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,838
of containers so like i found that

286
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,919
keeping it simple often works best so

287
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,760
like the fabric ones those are great

288
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,240
they're you know pretty inexpensive

289
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,159
they're reusable but i found that when

290
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,000
using the fabric ones it can be really

291
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,838
difficult to transplant out of those

292
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,519
especially if you got a big plant and

293
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,920
the roots like really busting through

294
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,600
that fabric um you can cause a lot of

295
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,240
damage to the roots and i've actually

296
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,240
shot the plant already so i if i'm using

297
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,039
the fabrics i tend to try to use them as

298
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,120
the final part right so when it comes

299
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,199
down to what pots i actually use i use a

300
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,200
mixture i start off with the plastic

301
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
parts i find that those are very easy to

302
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,680
you know transplant out of they're

303
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,000
durable um and they hold the water very

304
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,000
well you know if i'm using a smaller

305
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,839
fabric pot i find that water runs out of

306
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,879
it a lot and that can be stressful you

307
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,640
know just

308
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,639
i've actually seen one of your videos

309
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,159
where you talk about the dumping water

310
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,319
over top method when you're ordering

311
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,719
your plants i do that a lot so i've got

312
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,240
a really heavy hand and just having

313
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,200
water everywhere in the grow room isn't

314
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,759
always ideal so i like the fa the pla

315
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,079
the plastic parts to start off and as we

316
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,078
go into like the flowering stage then i

317
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,159
can pop them into some of the fabrics

318
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,000
and then i'll harvest from there soon

319
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,519
after but right now i'm actually just

320
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,320
using some of those like super cheap um

321
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,480
like almost like a plastic film so it's

322
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,079
like 90 cents i think i paid for one of

323
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,680
them and it's just like a sort of

324
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,919
plastic film with a few holes and i

325
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,719
added a few extra holes just to give it

326
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,399
that extra aeration and stuff but um

327
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,000
that's that's really what i grow and i

328
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,919
try to keep it simple i try to figure

329
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,679
out what works best for me because a lot

330
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,919
of people depending on their environment

331
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,679
where they're growing uh different parts

332
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,360
will dry out faster depending on your

333
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,039
environment right so like the fabric

334
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,120
ones will dry out a lot faster in

335
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,958
certain climates as opposed to the

336
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,720
plastic ones so you really got to find

337
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,719
what works for you and what works for me

338
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,639
was the plastic and then transplanting

339
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,200
into the fabric as they get

340
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,519
older or the transplant into flower that

341
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,200
that sort of stage so um that works best

342
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,879
for me but i've seen a lot of people in

343
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
the caribbean where i'm from growing

344
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,078
like in um buckets they use like very

345
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,480
creative stuff you know um wheelbarrows

346
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,879
they're a lot of creative stuff because

347
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,720
it's not always ideal for them to go out

348
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,399
and you know spend money on the plastic

349
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,079
parts and even those plastic parts can

350
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,078
be pretty expensive you know back in the

351
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:38,638
caribbean so um a lot of ingenious ideas

352
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,399
have been seen on um on my facebook

353
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,639
group i've got a facebook group where i

354
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,799
post a lot of uh stuff that i can't thc

355
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,560
channel so i've seen a lot of girls out

356
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,958
there just being so creative and you

357
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,719
know mad love to him but for me i like

358
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,879
the plastic parts when i start off and

359
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,399
then go on to the fabric ones

360
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,480
i was gonna say there are a lot of

361
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,399
creative ways out there and a lot of

362
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,079
people are using the five gallon buckets

363
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,519
that they get from like lowe's or home

364
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:02,638
depot those are pretty cheap i think

365
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,720
like two three bucks or something like

366
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,600
that for those containers i've seen

367
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,759
people use like peanut butter jars and

368
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,839
like the like large tubs of peanut

369
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,439
butter and like turning that into grill

370
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,120
pots or just like large plastic

371
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,040
containers you know from food and stuff

372
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,879
like that so like there are ways to go

373
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,240
about it uh one thing is just going to

374
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,919
be aware of is that you don't want light

375
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,399
to be able to penetrate through it that

376
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,679
could potentially lead to algae growth

377
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,839
of course if you see an algae growth

378
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,359
then that's one of the signs of

379
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,760
over watering you know too much water in

380
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
the medium as well but algae does grow

381
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,319
off

382
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,600
the light there and then as far as one

383
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,879
other thing i want to mention is those

384
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,879
air pots

385
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,559
i don't know how much they cost but like

386
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,120
i'm thinking if you're using like your

387
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,399
native soil which can be somewhat

388
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,240
compact

389
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,839
um not a lot of people add like perlite

390
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,320
a lava rock or something like that to

391
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,199
add in aeration because these plants

392
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,560
don't grow real well in a compact medium

393
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:56,639
at least the medicinal varieties that

394
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,159
were that we're referring to so maybe

395
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,839
having those air pots would probably be

396
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,919
beneficial to make sure that there is

397
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,440
air getting to the root zone um you know

398
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,039
and so it's not choking up the roots and

399
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,440
stuff like that so i forgot to mention

400
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,879
that one 100 i would agree with you on

401
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,720
that and just to add to that point

402
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,039
actually when i'm actually using native

403
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,879
soil outdoors i would actually add a

404
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,278
hefty amount of perlite because that

405
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,320
perlite sort of like goes to your point

406
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,480
it helps to um add oxygen to the roots

407
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,639
it has to break up that really thick

408
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,120
soil because i've actually grown in like

409
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,759
some native soil on its own nothing

410
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,240
added it was literally just like dirt

411
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,399
and when it got wet it became like mud

412
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,039
so the roots had a really tough time

413
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,879
penetrating through that mud and really

414
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,639
establishing themselves so it just goes

415
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,639
to show that by having the perlite and

416
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,560
creating those little pockets it really

417
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,480
does help you know the root system the

418
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,518
plant and the overall health you know so

419
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,680
i second that honestly yeah and then you

420
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,278
mentioned the amendments as well you

421
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,919
touched upon them but i'd like to get

422
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,679
just a little bit deeper into them so

423
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,198
for the vegetation stage what are you

424
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,359
using for amendments and like when are

425
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,519
you top dressing if you maybe let us

426
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,839
know what ratios you're using if you

427
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,320
know of and then also for flowering same

428
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,480
deal okay so recently i've got into like

429
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,800
using the gaia green amendments uh when

430
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,600
it comes to top dressing so initially

431
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,278
i'll use my um i'll just go for a very

432
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,959
basic potting mix since i'm up here in

433
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,480
colorado i've just gone to walmart and

434
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,479
got like a cheap three dollar bag of

435
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,399
potting mix and i'll try to amend that

436
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,000
myself as best as i could with like um

437
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,000
bad guano

438
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,360
bone meal blood meal worm castings um

439
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,360
a few other things i'm just sort of

440
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,440
missing right now but that will usually

441
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,278
help me out for the first few weeks of

442
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,079
the plant's life you know sometimes i

443
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,159
might add some kelp in there as well and

444
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:45,679
that really does help a lot but that

445
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,519
helps me out for the first few weeks of

446
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,838
the plant's life when it comes down to

447
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,278
um the flowering stage when it starts to

448
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,680
need a lot of the

449
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,120
p and k ratios you know the phosphorus

450
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,519
and the um

451
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,159
potassium and that sort of stuff then i

452
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,320
sort of need a bit more nutrients the

453
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,759
plant starts out so give show me science

454
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,600
that it's really hungry and it needs

455
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,919
some more food so at that point then

456
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,560
i'll start to like um top dress with the

457
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,078
guy green but because uh the guy green

458
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,919
takes a little while for it to actually

459
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,758
work into the soil for it to break down

460
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,240
for the plant to absorb it what i'll

461
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,399
start to do is two weeks or so before i

462
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,240
actually flip the flower i will top

463
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,679
dress because i know that i'm going to

464
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,919
flip the flower within the next two

465
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,000
weeks so i'll give the chance the plant

466
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,759
a chance to break down everything absorb

467
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,679
it through the roots and that way you

468
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,440
know i'm sort of ahead of the game

469
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,599
because it's always harder to recover

470
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,199
from a deficiency than to deal with that

471
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,800
up front you know so that's just

472
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,278
something that i've learned always

473
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,799
always harder to like recover than to

474
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,360
deal with it up front

475
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,719
um but when it comes to like just the

476
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,680
overall

477
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,600
my overall feeding stage cycle and stuff

478
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,000
what i would say is that

479
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,240
the natural side of things has worked

480
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,559
fantastic for me i haven't really had

481
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,680
any signs of over feeding or any signs

482
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,599
of burning

483
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,318
if there are issues with slight

484
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,360
deficiencies sometimes i may just use

485
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,759
like

486
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,078
a little nutrient booster and maybe

487
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,919
liquid nutrients like there's liquid

488
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,279
organic nutrients such as kelp like i

489
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,520
mentioned before

490
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,599
that's a fantastic thing that i use i

491
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,599
love it i use it all the time i'll mix

492
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,399
that up and i will just you know add it

493
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:25,038
to my water and water it in so that sort

494
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,120
of helps the microbes it doesn't um

495
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,839
attack the microbes or anything but i

496
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,399
found that it has great results for me

497
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,720
okay so there's your approach with soil

498
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,480
the containers nutrients throughout the

499
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,480
life cycle one thing i did want to

500
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,400
mention is that you know a lot of people

501
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,240
seem to be taking the natural farming

502
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,759
approach and that is the way you can

503
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,720
save money you know learning and

504
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,319
learning k f jadam which we're not going

505
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,400
to get into on this episode but there

506
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,879
have been uh like two or three episodes

507
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,640
in the past here on garden talk with uh

508
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,240
with some people that have a lot of good

509
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,120
knowledge in jadam and knf in particular

510
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,160
and it's easy to save money that way you

511
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,000
know what i mean because you're actually

512
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,080
going out into the woods

513
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,720
and uh getting your own indigenous

514
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,558
microorganisms for example uh in your

515
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,440
own you're creating your own fermented

516
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,359
plant juice and your own fermented fruit

517
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,679
juice as well so there's like so many

518
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,038
different things you can do

519
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,120
and those ways you can actually save

520
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,720
money because you can use things that

521
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,239
you probably have laying around that you

522
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,120
could you don't have to go and spend

523
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,880
money on so 100 and then there's also

524
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,558
composting right i mean that's a whole

525
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,520
other avenue we could talk about is

526
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:35,759
people who are composting their waste

527
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,359
and turning that into

528
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,359
things that they can put that they can

529
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:43,439
toss dress into their medium and have

530
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:45,279
usable fertilizer through compost right

531
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,840
and of course the

532
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:50,319
microorganisms the beneficials so i

533
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,480
don't know if you compost at all

534
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,519
or not yet

535
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,319
um

536
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,558
i've composted like a few times but like

537
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,079
in my experience it just becomes so

538
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:01,599
smelly and

539
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,038
it can like

540
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,839
just really get to you and like

541
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:08,480
especially my small small crib like the

542
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:11,599
grow room is pretty close to like where

543
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,919
my studio was um so just to have to like

544
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,558
inhale that all the time was a bit rough

545
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,480
um but that said it was a fantastic way

546
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,160
to you know inoculate the microbes just

547
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,919
to get the microbes going in the soil

548
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,120
just to feed that plant some organic

549
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,320
stuff because like you said a lot of

550
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,159
stuff that you're going to throw away

551
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,879
anyway you can use that stuff to feed

552
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,600
your plant once you understand the npk

553
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,840
values and npk ratios what the plant

554
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,399
needs and when it needs it you can like

555
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,599
really dial in on your feeding schedule

556
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,559
what you're feeding the plant you

557
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,918
realize like okay i don't actually need

558
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,759
all these

559
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,759
fancy bottles of

560
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,679
nutrients i don't need 37 bottles of

561
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,240
nutrients to feed my plant

562
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,240
in reality during the flower the veg

563
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,079
stage they like a lot of nitrogen they

564
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,558
like a lot of micronutrients as well you

565
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,319
know the calcium magnesium that sort of

566
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,000
stuff when you go on to flour you want

567
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,558
to give them a lot more of the night the

568
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,079
potassium the phosphorus that sort of

569
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:05,599
stuff once you get an understanding of

570
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,759
that and where you can derive those

571
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,839
natural substances from you can feed it

572
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,679
to your plant through the soil like it

573
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,599
may take a longer time to break down

574
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,679
depending on how you feed it that's why

575
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,759
composting is so important even like

576
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,840
compost teas are a great way to get it

577
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,679
to the plant quickly i've brewed a lot

578
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,759
of compost teas and it's like a

579
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,000
fantastic pick-me-up for the plant i use

580
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,879
it quite often but again the smell is

581
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,200
horrific sometimes so um it all really

582
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,760
depends on when you want to do it and

583
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,360
how you decide to do it you know

584
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,440
that's what i would say it all depends

585
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,839
on how and when you do it yeah i

586
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,240
currently have a verma compost bin so

587
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:45,519
i've got the worms in there i have

588
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,480
european night crawlers and red wigglers

589
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,200
in there

590
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,759
and uh it's about seven months in

591
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,919
so um still haven't actually taken any

592
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,440
out and tried to top dress plants yet

593
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,520
still kind of feel like i'm seeing some

594
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,840
breakdown that needs to happen now it

595
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,359
was just winter time so it slows down

596
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,839
all the activity slows down the

597
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,599
breakdown slows down and all that stuff

598
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,759
but for in my experience

599
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,639
it doesn't really get smelly unless you

600
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,000
have that imbalance of carbon to

601
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,320
nitrogen

602
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,798
or if it's like too wet in there it can

603
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,879
attract mites and you have no population

604
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,038
of mites which i went through

605
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,039
and so i i think it's like a balancing

606
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,960
game i'm still trying to figure it out

607
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:25,839
i could still consider myself a beginner

608
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,400
at this point when it comes to

609
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,480
vermicomposting but it's fun it's fun to

610
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,000
learn and and just knowing that hey

611
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,038
maybe another six months down the road

612
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,480
i'll be able to take compost from there

613
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,240
top dress my plants and i won't even

614
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,279
defeat any nutrients at all you know and

615
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,880
i mean this is all waste that i've

616
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,359
compost you know turned into compost

617
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,960
through that there's also bokashi

618
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,918
composting which i'm just learning about

619
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,759
now

620
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,280
which seems to be

621
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,440
a little bit better

622
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,200
in various ways

623
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,480
and i won't get into that because i'm

624
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,159
still learning but there's a book called

625
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,000
bokashi composting and that's what i'm

626
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,760
reading right now to learn

627
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
and you can use like additional scraps

628
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:07,359
that you can't put in your traditional

629
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,559
compost pile vermicompost so i'm going

630
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,798
to start a bokashi bin soon

631
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,558
do some bokashi composting and uh no

632
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,599
just hope for the best try it out should

633
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:17,519
be fun

634
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,199
that's awesome dude um i think what you

635
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,119
said actually about the humidity as well

636
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,120
is a completely

637
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,119
that's an awesome point dude because

638
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,439
back in trinidad and tobago the humidity

639
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,839
was unreal it was so humid so that was a

640
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,519
big part of like causing a lot of

641
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,439
the imbalance that you referred to you

642
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,798
know so it was very difficult and i

643
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,279
guess that's one of the uphill

644
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,359
challenges that i faced um so great

645
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,960
point great point chris let's get deeper

646
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,359
into environment a little bit you know

647
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,640
let's start with lighting first and then

648
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,279
we'll get into like temperature and

649
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,720
humidity and co2 all that stuff so

650
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,279
lighting

651
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,440
how do you suggest going about lighting

652
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:56,079
when you're on a budget

653
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,759
um when you're on a budget lighting can

654
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,319
be a bit tricky especially for if you're

655
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,400
going on indoors because um a lot of

656
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,200
growers want the best lights and lights

657
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,280
can be pretty expensive but the truth is

658
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,440
you don't always need the best lights

659
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,798
brand name lights there are a few things

660
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,400
actually that you may want to look for

661
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:13,519
when you're buying a light like the

662
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,960
spectrum

663
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,480
um because you want to probably stay

664
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,240
away from some of the older tech

665
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,200
depending on your grow setup it can get

666
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,000
a little bit hotter on the hids leds

667
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,679
have turned out to be you know awesome

668
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,159
lights nowadays so i would highly

669
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,840
recommend the leds so there are a lot of

670
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,600
things that you can zone in when you

671
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,119
look for but mainly i would suggest that

672
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,199
growers look for the full spectrum

673
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,199
lights uh stay away from the older

674
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,360
attacks such as the blur pro lights

675
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,000
those lights are they're okay but you

676
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,678
know we we've kind of gone past that now

677
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,359
um so i really recommend the full

678
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,679
spectrum i recommend one with an

679
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,759
external dimmer that really does help

680
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,919
you when you're like just want to

681
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,000
increase and decrease the brightness

682
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,679
one which can be adjusted as well so

683
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,119
those are the main characteristics that

684
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,519
you look for and a lot of the flight

685
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,119
companies offer those characteristics

686
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,278
and the great thing is that a lot of the

687
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:06,158
light companies also offer like budget

688
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:08,960
friendly lights so they'll have the

689
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,120
the cheapest version or the most cost

690
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,000
effective version for the um beginner

691
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:16,399
grower and a lot of those will you know

692
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,640
have those bases covered so if you were

693
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,640
to get one of those you can always get

694
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,880
another one later on you can manipulate

695
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,038
the lights you can use the light bleed

696
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,840
to your um your benefit

697
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,519
rather than having one huge light so

698
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,038
when it comes to that i would suggest

699
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,240
that um those are the main things to

700
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:33,759
look for you want to look for full

701
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,759
spectrum you want something that runs

702
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,720
cool something that's not too heavy

703
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,038
something that does not run too hot and

704
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,120
something that is full spectrum and has

705
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,720
the external dimmer those are the main

706
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,000
things that i look for when buying a

707
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,319
light

708
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,480
and again different lights for different

709
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,798
stages of plant growth right so if you

710
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,798
have a seedling or you have a young

711
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:58,079
plant and veg or maybe even a cloning

712
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:01,679
station you don't want to have a huge

713
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,519
light let let's say a mars hydro fc 6500

714
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,759
which is what i have downstairs that

715
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,639
will that definitely fry your stuff

716
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:11,200
right um so a smaller one is

717
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,038
will will work great so different light

718
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,200
for different plant stages of growth

719
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,519
depending on your setup i know some

720
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,840
folks who being on a budget they only

721
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,240
can get one light and they might choose

722
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,918
that mars light uh you know being able

723
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,720
to dip it down like you said i think is

724
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,400
key

725
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,759
you know you might be wasting light for

726
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,759
a period of time while the plants are

727
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,440
seedlings but i i think they can grow

728
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,400
into it but some of the man some of

729
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,679
these

730
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,840
prices of lights are insane now there

731
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,278
are a lot more budget-friendly options

732
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,240
you know there's lots of people out

733
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,679
there that are saying that the prices

734
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,519
are going to come down over the years

735
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,000
you know as is more competition

736
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,599
as production gets cheaper

737
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,200
prices should come down over the years

738
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:52,079
they have been for the past five plus

739
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,759
years

740
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,278
they have been coming down more and more

741
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,919
and more but yeah that initial

742
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,519
investment can certainly be painful

743
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,320
there are some blurple lights out there

744
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,558
from my experience that do put out

745
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,319
enough photons for

746
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,639
plant growth and actually put out

747
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,678
equivalent to some of these top lights

748
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,200
out there

749
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,679
but like you mentioned their older

750
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,278
technology the spectrum they've got the

751
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,640
heavy on the blue and the red so it

752
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,038
looks purple

753
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,400
and some people say that the morphology

754
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:24,879
of the plant is impacted from that

755
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,320
also with the active cooling versus

756
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,080
passive right with the active cooling

757
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,720
you have the fans on there it's using up

758
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,798
more wattage that's a failure point you

759
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,480
know if your fan breaks on it that you

760
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,079
know do the cooling's

761
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,400
screwed on that so you might want to

762
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,519
consider a passive cooling light for

763
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,840
example

764
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,759
but yeah there is a lot to talk about

765
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,119
when it comes to lighting and what to

766
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,960
look for

767
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,278
i think it really comes down to getting

768
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,720
the right amount of light because

769
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:54,480
these medicinal plants in particular

770
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,640
they're heavy on the lake they can take

771
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,640
a lot of light is what i'm trying to say

772
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,159
and so some of these grow lights you see

773
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,679
on amazon and stuff like maybe some

774
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,440
small bulb maybe they're 20 30 40 bucks

775
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,480
it's not going to be enough really to

776
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,919
grow anything worthwhile in my opinion

777
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,880
it just doesn't put out the photons

778
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,960
needed for good growth so

779
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,559
something to be careful of another topic

780
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,319
there that

781
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,639
there has been multiple people on that

782
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:22,158
podcast that has talked about

783
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,080
there's one in particular it says what

784
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,760
to look for in a grow light

785
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,678
search that on youtube

786
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:31,519
and then also i'll grow like buyers

787
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:34,399
guide 2021 with chilled led that was a

788
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,918
great episode that uh that'll help those

789
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:37,599
folks that are looking to buy a girl

790
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,960
like kind of what to look for because

791
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:40,719
there is there's so many different

792
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,919
things that you can freaking look at on

793
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,919
these grow lights and it gets

794
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,600
overwhelming because there's so much to

795
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,600
learn and you don't know what to focus

796
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:51,839
on and and so on and so forth so

797
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,558
now how about uh environment you said

798
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,839
it's difficult for humidity i think you

799
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:57,839
had mentioned offline that it's

800
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,359
difficult for temperature as well how do

801
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,359
you control like temperature and

802
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,959
humidity and what do you typically aim

803
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,278
for on those things

804
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,440
okay uh well those two things were

805
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,278
really difficult to manage um as a

806
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,798
caribbean girl growing in the caribbean

807
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,720
it was really difficult to manage those

808
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,119
things because it's extremely hot and

809
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,600
it's extremely humid so especially if

810
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:20,000
you're growing indoors um in a grow tent

811
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,558
you'll definitely need a carbon filter

812
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,480
and an exhaust fan that helps to manage

813
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,519
uh the air circulation inside of the

814
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,519
grow tent i actually had to add some

815
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,798
standing oscillating fans just to help

816
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,879
with that um

817
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,879
air air circulation and air movement in

818
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,039
there as well but

819
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,000
sometimes that just blows around hot air

820
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:42,240
right so thankfully i had an ac unit

821
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,079
installed in the uh in the bedroom i had

822
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,640
to run that 24 7. just to counteract the

823
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,879
lights um the the heat coming off of the

824
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,919
lights the the heat from the environment

825
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,039
in general um so i ran that 24 7. my

826
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,799
bill was

827
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,319
amazingly

828
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,158
high

829
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,879
and aside from that actually i had to

830
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,840
run a dehumidifier so i had one of those

831
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,000
big dehumidifiers like um what mr

832
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,599
canucks grows and i hooked that up to a

833
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,919
drain hose and had that draining

834
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:14,558
directly outside so that actually helped

835
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,200
me to get my humidity down to around the

836
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:19,200
50s the 40s the 50s especially during

837
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,200
flower that was the sort of range that i

838
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,200
would look for just to avoid any butt

839
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,240
rot i tried not to go too much lower

840
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,679
than that

841
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,720
because i didn't want to run into any

842
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,278
issues but that said um when you're

843
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,440
using a dehumidifier and an ac unit in

844
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,599
your main grow room um

845
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,519
at the same time you kind of run into

846
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,038
issues if you're trying to clone or if

847
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,200
you're trying to run seedlings right

848
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,038
because that's sort of the other end of

849
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,880
the spectrum as to what seedlings like

850
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:47,200
seedlings like more humidity seedlings

851
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,760
like more moisture so what i did is i

852
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,558
found myself having to get a mini

853
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:55,440
humidifier and i have to put that into a

854
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,038
separate little seedling tent so it was

855
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,159
really difficult just sort of like

856
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,158
dialing in um all the the temperature

857
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,399
the humidity and all those sort of

858
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,399
environmental factors just because of

859
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,000
where i was living and a lot of growers

860
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,079
probably find themselves in that same

861
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,319
sort of predicament but once you get

862
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,240
like the right pieces of equipment you

863
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,558
can really help to counteract and set

864
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,519
that off so in terms of humidity when i

865
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,839
was in flower um sorry when i was in

866
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:25,440
seedling stage or veg i would aim for

867
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:29,599
like um 75 percent all the way down to

868
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,759
maybe 65 maybe 60. if i was in veg then

869
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,918
maybe 60 to 50

870
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:36,158
and flower i would probably try to go

871
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,080
down to 50 to 40. so somewhere around

872
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,399
there um and i did a lot of my

873
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,319
measurements of temperatures in degrees

874
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,199
celsius that's just because of where i'm

875
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:47,439
from but typically the environment the

876
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,480
temperature outside will be about 35

877
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,278
degrees

878
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,200
so it can get pretty warm in indoors it

879
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:56,159
can get pretty warm as well but i would

880
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,200
aim for like around the 26 degrees 23

881
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,960
degrees um sort of range that didn't

882
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,200
always happen but that's what i would

883
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,919
typically aim for and if current were to

884
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,919
go or electricity were to go um trouble

885
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,320
man trouble honestly

886
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,000
so yeah that's that's pretty that that's

887
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,599
the difficulty of you know growing out

888
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,599
in the caribbean trying to get

889
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,319
everything set up in a for a home grower

890
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,158
anyway so yeah just about every area it

891
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,720
can be difficult to control temperature

892
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,039
and humidity no what about co2 were you

893
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,000
doing anything for that at all or just

894
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:30,640
doing the normal co2 levels

895
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,200
normal co2 levels i didn't uh supplement

896
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,840
any co2 like there were so many pieces

897
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,519
of equipment already in my setup that um

898
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,678
just managing another one just seemed

899
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,200
like a daunting task you know so i had

900
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,440
like like i said a humidifier a

901
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,640
dehumidifier an ac unit grow light grow

902
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,880
tank fans um the works it was really

903
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,799
just i just didn't think that adding co2

904
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,880
would have done too much more for me at

905
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,599
that point you know so i didn't get into

906
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,120
that too much honestly how about water

907
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,439
what are you using what were you using

908
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:01,678
for water when you were out there

909
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,600
boy i mean how was the local tap water

910
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,360
did you have to get filtered were you

911
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,319
catching rain water what were you doing

912
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:08,639
for that

913
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,038
great question actually

914
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,038
um rainwater actually worked great

915
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,119
surprisingly that natural rainwater out

916
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,119
there worked fantastic so i used that

917
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,558
quite often but for those times that i

918
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,879
couldn't get a lot of water or couldn't

919
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:23,278
get enough i would typically just fill

920
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,278
it up from my tap i ph um in the

921
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:26,880
early stages so i know what the ph was

922
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,880
coming out of my tap and i just

923
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,480
occasionally randomly test it just to

924
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,000
make sure that it's all at that level

925
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,000
and once it's at that level and i

926
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,480
realized that okay the ph doesn't

927
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,640
actually move much i can just water uh

928
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,319
use the water from my tap but just to be

929
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,799
safe i'll actually use the water for my

930
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,038
tap fill up a few gallon buckets and i

931
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:47,359
would let's set that down for a few days

932
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,720
and let that uh stale that's what we

933
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,278
call it you know just let the water

934
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,038
stale and just let all those um heavy

935
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:55,038
metals or any chlorine and that sort of

936
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,519
stuff sort of neutralize and settle or

937
00:32:55,038 --> 00:33:00,240
whatever and um that that's all i would

938
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,159
do so i wouldn't get too um complicated

939
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,399
with the watering process simply because

940
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,559
i knew that the ph of the water coming

941
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:08,398
out was acceptable for my plants were

942
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,558
you actually adjusting the ph like did

943
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:13,119
you have a ph beater you had access to a

944
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,398
ph meter or using those drops yeah

945
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,639
yeah

946
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,798
no i used a ph meter so i actually had

947
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,240
one of the cheap amazon ones um and i

948
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,079
started off with that and then i got

949
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,159
like a blue lab on just to like make

950
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,480
sure that like the cheap one wasn't

951
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,480
actually setting me up or anything

952
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,720
but it came out you know the similar

953
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,759
reading so i realized like okay this is

954
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,278
fine um it was usually around seven or

955
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:36,398
seven point something something around

956
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:38,319
there

957
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:41,759
and it was okay for me so i worked with

958
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:44,720
that and um yeah so how would you go

959
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,319
about determining when to water um

960
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,399
fantastic question because that's

961
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,079
something that stumps a lot of beginner

962
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:51,839
growers and i see you talk about that a

963
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,240
lot on your channel like over watering

964
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:57,439
is a huge problem among beginner growers

965
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,919
um yes guys plants need water but

966
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,960
water can also drown the root system so

967
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,559
for me i try not to over saturate i find

968
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,399
that less is more

969
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:08,639
if the plant is

970
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,638
lacking water it tends to dry up it

971
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,039
tends to get really soft to the touch

972
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:17,039
and you can tell so for me for watering

973
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:19,119
i like to um wait until the plant is

974
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,878
show signs of needing watering i could

975
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,559
tell i touched the leaves quite often to

976
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,398
tell like you know if the leaves are

977
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,639
full of uh if the leaves if the plant

978
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,398
has been recently watered then the

979
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,720
leaves tend to be really thick and

980
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:32,398
swollen like almost swollen but then if

981
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,118
they're not like you can like fold them

982
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,878
over they're very malleable

983
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,960
you can actually literally feel it so i

984
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,719
get like really in there with my plants

985
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,639
i touch them i feel them i lift up the

986
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,039
pot that's another way that you can tell

987
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,159
how heavy it is um how much water is in

988
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,000
there

989
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,398
so that's typically what i'll do and

990
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,398
when i actually go to watering i

991
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,398
try the easiest method possible i just

992
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:56,719
fill up a bucket and dump a bunch of

993
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:59,039
water over there and let that drink you

994
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,519
know i just let it settle down in there

995
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,440
um usually i don't see any runoff so i

996
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:05,920
try not to water with runoff because i

997
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,838
don't um one and here enough i just

998
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,760
don't want any runoff i don't want um

999
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,199
any over saturation at the bottom of the

1000
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,520
plant pot either

1001
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,358
i have seen instances where water can

1002
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:17,039
just settle down there even though

1003
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,358
you've got like holes and stuff in the

1004
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,519
bottom of the pot so i try to avoid that

1005
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:24,239
and for me less is more the plants can

1006
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,559
always recover quickly from um or easier

1007
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,239
rather from over underwatering as

1008
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,000
opposed to over watering over watering

1009
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,479
can be fatal you know if you underwater

1010
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,280
your plants you water them and they'll

1011
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,240
be okay if you over water them then

1012
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,400
may the god be with you

1013
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:41,919
now what about plant training techniques

1014
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,519
are you doing any of those at all

1015
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,039
throughout the grow

1016
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,639
yeah i've actually done quite a few

1017
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:49,759
plant training techniques my favorite

1018
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:52,319
method is lst i like to couple that with

1019
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,640
topping so once the plant reaches about

1020
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,200
three or four nodes around there i will

1021
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,118
do the first initial topping i don't get

1022
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:02,719
too technical with it i really just get

1023
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,880
in there pinch it off and watch it grow

1024
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,719
i use these little lst clips which i

1025
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,640
mentioned earlier for those who may not

1026
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,959
be able to see it's simply just a little

1027
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,598
clip which allows you to bend uh the

1028
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,000
branch of your plant without breaking it

1029
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,640
and in so doing you can expose lower bud

1030
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,960
sites to light and so forth and that is

1031
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,879
just a really great way to increase

1032
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,599
flowers increase yield increase health

1033
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,320
and potential the plant um you'll be

1034
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,240
you'll be happy with it so for me lst is

1035
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,200
a great way to you know manipulate the

1036
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,279
plant and speaking of training lst is

1037
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:37,519
also a great way that i found to get

1038
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,640
into the bonsai experimenting side of

1039
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,079
things you know

1040
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:43,358
but that's probably a whole different

1041
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,359
episode but um yeah lsd for me and

1042
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:46,880
topping is the way to go okay and then

1043
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,440
what about like are you doing any super

1044
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:54,160
cropping at all or filming

1045
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:56,960
or now yeah um i do fem um if i miss

1046
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:59,838
when i top yeah i accidentally filmed

1047
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,079
in terms of the super cropping i don't

1048
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:03,679
go out of my way to do it often unless i

1049
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,200
really have to so like if one of the

1050
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,679
branches are reaching too close to the

1051
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:10,078
light or um they're just getting too

1052
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,159
tall during the pre-flower stretch then

1053
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,240
yeah i'll try to super crop it and stuff

1054
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,239
but it's not it's not like my favorite

1055
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,319
approach to doing things i'm not

1056
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:20,319
necessarily sure why because i've done

1057
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,200
it i've done videos on it and i've had

1058
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,160
great results with it but i'm just not

1059
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,838
the hugest of fans i prefer the lst um

1060
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:30,559
because to me i can achieve the same

1061
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:32,719
results using lst and just like one or

1062
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,880
two tops you know i try not to go too

1063
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:38,000
crazy with the topping either

1064
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,358
relating budget into this

1065
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,920
i feel like there's a lot of people out

1066
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,838
there that you know that are on a budget

1067
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,358
they have smaller spaces

1068
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:47,440
and that's why i want to talk about

1069
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:49,519
training is because that does help keep

1070
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,679
your plants confined to a small space if

1071
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:53,280
that's what you're working with and so

1072
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:55,039
i'm glad you're talking about lst and

1073
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,800
some of the training techniques you do

1074
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,639
because it can be helpful for those that

1075
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,160
are in a smaller space for example

1076
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,960
definitely

1077
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:05,838
now are you doing anything to prevent

1078
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,838
pests at all oh when it comes to pests

1079
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:10,000
man i've i've ran into some serious

1080
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:13,039
issues um growing out in the caribbean a

1081
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
lot of a lot of pests out there um

1082
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:18,480
i ran into like the aphids the spider

1083
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,639
mites mites in general

1084
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,559
a bunch of different stuff right so i

1085
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:25,358
found that prevention is a lot better

1086
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:27,679
than cure and having like an ipm routine

1087
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:30,239
an integrated pest management routine is

1088
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:32,799
really key so typically what i'll try to

1089
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,799
do is on occasion i will just spray down

1090
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,560
the the grow room firstly i'll keep it

1091
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,880
extremely clean so i'll spray down the

1092
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:40,719
grow room with like rubbing alcohol i'll

1093
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,480
keep the tents clean and so forth after

1094
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:45,519
every grow i'll reset

1095
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,920
um aside from that on a weekly or

1096
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:49,920
bi-weekly basis i will just do like a

1097
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,440
little spray that i'll spray onto the

1098
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,039
leaves and that will have like

1099
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,679
peppermint um neem oil just some of the

1100
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,838
very organic stuff but when i did run

1101
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,759
into issues back in the caribbean i

1102
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:04,159
don't recommend this to anyone but i did

1103
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,760
have to use some of those uh more heavy

1104
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:07,759
heavy duty style

1105
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,480
insecticides on the plants just to get

1106
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,520
rid of the infestations that i had and

1107
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,280
it's not recommended but it did work but

1108
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:18,159
you've got to be very very careful with

1109
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,240
it man so definitely to avoid getting to

1110
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:23,039
that point i'll recommend to anyone have

1111
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:24,959
an integrated pass management system

1112
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,679
which you use because that can save you

1113
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,199
like a lot of headache in the long run

1114
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:30,719
there's a lot of natural stuff that you

1115
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,118
can use like i mentioned the peppermint

1116
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,358
extract um even rosemary extract stuff

1117
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,200
like that you can use that and mix it up

1118
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,880
make your own mix and you should be good

1119
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,279
to go apply it like

1120
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,200
every two weeks or so just to avoid any

1121
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,119
issues guys okay

1122
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:46,799
and yeah that's that's what i would say

1123
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,480
for my ipm

1124
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,560
i know there's a lot of people that use

1125
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,838
essential oils they have diffusers right

1126
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,039
so they have essential oils going

1127
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:56,559
throughout their house and stuff like

1128
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:59,279
that you can actually use those oils

1129
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,880
right as an ipm right you you would

1130
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,519
dilute it you'd have like a lot of

1131
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,519
people use dish soap as a surfactant but

1132
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,358
water a little bit of dish soap use

1133
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,480
about a teaspoon of dish soap and then

1134
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:12,639
some drops of the essential oil and then

1135
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,800
you mix that all up and then spray it on

1136
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,719
your plants and that's an easy way a

1137
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,839
cheap way if you haven't already have it

1138
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:21,759
on hand it can be a cheap way to help

1139
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,480
prevent pests from invading your grow

1140
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,640
space it deters pests really it's uh

1141
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,519
pests don't like to come close to your

1142
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,039
plants on that avenue so yeah there's

1143
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,880
something there dude

1144
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,199
so taking a step back and and just

1145
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,960
talking about like general advice like i

1146
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,439
mentioned that there's a lot of people

1147
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,800
out there that are on a budget you know

1148
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,119
what i mean maybe they're either a

1149
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,200
beginner just kind of getting into it or

1150
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,640
they're somebody who has intermediate or

1151
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:47,439
advanced knowledge and they already have

1152
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:50,239
their

1153
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,200
own setup going budget-friendly setup

1154
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,759
jeffy general advice for those

1155
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,679
at any level that are trying to do

1156
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,800
things on a budget with limited

1157
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:03,440
resources yeah i would definitely say um

1158
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,160
keep it simple keep it very simple a lot

1159
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,159
of times um guys remember that plants

1160
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,559
have been growing for millenniums

1161
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:11,679
without our intervention you know so

1162
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:13,679
there are a lot of things that you can

1163
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,679
do just to mimic the natural environment

1164
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,440
that's not necessarily the most

1165
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,440
expensive way of doing things so try to

1166
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,440
keep things simple as possible you know

1167
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,240
there are ways that you can uh use

1168
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,800
natural substitutes instead of

1169
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:28,479
the bottle stuff you can use um

1170
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,960
even when it comes to like setting up a

1171
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,960
grow tent you can build your own um

1172
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,599
important grow tents to the caribbean is

1173
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,318
super costly so i actually built my own

1174
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,400
out of like pvc and roofing insulation

1175
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,800
so like these are great ways to get a

1176
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,838
budget stanley fed up um get things

1177
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,000
running um on a budget and really just

1178
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:50,078
maximize your plant's potential you know

1179
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,119
so that's one suggestion that i would

1180
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:56,240
have if you can like hack a lot of your

1181
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,640
grows then definitely try to do it

1182
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:01,598
you can lose like um the

1183
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:03,279
cake cake covers as humidity domes you

1184
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,119
may have one of those at home those

1185
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,480
things really come in handy uh there are

1186
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,160
a lot of things that you can just be

1187
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,880
creative with you can create your own

1188
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:13,118
plant labels from like yogurt containers

1189
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,440
um there's a lot of stuff a lot of stuff

1190
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,119
you can create your own pvc scrog using

1191
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,679
pvc frames

1192
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,680
and the screws and you know like uh

1193
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,759
twine and wire you can there's a bunch

1194
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:25,519
of stuff so guys really get creative

1195
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,520
think outside of the box it's not

1196
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,119
necessarily all about like spending

1197
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:30,960
loads of money to achieve a perfect

1198
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,519
setup simply because plants have been

1199
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,599
doing this for such a long time without

1200
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:37,838
our help so you just need to guide them

1201
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,920
along the way and you don't need plants

1202
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,639

1203
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,200
expensive uh piece of equipment over it

1204
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,879
or if you're using like a three by two

1205
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,960
frame that you built and made your own

1206
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,599
scrog net out of it just knows it's

1207
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,358
being trained right so think of it that

1208
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,039
way and um just try to think of the

1209
