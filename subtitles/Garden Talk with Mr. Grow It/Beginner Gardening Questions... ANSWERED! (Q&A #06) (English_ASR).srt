1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,240
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,638
know me my name is chris

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,519
aka mr growit and i'm back with another

4
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:13,039
q a video

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,559
this time around i decided to do

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,118
beginner questions

7
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,640
last week i did intermediate questions

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,559
next week i plan to do advanced

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,920
questions well maybe it might not be

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,640
next week it might be the week after

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,560
that

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,679
i still need to gather more advanced

13
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,599
questions for that

14
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,960
so if you actually have any questions

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,518
that are more on the advanced side of

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,880
things

17
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,719
leave them down in the comments section

18
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,359
below and maybe i will include them in

19
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,960
that video

20
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,479
but yeah a majority of my audience is

21
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,359
beginners and i get a lot of beginner

22
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,439
questions so

23
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,558
i figured i would dedicate this video to

24
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,679
you beginners out there

25
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,519
before we get into the video i just want

26
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,119
to give a quick shout out to our sponsor

27
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,719
for this episode

28
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,558
big thanks to spider farmer for

29
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,480
sponsoring this episode they recently

30
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,839
sent me their new led grow light

31
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:56,319
the sf7000 this thing looks pretty cool

32
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,960
i'm loving the color they use sealed

33
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,000
diodes

34
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,960
and an inventronix driver it pulls 650

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,600
watts from the wall

36
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,079
has an efficiency of 2.9 micromoles per

37
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,560
joule

38
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,599
and covers a 5 foot by 5 foot grow space

39
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,439
a full disclaimer

40
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,719
i haven't used this light this is just

41
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,359
me unboxing it

42
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,599
i'm currently using the sf-2000 and i've

43
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,438
used the sf-4000 in the past

44
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,039
but i do know several people who already

45
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,639
have the sf-7000

46
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
up and running in their gardens and

47
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,560
they're impressed with this so far

48
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,000
i will leave a link to the sf 7000 in

49
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,759
the description section below

50
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,519
feel free to click on that link to learn

51
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,478
more about it and i also have a coupon

52
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,519
code for you

53
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,438
use code mr growit5 for discount and

54
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,599
that code works on both amazon

55
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,078
and the spyderfarmer website it actually

56
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,399
works for all spider farmer products all

57
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,879
right

58
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,079
now let's get into the questions hey

59
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,039
chris just wondering is

60
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,519
5.8 ph fine for soil so far it's doing

61
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,200
fine

62
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,039
what's your thoughts plant seems to be

63
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,759
more compact and leaves are smaller than

64
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
my last grow

65
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,319
last was on 6.2 ph so 5.8 ph in soil

66
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,040
should be okay

67
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,519
now general range that you hear on a lot

68
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,920
of

69
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,718
websites and forums and everywhere is

70
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,079
going to say

71
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:08,318
first soil between 6.0 and 7.0

72
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,000
however a lot of these bags of soil

73
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,839
actually come in lower than that

74
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,759
um i personally use a fox farm ocean

75
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,239
forest soil that usually comes in at

76
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,679
like

77
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,319
5.5 5.4 ph and i usually have to water

78
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,439
in

79
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,439
at like 6.5 to 6.8 ph

80
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,598
and then slowly kind of drifts up over

81
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,000
time the plant's able to take it

82
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,598
the plant uptakes nutrients just fine

83
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,239
there there are some growers out there

84
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,479
that

85
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,840
say that the range instead of being 6.0

86
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,959
to 7.0 for soil

87
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,759
that it's actually 5.0 to 7.0 in soil

88
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,680
that's the kind of safe range however

89
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,439
at different ph levels there's going to

90
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,760
be different nutrient uptake

91
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,598
there are charts online that you can

92
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,399
google search as far as

93
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,919
nutrient uptake for plants ph levels

94
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,280
search something like that

95
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,679
and you'll see what i'm talking about

96
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,640
but yeah the plant should be fine at 5.8

97
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,239
ph

98
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,279
you may just want to water in at like

99
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,000
6.5 6.8 ph and then it should drift up

100
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,519
over time

101
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,280
what would happen if you grew a plant on

102
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,280
12 12 light cycle from

103
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,878
seed to harvest so i've done that before

104
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,400
actually i've done the

105
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:14,318
solo cup challenge i was at four or

106
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,640
five years ago now so basically that

107
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,359
challenge was to plant a seed in a solo

108
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,759
cup

109
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,280
immediately have it on 1212 light cycle

110
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,120
for the entire grill

111
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,199
so what happens is the plant is going to

112
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,680
spend some time in the vegetative stage

113
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,639
no matter what light cycle it's on so

114
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
basically for the first 21 days or so

115
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,919
it'll

116
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,200
just veg up then from there you'll start

117
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,958
to see

118
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,560
you know pistols or pollen sacks you'll

119
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,400
start to see signs of sex

120
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,598
it'll start pre-flowering and then

121
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
flowering from there

122
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,359
so yeah you can absolutely have it on a

123
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,919
12-12

124
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,519
the entire time if you want it's not

125
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,598
really recommended because the extra

126
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,000
hours if you put on an 18-6

127
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,438
instead you'd have more light it would

128
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,560
contribute to more energy that the

129
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:57,919
plant's receiving

130
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,080
and therefore more growth in the

131
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,719
vegetation stage so so yeah you can do

132
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,000
it but

133
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,919
you probably get better results if you

134
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,680
would a veg on an 18-6 light cycle

135
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,679
is it okay to add a single nutrient like

136
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,280
calmag if i'm seeing deficiency on a

137
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
water day or is it best to wait for a

138
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,680
feeding day

139
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,598
oh yeah you can absolutely feed in cal

140
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,200
mag on a watering day so

141
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,358
common practice which i think is what

142
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,199
he's going by is the water

143
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,959
feed water feed technique when growing

144
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,680
in soil so you'll feed nutrients one

145
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,759
time

146
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,800
once the soil dries out then you'll just

147
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,240
feed plain water

148
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,160
then once the soil dries out you'll go

149
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,000
back to feeding a nutrient solution

150
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,680
and so on and so forth yeah a lot of

151
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,759
growers what they'll do is they'll do

152
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,800
calmag every time even on their watering

153
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,560
days so that's

154
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,439
perfectly fine to do and then there are

155
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,879
some growers that just feed every time

156
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,719
so every time the medium dries out

157
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,680
they'll feed in but they'll feed in at a

158
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,120
lower dosage

159
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,199
so there are several different ways you

160
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,240
can go about it but yeah short answer is

161
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,478
yes you can feed

162
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,400
cal mag on one of your watering days can

163
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,918
i change nutrient companies in flour

164
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,439
i started with advanced nutrients but

165
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,918
now i am going to feed them

166
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,199
ramo nutrients you can but there's

167
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:00,799
definitely a little bit of risk there

168
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,319
you know ideally you have the proper

169
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,199
ratio of nutrients

170
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,959
throughout the entire life cycle and

171
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,000
these companies they have

172
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,000
those proper ratios on their feeding

173
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,918
schedule it's just a matter of

174
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,680
you know what dosage do you feed the

175
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,560
plants now if you're going from advanced

176
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
nutrients

177
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,000
they have their certain formula

178
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,320
switching to a different formula it

179
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,560
could potentially throw off that ratio

180
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,240
so it is kind of risky you know changing

181
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,600
nutrient companies midflower

182
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,439
however you can probably get away with

183
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,320
it a lot of these formulas are pretty

184
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,918
similar

185
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,519
there's just some small differences

186
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,038
there so yeah you could probably get

187
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,478
away with it it's just a little bit of a

188
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,399
risk there i'd love to know in the

189
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,240
comment section if anybody out there

190
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,758
has done it before maybe somebody out

191
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,199
there does do it and it's a common

192
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
practice for them to change

193
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,038
nutrient companies at some point in the

194
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,439
grow so comment down below if you do

195
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:48,959
that

196
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,360
how do you feel about always watering

197
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,799
coco coir with some nutrients or tea

198
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,479
i've read in a lot of different forms

199
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,120
that you should never water cocoa

200
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,159
with plain ph adjusted water until it's

201
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,519
time to flush

202
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,560
in my experience nutrients can

203
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:05,198
definitely build up in coco coir

204
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,000
you know me growing in particular there

205
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,680
have been times where

206
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,279
nutrients have built up to the point

207
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,519
where i did have to do

208
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,119
a watering in order to allow the plant

209
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,959
to eat up those nutrients that were

210
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,800
built up in the medium and sometimes i

211
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,599
had to do a couple watering days in

212
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,319
order to

213
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,199
reduce that ppm now coir is an inert

214
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,360
medium

215
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,199
that means there are no nutrients in the

216
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,680
medium so a lot of growers will

217
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,879
feed in every single time but again in

218
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,439
my experience

219
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,680
nutrients can build up and adding a

220
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,000
watering day in there once in a while in

221
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,918
order

222
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,918
to reduce the nutrients in the medium is

223
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,159
just fine some would argue that even on

224
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,478
those days we don't feed base nutrients

225
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,479
you should be feeding in calmag calcium

226
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,399
and magnesium are common deficiencies

227
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,159
when growing in coca-cola so

228
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,000
a lot of girls will swear by feeding

229
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,240
calmac every single time

230
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,680
now as far as reading things on forums

231
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,240
just be careful there

232
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,840
especially with older threads every time

233
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,519
i look back at some of the older threads

234
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,239
i'm talking like from 10

235
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,598
years ago 15 years ago sometimes even

236
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,199
like six or seven years ago

237
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,038
there is some inaccurate information in

238
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,120
there so just be careful

239
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,199
always do your due diligence do further

240
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,519
research beyond what you hear in forums

241
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,520
if i'm using ocean forest and happy frog

242
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,159
mix do i still water with nutrients or

243
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,519
plain water

244
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,599
so when you're mixing those two soils

245
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,519
combined both soils do have

246
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,360
nutrients in them to begin so you won't

247
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,598
need to add nutrients right away

248
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,120
now you probably start to need to add

249
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,159
nutrients in 20

250
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,240
30 days of the plant's life depending on

251
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,520
you know how often you transplant if

252
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,759
you're growing for

253
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,439
15 20 days and you transplant to a

254
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,199
larger container well then that fresh

255
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,639
soil has nutrients in it so you don't

256
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,038
need to start feeding nutrients right

257
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,639
away

258
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:46,639
so general guidance is 20 to 30 days

259
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,000
roughly this one grows start to feed and

260
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,079
nutrients but you can get a more

261
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,879
accurate picture by using a tds

262
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,719
tester and checking the ppm of the

263
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,840
runoff how can i talk with you without

264
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,680
using facebook

265
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,079
how about personal guidance you can come

266
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,918
onto my forum mr growth.com

267
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,439
forum i'm on there almost every day

268
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,639
answering questions sometimes it might

269
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,120
take me two or three

270
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,639
days to get back to you on things a lot

271
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,639
of people posting on there

272
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,680
a pretty big community that we've built

273
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
up over there

274
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,879
there's several active members on the

275
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,038
forum that

276
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,160
will go on there and answer questions so

277
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,759
it's not just me

278
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,680
trying to help people out there that's

279
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,639
the best way if you really want

280
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,598
one-on-one

281
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,639
feedback from me really patreon is kind

282
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:28,719
of my go-to

283
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,680
i usually prioritize patreon responses

284
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,360
as the first

285
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,759
ones that i respond to is patreon

286
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,278
messages then i'll go over to the forum

287
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,879
and then start answering there but yeah

288
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,439
if you try to message me on facebook if

289
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,879
you try to dm me on instagram

290
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,680
if you try to ask questions through

291
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,559
twitter i send everybody over the forum

292
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,559
because

293
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,000
you know quite frankly it's really hard

294
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,479
for me to try to keep up with

295
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,240
all these different platforms so i send

296
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,480
everybody to mr growth.com

297
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,399
forum and ask questions there and that

298
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,759
allows you to add more details you can

299
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,320
add in pictures

300
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,919
video and i can sit down and give more

301
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,440
detailed responses for you

302
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,199
i'm a new grower and i'm using liquid

303
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,440
nutrients for my plants i just wanted to

304
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,839
know if i make a batch of nutrients and

305
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,120
ph the water how long is it good to sit

306
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,680
for you'll probably get a different

307
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,240
answer

308
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,838
from different people that you ask so i

309
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,000
actually asked this question

310
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,600
to rob from blue planet nutrients i

311
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,080
believe he's one of the owners of blue

312
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,800
planet nutrients his answer was no

313
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,720
longer than

314
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,958
two weeks so if i mix up a batch of

315
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,200
nutrients into a bucket for example

316
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,559
i should use that within two weeks now

317
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,000
there are other people out there that

318
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,000
say it's way less than that some people

319
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,039
say no longer than 24 hours

320
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,519
you want to lose that because those

321
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,199
nutrients can fall out of solution

322
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,278
so your best bet probably is just to

323
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,278
reach out to the nutrient manufacturer

324
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,600
and ask them what they think because

325
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,958
their particular nutrients they may have

326
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,480
different guidance for you what are some

327
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,319
tricks that you use to improve

328
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,839
smell and taste of your buds so the

329
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,240
smell and taste

330
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,640
really come down to the terpenes and

331
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,799
flavonoids that are located within the

332
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,399
resin glands or trichomes of the plant

333
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,799
when you walk into your grow room and

334
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,639
you

335
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,278
smell the plant that smell is actually

336
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,879
the terpenes in those resin glands

337
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,879
evaporating different terpenes will

338
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,240
evaporate at different temperatures

339
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,200
but yeah i think it's mostly going to

340
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,320
come down to genetics you know phenotype

341
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,640
genotype i think environment is a factor

342
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,680
drying is a factor the way it's cured is

343
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,199
factor

344
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,879
so all those different things kind of

345
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,360
combined is

346
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,320
uh going to determine your taste and

347
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,000
smell of the buds

348
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,920
so if you dial in those processes it

349
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,120
should improve it i'm in la it's pretty

350
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,879
dry here too

351
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,480
is it safe to put a humidifier with

352
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,399
thermostat in your dry room

353
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,159
absolutely a lot of growers do that they

354
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,320
need to add a humidifier in there

355
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,319
in order to increase the humidity in the

356
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,720
dry room so the buds don't dry too

357
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,000
quickly

358
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,519
just a couple tips make sure the

359
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,958
humidifier isn't blowing directly onto

360
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,278
the buds

361
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,719
make sure that you have air circulation

362
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:52,320
going on so

363
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,839
the humidity doesn't reach so high then

364
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,160
all of a sudden the stagnant air

365
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,519
and mold could potentially happen so i

366
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,039
usually put an oscillating fan

367
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,879
on the bottom part of my grow

368
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,278
environment grow tent is what i usually

369
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,879
use

370
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,480
and then air will be able to circulate

371
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,240
down below and it kind of goes up

372
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,680
and i usually leave like the ventilation

373
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,480
sock up top

374
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,000
on the grow tent open so air will be

375
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,519
able to exchange some people actually

376
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,240
use an inline fan as well

377
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,600
for and put it on a low setting in order

378
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,720
for air exchange so

379
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,320
there are a couple different ways to go

380
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,800
about it but yeah you can absolutely

381
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,800
have

382
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,399
put a humidifier in your drying room in

383
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,559
order to increase the humidity

384
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,799
how do you boost rh in a dry environment

385
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,439
i had two humidifiers going full blast

386
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,399
in the tent

387
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,160
and it could only manage 29 would an

388
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,679
external humidifier help

389
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,679
we just talked about that adding a

390
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,359
humidifier will do it so i'm jumping to

391
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,639
an assumption here but i assume that you

392
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,800
have an intake

393
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,319
fan exchanging air in your dry

394
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,879
environment so

395
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,480
with two humidifiers it being at 29 i'm

396
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,519
assuming you're just exhausting too much

397
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
air out of the space

398
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,879
if you have a variable speed controller

399
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,919
on the fan you can reduce it down to

400
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,439
like the lowest setting

401
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,278
for example some people actually don't

402
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,160
even use an intake vent

403
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,200
to for air exchange i personally don't

404
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,719
like i just said in the previous

405
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
question i'll leave that top ventilation

406
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
sock open

407
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,720
sometimes i'll actually leave the tent

408
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,838
cracked as well and then i'll open up

409
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,480
the tent once a day

410
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,200
and completely change the air once a day

411
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,959
but

412
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,560
as long as air is not stagnant you know

413
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,199
adding an oscillating fan down the

414
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,439
bottom

415
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,440
and then you also ask would an external

416
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,800
humidifier help so i'm assuming

417
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,639
what you mean by that is having a

418
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,559
humidifier outside

419
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,959
of the grow tent for example a dry

420
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,879
environment so the air coming in

421
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,319
is of the proper humidity yeah you can

422
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,720
try that as well that should definitely

423
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,560
help

424
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,959
is the fox farm three bottle system

425
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:38,159
organic quick easy answer on this one

426
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,439
no how to resolve leggy seedlings most

427
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,519
of the time when the seedling

428
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,800
sprouts from the medium and it's coming

429
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,560
up and it appears to be

430
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,078
stretchy usually it's stretching up

431
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,119
looking for more light

432
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,199
so an easy fix is to lower that grow

433
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,839
light so it's closer to the plant that's

434
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,839
way to go about

435
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,040
cell division leads to a closer node

436
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,800
spacing on the plants so

437
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,559
i'm not really sure what light you have

438
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,319
over the plants but keep in mind that

439
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,439
the spectrum could also contribute to it

440
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,160
do you have your lights on

441
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,839
100 power or use a progressive method so

442
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:20,639
i personally do like to conserve energy

443
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,880
where i can

444
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,159
i actually have a par meter i have the

445
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,559
apple gmq

446
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,958
620 par meter i actually also have their

447
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,119
older model which is the mq 500

448
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,199
parameter and i use that in order to

449
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,360
dial in my light distance so often time

450
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,440
i am dimming the fixture down

451
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,440
trying to bring it pretty close to the

452
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,880
actual plants and then as the plants get

453
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,399
older and larger

454
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:46,720
i am raising the distance increasing

455
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,399
the percentage so i am able to dial down

456
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,399
the fixture use a par meter and

457
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,799
dial in that distance a little bit more

458
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,078
accurately but yeah generally i'm sure

459
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,519
there's a lot of people out there who

460
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:56,638
don't have par meters they're so

461
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,639
expensive that's over

462
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,159
i think it's like 575 dollars for the

463
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,278
one that i have which is

464
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:05,198
kind of crazy but um just going by the

465
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,480
grow light manufacturer's recommended

466
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,439
light distance is

467
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,440
generally where i advise people to start

468
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,079
and hopefully the manufacturer has

469
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,440
correct light distances set so you don't

470
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,120
you know burn your plants and harm your

471
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,199
plants with the lights off temp

472
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,959
what do you like to run the room in veg

473
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,958
and flower ideally it would be

474
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,559
10 degrees lower we're talking

475
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,719
fahrenheit 10 degrees lower than the

476
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,278
lights on temperature so if i'm running

477
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,120
82 degrees lights on temperature you

478
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,000
know 72 degrees

479
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,839
would be ideal for lights off now if it

480
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,278
creeps below than that that's fine the

481
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,839
plant's still going to grow

482
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,600
high 60s even mid 60s when we get into

483
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,120
the low 60 degree fahrenheit you could

484
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,278
see a stunt growth and then also if

485
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,480
you're having these large swings from

486
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,000
82 degrees down to 62 degrees i mean if

487
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,600
you're seeing constant swings like that

488
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,958
that does stress out the plant so you

489
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,480
can definitely see issues if those

490
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:58,000
swings are too large but yeah

491
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,920
10 degree 15 degree swing fahrenheit is

492
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,078
ideal thanks for your videos i was

493
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,039
wondering on taking oakster dam online

494
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,120
pace classes

495
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,399
it's on sale 9.95 do you recommend

496
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,000
taking this course so i personally

497
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,240
haven't taken that course so

498
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
i i can't recommend it okay gm

499
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,320
university is a well-known

500
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,278
university for cannabis cultivation so i

501
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,959
am pretty confident that you're going to

502
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,639
receive good information there

503
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,399
i'm just not really sure what type of

504
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,159
information that course

505
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,679
gives so i can't really tell you if it's

506
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,399
going to be worth it or not for you

507
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,679
unfortunately

508
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,120
i wish i was able to help you out more

509
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,958
on that one all right so a few things

510
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,480
before in this video first thing is my

511
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,479
beginner grow book

512
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,800
this is available paperback form on

513
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,000
amazon it is a complete beginner's guide

514
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,039
for growing

515
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,639
both in soil and coca-cola indoor

516
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,799
cultivation and it's really just going

517
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,919
to give you a lot of general information

518
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,278
that's going to get you through your

519
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,879
first few grows so

520
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,039
really if you're in your first grow

521
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,759
second grow this book is probably more

522
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,278
for you

523
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,199
versus i've actually had some people who

524
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,559
have like five six years experience

525
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:55,919
they buy and they're disappointed

526
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,119
because well there's beginner

527
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,078
information in there yeah i can't

528
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,759
satisfy everybody

529
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,239
if you do end up buying it on amazon

530
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,639
please leave a review i'm looking to get

531
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,320
500 reviews on amazon currently i have i

532
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,720
think 225

533
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,399
reviews so i have a long ways to go

534
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
anybody out there that has purchased a

535
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,958
book

536
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,399
it would mean a lot to me if you spent a

537
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,039
few minutes to leave

538
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,639
a rating a star rating or review on

539
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,319
amazon that helps with ranking

540
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,159
helps more people find the book so on

541
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,040
and so forth so thank you to all who

542
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,039
