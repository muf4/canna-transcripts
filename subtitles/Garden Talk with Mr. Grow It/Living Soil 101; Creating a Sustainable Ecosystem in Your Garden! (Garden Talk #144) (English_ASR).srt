gardening sure sure uh my name is Joshua

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:32,120
steensland and um I've been cultivating

69
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:35,000
plants and and tending Gardens um since

70
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:39,200
about 1997 when I got out of the Marines

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,919
um I really uh had an itch to to to get

72
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,759
involved um

73
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,119
horticulturally um with all kinds of

74
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,000
plants medicinal plants veggie gardens

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,120
the works and um really just kind of hit

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,439
the ground running and I've been

77
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,759
cultivating pretty much continuously

78
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:58,079
since 97 awesome yeah I think I first

79
00:02:54,759 --> 00:03:00,000
came across you in 2016 if I remember

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,680
correctly came across your content I was

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,318
like man this guy he's really good at

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,280
dialed in and you were doing Organics

83
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,359
and living soil back then so you've been

84
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,479
had so many years experience here doing

85
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,760
it how many years have you kind of had

86
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,238
your feet wet with living soil in

87
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:18,000
particular yeah well I ironically I

88
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,759
think you probably uh came across me

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,759
right around the time I was um first

90
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:28,878
discovering and sharing my process so

91
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:31,199
before about 2016 I I would cultivate in

92
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,280
many different I used to own a couple

93
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,959
brick and mortar hydroponic shops or

94
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,400
garden centers in southern Oregon and um

95
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,319
that afforded me the opportunity to try

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,080
lots of different cultivation Styles

97
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,039
aeroponic deep water culture

98
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,480
recirculating deep water culture Coco

99
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:50,798
you the works so I had been in um the

100
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,280
middle of lots of different transitions

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:58,319
I had a really bad run with h a popular

102
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:01,759
nutrient brand that I won't name um and

103
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:07,000
I was just kind of fed up and so I hit

104
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:09,639
the IC M forums and I saw a picture in a

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,719
post of probably the most beautiful

106
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,559
plant I had ever seen and the caption

107
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,199
underneath the picture

108
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,918
was this plant was grown with nothing

109
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,478
but water and its own shade leaves and I

110
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:26,198
was just Gob smacked completely blown

111
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:28,918
away how that was even possible so I

112
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,520
went in I just Dove deep into the rabbit

113
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:35,319
hole I started with the subcool super

114
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:38,399
soil type um blend and then um really

115
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:42,159
Dove uh head first into and a huge shout

116
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:46,599
out to Jeremy at Builder soil uh he his

117
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,520
website was uh really and still is a a

118
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,160
vast um resource for knowledge and

119
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,079
especially in those early days there was

120
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,800
not a lot of people talking living soil

121
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,800
and um it really gave me the confidence

122
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,160
to kind of jump in with both feet and I

123
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,120
decided at that time to just document my

124
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,039
journey so I started a YouTube

125
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,280
channel and you can watch like my first

126
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:12,800
12 Cycles or something might might only

127
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,478
be 10 um on YouTube they're all on there

128
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,720
and I just kind of documenting my

129
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:21,959
journey and uh uh really got to watch

130
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,960
the the living soil methodology take off

131
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,000
over the years it was uh really great I

132
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,879
feel fortunate to have been in a unique

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,639
position to kind of watch this Rebirth

134
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,839
of these old School cultivation

135
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,519
techniques that are are being embraced

136
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:37,279
um in all different sectors of of

137
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,560
horiculture and agriculture that's

138
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,038
awesome so lots of history there yeah I

139
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,560
remember when I first started I started

140
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:46,199
with the synthetic bottle nutrients and

141
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,280
I'm slowly transitioned over to the

142
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,240
organic side of things and it seems like

143
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,839
the past 10 years in particular there's

144
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,439
been a large transition from using

145
00:05:53,839 --> 00:06:00,038
bottle nutrients to Organics living soil

146
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:03,240
no to living soil regenerative Garden

147
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:05,800
right what is meant by living soil so

148
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,000
say all your organic gardening or you're

149
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,240
living soil and what's the difference

150
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,279
break it down for us sure so living soil

151
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,120
you know there's life everywhere even in

152
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,119
the worst like Dusty dirt that has no

153
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,038
organic matter there's still bacteria

154
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,160
there present so everything is really

155
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,959
alive so some people get confused with

156
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,199
like what is this living soil mean and

157
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,079
really uh uh horticulturally speaking

158
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,560
it's

159
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:38,598
having not just bacteria but fungi

160
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:42,399
protozoa M micro arthopods worms you're

161
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:44,759
having a whole Consortium of of biology

162
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:48,359
Dr Lane in refers to it as the soil food

163
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,800
web I highly recommend folks going down

164
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,598
that rabbit

165
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,800
hole um but in a living soil system

166
00:06:53,598 --> 00:07:00,560
we're paying as much or more frankly

167
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,360
attention to the soil than we are are

168
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,800
actual the crop that we're trying to

169
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,919
grow or trying to cultivate and um

170
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,680
there's there's practices that can that

171
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:13,839
that you can do to help increase the

172
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,639
biological diversity and the quantity of

173
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:20,159
biology in your soils to uh really help

174
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:24,879
facilitate that nutrient cycling process

175
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,199
so um it's really all about biology in

176
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,360
in diversity and in the correct

177
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,280
quantities in order for it to kind of be

178
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,639
a a quote unquote living soil um system

179
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,799
okay so if someone were to use organic

180
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,560
inputs for example they add an organic

181
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,160
inputs throughout the growth cycle they

182
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,319
do that initial mending to begin of

183
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,919
course and then they add in uh microbial

184
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,680
inoculant for example would that be

185
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:50,878
considered a living soil system or do

186
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,199
they also need worms and they need to

187
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,919
use compost and where's like the line I

188
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,840
guess when it comes to True living soil

189
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,560
versus just growing organically with

190
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,959
Organic and you know what I mean

191
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,680
absolutely I think that's a really good

192
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,680
question and that's a that's a kind of a

193
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,360
hard distinction to make because there's

194
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,199
a lot of gray area on the lines outside

195
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,360
of these definitions so I think for me

196
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,439
personally and I've really struggled

197
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:21,038
hard with trying to not be an absolutist

198
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:24,158
in this in this game um because first

199
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:26,120
off that that can come across as um

200
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:28,319
holier than now or can come across as

201
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,158
like oh we know everything when really

202
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,200
we we just know what we've been doing

203
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:35,038
and we share my experience and I can't

204
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,240
say that my definition is the absolutes

205
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,319
definition but I think the most most

206
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,879
people in the living soil Community

207
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:47,360
would agree that um there's so many

208
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:50,600
different ways to to tackle fertility

209
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,480
and I don't poo poo on people who use um

210
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,800
organic amendments or even even organic

211
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,079
kind of soluble nutrients um as long as

212
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,919
you're still paying attention ption to

213
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:04,639
the soil biology and you're not doing

214
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:08,240
anything that's a detriment to the soil

215
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:11,159
biology you can still amend you can

216
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,519
still fol your feed with your plants you

217
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:15,838
can do all kinds of different things um

218
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,720
outside of just tending to soil putting

219
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,959
worms and using water only which happens

220
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,040
to be kind of my minimalist approach I

221
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:24,679
don't I don't use a lot of top dresses I

222
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:26,759
don't use anything like that um but when

223
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:29,838
other people do I don't say oh you're

224
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,919
not living soil you know uh as long as

225
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,120
they're as long as you if if worms can

226
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,879
live in your system and you're not

227
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,200
killing your worms then you've got a

228
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,200
living soil system to be frank they are

229
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,560
the they're like the canary and the coal

230
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,920
mine they will scram if anything's weird

231
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:47,119
they will scram they will not survive

232
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,240
and if you're if if what you're doing if

233
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,720
the variable that you're adding to your

234
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,480
system it it makes it to where you can't

235
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,639
have those that kind of life in your

236
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,560
system I would start to question whether

237
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:58,879
you have a living soil system thanks for

238
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,278
breaking that down for us I feel like

239
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,159
that's an area where just there's so

240
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:03,639
much confusion I agree though I think

241
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,039
that I think that that distinction needs

242
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:09,319
to be made because a lot of folks have

243
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,919
this really absolutist approach and um

244
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,640
this kind of All or Nothing approach

245
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:14,439
when it comes to regenerative

246
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,159
agriculture in general and it can be

247
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,560
off-putting to people who are trying to

248
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,199
get in who are trying to just trying to

249
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,559
understand the system and trying to

250
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,879
convert maybe ass salt system into a

251
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:27,958
living soil system it's nice to know

252
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:29,559
that you've got flexibility in leeway

253
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,319
with how to how to apply the these

254
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:34,799
techniques and still and still qualify

255
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,920
as a living soil system got it so how

256
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:40,039
does the overall health and productivity

257
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:41,958
of plants grown in living soil differ

258
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,480
from plants grown in other systems such

259
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:46,479
as synthetic nutrients in soil or

260
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,159
Hydroponics yeah that's another great

261
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,680
question I think you know with

262
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,958
Hydroponics and salt based systems you

263
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:56,278
get very rapid growth especially in the

264
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,879
vegetative stage of of certain plants so

265
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,078
that you'll get um very fast very fast

266
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,278
growth

267
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:05,399
and um if that's your only metric for

268
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:08,159
success or for plant Health then that

269
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,600
then that really kind of keeps people in

270
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,519
that you know in that system because

271
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,159
there's like oh my plants grow very fast

272
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,679
and they look very green and they're

273
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:20,319
beautiful and that's your only metric

274
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:24,199
then that tends to work but um in an

275
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,160
organic system you might get a little

276
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,360
your veg time might be a little lower

277
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:32,799
the but the overall health of your plant

278
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,680
is going to be the same or better uh

279
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,639
than a salt-based system and that's just

280
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:40,759
based on my experience I know plenty of

281
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:43,440
my friends and plenty of my very good uh

282
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,000
colleagues uh they grow using salt-based

283
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,839
nutrients they've just done it forever

284
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,120
and that's what they do and they got

285
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,040
their systems dialed and you know I'll

286
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,600
still smoke their material I've got many

287
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:57,078
friends that grow in with Sal based

288
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,759
nutrients and um I have no problem going

289
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:59,919
over to their house eating their fruits

290
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,439
and veggies

291
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,120
cuz I know that they're doing things

292
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,200
properly they're flushing things

293
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,399
properly and they're not

294
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,800
um they care about what they're putting

295
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,600
out they care about what their end

296
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:15,559
product is so once again I'm not an

297
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,480
absolutist in that sense where I just um

298
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:19,719
if people aren't growing in living soil

299
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,639
then I'm shaming them or or anything

300
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,920
like that because I think I think

301
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,600
there's plenty of room for everybody to

302
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,759
cultivate cultivate the way they're

303
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,800
comfortable I in my experience happened

304
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:35,879
to have experienced uh a greater degree

305
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:38,319
of success and a higher level of quality

306
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,838
um when going the organic route

307
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,278
understood yeah I think the debate is

308
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,440
going to be going on for many years from

309
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:47,039
now what's better living soil or growing

310
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,079
with synthetic inputs and uh you know

311
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,559
it's not something we're really going to

312
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,719
get deeper into in this episode I have

313
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,919
other episodes where we kind of get

314
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,040
deeper into the differences there but

315
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,799
yeah it was interesting to get your

316
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,958
thoughts on on the differences there

317
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,198
let's get into soil microbiology next I

318
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,838
want get deeper into that and how it

319
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,719
works in living soil are you able to

320
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,320
kind of break it down for us how

321
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,680
different microorganisms benefit plant

322
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,079
growth yeah absolutely I I'm I'm no Dr

323
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,439
elain um but I think I've got a pretty

324
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:18,919
good grasp I actually did her foundation

325
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,519
course and um I found it really really

326
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:24,039
beneficial for me to to connect some of

327
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,959
the dots uh as far as what I was

328
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:29,278
experience experiencing with plant

329
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:31,719
health and plant fertility and and so

330
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,879
the takeaway with the biology is once

331
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,759
again as I referenced the soil food web

332
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:39,559
earlier um if you just have bacteria in

333
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,958
your system which is everywhere I mean

334
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:44,638
bacteria is literally everywhere it's

335
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:46,518
out on if I remember right it's they're

336
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
they're finding bacteria that survive on

337
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,759
the outside of the Space Shuttle when it

338
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,078
goes into the vacuum of space and the

339
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,959
mariia trench at the really hot vents

340
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:58,278
there's just bacteria everywhere so

341
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:00,000
we're not really concerned about our

342
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:01,879
bacteria levels as long as there's not

343
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,360
bad bacteria but what we really want to

344
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:07,480
see and especially in row crops

345
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,519
vegetables medicinal plants those type

346
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,440
of things we really want a One toone

347
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:17,278
bacterial to fungal ratio so the hard

348
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,639
part for a lot of um soils and

349
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,360
agricultural soils is getting the

350
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:25,720
organic matter up to the level where you

351
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,278
can start to increase fungal diversity

352
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,560
and aerobic fungal diversity uh

353
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:31,639
specifically

354
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,319
and so you know if you have a system

355
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,039
where you have plenty of bacteria and

356
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,519
fungi you might be think that you've

357
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:43,198
you've made it but to be honest that

358
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,799
you're all of your nutrient that the

359
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,758
bacteria and fungi are mining from your

360
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:49,758
organic matter and hopefully you have

361
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:53,079
beautiful agricultural soils with lots

362
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:56,560
of organic matter um that's where the

363
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:59,679
bacteria and fungi mine the minerals and

364
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:04,479
nutrients that they in turn

365
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:07,120
exchange with the plants and a lot of

366
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,440
that nutrient and mineral can get locked

367
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:14,078
up in the living bodies of the bacteria

368
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,920
and fungi and so there needs to be a

369
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:20,319
predator a higher order predator in that

370
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:23,399
system that kind of facilitates their

371
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,800
demise so you really want the protozoa

372
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:29,078
in there

373
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:31,919
to get at the bacteria and fungi and

374
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:35,000
will now in turn release some of that

375
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,838
soluble nutrient um that's going to be

376
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,958
right kind of around the risos spere of

377
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:42,040
the plant so the plant Works in

378
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:44,958
conjunction with the biology to get what

379
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,360
it needs uh without getting too specific

380
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,638
and drilling down into some of the

381
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,839
specifics a byproduct of photosynthesis

382
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:55,198
in the plant creates carbohydrates the

383
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,519
plant is so intelligent it has the

384
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:01,240
ability to formulate that carbohydrate

385
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:04,679
from moment to moment and then at night

386
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,759
it sends it back down into the root Zone

387
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:10,399
and that those

388
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:12,120
exudates cover the root Zone and

389
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,958
depending on the formulation of the

390
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,879
exudate it attracts whatever biology

391
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,838
has the plant needs so the plant needs a

392
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:25,039
very specific micronutrient it will and

393
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,319
it it already knows that the the biology

394
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:30,039
that likes that micronutrient and has it

395
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:32,240
stored in its bodies likes this specific

396
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:34,278
configuration of carbohydrate it

397
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,000
attracts it to the root Zone and then

398
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:38,559
the soil food web does its thing and

399
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,078
everything is kind released in a soluble

400
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:44,559
plant ready form there at the rizosphere

401
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,159
so it's really important not just to

402
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,439
have bacteria and fungi but it's

403
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:52,519
important to have those uh the protozoa

404
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,240
as well to help release uh to help

405
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,799
release that uh that trapped nutrient

406
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,600
and mineral and then on the way up the

407
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:02,039
microarthropod and all those other

408
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,640
things those just work on your organic

409
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:07,918
matter and um they have waste products

410
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,520
that are beneficial to the system so you

411
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,120
know really just like you want to see in

412
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:16,359
nature you want to see a a a diverse

413
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:19,119
population of Life uh flourishing in

414
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,918
your system when you have that um then

415
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,759
you know uh you're kind of working in

416
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:29,038
accordance with nature and the way

417
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:30,599
plants work with soil is so supremely

418
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,679
designed it's it's

419
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:36,359
unbelievable how

420
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:38,600
amazingly uh Adept and and the plants

421
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:41,639
are at feeding themselves they do not

422
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:45,319
need our help they do not need us in

423
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:49,360
there um fidgeting around with things

424
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:52,558
for them as long as you have biology

425
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,479
organic matter moisture sun and a plant

426
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,558
it's going to do its thing you just have

427
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,679
to you just have to know and trust that

428
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:01,918
process um and that comes with

429
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,840
experience and just really just doing it

430
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,280
you mentioned protozoa and I feel like a

431
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:10,720
lot of folks will rely on micr products

432
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:13,839
in order to kind of enhance the

433
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,240
microbiology in their soil right and I

434
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,839
feel like a lot of these microducts

435
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,079
don't have protozoa in it would you Happ

436
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,678
to know why no I think though I think

437
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:25,079
because they're a larger uh a little bit

438
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:29,400
larger life form and a little more

439
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:33,000
fragile than the so say like a a

440
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,000
bacteria have a really good um ability

441
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,359
to to kind of preserve themselves if

442
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,880
they get into a dry or a hot or

443
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:43,558
undesirable condition a lot of them have

444
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,000
a ways just kind of like go into like a

445
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:47,879
suspended animation and then they'll

446
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,440
when the moisture content is correct

447
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,799
again they'll come back protozoa don't

448
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,240
really have that ability they're a

449
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:56,359
little more fragile I mean I think

450
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,480
amoeba will go into like a testate form

451
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:00,959
when they get shaken up um but I don't

452
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,960
think that they're very tolerant of

453
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:08,079
drought or anything like that so

454
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,840
um they kind of fragility uh lends to

455
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:13,720
them being um the kind of the first ones

456
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:16,319
to go when you have a systemic issue or

457
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,919
a crash or you've uh let your system dry

458
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,960
out um but the wonderful thing about

459
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,640
that is is that if you all you have to

460
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,798
do is get your system back in to balance

461
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,240
and get your organic matter right get

462
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:32,839
your moisture right protozoa will

463
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,919
arrive they'll just arrive and if you

464
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:38,678
have any kind of uh compost or Verma

465
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,159
compost there's tons of protozoa in in

466
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,159
fresh worm castings um if you do a

467
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:46,120
thermophilic compost there's going to be

468
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:49,200
tons of protozoa I've never seen the

469
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:50,879
Johnson Sue kind of bioreactor material

470
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,279
under a microscope but I've heard lots

471
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,440
of really good things about that

472
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:59,158
composting process so um there's ways to

473
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,679
just kind of reintroduce them into your

474
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,919
system um at at random intervals or at

475
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:07,400
set intervals to ensure that you're

476
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,799
you're kind of keeping your protozoa uh

477
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,440
and your bacterial to fungal po

478
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,119
populations correct that's interesting I

479
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,038
don't know if a lot of people know about

480
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,959
that so yeah if you're adding in worm

481
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,759
castings you're adding in protozoa as

482
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,720
well so that's really good to know now

483
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,798
how about micr products you know we kind

484
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,919
of talked about that a bit a lot of

485
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:27,798
people do rely on micro products to

486
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,720
inoculate the medium with microbes

487
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:31,639
however the diversity there is pretty

488
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,600
limited right now you could go out and

489
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,159
do the IMO process and get more

490
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:37,759
diversity can you kind of talk to us

491
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,880
about the difference between inoculating

492
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,000
with a micr product versus the IMO

493
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,360
process maybe some of the pros and cons

494
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,919
to both of them yeah sure so look I

495
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:51,558
think there's a lot there's a lot of

496
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:54,640
kind of what what are lovingly referred

497
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:55,879
to as bugs in a jug products out there

498
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,960
and

499
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,120
um my very basic kind of rudimentary

500
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,360
understanding of this I'm not going to

501
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:07,839
pretend to be um the the expert in this

502
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:11,158
but but my basic General understanding

503
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:14,639
is is that you do better in your

504
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:18,320
cultivation system if you can gather um

505
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,038
those microbes kind of regionally uh

506
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:24,798
otherwise you're you're very limited

507
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:27,119
like you said to a very specific um type

508
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,440
of biology and sometimes they might not

509
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,399
be suited for your region and so what

510
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,519
you end up doing is you just end up

511
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,320
applying a bunch of biology to your

512
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:39,158
system that just ends up being food for

513
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:40,839
your native biology um which causes a

514
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:42,200
which causes a bloom in biology and

515
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:44,038
you're like oh wow the product worked

516
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,960
great and you know maybe it did May

517
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:48,720
maybe if that's one of the functions of

518
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,840
those products then that that still

519
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,558
technically Works maybe just not in the

520
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:55,678
same modality that people are thinking

521
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:59,038
when they're applying it um and there

522
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,759
also you know based off of this the the

523
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,359
schooling that the stuff that I learned

524
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:08,000
at the soil food web school was a lot of

525
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:11,319
those bugs and The Jug recipes have um

526
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,558
like some kind of acid in there to to

527
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:17,240
stabilize it to make it shelf stable and

528
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:20,678
that can have a negative impact on your

529
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:25,640
native biology as well so I've always

530
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:29,240
just tried to avoid um those products in

531
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:32,400
and work to cultivate

532
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:35,839
that biology on my own property or in my

533
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,440
own region once again via Thermo Thermo

534
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,480
composting I've never done IMO

535
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,759
collection I I know lots of people who

536
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,519
do lots of people who are really have

537
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:48,240
found great success you taking bits and

538
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:50,200
pieces of the k&amp;f practices and applying

539
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,359
them to their system and I think

540
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,159
obviously one of the most successful

541
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:57,000
things that you can do outside of like

542
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,120
fpj's and stuff is that that IMO

543
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,798
collection technique is really stellar

544
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,479
and I really I'm really intrigued by

545
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:05,839
that process and I really like to see

546
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,400
people follow through with it I've just

547
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:11,000
I've never done it I've focused more on

548
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,480
the vermac composting side and the ther

549
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,558
thermophilic composting side to make the

550
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,319
the biocomplete compost and I've just

551
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:21,759
had great success with that and just

552
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,678
felt like um if I'm getting the biology

553
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,158
into my system this way I just really

554
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,400
didn't need to to to venture into that

555
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:32,120
other uh technique that being said I

556
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,440
encourage people to try as many of these

557
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,639
techniques and find out which one

558
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,519
scratches your itches you know which one

559
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,120
feels good you know lots of people are a

560
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,200
type and they like to be busy and they

561
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,479
like to do things and feel like they're

562
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,798
participating I'm more of a hands off I

563
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,640
like to just kind of set it and forget

564
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,200
it I don't like to spend hours in my

565
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,200
grow I like to just go in and look at it

566
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,759
like things are great see you later I'm

567
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,919
going to apply compost to my to my beds

568
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,079
twice a year or maybe even just once a

569
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,919
year and just kind of leave it at that

570
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,918
and don't fuss over things but if

571
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,679
there's people who are like super a type

572
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:06,038
I encourage them to check those things

573
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,559
out try the things you know build the

574
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:10,798
cedar box take it out to the woods do do

575
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,480
all those things and uh and I'm sure

576
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,038
it'll feel great and you'll get great

577
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,319
results I'm just like you I haven't had

578
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:18,960
the chance to do the IMO process I've

579
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:21,558
just like you been focusing on vermac

580
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,600
composting and cool I I think a lot of

581
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:25,319
people are under the you know have the

582
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,319
misconception that if you're not doing

583
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,038
the IMO process then you're not doing it

584
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:31,480
right and I think that's just the wrong

585
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:33,879
way to think about things I think there

586
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,599
are other ways to get to the Finish Line

587
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,240
like you mentioned the verac composting

588
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,959
that's another way where you can create

589
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,240
biology get biology maintain it take it

590
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,720
from your vermac compost system and then

591
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,759
put it into your garden whether it be an

592
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,079
outdoor Garden or indoor garden with

593
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:52,879
grow pots or containers there are

594
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:55,038
multiple ways to get to that goal of

595
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,760
increasing the microbial population in

596
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,480
the medium so yeah that's uh some really

597
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,359
good info that you shared with us right

598
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,120
there and I'm glad you expanded on it

599
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:06,038
and and mentioned it in that way let's

600
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,119
get into building soil from scratch you

601
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:09,599
know a lot of folks that are just

602
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,119
getting started and they want to start

603
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,359
off with a living soil what's your

604
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:16,719
recommendations what should people use

605
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:19,319
for materials in order to start to build

606
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,880
their own living soil you know I think

607
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:23,079
there's there's a couple ways that you

608
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,480
can tackle this you could build your own

609
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:27,240
um and and that's I highly recommend

610
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,000
people Venture into doing that it really

611
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:34,079
gets you more connected to your system

612
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,720
and and get you more uh um familiar with

613
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,960
sourcing the ingredients and

614
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,880
understanding how difficult that could

615
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,960
be sometimes or you can go through a

616
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:45,559
company like um keep it simple or any of

617
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,640
these other uh build a soil that have

618
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:50,440
these really great kind of Custom Blends

619
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,159
and most of those are based off of the

620
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Coots recipe I don't know if many of

621
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,919
your Growers would be familiar with

622
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,000
Clackamus cot or many of your viewers be

623
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:01,399
familiar with Clackamus cot he's been a

624
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,200
little uh a little less vocal on social

625
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:05,119
media over the past five years or so but

626
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,278
early on around the time I first started

627
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:11,759
come on his soil Blend or soil recipe um

628
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:14,319
had become very very popularized and

629
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,960
most um living soil Blends you're going

630
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:19,000
to find here in the states are are going

631
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:22,038
to be basically A variation of of the

632
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,679
Coots recipe um and that's it's changed

633
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:26,038
it's changed a little bit over the years

634
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,960
and some people like Mountain Organics

635
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:33,839
have have really kind of tweaked it and

636
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:37,519
um you know it's a one3 compost uh one3

637
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:39,079
like p uh uh Iration and oneir Pete or

638
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,079
cocoa I think a lot of people are still

639
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:42,960
using Pete I've never done cocoa in a

640
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:45,599
living soil blend I think I think

641
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,519
there's some unique differences there um

642
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:51,959
and then that being your base you add

643
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,960
your nutrients and minerals and that's

644
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,038
where things get um interesting because

645
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,798
people people take that recipe and do

646
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:01,359
all kinds of things with it some people

647
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,720
just use like Mountain Organics for a

648
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:07,719
while was just using glacial Rock Dust

649
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:10,640
at like four cups per cubic foot of uh

650
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,360
base and was doing great with that like

651
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,120
was just doing amazing so I think you

652
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,798
know you could use that you can look at

653
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:20,079
that cot's base and then just add kind

654
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:22,359
of mess with it and add things if you

655
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,599
got a crustation mix you can add you've

656
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:25,918
got you know kelp all these different

657
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:28,398
all these different things that you can

658
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,480
add to it and you're going to have some

659
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:33,359
fun and get get acquainted with um

660
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,440
putting those systems together is really

661
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,719
good and beneficial for your cultivation

662
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,519
Journey um if you don't have time or

663
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,240
patience for those things like I said

664
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:45,038
just getting into a reputable company

665
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,720
that's been producing um soil for living

666
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:50,519
soil cultivators for years um uh

667
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,440
literally a decade or more some of these

668
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:55,839
companies and and you can't go wrong

669
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,640
it's it's it's hard to go wrong so with

670
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,359
any living soil recipe

671
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,960
most of the time nutrients are going to

672
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:05,918
deplete right so unless it's quote a

673
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,120
super soil to where it's a water only

674
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,799
recipe for example of course it's going

675
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:13,119
to depend on how long you veg the plants

676
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:14,759
for but some of them you can just do an

677
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,959
initial mending and then you just water

678
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,720
only for the rest of the cycle other

679
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,759
recipes which are a majority of the

680
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,960
recipes the nutrients are going to

681
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:26,720
deplete at some point for those recipes

682
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,558
What organic inputs do you typically add

683
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,558
in throughout the growth cycle and when

684
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:34,359
do you add them in yeah this is this

685
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:37,879
tends to be a very uh hotly debated

686
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:40,759
topic amongst um agronomists and um and

687
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:44,480
especially large scale agriculturists

688
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:47,599
and hor culturists um I have a differing

689
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,880
opinion so there's two uh trains of

690
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:52,759
thought when it comes to fertility and

691
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,200
available nutrients and just to kind of

692
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,879
briefly describe the two different camps

693
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,880
well I me there of three but there's one

694
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,080
that's in the middle

695
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,799
so the the far far off to one side I

696
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:10,038
don't want to say right or left but far

697
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:14,240
off to one side is the uh Dr Elaine Camp

698
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:15,839
which I tend to be in and that camp is

699
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,038
you know and that's based off of what

700
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:21,079
I've learned in um going through her

701
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,519
foundation course material and then also

702
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:25,720
how that

703
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:27,558
information uh laid over my experience

704
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,440
and really helped connect a lot of dots

705
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:32,359
and so according to Dr

706
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,840
Elaine as long as you have adequate

707
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:39,359
biology once again diversity and

708
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:42,759
quantities um and aerobic and you have

709
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:46,199
adequate organic matter that biology

710
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:49,679
will be able to mine whatever nutrient

711
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,080
whatever mineral that that crop needs

712
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:56,480
whether it's corn potatoes medicinal

713
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:59,158
plants Tomatoes herbs any of that her

714
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,679
body of work has led her to the

715
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:05,080
conclusion

716
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:09,159
that all nutrient needs for all plants

717
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:12,079
can be met entirely and

718
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:17,399
completely with Biology and organic

719
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:21,000
matter and so if you go by that then

720
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:22,879
really all you need to do is keep track

721
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,278
of your biology make sure that your

722
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,640
biology is flourishing and make sure

723
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:30,839
you've got plenty of organic matter and

724
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:33,159
if you follow those two rules you'll be

725
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,558
able to continuously crop without ever

726
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:37,399
really to

727
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:39,759
amend she goes as far to say you don't

728
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:42,719
even need to get a chemistry analysis

729
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:45,720
now when I when I say these words I can

730
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,399
see the Peds exploding in your

731
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,720
viewership right now because there's

732
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:52,479
lots of people who are going to say

733
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:56,360
hogwash and they're going to fish at

734
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,440
that and I get it I totally understand

735
00:30:56,359 --> 00:31:01,158
for me personally

736
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,480
I started not understanding the soil

737
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,840
food web web but just kind of trusting

738
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:10,880
the process and really wanting to see

739
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:14,038
how little I could do how minimum how

740
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:19,278
many variables can I exclude from my

741
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:21,000
system and still pull off a viable crop

742
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:25,638
not just a viable

743
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,319
but better than average right and I was

744
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:29,038
experiencing that for years once again

745
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,798
you can go back back into my YouTube and

746
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:34,000
look at my first six

747
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:36,319
cycles first eight cycles and I I talk

748
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,159
about these very things I have not in

749
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:40,519
the over 10 years I've had my beds and

750
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,960
the soil that I've had now I've never

751
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:46,638
done one chemistry analysis on my soil

752
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,000
and my yield numbers are the same from

753
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:52,439
day one from 10 years ago they're the

754
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,038
same and so and all I've been doing for

755
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,440
the past about 5 years is just adding

756
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,359
compost or Verma compost or some kind of

757
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,080
compost

758
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:03,439
extract to my system to maintain biology

759
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:06,918
because I know myem has plenty of

760
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:10,200
organic matter so you can you can take

761
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:12,399
that kind of ultra extremist biological

762
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,840
approach to cultivation and you'll be

763
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:18,038
just fine I'm a testament to that um I

764
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,439
we've set up uh uh commercial

765
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:23,679
cultivation facilities with the same

766
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:27,519
ideology and they do great they do

767
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,159
amazing we've done large scale outdoor

768
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:33,079
um

769
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:36,320
fiber and hemp crops that we've put

770
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:37,720
nutrient Blends in half of the acreage

771
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:41,398
and then left the other half of the

772
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:44,120
acreage with without any whatsoever just

773
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:46,359
water and native soil which was woefully

774
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:49,278
inadequate organic matter and they

775
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:50,959
produced the same the yields were the

776
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,200
same in one half of the field to the

777
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,639
other and we were adding it was costing

778
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,360
$550 an acre to add that nutrient so

779
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:02,240
over 100 acres you know

780
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:04,319
$55,000 that was not needed at all we

781
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,038
could have used that $55,000 anywhere

782
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,000
else the other half of the acreage that

783
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:11,079
we didn't put the nutrient mix on did

784
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,359
exactly the same that you could not tell

785
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:16,879
the difference one one field to the next

786
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:20,398
one row to the next so that to me was

787
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,278
spoke volumes about the power of biology

788
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,719
and the power of this soil food web now

789
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,919
that being

790
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,440
said that doesn't that doesn't do it

791
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,038
some folks there's a lot of folks that

792
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,200
are so tied into the the chemistry part

793
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:37,398
of it that they have to know the

794
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,759
chemistry and so that's the other side

795
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:44,398
is the people that completely ignore

796
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:45,839
biology and only focus on chemistry and

797
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,239
you find that those are the people that

798
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,398
are using the salt-based chemical

799
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,200
fertilizers and pesticides and all those

800
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:55,319
other things they live in that camp and

801
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,519
somewhere in the middle is a guy named

802
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:01,599
John Kemp and and he's his company is

803
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:06,319
advancing ecological agriculture they're

804
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:09,480
huge they're gigantic he firmly believes

805
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:11,440
in the biological portion he's actually

806
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,280
been on podcast with Dr Lane they've had

807
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,878
some really interesting conversations

808
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,440
about about about the way there two

809
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:21,000
different takes on this

810
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:24,039
he is not ready to just drink the

811
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,918
Kool-Aid and go 100% biology even though

812
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:30,440
he knows that the biology supersedes

813
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,719
the chemistry in any kind of cultivation

814
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:36,000
system biology will always supersede

815
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,759
chemistry and so what he's done with a

816
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,440
lot of conventional a big conventional

817
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:45,119
AG guys is that he's come to the table

818
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,240
and said hey look let's focus on biology

819
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,519
and then let's watch what happens to our

820
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:53,598
chemistry and so he's

821
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,719
utilizing the data that conventional

822
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,000
Farmers have relied on for generations

823
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:02,078
and for decades right this this this

824
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,199
this chemistry data

825
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:08,000
and exposing them to the biological data

826
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:09,799
and saying hey look what happens when we

827
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,400
marry these two look at the changes that

828
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,920
take place and he's done a really good

829
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:19,000
job at convincing

830
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:21,000
Farmers that one they can remove certain

831
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,800
things from their system because it's

832
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,719
the the it it's not beneficial you know

833
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,880
the the the the biology is not present

834
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:29,759
to process the the raw amendments that

835
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,039
you're putting down you're just leaving

836
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,240
money on the table or you're L literally

837
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:37,358
letting it Blow Away In The Wind and so

838
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:39,879
he's combining these two uh

839
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:42,838
methodologies to really bring

840
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,280
conventional a into the fold and then

841
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,719
where he differs from Dr Lane is that he

842
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,800
says hey look yeah you can the natural

843
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:52,559
Order Drive cultivation and drive

844
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,599
fertility but if you're producing a cash

845
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:58,400
crop and you were trying to maximize you

846
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:01,359
can drive that in an organic way

847
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,920
while still keeping in mind what's

848
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:04,119
happening with your biology and not

849
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,240
doing

850
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:08,640
anything that's going to have negative

851
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:11,239
impact on that so over the years where

852
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,838
I've went from this very hardcore doct

853
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:16,118
Elaine curist you know wouldn't even

854
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:19,159
tell a client to get a soil test or

855
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:22,280
anything now I kind of understand the

856
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:26,519
John km ideology where it's really you

857
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:28,839
know like like let's let's leverage the

858
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:29,920
data that that most people are relying

859
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:32,239
on they really want to see that

860
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,559
chemistry data and let's just kind of

861
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:37,639
use that to kind of prove the concept of

862
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:40,159
what's happening and then you can drive

863
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:42,318
your crop you can drive your crop I know

864
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:45,399
Steve kwell good live productions they

865
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:48,920
they do uhry analysis but they're still

866
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,480
very heavily biologically focused and um

867
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,119
one of my colleagues M Davenport with

868
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,719
the ma designs he's uh very much the

869
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,318
same way I think he had his hand he had

870
00:36:54,719 --> 00:37:02,799
a hand in in designing um

871
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:06,199
GOP and um and so I've really kind of

872
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,960
eased off of that that hardcore purist

873
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:10,279
not when it comes to my personal grow my

874
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,159
personal grow I'm still very hardcore I

875
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,640
I still don't do chemistry analysis I

876
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,679
still don't top feed or top dress

877
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:19,078
anything that I think I might be missing

878
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:21,399
I just focus on my biology my crops are

879
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,760
great my yields are great I'm happy

880
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,240
camper um that just doesn't cut it for

881
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,000
other folks so if I work with somebody

882
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:29,479
on a personal basis or so I'm working

883
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,719
with a client that has a commercial

884
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,639
growth I'll introduce this kind of John

885
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:38,000
km or or kind of a Matt Davenport or

886
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,318
Steve kwells kind of a ideology where

887
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,318
hey look let's take a peek at the

888
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:42,719
chemistry let's see where we're at and

889
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:44,000
let's just make sure that we're at those

890
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:47,318
numbers because that makes everybody

891
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
feel happy and so I'm not opposed to

892
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:51,519
that so I don't have a lot of experience

893
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,838
kind of a long way around to answering

894
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,480
your question I don't have a lot of

895
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:57,719
experience with adding amendments to

896
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,280
systems because I've just been mainly

897
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:02,838
focused on biological driven fertility

898
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:06,960
systems and I have no interest in you

899
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:09,480
know pushing my crop to yield 15% more

900
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,960
um by tweaking certain numbers um not

901
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,039
that it can't be done just have no

902
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,559
interest in it and and and I've had

903
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:19,039
really a great level of success just

904
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:21,960
kind of being on that other e uh extreme

905
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:25,639
end um but that being said there's lots

906
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,358
of data and information and and podcasts

907
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:30,519
that people can Digest like I highly

908
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:33,279
recommend John km anything that he's got

909
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:36,800
is just really I've learned so much um

910
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,280
from his material uh that um it can

911
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,119
scratch that itch once again if you're

912
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,319
the a type that really likes to be in

913
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:45,559
charge and really likes to know

914
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:47,358
everything that's going on um there's a

915
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:49,239
methodology and a template for you to

916
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,400
achieve that I think it might be a bit

917
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:53,559
eye openening for some of the viewers

918
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,880
here some of the listeners here when we

919
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:57,440
talk about some of these prominent

920
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,480
figures such as Dr laningham versus

921
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,880
versus John Kemp who they've got

922
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,358
different insight and different data and

923
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,838
different ways to go about it a lot of

924
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,239
people reference Dr Bruce bugby and they

925
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:10,759
say he's the end all be all what he says

926
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:12,639
goes and and everybody else is wrong you

927
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,520
know but there are a lot of scientists

928
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,598
out there that disagree with his ways to

929
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:18,119
go about it right next topic we're going

930
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:19,920
to get into here but I I just have a

931
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,800
followup question for you but the next

932
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,559
topic when we get into teas there's

933
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,560
actually some pretty big disagreement in

934
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:26,759
regards to some high level scientists

935
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:29,279
who disagree whether or not you should

936
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,480
do teas sure but before we get into te's

937
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,800
you mentioned you do compost only right

938
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,400
can you give us some insight in just

939
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,280
like how much compost and how often you

940
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:41,960
apply it yeah so with my uh with my

941
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,119
methodology it it tends to be once again

942
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,000
frustrating to the a types because I'm

943
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:50,240
just really run uh very

944
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,039
intuitively um I'm fortunate enough to

945
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:55,598
have a very wellestablished

946
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,159
beds um before I moved to my new

947
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,400
location my current location about a

948
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:03,039
year year and a half ago the beds that I

949
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:05,920
had were in 3 4X 8 by 1s and they were

950
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:08,679
like 8 years old so very established

951
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,280
beds just I could put anything in them

952
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:11,759
and it would just flourish it wouldn't

953
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,079
have to really do anything as long as

954
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,520
the moisture levels are on point

955
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,519
everything was great I moved into my new

956
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:21,159
uh place and I had to add about two and

957
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:23,119
a half yards of new soil to the new beds

958
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:25,318
that I built so I've kind of got like a

959
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,318
layered system where my upper part of my

960
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:30,480
bed is the newer soil and the lower

961
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:33,318
lower part is that older aged soil so I

962
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,920
really have this benefit of having a

963
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:40,039
large Storehouse of organic matter and

964
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,800
biological activity deep in my beds so I

965
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:44,079
could I really feel like I could go

966
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,839
quite a while without ever having to

967
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,800
amend um because look if if if you're

968
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:53,480
cultivating in your system and it's not

969
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,400
just sitting there um uh uh not doing

970
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,760
anything uh

971
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,318
then that cultiv

972
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,079
process with mulching and living if you

973
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:05,838
got if you got companion plants or or or

974
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:08,280
cover crops going all of that is

975
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:10,519
contributing to New Life in your system

976
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,280
and sustaining the life that's there so

977
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:16,000
you could theoretically build a living

978
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,960
soil system and never really add compost

979
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,960
ever as long as you're cultivating the

980
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,280
system I mean out in nature in the

981
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,639
forest there's nobody out there

982
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,680
spreading compost around it just is kind

983
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:28,199
of cre that that natural hum natural

984
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:32,118
humic

985
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:34,799
is just there it's developed over time

986
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:38,000
and you can build that same type of

987
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,400
system um with your system and just kind

988
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,719
of allowing the natural process to build

989
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,760
over time you don't have major dry out

990
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,959
events or major flooding events or any

991
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,560
of those things those will be setbacks

992
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,400
but eventually your system would build

993
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:54,920
back up so what I do is I just kind of

994
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,079
once or twice a year add compost to my

995
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:02,240
soil um I do have a microscope scope I

996
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,839
do take periodic um microscopy readings

997
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:05,919
just to kind of analyze make sure

998
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:10,279
everything's good but you know after

999
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,240
doing so many slides you really just

1000
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,000
kind of know when your soil's on point

1001
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,838
if I ended up getting having an

1002
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,639
overwatering event and I felt like I had

1003
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:20,719
an anerobic pocket I would I would try

1004
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:24,000
to analyze and make sure I didn't have

1005
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:26,519
any pathogenic fungi or any of the bad

1006
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,039
um bad biology present in the system

1007
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:30,800
that could have a leous effect um but

1008
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,318
really that's just that's frankly that's

1009
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,519
never happened so I've I've stopped

1010
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:39,639
using the microscope almost entirely I I

1011
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:42,559
still think it's a valuable tool um but

1012
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:45,239
I've built compost so much and I've and

1013
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,559
I've my system is so stable that I just

1014
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:49,558
I know when I have good compost and I

1015
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:51,119
know when my system is good and I just

1016
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,760
kind of

1017
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,240
intuitively uh amend a lot of people

1018
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,440
aren't going to like

1019
00:42:55,239 --> 00:43:00,479
that yeah I think a lot of people

1020
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,240
process is that you're growing a plant

1021
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,440
and then you're removing that biomass

1022
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,558
and all the you know as the plant's

1023
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,358
growing obviously the nutrients being

1024
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:07,440
uptaken by the plant so when you remove

1025
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:09,719
that biomass you're removing the

1026
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,358
nutrients from the system so that's when

1027
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:15,919
adding in more inputs is you know

1028
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:17,598
requirement really for for the most part

1029
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,720
it's not like the the out in the forest

1030
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,359
where nobody touches and stuff well the

1031
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:22,919
leaves are falling down right and then

1032
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:24,759
they break it down but everything's kind

1033
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,800
of being recycled within the same area

1034
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,160
but when you're removing that biomass I

1035
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,039
think that that's a concern for a lot of

1036
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:33,639
people yeah it really is and I think

1037
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:35,880
that's where um trying to wrap your head

1038
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:38,639
around and having a deeper understanding

1039
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,480
of kind of the Dr Elaine ideology where

1040
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,799
look you don't need to worry about what

1041
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,480
the plant is taking out of the system

1042
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,760
because it'll be just be replenished

1043
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,599
like she had lots of in that course I

1044
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,200
took there was lots of graphs and

1045
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,838
information and data where they took

1046
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:55,799
organic matter and extracted it and and

1047
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:58,279
calculated how much nitrogen was

1048
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,280
available and just kind of basic organic

1049
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,680
matter that you would find in soils and

1050
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,280
it far

1051
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:07,440
exceeded the AAL of nitrogen that was

1052
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,920
available in to be mined not plant ready

1053
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,599
or available but available to be mined

1054
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,079
by biology was like four times the needs

1055
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,880
of some of your most nitrogen hungry

1056
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,359
crops like corn that like like quite

1057
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,760
literally there is so much nutrient in

1058
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,440
Mineral now of course if you're in a

1059
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,200
sandy desert you know that that and

1060
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,599
you're dealing with a very heavy sand

1061
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:29,838
soil that's going to have a that's going

1062
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,200
to play a factor and I think that's

1063
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:34,440
where John km comes in and is like hey

1064
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:37,199
look not every agricultural soil this is

1065
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,079
going to work with but you know given

1066
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,399
enough time and enough organic matter

1067
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:44,079
you could convert that sandy soil into

1068
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,838
really good tith and find yourself in a

1069
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:50,559
situation where you have actually superb

1070
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:53,719
uh uh superb organic matter content and

1071
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:57,040
and thusly nutrient cycling capability

1072
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:58,919
so that's a tough pill for a lot of

1073
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,519
folks to swallow when you tell somebody

1074
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,559
that they could get all the nutrients

1075
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:04,440
they need out of the organic matter in

1076
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:07,319
your dirt and biology they just don't

1077
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,119
they don't buy it I challenge folks to

1078
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:11,400
kind of step out of this absolutist

1079
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,280
approach and just look into it maybe try

1080
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:18,039
it maybe try growing without amending

1081
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:19,519
your soil uh every six months or just

1082
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:20,759
see what happens if you think that

1083
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:23,800
you've gotten to the point where you're

1084
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,319
low run a cycle run a cycle see where

1085
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,680
your yields and where your numbers are

1086
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:29,079
at um and and

1087
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,799
my guess is that you're going to find

1088
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:33,559
that there's going to be a negligible

1089
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,880
difference between the two so negligible

1090
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:37,280
that any number of variable could have

1091
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,838
contributed to whatever difference

1092
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:45,119
you're seeing so um yeah I I hold hard

1093
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:47,838
and stand hard and fast uh to that to

1094
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,960
that fact that you can literally get

1095
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:53,279
whatever you need in

1096
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,119
perpetuity as long as you're cultivating

1097
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,440
in that system as long as you've got

1098
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,800
adequate organic matter and biology

1099
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,639
uh your plants will be able to mine

1100
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,000
exactly what they need precisely what

1101
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:06,239
they need awesome yeah you mentioned Dr

1102
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,280
lingham's course and I've been wanting

1103
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,479
to take that for several years now it's

1104
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,280
just so hard to find the time you know

1105
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,760
I've got a daughter now and so all my

1106
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,960
time is occupied by her and uh but

1107
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,440
eventually it's on my list of of uh

1108
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,880
courses to tackle there's so many good

1109
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,440
courses out there and so many great

1110
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,720
teachers out there but she's definitely

1111
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,358
that course in particular I think she

1112
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:26,519
has a couple different courses I

1113
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:28,759
definitely want to go through at least

1114
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:30,159
one of them here in the upcoming years

1115
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,200
yeah highly recommended Foundation

1116
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:35,399
course material was a real eye opener

1117
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:37,598
for me let's get into Brewing teas now

1118
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,480
this is an area like I mentioned people

1119
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:42,280
are split upon right so you've got

1120
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,159
different te's first off you know you've

1121
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,040
got everything from nutrient te's manure

1122
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,358
te's you've got te's that focus on

1123
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:50,440
increasing the microbiology but you have

1124
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:53,400
folks that Brew the te's and say it's

1125
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,039
great successful it's very beneficial

1126
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,240
but you've got other there's one

1127
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:58,358
scientist particular I can't remember

1128
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,039
her name but she had mentioned they're

1129
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:02,679
completely pointless nobody should be

1130
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:05,400
Brewing teas adding compost and then

1131
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:07,838
watering in that compost is just as

1132
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,119
beneficial what's your take on Brewing

1133
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:13,440
teas yeah no is definitely a Hot Topic I

1134
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:17,039
think um folks are not going to be

1135
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,159
surprised that my my concept of of tea

1136
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,199
application I think I think first off I

1137
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:23,000
think there there needs to be a an

1138
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,719
important distinction that needs to be

1139
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,599
made uh between um what's commonly

1140
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:31,039
referred to as a tea

1141
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,920
and what should be uh uh classified as

1142
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:36,239
an

1143
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:38,838
extract and so Al what an extract is

1144
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:42,358
just basically simply what the name

1145
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:45,639
states it is you're basically just

1146
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:48,239
extracting biology from a medium whether

1147
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:51,078
it's vermac compost or or thermophilic

1148
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:53,318
compost you you're you're putting um

1149
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:56,200
some of your highquality biocomplete

1150
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:58,440
compost that has all the protozoa and

1151
00:47:56,199 --> 00:48:02,598
protozoa and necessary fungi and

1152
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:04,960
bacteria in there and it's all attached

1153
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:06,640
basically glued and stuck to the organic

1154
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,559
matter in your

1155
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:13,318
compost you put that into like a 220 bag

1156
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:15,400
or paint bag or whatever your uh your um

1157
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:18,960
your bubble bag reused old Bubble Bag

1158
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:24,000
220 thing and we would use that to

1159
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:26,318
dunk the just dunk gently dunk the uh

1160
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,159
compost in and out of kind of room

1161
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:32,639
temperature water and slowly agitating

1162
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:35,118
and knocking off the the biology from

1163
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:39,000
the organic matter and then suspending

1164
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:41,400
it into the liquid Matrix right so now

1165
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,440
you've got you've got this liquid that's

1166
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:50,039
just full of floating biology and um

1167
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,798
that's a really great way to introduce

1168
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:54,480
concentrated biology because you could

1169
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:56,920
use three or four cups dunk it into a 5

1170
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,679
gallon bucket for a minute or 90 seconds

1171
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:03,639
two minutes and then get another one a

1172
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:05,440
fresh load it's like putting two tea

1173
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:07,440
bags of Earl gry in your morning tea

1174
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,838
you're going to get a St a stiff cup of

1175
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:14,000
tea um you or stiff extract we should

1176
00:49:10,838 --> 00:49:17,078
say so you know by doing that you could

1177
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,880
really kind of control the the the

1178
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:21,680
concentration of biology in whatever

1179
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,880
your whatever you're suspending and the

1180
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:26,960
water you're suspending it in and so

1181
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:31,440
what the benefit of that is is that when

1182
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:34,358
you water that in it it really travels

1183
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,400
with the water penetrates deep into the

1184
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:41,358
root Zone where you really want that

1185
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:43,358
biology to reside um very few variables

1186
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:45,558
considering your compost was properly

1187
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:47,199
made you've properly analyzed it you

1188
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:49,000
know you don't have bad guys in there

1189
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:50,199
it's not Anor robic or any of those

1190
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,199
other things and you're not basically

1191
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:55,639
just adding concentrated Anor robes to

1192
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:58,118
your system assuming that all of those

1193
00:49:55,639 --> 00:50:00,440
factors have been met and you've got a

1194
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:02,039
really great Stellar product you're just

1195
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,960
going to be adding those concentrated

1196
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:08,199
microbes directly to the root Zone where

1197
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,400
they belong and that's the safest way

1198
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:13,159
with the fewest variables to introduce

1199
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:17,160
biology into your

1200
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:19,519
system now a t what people call te some

1201
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:21,078
people would call the extract a tea I

1202
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,440
think we should get away from that I

1203
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:25,039
think we should we should call an

1204
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:28,440
extract an extract and we should call

1205
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:31,639
anything that we actively Brew anything

1206
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:35,480
that we're brewing for 4 hours 12 hours

1207
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:38,358
36 hours 72 hours there's all kinds of

1208
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,480
recipes and this is I think where some

1209
00:50:38,358 --> 00:50:42,880
people have

1210
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:45,798
issue and and and I'll say that there is

1211
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:49,079
a time in place for a brooded compost

1212
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:51,079
tea and I think that and this is what I

1213
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:53,000
learned taking Dr Elaine's course I

1214
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:54,720
don't want to sound like a one trick

1215
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,358
pony or just tooting one horn the whole

1216
00:50:54,719 --> 00:51:01,039
time but it she really like lays things

1217
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:04,798
out in in a in a great way when you

1218
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:08,199
brew a tea usually you're adding a food

1219
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:09,838
source it's highly oxygenated and so

1220
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:12,639
what's happening is when you add a food

1221
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:14,960
source and lots of oxygen that biology

1222
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:17,679
is going to multiply and it's going to

1223
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:20,639
breed I think biology uh bacterial

1224
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:23,798
colonies they double every 20 minutes so

1225
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:25,719
there's an exponential growth rate that

1226
00:51:23,798 --> 00:51:27,480
takes place when you're when you're

1227
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:31,239
brewing a te

1228
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:33,079
and and it's this process that if you do

1229
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:35,838
it right you can leverage it in your

1230
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:38,680
favor if you don't do it right you can

1231
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:40,798
be doing nothing at all or you could

1232
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:42,399
actually be causing harm to your system

1233
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:45,318
compounding harm to your system over

1234
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:49,280
time and I'll and I'll I'll uh I'll

1235
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:52,920
explain I'll um a little better so an

1236
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,720
extract great for the root Zone the the

1237
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:58,039
the the biology is just suspended in the

1238
00:51:55,719 --> 00:52:00,039
water flows out the water colonizes the

1239
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:02,519
root Zone gets back onto organic matter

1240
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:05,880
in the soil starts doing its business

1241
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:09,480
let's say you brew a tea that doubling

1242
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:11,559
that multiplication process the biology

1243
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:15,798
just getting busy in there doing their

1244
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:19,960
thing creates a very sticky glomulin

1245
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:24,199
kind of gluey type substance and you can

1246
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:27,280
use that to your benefit by only

1247
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:28,919
applying that as a foler cuz now what

1248
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:34,640
happens is you've got all of that

1249
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:36,838
biology encased in a slimy sticky glue

1250
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:39,358
and when you spray it onto the surface

1251
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:42,400
of a plant or onto the onto the the

1252
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:46,838
trunk of a plant that water is carrying

1253
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:50,000
that sticky substance boom it slaps onto

1254
00:52:46,838 --> 00:52:52,318
the leaf and then the water falls off

1255
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,599
and leaves the biology behind on the

1256
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:58,599
surface of the leaf and so now you've

1257
00:52:54,599 --> 00:53:00,480
got active biology ready to populate the

1258
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:03,079
entire surface of your plant and

1259
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,838
literally create a castle wall a

1260
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:10,318
microscopic wall of biology that covers

1261
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:12,519
all of your plant so when outside spores

1262
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:14,719
land on the plant and try to hook in and

1263
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:17,920
do its thing there's there's nowhere for

1264
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:20,159
it to go it's literally landing on

1265
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:23,400
something else right that's landing on

1266
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:26,039
that biological film that's taking place

1267
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:29,720
if you inversely if you take that sticky

1268
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:32,318
glue e substance and you try to water it

1269
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:34,639
into the soil it's all going to get

1270
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:37,599
stuck at the top layer of your soil and

1271
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:40,480
it's not going to penetrate down deep so

1272
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,359
taking an actively brewed tea and

1273
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,358
applying it to your root

1274
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:46,838
Zone I don't know if it's been

1275
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:49,239
Quantified you know like how much is not

1276
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:51,078
making it down to the bottom but the

1277
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:53,199
vast majority of it going to get trapped

1278
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:56,000
at that upper layer and that upper layer

1279
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:58,078
is the most volatile that upper layer is

1280
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,920
the layer that dries out first and when

1281
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,880
it dries out the biology dies the amoeba

1282
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,960
go into testate form and then eventually

1283
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,039
they die if the moisture doesn't get

1284
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,159
back up back up so you're really you've

1285
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,838
taken all this time to create a te and

1286
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:15,399
what you're trying to accomplish is

1287
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:17,318
being reduced by 80% or even if it's 30%

1288
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,720
reduction in what's being delivered to

1289
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:22,199
the system you kind of have to like

1290
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:27,118
weigh things out like is this even worth

1291
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:30,358
it so if you can think of T's as a folio

1292
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,160
application and extracts as a root Zone

1293
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:34,759
application you're going to eliminate a

1294
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:37,519
lot of variables that could lend itself

1295
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:40,119
to undesirable results or just kind of

1296
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:42,079
results that are me you know so I think

1297
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:45,160
if you follow those two rules you'll be

1298
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:49,760
really you'll be fine now with the

1299
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:53,399
Brewing aspect of it if you're brewing a

1300
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:56,119
tea without the aid of of microscopy

1301
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,680
you're really just rolling the dice um

1302
00:54:56,119 --> 00:55:02,160
what happens is when you've got biology

1303
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:05,118
in there and they're reproducing at this

1304
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:08,078
exponential rate they will eventually

1305
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:10,400
and in very short order use up all of

1306
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,880
the available oxygen it doesn't matter

1307
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,680
how big of an air pump you've got

1308
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:17,119
pumping into your 200 gallons of water

1309
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:20,038
or whatever you'll eventually reach a

1310
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:23,400
Tipping Point of bi of of biological

1311
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:25,839
population that they simply have used

1312
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:28,079
all the oxygen available you you can't

1313
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:30,679
add enough oxygen when it reaches a

1314
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:33,920
certain point now at that point you have

1315
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:36,000
an anerobic brew and all of that good

1316
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,440
biology that you had bloomed or grew

1317
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,920
over 12 hours or 24 hours is now

1318
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,000
starting to die because there's not

1319
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,039
enough oxygen and they're being replaced

1320
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,719
by Anor

1321
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:47,400
robes there's this window when this is

1322
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:49,318
happening that you're not going to be

1323
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,798
able to tell with your old factory

1324
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:53,358
senses that you've gone anerobic now

1325
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:54,759
obviously you let it go long enough it's

1326
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:56,598
going to smell like sewage you're be

1327
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:59,319
like I'm anerobic

1328
00:55:56,599 --> 00:56:00,798
but there's going to be a period where

1329
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:02,558
it's going to smell earthy it's going to

1330
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:04,639
smell okay you're be like oh man I can

1331
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,359
drink this you know like this is great

1332
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:08,199
but it's not great because now you've

1333
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:11,199
started you because oxygen has been

1334
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:13,239
depleted now you've got now you've

1335
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:16,798
created an environment where Anor robes

1336
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:21,318
Thrive and that's where all your harble

1337
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:22,798
pathogenic things uh reside so I

1338
00:56:21,318 --> 00:56:25,679
understand where people are like uh

1339
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:27,880
don't don't Brew you know don't Brew

1340
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:29,679
teas because you you know once again if

1341
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,599
you're not visually seeing what's

1342
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:34,480
happening in there you are literally

1343
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,798
rolling the dice if your Source material

1344
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,199
was full of anoes and you're and that's

1345
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:40,798
what you're using you're just breeding

1346
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:42,798
more Anor robes like you really could be

1347
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:45,159
causing yourself more problems in your

1348
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:47,440
system or just not doing anything at all

1349
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:49,838
and just wasting time and money which

1350
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:55,200
time is the most precious thing that I

1351
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:57,920
have and I hate wasting it and so um I

1352
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:00,000
basically stick to straight extracts I

1353
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,920
don't even really do tease for folar

1354
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,079
applications I've just really never felt

1355
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:08,880
that necessary now if I had an orchard

1356
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:12,519
and um there was all kinds of uh fungal

1357
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:14,640
threats to my Orchard and uh and regular

1358
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:16,599
folar applications made more sense then

1359
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:19,000
I'd be doing that but the kind of crops

1360
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:21,720
that I that I'm involved with just just

1361
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,079
don't have that kind of pressure so I'm

1362
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:26,239
more uh concerned with making sure that

1363
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,160
my soil soil is healthy and the soil

1364
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:32,519
biology is active and then whatever

1365
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:34,480
foliar I do are strictly for a nutrient

1366
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:37,679
or exudate

1367
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,880
enrichment uh tactics or strategies so

1368
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:41,759
would you say that it's impossible to

1369
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,440
answer the question when somebody says

1370
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:48,039
how long brewing tea is too

1371
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:50,559
long yeah because I mean there's so many

1372
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:52,160
different variables as to like what what

1373
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,480
what your starting material was like

1374
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:55,118
what's the temperature where you're

1375
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,039
Brewing it are you temp Brewing it in a

1376
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:59,960
45°

1377
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:02,119
uh pole barn you know in in February in

1378
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:05,039
the northeast or you know are you doing

1379
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:06,720
it in 110 degree weather you know out

1380
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:08,240
the sun beating down on it there so

1381
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,118
there's going to be so many different

1382
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:14,919
variables it's really hard to say and

1383
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:17,160
and the best most responsible answer is

1384
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,440
when you can just have it analyzed

1385
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:21,679
there's plenty of soil food web Labs

1386
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,440
that will analyze your material um

1387
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:25,440
they'll analyze what you've got and let

1388
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,200
you know whether you've got good guys or

1389
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,079
bad guys or at safe to use look if

1390
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:33,838
you've got a a a cash crop um even if

1391
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:36,880
it's just your hobby hobby situation you

1392
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:39,119
know 80 bucks for a test is not the end

1393
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,559
of the world as far as I'm concerned to

1394
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:44,680
to get that peace of mind and and know

1395
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:46,519
where you reside and on the flip side of

1396
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:49,000
that too like you know learning how to

1397
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:51,159
use the microscope and identify the

1398
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,400
constituents of of what you want to find

1399
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:57,078
in there would be well worth it as well

1400
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,480
it's not hard I'm not a brilliant person

1401
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:02,079
I was able to learn the things and able

1402
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:07,679
to apply them in in a way that was

1403
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:09,599
effective and and created um a a nice uh

1404
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:11,440
level of understanding that provided

1405
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,798
comfort in what I was doing and not just

1406
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,400
kind of doing things willy-nilly which

1407
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:18,318
is fine proofs in the pudding but at at

1408
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,960
some level I wanted to know why it was

1409
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:23,279
working and how it was working and the

1410
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:25,720
microscope really just aided in seeing

1411
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,599
uh what was happening uh at this level

1412
00:59:25,719 --> 00:59:28,679
that we can't see I had a feeling you

1413
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,920
were going to say that there was too

1414
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:33,159
many variables in order to answer the

1415
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:35,519
question on the time length there less

1416
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:36,399
is more just do four hours four 6 hours

1417
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:38,239
you're going to get plenty of

1418
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,960
reproduction in that amount of time

1419
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:42,759
obviously the longer you go the longer

1420
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,639
chance you have of depleting your oxygen

1421
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,359
and obviously the smaller vessel you're

1422
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:51,358
brewing in if you're brewing in a five

1423
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:53,880
gallon uh bucket for 72 hours you do not

1424
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:56,838
have an aerobic mix at the end of that I

1425
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:58,119
I I I I'm pretty confident in saying

1426
00:59:56,838 --> 00:59:59,199
that that you know you're you're

1427
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:01,318
definitely going to be tipping the

1428
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:04,038
scales into the Anor robic you know and

1429
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:05,480
so less is more if you could do a 4our

1430
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:07,720
brew and that makes you feel better and

1431
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,798
you're good do it because there's every

1432
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:11,838
20 minutes the microbial population the

1433
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:14,639
bacterial population doubles every 20

1434
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:16,960
minutes so 12 hours is a long time when

1435
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:20,318
you've got this exponential growth and

1436
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:22,199
certainly 72 good to know man what a

1437
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:24,599
conversation we have reached the hour

1438
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:26,358
mark here and uh man there's a lot more

1439
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:27,798
we could have got into and this episode

1440
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:29,358
but I think we might have to get you

1441
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:31,079
back on another episode if you're

1442
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:33,199
willing to come back on in the future

1443
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:34,519
here at some point I'd be thrilled that

1444
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:35,798
would be awesome yeah we can get in

1445
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:38,719
things such as like cover crops

1446
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:40,719
companion planting mulch layers there's

1447
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,639
managing Pest and diseases in an

1448
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:44,519
allnatural way there's so many different

1449
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,358
things that we can get into that relate

1450
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:48,159
to living soil so I'd love to have you

1451
01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:49,838
on for a part two but let's wrap things

1452
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:51,279
up here can you tell listeners how they

1453
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:53,639
can find you and what you have upcoming

1454
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,160
in the future Yeah so basically you can

1455
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:57,960
really just find me on Instagram um just

1456
01:00:56,159 --> 01:01:00,719
use my name I don't use a handle so it's

1457
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:03,358
just Joshua C steensland on Instagram I

1458
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:05,279
do have a YouTube channel with a lot of

1459
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:07,000
like that older material it's still

1460
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,720
valuable a lot of that there's a few

1461
