1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,149
what is up everybody feel that don't

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,099
know me my name is mr. grow it and today

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,569
I've got a topic video for you in this

4
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,029
video I'm going to assemble a 2 foot by

5
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,589
4 foot grow town every grow tent should

6
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:12,299
have instructions that come along with

7
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:14,429
it so make sure you're following the

8
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,560
instructions but for the most part these

9
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,719
two foot by four foot grow tents should

10
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,160
be assembled just about the same as you

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,778
can see here I have the pieces of the

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,219
grow tent laid out there are six

13
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,350
different poles included and then

14
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,329
they're also in pieces as well as the

15
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,189
main cover of the grow tent

16
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:32,159
let me pause it right here so my camera

17
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,409
actually cut out as I was filming this

18
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,359
so we're beginning here with a little

19
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,039
bit already assembled anyways as you can

20
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,619
see I assemble the bottom pieces first

21
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,640
then I assembled some of the poles it's

22
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:43,530
actually not connected all the way at

23
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,558
the top just yet and then I basically

24
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,989
slid the cover underneath so the cover

25
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,359
the grow tent is actually on the bottom

26
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:54,238
part there so from here I'll connect the

27
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,519
top pieces you know so you got a piece

28
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,439
on each of the corners and then after

29
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,289
you attach all of those pieces onto the

30
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,808
corners you start to pull up the grow

31
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,519
tent around the top there you need to

32
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,590
make sure the cover is actually unzipped

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,689
entirely or else you won't be able to

34
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,400
pull over the grow tent so as you can

35
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:13,919
see here I'm pulling over the grow tent

36
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,868
and it kind of it's pretty snug so it

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,180
takes a little bit in order to get it

38
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,560
over there but being able to put it on

39
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,659
the bottom first and then kind of bring

40
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,210
it over the top it just makes it much

41
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,090
easier than it is assembling the entire

42
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:29,069
frame and then trying to just snug it

43
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,350
over so I pulled over the rest of the

44
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:32,938
cover and zipped it up entirely so

45
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:34,828
here's what it looks like when it is

46
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:36,389
closed all right now I've unzipped it

47
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,789
and you can kind of see the inside there

48
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,159
there's multiple ports all along the top

49
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,380
and the bottom of different sizes

50
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,290
depending on which grow tent you get and

51
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:49,199
then at the very top here I putting the

52
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,729
top bars in to hang the light so this

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,829
particular grow tent a 2 foot by 4 foot

54
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:55,019
comes with two bars they basically set

55
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:56,908
across from each other and then there's

56
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,560
a shot of what the grow tent looks like

57
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,670
when it's complete that's pretty much it

58
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,670
for this video guys I just want to do a

59
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,799
real quick video showing you how to

60
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,090
assemble this grow tent by the way this

61
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,829
is my second YouTube channel if you

62
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,500
haven't noticed it this channels gonna

63
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,068
be for lesser effort type of videos I

64
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,919
guess you can

65
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:16,318
I spent a lot of time and effort on my

66
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,699
main channel that show has close to 30

67
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,169
thousand subscribers at this point so

68
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,639
it's growing like crazy but I really

69
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:23,548
feel like you know the amount of time I

70
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,108
