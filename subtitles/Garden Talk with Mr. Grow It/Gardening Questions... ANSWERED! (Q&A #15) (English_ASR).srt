00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,600
hey what's up everybody welcome back to

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,298
my channel for you that don't know me my

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,859
name is Chris aka Mr Grow it and today I

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,359
got a q a video for you if this is your

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,519
first time tuning in to one of my q a

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,199
videos I record them live on Twitch

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,079
every single month so if you have

8
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,059
questions head on over to twitch.tv Mr

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,979
Grow it hit the follow button make sure

10
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,379
notifications are on and the next time I

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,179
go live tune into it and you can ask

12
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:25,379
questions and if you do tune in to one

13
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,239
of the live streams and ask questions

14
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,939
they may be featured in a future video

15
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,579
okay now let's get into the questions

16
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,439
how many plants would you recommend in a

17
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,439
three by three grow tent and what's set

18
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,899
up like pot size 3x3 I would do four

19
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,238
smaller plants maybe two medium-sized

20
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,219
plants or one big plant and a three by

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,738
three that's what I would do as far as

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,759
pot size probably three gallon pots you

23
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:49,979
know if you're keeping it with the

24
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,719
smaller plants four smaller plants and

25
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,759
three gallons or maybe even shove a

26
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,320
seven gallon in that three by three and

27
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,159
just do one plant whatever you want to

28
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,259
do you can definitely have some

29
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,299
flexibility there when you Peach your

30
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,698
water does it matter if you use a glass

31
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,198
or plastic cup do I don't know if I

32
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,359
fully understand your question so when i

33
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:08,280
ph my water what I'm doing I use a five

34
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,640
gallon bucket put the water in there

35
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,500
then I'm taking the ph up or PH down and

36
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,019
then dropping it directly into the water

37
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,819
and that's that's a plastic bucket is

38
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:20,039
what I use now I'm not sure maybe you're

39
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,019
asking if it's a nutrient solution

40
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,000
inside that five gallon bucket then what

41
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,920
I'll do in order what they say is dilute

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,118
the ph up and Peach down first in water

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,739
and then pour it in the nutrient

44
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,259
solution so you don't have precipitants

45
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,899
and so uh yeah put into a little little

46
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,400
glass of water page up PH down mix it in

47
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,780
there and then put it into the bucket of

48
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,180
nutrient solution hopefully that answers

49
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,219
your question Mr Grote asks what is a

50
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,618
good bagged soil besides the one you use

51
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,840
in your videos well shout out to our

52
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,060
sponsor happy Hydro they sell soham

53
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,060
Living soil really really good product

54
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,799
Omri certified organic this is what a

55
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,478
lot of people consider as a super soil

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,280
now of course it's going to depend on

57
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,840
the size of container that you're using

58
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,478
but a lot of people are actually

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,859
planting into this soil and then growing

60
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,420
their entire plant all the way up to

61
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:05,280
harvest without adding any other

62
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,159
nutrients in there so big shout out to

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,899
happy Hydro if you buy from them it's a

64
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,340
one to three day shipping on their

65
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,560
product so it can get to you pretty

66
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,659
quickly depending on where you are in

67
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,098
the states definitely have a link to a

68
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:18,959
heavy Hydro down in the YouTube

69
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:20,519
description section below how long did

70
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,400
it take you to dial in your organic

71
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,340
growing I like this question so when I

72
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,260
first started using organic inputs I was

73
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,020
using Earth dust nutrients by the green

74
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:33,419
Sunshine Company rest in peace that that

75
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,000
brand is no longer exists they close the

76
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,500
door and the end of 2022 I'm not sure if

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,680
you guys knew about that or not but

78
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,120
that's a bummer but I didn't know that

79
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,500
you should be keeping the media moist at

80
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,000
all times so those amendments to break

81
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,519
down something I've been talking about

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,959
for so much over the years since I've

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,219
learned that and been doing that but

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,598
people still make that mistake as

85
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,699
they'll top just those nutrients in

86
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,079
water them in and then they'll go right

87
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,639
to what they were doing with synthetics

88
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,780
where they have dry backs you know

89
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,059
they'll wait for the medium to dry out

90
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,919
before watering again well with Organics

91
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,878
unfortunately the microbes go dormant

92
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,458
and then they're not breaking down

93
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,259
nutrients so keeping that Medium moist

94
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,819
keeping those amendments moist it took

95
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:10,500
me a few grows to really realize that

96
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:11,818
and dial things in I do want to get my

97
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,639
hands on a moisture meter though that

98
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:17,219
should make things a lot easier blue mat

99
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,139
actually has a well actually their

100
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,000
company name is sustainable Village they

101
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:21,899
have a nice digital moisture medium I'm

102
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,580
trying to get my hands on I think it's

103
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,680
like 85 bucks or something like that but

104
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,659
uh if I can get one of those I can dial

105
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,640
in waterings a lot better and then of

106
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:32,759
course adding in the blue mats that's

107
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,679
how helps dial in the moisture level but

108
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,019
yeah that was the main thing in regards

109
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,739
to dialing in organic growing was just

110
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,480
dialing in that moisture of the medium

111
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:45,239
no-till or super soil and what's the

112
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,639
difference so super soil is generally

113
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,519
just a soil that has all the nutrients

114
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,859
needed in it for the entire grow so like

115
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,599
I just mentioned sohum living soil they

116
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,340
consider it a super soil where basically

117
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:57,780
you just take that whole bag put into I

118
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,239
believe a seven gallon container for

119
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,219
like a 1.5 cubic foot bag and then plant

120
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,620
the seed in there and then you know you

121
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:05,878
do a 30 day veg or so once you flip over

122
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,378
the flour there should be enough

123
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,919
nutrients to last throughout the entire

124
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:12,359
Grill no-till is just basically not

125
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,579
disturbing the soil at all you're

126
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,439
basically just adding on amendments up

127
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,019
to that top of the soil and you're not

128
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,699
like disturbing it at all so two

129
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,800
different things there and uh yeah

130
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,360
no-till is a very common practice these

131
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,919
days with particularly with Organics

132
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,120
because you've got the microbes in there

133
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,219
that are working for you to break down

134
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,319
nutrients and if you're disturbing the

135
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,300
soil at all you're killing off microbes

136
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,399
so a lot of people are going towards no

137
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,620
till if you could go back and give

138
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:40,500
beginner Chris one tip what would it be

139
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,540
it would probably be learn what nitrogen

140
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:48,060
toxicity is because beginner Chris

141
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,819
overfed and had nitrogen toxicity and

142
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,800
wiped out a grill wiped out five plants

143
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,379
that came out terrible because of

144
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,960
nitrogen toxicity so beginner Chris

145
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,180
learn what nitrogen toxicity is if you

146
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,819
have very dark leaves and they're shiny

147
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,579
and they're curling then that's most

148
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:08,759
likely nitrogen toxicity and always

149
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:11,219
check the PPM or EC so that way you're

150
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,840
not over feeding Zaza genetics asks how

151
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,139
are things going with your chill out OG

152
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:18,359
going pretty good on the f3s right now

153
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,699
so inbreeding learned a lot from you

154
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,979
Zaza I hope you know that I'm doing the

155
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,900
inbreeding so I'm on f3s right now I'm

156
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:27,300
going to be planting the f3s and seeing

157
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:29,038
how they turn out but uh so far so good

158
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,139
I'm getting the structure I'm looking

159
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,360
for over overall I'm looking for kind of

160
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,000
the the smaller structure plant bud

161
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,100
structure of the briskero G it's

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,779
actually a Brisco OG across the Pakistan

163
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,460
Valley the Pakistan Valley is a land

164
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:42,959
race train actually by world of seeds so

165
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:44,279
kind of the smaller structure Indica

166
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,680
side of things of the Pakistan Valley

167
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,239
the bud structure of the preschool G and

168
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,439
kind of a mixture of the terp profile is

169
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,259
what I'm looking for but yeah so far

170
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,839
it's going pretty good long process long

171
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,939
process for this and I know there's tons

172
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,219
of people been asking me for them it's

173
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,079
just not ready should be ready this year

174
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,840
though fingers crossed what are your

175
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,459
go-to dry amendments in most recent

176
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,899
years I've just been using the builders

177
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:08,579
Hill craft blend I've talked about this

178
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,439
on my channel I have a handful of times

179
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,418
large handful of times but that's

180
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,459
actually has everything you need in

181
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:18,000
order to get through the grow and it's a

182
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:19,560
just one mix one blend for the entire

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,600
Grove so it's not a separate one for veg

184
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,100
and a separate one for flowers is what

185
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,199
I'm getting at and I'll do an initial

186
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,240
amending I was using a salmon gallon

187
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,280
container one cup of boil soil craft

188
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,139
blend I'm ending it in to begin letting

189
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,659
it cook for for a week two weeks

190
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,579
planting into letting the plant grow 30

191
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,860
days after the plant sprouted from The

192
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:40,859
Medium 20 to 30 days I'm adding in

193
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,860
another cup per plant and then uh really

194
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,960
every 30 days just a cup per plant onto

195
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,300
the medium top dressing it in and that's

196
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,120
it so that's been my go-to as far as

197
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,360
other amendments alfalfa meal kelp meal

198
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,620
use once in a while I've used grokashi I

199
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,900
like that for breakdown I like to

200
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,840
putting that in my compost bin as well

201
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,279
my worm bin insect frass another member

202
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,079

203
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:06,000

215

have a whole list of things a whole list

216
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,300
of things let's just go over we can

217
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,918
right rombury by freedom of seeds don't

218
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,079
know too much about that ended up being

219
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,240
a free freebie from attitude my old

220
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,098

221

homegrown Co Amnesia fast by seeds men

223

sour grape Rock Candy by welcome to the

224
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,859
grow tent all those four that I just

225
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,660
mentioned are Femmes so guaranteed

226
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,220
female as long as they sprout sometimes

227
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,199
they don't have a good male female ratio

228
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,580
so I wanted to throw some Femmes in

229
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,079
there to make sure I get some the rest

230
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,879
of these are going to be regular so they

231
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,318
could be the male or females I might

232
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,579
plant them grow them and have to kill

233
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,039
them off because they end up being males

234
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:07,560
