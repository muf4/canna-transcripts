1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,459
coming up on Garden talk if you're

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:07,740
adding uh you know algae to the soil if

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:10,138
you're adding rocks in whatever you're

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,000
doing to the soil you can come back and

5
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:14,058
measure it two or three four weeks later

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,740
and see whether it's having an impact

7
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:19,559
increasing the biomass because if it is

8
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:24,179
you want to continue to do it but when

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:27,778
the plant seed germinates in new soil it

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:31,559
brings with it the kinds of bacteria

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:33,960
that are beneficial to that particular

12
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,960
plant start out knowing what the soil

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,899
food web is it's going to be really easy

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,579
to start gardening if you go chemical

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,160
you've got to figure out what those

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,859
chemicals do how much to use how much to

17
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:52,019
measure when to use them when not to use

18
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:53,519
them it really makes gardening work and

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,039
it's not supposed to be work it's

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,039
supposed to be a wonderful Hobby

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,299

88
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,000
in 2022. I just ordered that today

89
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,399
actually super excited for that one I

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,780
can't wait to start reading it yeah me

91
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,140
too

92
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,360
no it's I I've obviously read it but uh

93
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:57,059
it really messed me up because I used to

94
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,780
have a Trilogy so I call myself lord of

95
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,378
the roots and now it's what's known as a

96
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,840
quadrilogy uh actually a word quadrilogy

97
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:09,840
uh four books on the same basic subject

98
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,959
that's what it means uh and so it's it's

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,400
it's pretty exciting I I can't wait for

100
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,340
people to get into this new book because

101
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,680
it really is a major change to the soil

102
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,839
food web no I can't wait yeah I'm super

103
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,840
excited let's talk about today's episode

104
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,179
I'd like to get into microbes and I want

105
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,339
to start with the basics of the soil

106
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,040
food web and then get a bit deeper into

107
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,478
things but first before we do that what

108
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,979
I like to do with all guests is an

109
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:36,599
introduction can you tell us a little

110
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:40,079
bit about yourself and how you got into

111
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,979
gardening well uh I'm 73 years old maybe

112
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,779
70 yeah maybe 74. uh I started gardening

113
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:47,579
when I was about six months old in a

114
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:50,879
little basket my father used to bring me

115
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:53,939
out to his his gigantic Garden he was a

116
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,680
frustrated uh New York City worker who

117
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:57,300
lived out in the country and he would

118
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,519
come home and he would garden and if you

119
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,060
wanted to be around my dad you gardened

120
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:07,579
uh and so I learned at an early age

121
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:11,160
unfortunately he was not organic until

122
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:14,219
oh I would say I was about 15 so I

123
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,860
learned as a chemical head and then was

124
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,600
exposed to organic gardening which you

125
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,360
had just started actually back then

126
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,620
believe it or not and uh I've been

127
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,500
gardening ever since and I've been

128
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:29,160
organic basically ever since with one

129
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,199
small exception a chemical that is very

130
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,199
well known a very well known fertilizer

131
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,300
the guy that the guy that it was in

132
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:40,160
charge and then sort of invented the

133
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:43,379
company uh and it ends in Gro

134
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,660
uh worked for my dad and my grandfather

135
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,699
and put my picture on a margarine

136
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,100
package they were in the butter business

137
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:53,699
and so he he made me happy boy margarine

138
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,580
you can Google that and find my picture

139
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,439
um but because of our friendship with

140
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:01,620
him we would be organic except

141
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,899
occasionally we'd use that product I've

142
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,959
learned since that that product is not

143
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:08,819
good for the soil food web and that

144
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,978
probably gives us a good jump off point

145
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,680
to talk about what the soil food web is

146
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:15,300
yeah absolutely what is the soil food

147
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,939
web and why should gardeners care about

148
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,100
it okay well everybody I think is a

149
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,199
familiar with what's known as a food

150
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,819
chain you know where the little guy gets

151
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,560
eaten by the bigger guy who gets eaten

152
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,319
by the bigger guy well there are all

153
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,600
these chains down in the soil of various

154
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,759
organisms and every now and then

155
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,100
something on one of the chains looks up

156
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,500
or looks down and sees a different chain

157
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,139
and says hey I can I can eat that guy

158
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,478
and so they connect These Chains get

159
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:46,620
connected together and they form a web

160
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:50,699
it's basically a description of who eats

161
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,560
whom in the soil now normally we would

162
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,780
leave it there but we're gardeners and

163
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,759
so we grow vegetables and we grow

164
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:59,879
flowers we grow all sorts of terrific

165
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:03,840
plants and so so from our perspective

166
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:07,978
the soil food web also includes the

167
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:10,079
plant and the plant is in charge it

168
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:12,599
takes photosynthetic energy up to 50

169
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,698
percent of it and it creates these

170
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,740
things that drip out of the root Zone

171
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:21,840
that attract bacteria and uh uh fungi

172
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,879
and they're attracting the bacteria and

173
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,598
fungi because the bacteria and fungi

174
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:29,819
need the carbon that's in these exudates

175
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,399
you're actually dating right now sweat

176
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:36,479
uh and that sweat actually attracts

177
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:40,258
bacteria uh and fungi uh uh but in the

178
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,959
soil it attracts the bacteria and fungi

179
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,580
they're very happy living right by the

180
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,799
root Zone in what's known as the

181
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:50,038
rhizosphere that little area right

182
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,759
around the root uh and and they in turn

183
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:55,318
attract the things that eat them

184
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:58,620
protozoa which we all studied in high

185
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:00,120
school amoebas and parameciums if people

186
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,120
think back to 10th grade they may

187
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,538
remember that from biology class uh and

188
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,379
and uh nematodes which are a true

189
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:13,500
microscopic worm they're hair size uh

190
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:15,719
and they eat the bacteria and the fungi

191
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,459
because they need carbon too and so they

192
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,319
take the carbon out of the bacteria and

193
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:25,138
fungi uh and the excess is pooped out

194
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,080
for one of a better word and it's

195
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:32,038
nutrients in plant usable form

196
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:36,059
particularly all important nitrogen and

197
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:38,458
this is moved into the plant and that is

198
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:41,458
how the plant feeds itself now notice I

199
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,679
say the plant feeds itself the plant is

200
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,838
in control and if it needs a different

201
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,239
kind of food if it needs to protect

202
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,360
itself a different way it can attract

203
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,360
different populations of bacteria and

204
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,600
fungi to do what the plant needs it to

205
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,120
do the plant is in control not me and

206
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,820
you the gardeners it's the plant that's

207
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,399
in control so that's that's the basic

208
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,760
soil food web system but there have been

209
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:11,700
over the years three things I'm going to

210
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:14,179
say that have added to that soil food

211
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,700
web picture the first is known as

212
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:20,458
rhizobia bacteria you and I know that as

213
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:24,120
the as stuff that we roll close you know

214
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:27,539
that we roll legumes in uh and it forms

215
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,820
uh when the root hairs form uh they curl

216
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:32,639
around a bacteria that's attracted to

217
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,278
the plant by the plant uh which gives

218
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,580
that bacteria a little a little space

219
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:42,000
where oxygen can be limited and it can

220
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:44,160
fix nitrogen feed the plant feed the

221
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,899
soil so that's that's the second part of

222
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,819
the soil food web the third part of the

223
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:51,839
soil food web which I covered in in in

224
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:56,940
the book in 2017 I guess uh teeming with

225
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,760
fungi are are the fungi that associate

226
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:03,300
with the roots and form a symbiotic

227
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:06,059
relationship mycorrhizal fungi and they

228
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:08,519
take these nutrients from the soil and

229
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:10,739
move them right into the plants so we've

230
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,839
got basically two things that are moving

231
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,240
nutrients into the plant this rhizobia

232
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,820
uh although more of it comes when it

233
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,700
dies uh and these these mycorrhizal

234
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:23,760
function okay now the the fourth book

235
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:27,300
teeming with bacteria is about what are

236
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:31,200
known as endophytic bacteria some of

237
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:33,299
those bacteria that are attracted by the

238
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,519
exudates that the plant is producing as

239
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:38,639
a result of photosynthetic synthetic

240
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:42,899
energy that it's using some of those

241
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:48,419
bacteria are tricked by the plant to

242
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:51,000
back into the very tips cells the

243
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:53,578
meristem cells in the root and they're

244
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
they're tricked to back into that cell

245
00:10:53,578 --> 00:11:01,278
they go through the cell wall but they

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,919
don't go into you know the the membraned

247
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:08,220
cytoplasm section of the cell so if you

248
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:09,659
would imagine I always use the tofu

249
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,720
container that you see at your

250
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:15,240
Supermarket the outer white part that

251
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,040
plastic that's the cell wall

252
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:22,740
of the root meristem cell the tofu in

253
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:25,500
the inside is all of the goodies that

254
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:29,220
are inside the cell the you know all the

255
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:32,039
things that that make enzymes and do all

256
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,980
the all the organelles but around that

257
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:37,759
tofu it's floating in this water that's

258
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,440
known in in cellular talk as the

259
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,078
periplasmic space and that's where these

260
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:47,519
bacteria end up and they get in there

261
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:51,599
and the plants sprays them with a

262
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:55,078
special super oxygenated uh uh chemical

263
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:59,519
molecules and they strip off

264
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:03,000
the cell wall of the bacteria and absorb

265
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,778
that internally and then they don't have

266
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,059
a cell wall they begin to move around

267
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:11,700
the that little liquid section in the

268
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:14,338
tofu container uh and as they do they

269
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,920
don't have any cell wall anymore they

270
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:19,200
multiply bacteria multiply every 20

271
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:20,759
seconds I mean every 20 minutes now they

272
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,019
don't have a cell wall so it's probably

273
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:28,919
even quicker and as they multiply

274
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:31,399
they produce a nitrate that they spray

275
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:35,879
at the plant to stop it

276
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:39,360
from causing it to Decay and and that

277
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:42,778
turns into nitrates which the plant

278
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,120
absorbs now these bacteria circulating

279
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:47,879
around the plant is circulating these

280
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,778
bacteria and they're multiplying inside

281
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:54,240
the plant roots mirrors themselves and

282
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:57,659
they're also producing ethylene which

283
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,459
causes the root to stretch out the cell

284
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:01,980
begins to stretch out that's what

285
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:05,278
ethylene does inside a cell

286
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:08,039
when they get too plentiful they back up

287
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,838
against the cell wall producing ethylene

288
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,199
it's not being circulated anymore it's

289
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,500
being produced in one spot they create a

290
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:21,660
little tube to form in the in the cell

291
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:24,360
wall and outgrows a road hair and the

292
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:27,120
bacteria are thrown into that root hair

293
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,480
and they're blown out of that root here

294
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,578
and there are five or six explosions as

295
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,278
the root hair grows

296
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:38,699
throwing these bacteria back out into

297
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:42,539
the soil where they regrow their cell

298
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:45,000
walls re-nutrify themselves and then a

299
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:48,419
couple three or four days later go back

300
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,059
into a new mirror stem cell to to do the

301
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:51,919
same thing so what we've got is the

302
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:55,018
plant

303
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:57,838
sort of farming in the first instance

304
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,519
it's it's it's putting an exudate out

305
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,639
there it's attracting bacteria it's

306
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,700
detracting and it's and it and it Farms

307
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,620
those guys now we've got a situation

308
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:11,278
where the plant is bringing them into

309
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,679
the barn shearing Off the Wall taking a

310
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,480
couple of you know lamb chops and then

311
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,599
putting these guys back out into the

312
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,480
pasture so they're ranching so we've got

313
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,560
plants farming and ranching that latter

314
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,860
part is known as I pronounce it the

315
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:31,018
rhizophagy cycle rhizo meaning root

316
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,019
remember rhizosphere that area right

317
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:36,000
around the root and fagi which means eat

318
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,459
so it's like root eating it got that

319
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,578
name because the discoverer in Australia

320
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:44,399
in 2010 so it's brand new that's why you

321
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:46,559
probably haven't heard about it uh

322
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,159
literally thought that the cell was

323
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:53,578
opening up and bringing in the the

324
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,559
bacteria that not happening now and

325
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:59,458
there's a gentleman named Dr James White

326
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:02,039
at Rutgers University who is really the

327
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:03,599
guru of this stuff now uh and it's

328
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,059
really quite something so we've got Dr

329
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,800
Elaine Ingham uh you know with the

330
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:08,939
original soil food web and all those

331
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,979
good you know the grease and the

332
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,620
mycorrasal funds and all of a sudden

333
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:17,039
we've got this new thing that results

334
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:20,220
from the ability to be able to see uh

335
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:22,620
using different kind of microscopy and

336
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,180
different kinds of testing to to ensure

337
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,759
that what's going on is what we think is

338
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:29,399
going on so

339
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,799
that was a mouthful wasn't it that's

340
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,720
absolutely fascinating so much good

341
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,299
information there I do want to back up

342
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,800
to the rhizo sphere you mentioned that

343
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,659
pretty briefly and from my understanding

344
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,639
the rhizosphere is a very very small

345
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:43,860
area we're talking one to three

346
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,620
millimeters that's directly outside the

347
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,720
root Zone and that's really that's where

348
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,959
the cookies and cakes with Dr Landing

349
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,699
hand talks about are in that area and

350
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:56,099
then that's where the actual exchange is

351
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:57,599
happening with the bacteria and I've got

352
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,060
some pictures of that by the way in in

353
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,759
teaming with bacteria phenomenal

354
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:05,399
pictures of of these extra dates

355
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,899
attracting bacteria in that little in

356
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,839
that little Zone there it's really

357
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:13,620
really phenomenal oh that's so cool so

358
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,940
so the pH of the rhizosphere versus in

359
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,399
the medium so a lot of folks the

360
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,860
gardening they will do a runoff test to

361
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,440
check the pH or they'll do a slurry test

362
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,060
or they'll use like the blue lab probe

363
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,420
that you can stick right into the medium

364
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:29,278
and get an idea of what pH is however

365
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,379
from my understanding the pH in the

366
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,059
rhizosphere can be drastically different

367
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:35,278
can you talk to us about that a little

368
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:37,439
bit yeah of course it can uh and really

369
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,539
it's the only pH that that counts if

370
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,459
you're an organic Gardener uh you don't

371
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:43,198
care what the pH is up on the surface

372
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,239
there no roots there and you know

373
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,979
nothing nothing's being absorbed there

374
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,299
and incidentally when I use that word

375
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,240
absorb

376
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:53,458
root hairs when I learned and when you

377
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,519
learned we always thought the purpose of

378
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:58,258
a root here was not to put bacteria out

379
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,539
into the soil which turns out to be

380
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:03,659
their real purpose but to absorb

381
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:06,058
nutrients which they do but I think they

382
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:08,639
absorb the nutrients as the root grows

383
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:10,859
you know the the older hairs are there

384
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,360
and uh you know they're not I don't

385
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,698
think they're absorbing nutrients as

386
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,078
they're as they're blowing up uh and

387
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,079
again the pictures in the book are

388
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,279
phenomenal literally you see these

389
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:23,639
bacteria

390
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:25,259
pushed into this tube that is the root

391
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,540
here the root hair is part of that

392
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:29,400
original cell and

393
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:32,460
they're blown out in it's just

394
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,740
absolutely amazing uh

395
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,100
yeah but but it's the you know it's the

396
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,200
pH May matter to them out there but you

397
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:42,359
and I as as gardeners taking care of

398
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,460
plants it's the ph and that rises fear

399
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:46,918
that we really care about uh and it's

400
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,319
caused by all the metabolites and the

401
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,440
extradates and and whatnot that are

402
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:55,500
produced you know we we don't recognize

403
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:59,220
how big these populations of microbes

404
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,839
are bacteria holy crow I always

405
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,759
encourage people I didn't include the

406
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:05,879
picture in the book because it cost 400

407
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:10,200
but I always encourage people to to look

408
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:12,539
up on the web uh head of a pin bacteria

409
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,759
and then go to images and there's

410
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:16,740
several pictures of bacteria on the head

411
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:18,240
when we think of bacteria you know we're

412
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,519
not we're not thinking about the

413
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,319
unbelievable numbers that are there well

414
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,980
they're producing stuff all the time

415
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:28,319
that impacts the quality of the soil uh

416
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,079
slime which creates soil structure and

417
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,399
sticks things together uh and and and

418
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:35,699
the pH

419
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,400
uh it's really really all happening at

420
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,720
this little TV level uh and and we don't

421
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,519
know about it as gardeners because we

422
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,038
can't really see it so would you say

423
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,980
measuring the pH of the runoff or doing

424
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:50,160
a slurry test is is pointless or not

425
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,419
useful to do because of the ph and the

426
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,460
rhizosphere being the only thing that

427
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:56,280
really matters I've never had any real

428
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,500
use for it although it's it's it's nice

429
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,019
to know what the pH is in general I mean

430
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,000
if you if you take your pH

431
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,798
someplace in the root Zone not

432
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,140
necessarily A rhizosphere you know and

433
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,720
it's way out of whack you know there

434
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,880
there there's a need for a fix there

435
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,440
um because if it's not impacting the

436
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,760
bacteria and the fungi and the nematodes

437
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,558
and the protozoa are right there and the

438
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,240
rhizosphere it's impacting other

439
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,819
microbes that are in the soil food web

440
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,640
that are outside of the rhizosphere so

441
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:26,279
uh yeah I mean they're not they're not

442
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,799
particularly a waste what I like is it

443
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,980
and I have to reveal that I'm an advisor

444
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:34,259
to the company is something called a

445
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:36,779
microbiometer uh an invention that that

446
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:40,558
enables you for five bucks and ten

447
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:44,038
minutes to test the microbiomass of your

448
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:48,538
soil which correlates to nutrients and

449
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:50,279
it also has built in now a pH reading uh

450
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:52,500
and so you can sort of correlate some of

451
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:55,220
this stuff together it's it's really

452
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,919
quite an invention you can find it at

453
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:00,720
www.microbiometer

454
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,940
microbiometer.com uh it's it's really

455
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,400
quite quite useful because it tells you

456
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,259
whether what you're doing is teaming

457
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,600
with microbes so yeah I was going to ask

458
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:11,279
you about the microbiometer so what

459
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,798
would you do with that information if

460
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:16,019
you were to get a result and the result

461
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,759
is correct me if I'm wrong I'm not too

462
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:19,918
familiar with it it gives you a bacteria

463
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,720
to fungi ratio and then you can kind of

464
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,820
make adjustments from there so how would

465
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,200
somebody go about taking the reading and

466
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:29,038
then making adjustments in the garden

467
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,740
well it also gives you a number so so

468
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:34,679
initially it was just the number and

469
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,019
then the company added fungal bacteria

470
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:40,038
because it's so important and the reason

471
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:43,079
why it's important is because fungal

472
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:45,359
dominated soils versus bacteria

473
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:47,460
dominated soils are produced two

474
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,859
different kinds of nitrogen and so

475
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,798
things that are in the ground for less

476
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:54,839
than a year that would be vegetables

477
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:55,940
annuals uh you know row crop kind of

478
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:59,159
things

479
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,558
they like they like the nitrate that

480
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:05,580
bacteria produce when they bring break

481
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:08,099
down and Decay organic material whereas

482
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:10,259
trees and shrubs they like the stuff

483
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:12,599
that fungi break down and so you want to

484
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:14,579
try to get a ratio that's

485
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,379
appropriate for your particular kind of

486
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:18,480
plant and that's a real gross

487
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,960
oversimplification

488
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,339
um you you need both in in the system

489
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,179
but

490
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:27,000
um

491
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:29,220
the number tells you

492
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,558
a starting point and then you take a

493
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,319
test later on if the number is high

494
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:38,940
enough you you know right away that your

495
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:41,939
soils are good if the number is low or

496
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:45,179
and or changes based upon what you're

497
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,820
doing if you're adding uh you know algae

498
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:49,798
to the soil if you're adding rocks in

499
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:51,779
whatever you're doing to the soil you

500
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:53,639
can come back and measure it two or

501
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:55,980
three four weeks later and see whether

502
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,559
it's having an impact increasing the

503
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,839
biomass because if it is you want to

504
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,460
continue to do it got it okay you

505
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:04,139
mentioned algae I want to actually talk

506
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,759
about that that's it it's really

507
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,500
interesting because a lot of people see

508
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,240
algae in their Garden they think it's a

509
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,700
bad thing they think they need to start

510
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,380
eradicating the algae they need much of

511
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,880
changes in the garden but after reading

512
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,820
your book team with microbes you have a

513
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,679
section in there for algae and it's

514
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:21,418
super interesting can you talk to us

515
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,280
about algae yeah I'm trying to remember

516
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,960
I I was going to say to you that was the

517
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,779
one thing I left out of TV with microbes

518
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,360
I you know I wrote the book in 2000 six

519
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,440
originally what you have is the revised

520
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,979
Edition

521
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,298
um

522
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:39,480
uh and incidentally on page 47 I think

523
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:41,519
of the of the first edition of either

524
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,940
the revised Edition or the regular as

525
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,918
well as the audio uh I reverse the

526
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:53,159
definition of pH

527
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:57,179
is low when you have lots of uh hydrogen

528
00:22:53,159 --> 00:23:00,240
ions and fungi tend to produce a lower

529
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:03,538
pH bacteria tend to produce a higher pH

530
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,839
now I forgot your question oh algae so

531
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:09,480
algae algae is has a couple of really

532
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:13,019
kind of neat properties it helps in

533
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:18,659
forming soil structure uh and it's a

534
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:21,058
it's a uh organic uh food for microbes

535
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:22,140
and so you know it it has a lot of

536
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:24,000
purposes and of course it's

537
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,860
photosynthetic

538
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,140
um and any and so it can be adding to

539
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:29,339
the soil in that regard it's it's and

540
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,799
and you're right people don't understand

541
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:34,019
it's in the soil it's in deserts you

542
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:37,500
know we tend to think algae algae that's

543
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:41,038
that's Pond scum uh it's you know it's

544
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:44,279
not in soil it's not a desert with algae

545
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:46,319
yeah they have these little pads of PODS

546
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:48,418
of algae and stuff it's it's interesting

547
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,220
stuff uh I you know I don't encourage

548
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,799
people to go out and add algae to their

549
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,679
Garden but you can uh and you surely

550
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,538
could add it to your compost pile uh uh

551
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,580
that's probably the best place to add

552
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:03,960
stuff is your compost pile and then add

553
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:06,658
compost uh to your to your plants uh and

554
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,058
the fall incidentally is in areas where

555
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:10,380
you plant in the spring the fall is the

556
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:12,720
time to make sure that you've got a

557
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:16,020
couple of inches of compost over your

558
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,419
soils so that you are you are working

559
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,798
the process and feeding the soils and

560
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:22,500
these microbes are working their way

561
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:25,319
down into the soil uh and into the root

562
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:28,798
Zone during the fall and winter so that

563
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:30,418
by Spring you've got some fertility back

564
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:31,980
in your soil

565
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,480
which is which is important for

566
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,179
gardeners if I could just add one other

567
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:41,099
thing because we really

568
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:43,440
obey the law of return what falls down

569
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:46,558
from a tree for example is supposed to

570
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,298
those leaves are supposed to Decay they

571
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,519
contain all the nutrients that the

572
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:52,139
plants sucked up out of the soil and

573
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:54,960
they Decay and go back into the soil

574
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,720
again and feed the plant we're Farmers

575
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,079
we're gardeners we're Growers we remove

576
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:04,259
things from the system we violate the

577
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:05,899
law of return and it's important to make

578
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:08,879
sure that you're

579
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:11,940
adding stuff back into the system in a

580
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,880
timely basis so that you don't have to

581
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:17,100
resort to chemicals period good point

582
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,600
one thing about algae that I wanted to

583
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:20,639
bring up I actually have a quote here

584
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:22,558
from your book and I don't think a lot

585
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,020
of people know this so that's why I want

586
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,658
to read it here is you put quote the

587
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:29,819
cell walls of diatoms which algae are

588
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:31,980
composed of silica covered with an

589
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:34,139
organic skin that decays and disappears

590
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,079
after the organism dies leaving behind

591
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:39,720
in huge numbers the silica skeletons

592
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:41,639
that make up diatomaceous earth

593
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,919
so algae once it's dying off it's

594
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,179
leaving behind silica well it's a kind

595
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,480
of algae I mean there are lots of

596
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:51,360
different kinds of algae but yes uh and

597
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,400
not not all of it does but but certainly

598
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,379
that does and and

599
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,120
you know that diatomaceous earth if you

600
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,679
ever get a chance to look in the look at

601
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,558
that stuff under a microscope it's

602
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,919
fascinating it has all these poor spaces

603
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:07,918
and uh uh you know it's just it's

604
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,799
spectacular condominium and provides a

605
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,080
little bit of food and substance and

606
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:15,480
drainage and storage it's it's of water

607
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,699
it's really amazing stuff yeah a lot of

608
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,159
people use it as use like a preventative

609
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,440
or to battle fungus gnats you know they

610
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,120
keep it in there and it helps tackle

611
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,580
that population but correct me if I'm

612
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,079
wrong that diatomaceous earth that's not

613
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:29,460
really in a usable form that the plant

614
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,678
can uptake right it needs to be broken

615
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:35,038
down by microbes in order to be in what

616
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,080
solicit acid or orthosolic acid in order

617
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:40,759
for the plant to uptake well yeah it has

618
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:43,259
to be it has to go in to the ionic form

619
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:47,400
in order for it to be taken up by the

620
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:49,740
plants uh teeming with nutrients the

621
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,380
second book I wrote the first book

622
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,359
really was was designed to explain the

623
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:58,380
soil food web as we knew it at the time

624
00:26:54,359 --> 00:27:00,240
this is how food gets to the plant and

625
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,880
it occurred to me one day after I wrote

626
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,000
the book that I had no idea how food

627
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,100
gets inside the plant and then once it's

628
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,380
inside what's it doing there and so

629
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:13,079
teeming with nutrients is about that

630
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,778
particular subject and and and one of

631
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:19,439
the take homes is the microbes in the

632
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:23,278
soil food web system break down the

633
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,620
nutrients into the proper ionic form so

634
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:29,099
that they can get through that cell

635
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:33,359
membrane which is again going back to my

636
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:35,278
tofu container which is you know holding

637
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,959
all of that tofu together in that little

638
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:44,159
tofu block and that membrane has little

639
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,960
uh uh proteins in it that act as tunnels

640
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,799
and there are various different ways

641
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,440
that individual uh eye ions nutrient

642
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:55,379
ions can move through and each tunnel is

643
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,720
specific for the one kind of ion which

644
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,600
is really mind-blowing when you think of

645
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,120
something like you know Boron just a

646
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:06,418
teeny little bits using they the plant

647
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:09,058
has to make that protein and insert it

648
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:11,220
into the membrane in order to be ah it's

649
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:13,700
just it's gonna make we we think plants

650
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:17,880
are stupid and dumb and they are

651
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:20,340
unbelievable microcosms of of of the of

652
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,200
Earth and what goes on in Earth they're

653
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:24,778
phenomenal and we think we know a lot

654
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,819
about plants and soil biology but we

655
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:29,278
probably know a fraction of what's

656
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:31,619
actually out there right oh well I can

657
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,298
tell you I mean I would never have told

658
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:34,979
you that I would be writing a book on

659
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:36,900
teeming with bacteria I mean it just

660
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:41,220
wasn't even in the realm even three

661
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:44,100
years ago uh yeah and now it's it's at

662
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:47,880
the point where uh we've learned so much

663
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:50,879
for example uh uh certain plants have

664
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:55,020
trichomes okay tomatoes have trichomes

665
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,500
as a result of studying rhizophage

666
00:28:55,019 --> 00:29:01,019
we now know that what's happening inside

667
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:04,440
trichomes is nitrogen fixation by

668
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:06,599
bacteria and you get the same kind of

669
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,759
reaction you don't you don't necessarily

670
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:11,579
get the stripping and the but you get

671
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:14,220
this you get multiplication uh you get

672
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:16,500
you get different chemicals being

673
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,620
produced some of which are very wanted

674
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,480
chemicals uh to to lower the oxygen

675
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:24,298
level so that this fixation can take

676
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,940
place those little we now know what's

677
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:29,038
going on in those factories which we

678
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,740
didn't know before so when you when you

679
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:34,319
take your tomato plant you know and you

680
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:37,019
you that smell comes from rubbing those

681
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,658
trichomes that's probably some kind of a

682
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:41,220
metabolite coming from bacteria that are

683
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,860
in those trichomes as you crush them

684
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:47,579
with a with your hand unbelievable stuff

685
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:50,639
and uh we haven't even gotten into the

686
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:52,319
other endophytic bacteria because some

687
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,020
of these bacteria go in and then they're

688
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:58,200
ejected out but some of these bacteria

689
00:29:55,019 --> 00:30:00,480
stay inside the plant and move

690
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,940
throughout the plant and do a number of

691
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,019
things that benefit the plant

692
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:09,058
first of all as they go into the plant

693
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:12,720
and they cause the plant to spray this

694
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:15,418
what's known as Ro onto the bacteria to

695
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,519
strip those walls the plant goes oh wait

696
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,080
a minute I better strengthen my own cell

697
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,079
wall or I'm going to be stripping my

698
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:25,678
cell walls by mistake and so it

699
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:27,778
increases its strength it's better able

700
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,320
to handle stress as a result of the

701
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:34,859
bacteria Invasion then these bacteria

702
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:38,579
produce phytohormones gibberellic acid

703
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:40,859
auxins all the things the ethylene all

704
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:43,740
the things that you want to have a good

705
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:45,599
healthy plant these guys are inside the

706
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,599
plant producing them and then it gets

707
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:51,139
even Wilder there's a philosphere around

708
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:53,879
the leaves which is like the rhizosphere

709
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,038
and then there's the area around the

710
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,520
flower well the bacteria get into that

711
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:03,619
area and they get trapped into the seed

712
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:07,398
coat and so when the plant seed

713
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:11,099
germinates in new soil it brings with it

714
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:14,839
the kinds of bacteria that are

715
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:18,740
beneficial to that particular plant

716
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:21,658
whoa and over the past five or ten years

717
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,099
farmers in particular and in the book I

718
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:27,000
hope we're going to start getting more

719
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:30,839
gardeners and Growers uh have been using

720
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,538
various different kinds of bacteria to

721
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:35,939
to fix nitrogen inside the plant and to

722
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:38,398
do all sorts of really cool things for

723
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,120
the plant to help it be stronger and

724
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:44,239
better uh these These are known as

725
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:47,398
endophytic bacteria

726
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:51,839
one that uh you know these medicinal

727
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:54,479
Growers uses is uh azosperidium it can

728
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:57,178
be purchased it's in a Spore form it has

729
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,159
a fairly long shelf life but there's a

730
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:00,360
mix of five or six bacteria that people

731
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:02,760
can use

732
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,859
to get benefits out of their plans and

733
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:08,038
and depending on what the plant is

734
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:10,918
different bacteria impact the impact the

735
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:13,278
plant different ways so there's a

736
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:16,980
difference for some plants when you use

737
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:18,599
vermicompost versus using thermal

738
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:22,200
compost because there's a different

739
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:26,038
bacterial base in either one of those

740
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,600
whoa so you know I I don't want to

741
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:30,538
overwhelm people with all of this

742
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,639
information and I promise you if you

743
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:35,220
pick up teaming with microbes and read

744
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,980
it and don't understand what I'm talking

745
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,259
about I'll buy that book back from you

746
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,360
three times the price now nobody's ever

747
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:45,019
taken me up because and it's not it's

748
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:48,359
not me it's the subject matter

749
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:50,579
once you have the vocabulary and

750
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:52,199
understand the system and it really is

751
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:53,699
just the little guy getting eaten by a

752
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,319
briefer guy you need by a breather guy

753
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,200
and one of those populations doing in

754
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:00,960
there before they get eaten uh it's

755
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,480
really simple stuff and really easy to

756
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,298
understand you will finish the book and

757
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,640
you will never Garden the same again you

758
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:11,579
can't incredible yeah definitely mind

759
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,740
blown off of a lot of that stuff the

760
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:15,960
endophytic bacteria also called

761
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,538
endophytes which is what A mycorrhizal

762
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,120
fungi is by the way it's an endophyte

763
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:24,538
um you mentioned that it can be

764
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:26,099
purchased is the application rate is it

765
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:28,798
something that's sprayed onto the plant

766
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:30,839
as like a foiler or is it actually a

767
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,398
soil drench or a drench the ones I've

768
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:35,699
seen are drenches but I'm sure there's

769
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:38,518
sprays but this has lots of implications

770
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:42,298
for people who are growing plants I mean

771
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:44,880
if the plant is bringing to the soil the

772
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:47,460
bacteria that it needs

773
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,740
well doesn't that mean maybe we should

774
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,840
be reusing our soil not throwing it away

775
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,880
because it's full of bacteria that we

776
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,639
need now we've got to make sure that the

777
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:59,880
law of return

778
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:02,038
has been taken care of but why do people

779
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,200
throw away soil that's the craziest

780
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:06,720
thing I ever heard of even pulling up a

781
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,940
tomato plant out of a pot doesn't make

782
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,980
any sense to me you cut the plant you

783
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,320
plant right there leave the roots where

784
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,659
they are they form channels that have

785
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,460
organic material that decay they have

786
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:19,740
the right bacteria right there in the

787
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:22,460
rhizosphere and the roots of the new

788
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:25,799
plant will grow down into those little

789
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:28,139
tubes uh and benefit from all of this

790
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,039
stuff I mean there's so much we can

791
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:33,899
learn by just listening to the plant and

792
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:35,940
unfortunately we have to listen with

793
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:38,159
microscopes and and we have to have

794
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,858
people like James White and and Elaine

795
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,980
Ingham uh you know do this stuff I don't

796
00:34:40,858 --> 00:34:45,960
invent this stuff all I do is report it

797
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:50,099
uh and and my hats off to these people

798
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:52,320
who have really uh I think changed the

799
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:55,500
tenor of gardening when I started

800
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,680
gardening with my with my dad bacteria

801
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:02,760
Syria that was bad fungi that was bad we

802
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:04,940
sterilized soil no I mean you know we we

803
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,040
know Growers that sterilize seeds today

804
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:10,079
no and if you start seeds you know your

805
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,820
tomato seeds in a you know in a paper

806
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,440
towel situation

807
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,300
you don't just take the little new

808
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,700
seedling and put it in the soil because

809
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:20,519
there are bacteria that jumped off that

810
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:25,439
seed that are in the paper towel bury

811
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:28,559
the paper towel too uh so we start to

812
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,960
think more logically what is the plant

813
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,739
doing and how can we help the plant do

814
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,599
that as opposed to using chemicals which

815
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:39,598
we haven't really talked about when you

816
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:44,220
use chemicals there are now proven

817
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:48,900
studies that using chemicals reduces the

818
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:52,739
bacteria and the bacterial activity when

819
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:56,099
you use Organics you increase that well

820
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:58,139
that's all I need to know uh I mean you

821
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:00,660
know in the book at the time in 2006

822
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:02,578
when teaming with micros was written you

823
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:06,598
know basically the discussion was that

824
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:09,240
some of these chemicals killed the

825
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:13,019
bacteria uh later on in the revised

826
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:15,598
Edition it was some kill uh some

827
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:17,639
increased populations and changed the

828
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,039
ratio of the populations well that's not

829
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:22,440
what the plant wants either the plant is

830
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:25,559
in control you you put down XYZ

831
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,980
fertilizer and all of a sudden you get a

832
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:31,980
lot more XYZ bacteria than you than you

833
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:34,800
necessarily want so the natural system

834
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:37,079
works it's always worked no one

835
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,539
fertilizes the forest that you go and

836
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,640
spend time in no one fertilizes the

837
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:44,880
Redwoods I like to say uh you know

838
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:46,799
nobody put the the the fertilizers down

839
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,240
there and spray them with herbicides and

840
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,460
root chemicals

841
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:53,519
they did it themselves because they use

842
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,619
the microbial system it works it's the

843
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,739
basis of regenerative gardening it's the

844
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:00,599
you know it's the basis of no-till this

845
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:02,338
is where you want to start folks if you

846
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,140
don't know anything about what I'm

847
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:06,299
talking about here and if you know about

848
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:09,059
some of it already you want to

849
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,740
continually use the internet to

850
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:12,900
continually update the information

851
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:15,000
because we're learning more and more all

852
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,619
the time you mentioned throwing away

853
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,579
soils and I think the reason why a lot

854
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:20,280
of people do that is because they are

855
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:22,980
using chemicals right and they're

856
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,500
worried about the balance of ions being

857
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,940
off balance you know if you have an

858
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,960
excess of some cations it's going to

859
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,820
lock out it's going to prevent the

860
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,539
uptake of other cations for example

861
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:34,859
right so if yeah the gross pH too same

862
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:37,320
thing I mean if you have a you know

863
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:39,239
really bad pH in oil in the soil it's

864
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,400
going to lock up a lot of the stuff sure

865
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:44,639
so for the folks that are using

866
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:47,160
chemicals and switching over to organic

867
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,319
you're saying they could probably rehab

868
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:50,819
that soil that they use chemicals in how

869
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,338
would you go about doing that I thought

870
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,320
in a compost pile compost I mean to me

871
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:57,539
that's the best way uh you throw it in a

872
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,338
compost pile you let the compost uh

873
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:01,019
microbes take care of the situation and

874
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:02,639
it you know it definitely works there's

875
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:03,960
no question about it

876
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:05,759
um

877
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,559
you know I I don't want to leave the

878
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,460
subject without mentioning that you can

879
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:13,858
use too much organic material as well uh

880
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,659
so so this time of year I always tell I

881
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,578
write a garden column I always tell my

882
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:19,019
readers you know an inch or two of

883
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:22,200
compost that's it

884
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:24,539
you know we don't plant we don't do

885
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:29,338
raised beds and compost it has it has

886
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:32,400
you know it's got too much phosphorus in

887
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:33,960
it uh phosphates uh and a lot of them

888
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,139
are locked up of course but it changes

889
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,240
the whole tenor of the soil so just you

890
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:41,279
know a little bit the plant will take

891
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,199
what it needs but you don't want to

892
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,560
overdo it all right what is the doctor

893
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:48,960
at least the Goldilocks rule uh and and

894
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,159
uh now I use compost tea so there are a

895
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,920
lot of people that just simply say

896
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,779
there's no science behind it I to me

897
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,200
I've always had great success I've

898
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,420
turned my lawn green uh using compost

899
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:02,039
tea so

900
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,420
maybe it's the tenor of the compost I

901
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,179
don't know but if you don't like the

902
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,400
idea compost tea use compost no question

903
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:10,500
yeah I think the the point of the

904
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,619
compost tea would be to multiply the

905
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,838
microbes in that tea right faster than

906
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:19,980
you would with just adding compost in

907
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:21,779
right right right uh and and yeah you're

908
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,358
multiplying it whereas you can make a

909
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:27,240
leachate by taking the compost you know

910
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:30,420
putting it into a bag and squeezing it

911
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:32,759
in in a you know bucket of Fairly of

912
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,740
nice warm water uh and you'll get

913
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,900
microbes from the compost there but they

914
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,519
just won't multiply so you have to feed

915
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,400
them and aerate them to get the

916
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:43,380
multiplication but again it's very it's

917
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,660
very hard to find great scientific

918
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,240
studies to say it works and yet what I

919
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:50,699
do when I do my side by side with

920
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:53,159
cilantro and different things holy crap

921
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:55,500
I haven't used you know I mean it's it

922
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:57,000
works for me I don't know what to say I

923
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,900
don't know what to say maybe it's just

924
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,358
my imagination

925
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:06,180
now with composting I just started

926
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:08,639
vermicomposting last year and from my

927
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:10,440
understanding there can be bad bacteria

928
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,940
in there as well so you have to kind of

929
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,338
worry about that making sure you're

930
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,200
composting correctly can you talk to us

931
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:18,059
about like good bacteria versus bad

932
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:20,519
bacteria and how to kind of avoid the

933
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:22,380
bad bacteria yeah well you know you

934
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:24,780
you're a little let's take about let's

935
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,880
talk about Verma composting I mean the

936
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,500
there's no thermal activity here this

937
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,559
stuff is going through the worm and the

938
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,239
worm is cleaning the stuff up uh if you

939
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:36,358
if you take the stuff when it's too

940
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:39,199
young you know you'll still have some of

941
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:42,239
the castings won't have been uh you know

942
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:44,699
they won't be the way you want them uh

943
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:48,659
Verma cast I always let my stuff go for

944
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:50,879
about six months Then I then I use it uh

945
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:55,019
thermal compost is is a different thing

946
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:59,519
the it's the Heat and the cycling that

947
00:40:55,019 --> 00:41:01,858
takes care of the bad guys and uh you

948
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:04,559
know if it goes anaerobic and stays

949
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:07,920
anaerobic if you don't turn it the right

950
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:10,559
way you can have pockets of anaerobic

951
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,900
anaerobic stuff uh depending on what

952
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,460
you're using as as your base material

953
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,019
you know if you're going going around

954
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,820
the neighborhood and picking up black

955
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:20,400
bags of leaves that people leave in the

956
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:23,460
curb in the fall uh without checking to

957
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,079
make sure that they don't have a dog uh

958
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,838
you know you may be putting manure in

959
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,880
there a lot of people use fish guts and

960
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,279
different kinds of things you got to

961
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,440
make sure that it's composted and and

962
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:40,019
there are studies that indicate that

963
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:43,260
many many yard composters don't actually

964
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:44,820
thoroughly compost their compost and so

965
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,460
they may end up with different things on

966
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,579
it that they don't want

967
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:53,880
and anaerobic bacteria

968
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:57,599
is what E coli is you know the bad guys

969
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,400
tend to be anaerobic and so you want to

970
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,740
make sure that you're turning it that

971
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,960
it's getting to the heat that all parts

972
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:05,659
of it are being turned and get to the

973
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:10,159
Heat

974
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:14,039
and you want to make sure uh that your

975
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:15,659
inputs are known I don't like to use

976
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:17,400
horse manure for example it's got

977
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:20,460
tetracycline in it I don't want that

978
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,079
tetracycline any possibility that any

979
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,059
would be left

980
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,140
um yeah so you just have to pay

981
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:28,259
attention

982
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:30,000
or you just pile it up and leave it

983
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,579
there for a couple of years and you'll

984
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,079
have some great compost

985
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:36,180
the easy way right yeah what are your

986
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,220
thoughts on bokashi composting yeah it's

987
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,899
all great you know I mean it it's all

988
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:42,118
great you got to take you know you get

989
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,320
the lead shape from the bokachi uh but

990
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,838
you got to take the stuff and put it in

991
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:48,900
a pile at some point in time anyway uh

992
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:51,119
to me uh to finish the job

993
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:54,300
um you know Korean natural Farm all that

994
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:57,480
stuff it's all good uh you know those

995
00:42:54,300 --> 00:43:00,300
tend to be uh anaerobic uh but they use

996
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,740
lactic acid and the same stuff that's in

997
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,780
yogurt and

998
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:05,519
um yeah they're all good it's all

999
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,680
microbes we're teaming you know some

1000
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:10,679
people team differently than others okay

1001
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,639
and then for the earthworms I want to

1002
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:14,039
get a little bit deeper into that

1003
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:15,900
specifically for firmer composting or

1004
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:17,460
even people just having worms in their

1005
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,200
bed can you talk to us about the

1006
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,480
earthworms is there a specific type that

1007
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,460
they should use you know we've got red

1008
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,079
wigglers African nightclaus European

1009
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,420
night crawlers there's a variety that

1010
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,060
can be used right right I I always use

1011
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:32,159
the red wigglers uh what we what we're

1012
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:34,019
worried about now is that new worm

1013
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:37,078
that's beginning to pop up all over the

1014
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:40,559
place it's uh that little band that's

1015
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:43,380
around it is is is different than the

1016
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:47,578
earthworm uh or earthworms that we're

1017
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:50,700
used to uh these guys move like crazy uh

1018
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:53,700
and they're very destructive to the duff

1019
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:55,618
layer we've already got a problem with

1020
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:58,318
fishermen who go fishing with even red

1021
00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:00,358
wigglers uh you know they're in Michigan

1022
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:01,679
and they don't catch anything because

1023
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:04,380
they don't live where I live in Alaska

1024
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,899
which has got all the great fishing and

1025
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:09,059
so they throw their fishing worms out at

1026
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,639
the end of the day as they're going back

1027
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:14,940
to their car and those worms multiply

1028
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:17,179
and they eat the duff uh and and then

1029
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:20,818
they mess up the mycorrhizal symbiosis

1030
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:22,139
uh and we end up uh you know with some

1031
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:24,659
serious problems so you got to be

1032
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:28,379
careful what you use to me I use

1033
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:32,338
vermicompost in a Verma compost bin I'm

1034
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:35,818
not a big one on throwing worms around

1035
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:37,920
um they'll come if your soil is good uh

1036
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:39,960
if you live in an area that has worms

1037
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,000
and I think most people in the in the

1038
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,220
United States do live in an area that

1039
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,579
has worms oddly enough when I first came

1040
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:49,318
to Alaska we really basically didn't and

1041
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:51,000
I still get letters from from readers

1042
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:53,699
and emails that say what are these

1043
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,338
little lumps in my lawn well those lumps

1044
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:58,618
are Verma compost those are berm those

1045
00:44:56,338 --> 00:45:01,199
are castings worm castings they're not

1046
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:04,800
really compost uh and what goes through

1047
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:07,379
a worm concentrates the nutrients uh you

1048
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,960
know the next X more times nitrogen

1049
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:13,740
export oh it's just a phenomenal

1050
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:17,460
opportunity uh to enrich or concentrate

1051
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:19,799
nutrients in your soil uh people I know

1052
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,179
used to throw night crawlers around I

1053
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,200
don't think that makes any sense you

1054
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:26,219
want

1055
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:28,739
you want your worms to be in a bin uh

1056
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:31,139
worms will get into the soil not it's

1057
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:32,879
not something that I really encourage so

1058
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:35,219
we are getting towards the end of the

1059
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,338
episode here and a couple things I like

1060
00:45:35,219 --> 00:45:40,199
to close out on would be advice for new

1061
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:41,400
gardeners do you have anything maybe we

1062
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:43,500
haven't talked about in this episode

1063
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,480
that you think should be brought up or

1064
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,579
you know advice for new gardeners well

1065
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,858
again I mean I I and of course it's

1066
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:52,140
self-serving but read to me with

1067
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:53,639
microbes understand the soil food web

1068
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:55,920
and if you don't understand the soil

1069
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:57,299
food web teaming with microbes I think

1070
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,760
the United States Department of

1071
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,519
Agriculture Dr Elaine wrote a little

1072
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:05,040
picture booklet about the soil food

1073
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:06,780
we're very very simplistic we'll look

1074
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:09,300
enough on the internet if you don't want

1075
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:12,119
to buy a bulker you know and and read

1076
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,280
about the soil food web that's how your

1077
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:17,039
plants work don't start with chemicals

1078
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,680
that's not the way to go I know you're

1079
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:22,440
being yelled at by some Scotch guy you

1080
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:25,559
know every spring to do X Y and Z I know

1081
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,599
people tell you that glyphosate safe uh

1082
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:29,578
this is not something that you want to

1083
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,200
be fooling around with you want to be an

1084
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:34,440
organic Gardener you want to be a

1085
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:37,559
Natural Gardener and it's really easy to

1086
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:40,500
do the work comes when you have to

1087
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:42,960
convert from a chemical situation to an

1088
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,400
organic situation which ultimately is

1089
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,380
where you're going to want to be when

1090
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,300
you go to the supermarket do you buy

1091
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,338
chemical Laden apples do you buy

1092
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:53,579
chemical Laden fruit or do you buy

1093
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:56,338
organic you buy organic and so you want

1094
00:46:53,579 --> 00:47:00,119
to grow your own organic as well and

1095
00:46:56,338 --> 00:47:03,179
it's so easy to do because the plant is

1096
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:05,338
in charge and if you get the plant to

1097
00:47:03,179 --> 00:47:08,699
balance what it needs

1098
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:11,099
your inputs water and that's basically

1099
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:12,179
it water and then the compost as well

1100
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:14,338
right that you have to add and

1101
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:16,379
everyone's going on absolutely yeah or

1102
00:47:14,338 --> 00:47:18,480
or different kinds of mulches I mean you

1103
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,680
can use mulches which are compost in the

1104
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,420
making

1105
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:24,480
um but but one or the other you should

1106
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:28,559
be using there are no bare soils uh

1107
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:31,199
don't Rollo till it's not necessary and

1108
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,779
it breaks up the soil food web and just

1109
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:35,639
displaces members of the soil food web

1110
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:38,460
that are supposed to be you know in one

1111
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:39,960
zone uh to another Zone where you know

1112
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:42,300
where it takes a long time for them to

1113
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,699
get back into the root system it messes

1114
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,560
up the mycorrhizal network that's been

1115
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:50,818
created in your garden so you got to be

1116
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:52,679
careful uh and again it's just what what

1117
00:47:50,818 --> 00:47:54,779
I'm saying to you is if you start out

1118
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:57,539
knowing what the soil food web is it's

1119
00:47:54,780 --> 00:48:00,599
going to be really easy to start

1120
00:47:57,539 --> 00:48:02,400
gardening if you go chemical you got to

1121
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:05,099
figure out what those chemicals do how

1122
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,760
much to use how much to measure when to

1123
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:13,559
use them when not to use them uh and it

1124
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:15,359
it really makes gardening work and it's

1125
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:19,318
not supposed to be work it's supposed to

1126
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:21,239
be a wonderful hobby well said so

1127
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:23,219
wrapping things up how can the listeners

1128
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:25,199
find you and what do you have upcoming

1129
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:27,059
in the future

1130
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:28,439
oh I don't think I'm going to be writing

1131
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:32,400
any more books but that's what I said

1132
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,119
after the first one uh ah man I tell you

1133
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,660
what

1134
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:39,559
um you can find me on Instagram and and

1135
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:44,159
whatnot at Gardener Jeff

1136
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:47,338
lowenfels.com is my website uh if you

1137
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:49,500
need to email me you can do so my email

um and uh there are lots of different

1140
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:59,338
things that you ought to be looking at

1141
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:02,220
other than me go on the internet look up

1142
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:04,619
the soil food web and learn about it

1143
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:06,598
from as many different sources as you

1144
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:09,240
can and then teaming with bacteria in

1145

1154
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:29,818
to be able to do an audio on it because

1155
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,920
it has so many bacterial names and

1156
00:49:29,818 --> 00:49:33,719
they're really hard to pronounce you

1157
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,500
don't have to do that as you read the

1158
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:39,000
book just go by them uh but yeah you
