1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,400
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,718
know me my name is chris

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,759
aka mr growit and i'm back with another

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:13,678
q a video

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,960
i decided to make this q a video more

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,399
topic focused

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,719
this particular topic that we're going

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,198
to go over questions for is led grow

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,198
lights

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,960
think about doing other types of topics

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,039
in the future whether it be

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,199
questions in regards to seedling stage

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,439
questions in regards to plant training

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,560
questions in regards to feeding so on

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,799
and so forth so

16
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,600
if you have ideas for which one i should

17
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,879
tackle next

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,399
let me know down in the comment section

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,200
below before we get to this video i'd

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,079
like to give a quick

series of grow lights which are bar

29
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,359
style are one of the more popular lights

30
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,000
as well as their fce series another bar

31
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,759

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,198
but the bars are removable so you can

33
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,320
actually customize how the bars are

34
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,239
placed on the fixture

35
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,359
stock is limited so when they sell out

36
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,920

and also provide this information in the

41
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,759
description section below

42
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,719
okay now let's get into the questions

43
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,280
how much does par

44
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,840
matter compared to environment nutrients

45
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,159
soil

46
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,359
genetics one could argue that it's the

47
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,040
most important thing

48
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,400
now i personally think that genetics is

49
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,520
going to be a baseline right you want to

50
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,439
go after genetics

51
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,560
first in regards to what you're looking

52
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,199
for whether it be

53
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,519
a high yielding strain specific terpene

54
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,000
profile cannabinoid profile so on and so

55
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,679
forth

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,920
then from there lighting now some could

57
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,399
argue that nutrition environment

58
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,320
are pretty equal there when it comes to

59
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,439
what's gonna give you a high yield right

60
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,118
if you don't have

61
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,959
one then it could certainly impact the

62
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,239
other but yeah lighting is definitely

63
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,599
one of the most important things when it

64
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,519
comes to plant growth

65
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,359
if you give your plant too much light it

66
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,438
could do harm such as light burn

67
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,879
slow down overall growth if you don't

68
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,359
give your plants enough

69
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,718
light lower than optimal then you're

70
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,959
just not going to see the growth

71
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,399
that you would if it did have optimal

72
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,719
light should i use the california

73
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,199
lightworks 400 watt in my 4x4

74
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,800
for full veg and flower yeah absolutely

75
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,318
that is a full spectrum light

76
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,120
i believe you're talking about the solar

77
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,719
extreme 500 i know that one is 400 watts

78
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,080
that's why i mention it i actually had

79
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,639
my hands on that before

80
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,560
i did a unboxing video on it then i did

81
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,839
a separate part test video on it

82
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,598
in my opinion i definitely think you

83
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,878
would get better results running two in

84
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,560
that grow space

85
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,239
when i took the par measurements i

86
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,239
really felt like

87
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,519
that particular light would be more

88
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,000
suited for a

89
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,599
two foot by four foot grow space so i

90
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,120
think two of those in a four foot by

91
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,878
four foot grow space

92
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,400
would be great now there are people that

93
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,560
reached out to me before and told me

94
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,920
that they do run it in a 4x4 and they

95
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,479
get some great results and i've seen

96
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,079
videos

97
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:56,000
of it so yeah try it out i don't think

98
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,519
it would be harmful if you added in

99
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,439
another light in that space

100
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,959
that's just my opinion next few

101
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,120
questions are kind of similar

102
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,400
do you increase the intensity over its

103
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,158
different stages

104
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
and how high should you adjust the

105
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,519
dimmer on your light for each stage of

106
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,598
your plant's life so i've gone over this

107
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,360
a bunch of times in a bunch of videos in

108
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:13,840
the past so i'll quickly just go over it

109
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,360
here

110
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,800
looking at par measured in ppfd 200 to

111
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,640
400 ppfd

112
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,480
is generally what i aim for for

113
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,798
seedlings clones and mother plants

114
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,079
400 to 600 ppfd for plants in the

115
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,439
vegetation stage

116
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,560
and 600 to 900 ppfd for plants in the

117
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,079
flowering stage now if you're

118
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,920
supplementing co2

119
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,200
you can go a bit higher than that and if

120
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,639
you don't have a par meter

121
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,560
so you can't really dial in that

122
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,839
distance by using a meter

123
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,759
most people what they'll do is they'll

124
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,519
look at the par chart

125
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,439
that the grill like company releases

126
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,959
it's usually on the grow light listing

127
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,799
or you can reach out to the manufacturer

128
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,719
and ask them for a bar chart and you can

129
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,159
use the par chart information to help

130
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,519
dial in that light distance so you're

131
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,120
getting those

132
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
specific power ranges during the

133
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,878
different stages of growth is it true

134
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:59,518
that you achieve better results in 75 to

135
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,798
85

136
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,000
unlike hps at 65 to 75 degrees

137
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,319
so the reason why it's generally

138
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,318
recommended to run a bit higher of a

139
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,039
temperature when using led grow lights

140
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:13,438
is because with hps lights they have

141
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,399
ir that kind of radiates down and it

142
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,560
increases the canopy temperature

143
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,319
more than an led grow light would that's

144
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,720
why it's generally recommended between

145
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,800
65 to actually 80.

146
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,320
i've heard some people going up to 82

147
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,478
with hps

148
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,599
versus you hear a lot of people doing

149
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,519
leds up to

150
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,919
up to 85 some even 87 i've tried 87

151
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,719
degrees in the past some cultivars can

152
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,159
take it

153
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,360
others uh you could see some stress

154
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,040
happening

155
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,879
in my experience these days i'm

156
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,319
typically aiming for a certain leaf

157
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,319
surface temperature if you kind of get

158
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,639
deep into it leaf surface temperature

159
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,319
is the more accurate way to kind of

160
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,040
measure what your plant should be at

161
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,879
80 to 82 degrees fahrenheit leaf surface

162
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,639
temperature is what i've had best luck

163
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,759
on that's kind of what i've read

164
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,360
to be ideal and i've seen that certain

165
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,439
cultivars are able to take that

166
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,038
if i go higher than that e384 there are

167
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,719
some cultivars that just

168
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,639
you see the stress happening then of

169
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,440
course if you're lower than that you're

170
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,000
potentially sacrificing growth will a

171
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,918
led last longer if it's kept cool

172
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,600
i.e pointing a fan directly at the

173
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,198
heatsinks so actually heard that same

174
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,879
thing from dan from the green sunshine

175
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,199
company he had recommended

176
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,439
pointing a fan at the heatsink to blow

177
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,360
off some of that heat off the heatsink

178
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,279
dan said that yes the fixture should

179
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,160
last longer you should get a longer

180
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,559
lifespan

181
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,240
out of that fixture if you're blowing

182
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,800
off some of that heat off of the heat

183
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,199
sinks

184
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,840
but for the most part if the heatsink is

185
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,160
built

186
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,519
for the amount of heat coming off of

187
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,360
those diodes

188
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,120
you shouldn't have to but i don't think

189
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,479
it would hurt i think it would help so

190
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,240
yeah i mean if you're doing that right

191
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,839
now i don't think it would hurt to

192
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,199
continue doing that how do you know what

193
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,399
level to set the dimmer

194
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,720
and the height during the different

195
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,879
stages that's a great question not all

196
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,560
led grill lights are created equal

197
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,159
a lot of these fixtures have dimmers on

198
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,319
them now so you can

199
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,439
dim them down reduce the amount of

200
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,280
energy you're consuming

201
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,879
and also allows you to bring the light

202
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,559
fixture closer to the plants

203
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,120
so if you're having height restrictions

204
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,959
for example it helps to dim things down

205
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,360
and get the light closer but every light

206
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,918
is different so it's impossible for me

207
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,400
to say

208
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,519
okay you're going to set it to 25 at

209
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,038
this height distance

210
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,478
then when the plant grows to this stage

211
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,560
you're going to increase it to this

212
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,318
percentage on the dimmer and this light

213
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,120
distance it's just it's impossible for

214
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,720
me to tell you

215
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,000
my recommendation is to look at the part

216
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,280
chart and you're going to have to do

217
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,038
some monkey math i'll reach out to the

218
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,038
manufacturer and find out if there's

219
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,079
certain dim levels that get you to a

220
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,599
certain amount of par

221
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,959
and also it's going to depend on which

222
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,720
plant you're growing different plants

223
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,120
have different lighting requirements

224
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,520
is led side lighting worth it that's a

225
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,360
great question

226
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,959
i did get my hands on some side lighting

227
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,000
uh actually last year

228
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,680
i got the chilled groscraft x1 and also

229
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,759
i got the chilled grovecraft

230
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,840
x1 mini i didn't actually use it as side

231
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,280
lighting so i'm not really speaking from

232
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,799
experience here i use it as a regular

233
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,279
grow light actually and it worked pretty

234
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,879
good

235
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,399
i think this is a debatable topic i

236
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,719
think that a lot of people are gonna say

237
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,918
no

238
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,000
and i think a lot of people are gonna

239
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,598
say that the lighting that you

240
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,720
have over your plants is gonna be enough

241
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,839
for it i'm trying to think of a

242
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,840
situation where

243
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,959
it would be beneficial maybe if you're

244
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,198
in a grow room

245
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,239
and the grow light you're using doesn't

246
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,879
really cover

247
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,400
your entire plant or entire grow space

248
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,839
and you kind of have some side lighting

249
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,560
over there to

250
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,000
compensate for that miss but for the

251
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,598
most part i really feel like you're

252
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,478
gonna be fine with just a regular grow

253
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,399
light and that

254
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:38,079
uh you probably wouldn't get much more

255
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,598
out of it with the side lighting

256
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,439
that's just my opinion what do you think

257
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:45,038
about the vivosun vs

258
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:47,839
1000 or vivosun vs1000

259
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,000
so i actually used two of these in a two

260
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,519
foot by four foot grow space

261
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,439
they work pretty good i don't have any

262
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,000
complaints i did look at the grill light

263
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,000
listing

264
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,120
pretty recently and i feel like they

265
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,720
overstate

266
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,160
the coverage area i personally think

267
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,000
that this light would be best suited for

268
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,280
a two foot by two foot grow space

269
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,038
when we're talking about flowering

270
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,598
coverage area probably three foot by

271
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:07,598
three foot

272
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,038
if you're in the veg stage but yeah two

273
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,800
of those in a two foot by four foot

274
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,199
space would be great i think one of them

275
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,919
in a two foot by two foot grow tent

276
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,038
would be great

277
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,639
i definitely think there are better

278
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,240
fixtures on the market today i'm

279
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,240
actually working on updating the best

280
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,680
led grow light articles that i have

281
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,680
some of you are familiar with that every

282
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,918
year i have an article that i

283
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,439
update which shows the best fixtures for

284
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,359
different sized grow spaces

285
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,199
this particular fixture did not make it

286
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,519
on the best led grill light list

287
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,639
for 2 foot by 2 foot space so just to

288
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,000
give you a heads up on that one

289
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,679
if you want to check out that list of

290
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,360
the best led grille lights go to my

291
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,199
website mrgrow.com

292
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,800
click on articles and then it's under

293
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,158
grow room and nutrients

294
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,000
i would link it in the description

295
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,720
section however youtube does not like my

296
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,559
website

297
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,000
so i don't post my website in the

298
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,039
description section what do you think

299
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,440
about the mars hydro

300
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,079
sp 3000 i seen rob said it was great for

301
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,240
the price

302
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,240
i think that light is awesome in a two

303
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,000
foot by four foot grow space

304
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,000
one of those would be great i got my

305
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,919
hands on two of them in the past

306
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,360
and i put them in a four foot by four

307
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,958
foot grow tent and did some part

308
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,959
measurements there and it looks

309
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,799
they looked really really good if you

310
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,799
space them out a little bit you can get

311
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,159
really even coverage across the entire

312
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,599
canopy there so

313
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,360
that plus the components that they're

314
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,480
using are high quality they're using

315
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,879
samsung diodes

316
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,639
meanwhile driver yeah i don't think you

317
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,480
can go wrong with that i think this is

318
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,720
one of the more affordable options

319
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,399
on the market today and uh definitely

320
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,000
worth it for sure if you're on a budget

321
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,440
this is a great light for you

322
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,120
why haven't you been using them all

323
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,080
along that's a good question so i

324
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,120
started growing

325
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,560
back in 2010 so 11 years

326
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,600
and i really wasn't introduced to led

327
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,919
grow lights until like i think 2013-ish

328
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,639
and back then a lot of them were just

329
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,159
terrible

330
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,838
a lot of the led grill lights created

331
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,159
back then were actually less efficient

332
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,760
than hps but they've come a long way for

333
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,519
sure i actually switched over to led

334
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,278
back in 2015

335
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,200
and i've been using it ever since i

336
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,320
don't have anything against hps

337
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,519
mh any hid grow lights nothing against

338
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,320
them at all i just

339
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,839
i personally use led and i prefer led

340
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,800
can light stress be a good thing in

341
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,480
small amounts

342
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,919
how much can you push it i personally

343
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,440
don't think that any light stress is

344
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,360
good i've had light stress

345
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,880
on several plants in the past i mean

346
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,639
with these led grill lights coming out

347
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:17,278
these days it's so easy to burn your

348
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,199
plants

349
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,519
the moment i start seeing any signs of

350
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,720
light stress i'll increase the distance

351
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,600
of my grow light or

352
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,399
i'll dim it down so it's not as intense

353
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,639
on the plants

354
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,679
now speaking about my experience and my

355
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,000
observations

356
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,039
i feel like it did negatively impact bud

357
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,360
structure a little bit

358
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,879
with that additional light so i

359
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,039
personally avoid light stress

360
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,320
at all costs what temps should you run

361
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,719
at different stages

362
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
some say leaf temp is lower than hps

363
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,440
yeah so we kind of touched on that in an

364
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,240
earlier question

365
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,720
in regards to the hps kind of increasing

366
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
the

367
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,800
the leaf temp but temp i usually aim for

368
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,879
a leaf temp 80 to 82 degrees

369
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,719
throughout the entire grill that's for

370
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,240
for seedlings i mean i'm not as

371
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,320
worried about it when the plant is

372
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,919
seedling or young veg

373
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,519
some would argue that it's safer to kind

374
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,759
of go on the lower side of that

375
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,799
but yeah 80 to 82 degrees fahrenheit

376
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,879
leaf surface temp

377
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,159
is what i usually aim for our hps

378
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,439
equivalence bs

379
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,199
i think back in the day they might have

380
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,959
been useful but i

381
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,480
personally don't have any need for them

382
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,599
anymore i think there's a lot of

383
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,120
manufacture

384
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,560
particularly some of these grow lights

385
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,839
you see on amazon that they're

386
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,919
exaggerating

387
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,240
what their hps equivalents are i mean

388
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,879
there are some lights really that pull

389
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,879
100 watts from the wall and they say

390
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,838
it's an equivalent of a thousand watt

391
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,759
hps which is just i mean that's bs so

392
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,079
when talking about hps equivalents

393
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,278
seeing those mentioned on listings

394
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:40,399
that's something i don't really pay

395
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,799
attention to at all

396
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,879
what's the life expectancy of leds well

397
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,439
not all led grow lights are created

398
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,159
equal

399
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,760
different diodes different drivers are

400
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,319
going to impact the lifespan of the

401
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,278
fixture

402
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,120
not sure if you're talking about the

403
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,639
diodes in itself or if you're talking

404
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,560
about the fixture in a hole

405
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,240
in most grow light listings you should

406
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,838
see a life expectancy

407
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,680
number 50 000 hours is what i

408
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,200
see on a lot of lights but yeah it's

409
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,199
going to be different depending on which

410
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,600
led fixture you're looking at are spider

411
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,440
farmer and mars hydro the same company

412
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,519
that's the rumor i have heard that in

413
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,200
the past i can't confirm it

414
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,839
i work with both of those companies a

415
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,079
spider farmer i have a different contact

416
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,079
than i do with mars hydro but i wouldn't

417
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,159
be surprised if there was a parent

418
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,000
company and then a bunch of other led

419
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,319
light brands underneath it i mean that's

420
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,679
pretty common across several niches

421
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
i've got a couple questions in regards

422
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,638
to the next one bars versus quantum

423
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,719
boards

424
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,759
thoughts on quantum boards versus new

425
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,480
bar style

426
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,838
are flat boards outdated i don't think

427
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,278
flat boards are out data it's kind of

428
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,079
funny to hear that

429
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,799
be like the flat quantum boards or led

430
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,719
boards

431
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,159
outdated by the way the word quantum

432
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,560
board is trademarked by

433
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,159
hlg horticultural lighting group so no

434
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,719
the company should be using quantum

435
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,039
board

436
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,240
but led boards what they're often

437
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,439
referred to flat board

438
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,959
i think that might be the first time i

439
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,480
heard of flat board i don't think

440
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,958
they're outdated i think they have a

441
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,519
place

442
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,039
here i think the bar style beats the led

443
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,799
boards or quantum boards

444
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,240
hands down when it comes to light spread

445
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,479
a lot of people what they look for is an

446
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,320
even light spread across the footprint

447
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,278
and with the quantum boards the light is

448
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,959
really focused

449
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,799
in the center of the footprint with a

450
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,599
lot of grow lights so it has that dead

451
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,199
center focus

452
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,120
and then if you look at the par chart

453
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,519
you'll see that the part numbers will

454
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,360
drop

455
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,720
off as it gets to the edges of the

456
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,519
footprint with the bar style light

457
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,680
you're going to get a much

458
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,600
even footprint across the canopy and

459
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,599
that's one reason why that i prefer

460
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,959
those bar styles versus the quantum

461
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,120
boards although i use both

462
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,159
i use the sf-2000 led grow light by

463
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,959
spider farmer

464
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,559
i've used the chilled growcraft x3 in

465
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,838
the past that's a bar style light

466
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,599
but yeah i wouldn't say that the led

467
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,760
boards are outdated

468
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,720
i would say that the bar style lights

469
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,559
definitely has the

470
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,920
upper hand when it comes to light spread

471
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,759
have you experienced light burn

472
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,759
got a 10 with all plants turning

473
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,759
yellowish yep absolutely have

474
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,159
experienced light burn in the past

475
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,000
several times like i mentioned earlier

476
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,078
it's so easy to burn your plants these

477
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,039
days with a lot of these grow lights but

478
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:04,479
yeah light burn

479
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,559
you know you start to see it at the top

480
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,240
of the plant works its way down

481
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,919
i actually do have a full article on

482
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,320
light burn on my website

483
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,319
if you go to mrgrow.com click on

484
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,399
articles and then plant problems

485
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,000
there is an article on light burn with a

486
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,039
lot more information about light burn

487
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,759
but yeah

488
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,480
i've experienced it before and it is no

489
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,639
fun

490
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,759
are blurple lights really that bad not

491
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,000
cheap amazon bro

492
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,799
leds but quality ones there are lighting

493
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,559
scientists

494
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,919
out there that are going to argue that

495
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,958
photons are photons

496
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,439
they're going to say it's more about

497
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,439
light density the amount of light

498
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,560
versus spectrum now with the blurpro

499
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,800
lights it had a

500
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,000
targeted spectrum there's a lot of blue

501
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,559
and a lot of red

502
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,240
minimal green maybe there's some uv

503
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,078
maybe there's a little bit of ir

504
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
but the plant will still grow it might

505
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:50,479
not be optimal you're going to get

506
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,680
people who are going to say that full

507
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,759
spectrum of light

508
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,838
is the best i would personally agree

509
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,278
with that however i wouldn't rule out

510
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,959
the blurple lights as being

511
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,320
something you shouldn't grow with at all

512
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,319
if you have it grow with it

513
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,600
just try to get that density of photons

514
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,278
or that par

515
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,800
get that at the right levels for the

516
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,240
different stages of growth like i talked

517
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,278
about earlier and you should be able to

518
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,278
get some good results

519
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,958
so no i wouldn't say that all blurple

520
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,399
lights are bad what's your choice of

521
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,799
light for a 4x4

522
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,000
so i personally instead of buying a

523
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,679
light intended

524
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,078
for a 4x4 a 4x4 flowering coverage area

525
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,519
i personally prefer to run two lights in

526
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,919
that grow space so

527
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,759
two separate lights in that grow space

528
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,838
with a flowering coverage area of

529
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,440
two feet by four feet i like to have two

530
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,199
lights in that space because you just

531
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,399
have that flexibility so

532
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,319
i personally grow all different

533
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,039
cultivars from seed

534
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,560
and as many of you may know each seed is

535
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,360
its own pheno you can have different

536
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,198
growth

537
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,800
on those plants so i'll get some plants

538
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,719
that will stretch up like crazy so

539
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,519
having the flexibility to raise

540
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,199
one light on one side of the footprint

541
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,399
keeping the other light down for the

542
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,319
smaller plants

543
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,159
i personally found that to be beneficial

544
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,920
and also it does sometimes help with

545
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,159
energy consumption as well right i've

546
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,759
had grow lights i've ran that

547
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,838
didn't have a dimmer on it so i'm

548
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,480
running the light full power

549
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,320
600 watts or whatever it may be for

550
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,839
small plants in the seedling stage

551
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,680
having two separate lights in there and

552
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,959
even if i didn't have a dimmer on it i

553
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,120
could at least

554
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,399
cut the energy consumption half for

555
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,399
seedlings for example

556
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,480
yeah i really like to have two grow

557
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,639
lights in that grow space

558
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,399
for flexibility purposes what happened

559
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,959
with your maxi sun sponsorship

560
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,799
it's complete so actually for those that

561
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,719
don't know i did a sponsorship with maxi

562
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,519
sun i did a video on my main channel

563
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,199
where i talk about

564
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,720
the different fixtures that they have

565
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,599
and then i also did

566
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,120
individual park test videos on the

567
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,800
fixtures that they sent me

568
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,159
on my second youtube channel which is

569
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,159
this youtube channel right here i

570
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,759
actually took all of those videos down

571
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,360
and the reason why i did is because i

572
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,959
was getting comments of

573
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,800
people mentioning that they've upgraded

574
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,719
their fixture so they upgraded the

575
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,240
components on the inside so

576
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,800
the information that was said with the

577
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,079
videos were no longer applicable so

578
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,758
that's the only reason why i took down

579
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,679
those videos is just because

580
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,798
the information is no longer correct in

581
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,519
there i didn't want to leave up those

582
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,480
videos

583
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,199
and spread misinformation or outdated

584
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
information

585
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,600
so i don't have anything against those

586
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
lights i think those lights are

587
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,759
fantastic

588
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,240
and yeah that's what happened with that

589
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,078
sponsorship is it ever okay to have your

590
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,919
plants closer to the led good lights

591
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:23,198
than the manufacturer recommends

592
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,640
yes but it's going to be very rare a lot

593
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,839
of the good grow light companies they're

594
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,759
going to give you a par

595
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,678
chart to go by and those pie charts are

596
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:30,480
going to be accurate so in that case you

597
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,320
can go buy

598
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,440
the manufacturer's recommendation now

599
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,200
unfortunately there are a lot of grow

600
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,640
light companies out there particularly

601
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,200
you'll find them on amazon

602
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,038
where they only give you the dead center

603
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,440
number for example of of par

604
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,879
this this one measurement right in the

605
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,880
dead center of the footprint

606
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,640
and that's it i have found instances

607
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,600
where those measurements were actually

608
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,120
incorrect

609
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,359
some girl like companies won't hesitate

610
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,199
to lie to you and exaggerate numbers

611
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,678
so yeah if you have an led relay from a

612
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,440
company that isn't well known or

613
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,440
maybe they're not showing all of their

614
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,440
part numbers on their part chart

615
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,960
that might be a case where having the

616
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,640
grow light closer

617
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,798
would be beneficial but for the most

618
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,679
part most of these led growth companies

619
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:10,480
they're going to have accurate

620
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,400
measurements

621
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,759
for you that you can go by i got several

622
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,400
people asking this question

623
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,759
calmag supplements for using led grow

624
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,759
lights why is it needed

625
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,599
what is the purpose will led lights

626
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,960
cause a deficiency in plants requiring

627
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,439
additives like calmag

628
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,960
should you supplement calcium under led

629
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,960
specifically in living soil

630
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,038
why do i see some people having calmag

631
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,558
problems after switching over to leds

632
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,319
so this was a question that was actually

633
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,000
asked the most and i don't think i have

634
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,720
the best answer for you but i'll try to

635
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,480
answer this

636
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,919
so way back in the day when i was using

637
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,679
hps lights

638
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,520
i was able to get away with just using

639
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,519
the fox farm trio of nutrients

640
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,960
so for those that don't know fox farm

641
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,519
has a trio

642
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,120
they've got it's a three bottle nutrient

643
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,679
line and i could use just those three

644
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,839
bottles

645
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,919
for the entire grow and my plants would

646
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,720
be fine now particularly when i switched

647
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,559
over to

648
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,960
led grow lights i found that i was

649
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:01,599
coming across calcium deficiency in

650
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,120
particular

651
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,599
and talking with people you know back

652
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,079
then on forums people just said that you

653
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,240
need

654
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,839
calmag supplement to be added whenever

655
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,759
using led and i'm not sure if any

656
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,159
science has come out on this one or not

657
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,759
but

658
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,200
i don't think we actually know the true

659
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,319
reason why that is

660
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,480
the true reason why you need to

661
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,240
supplement calmag when using led

662
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,919
it may just be because the density of

663
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,120
photons is greater or could have

664
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,320
something to do with the spectrum i

665
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,239
don't think we truly

666
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,439
know why that is the case i think that's

667
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
more of a question for a lighting

668
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
scientist

669
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,839
i'm actually looking to get a lighting

670
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,000
scientist onto my podcast in the future

671
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,599
my garden talk with mr grove podcast

672
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,119
and that's definitely a question i will

673
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,439
ask them but yeah wish i had a better

674
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,519
answer for you just for some reason when

675
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,279
using leds multi i don't know if it's

676
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,160
cultivar specific or what

677
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,720
but having calmag on hand to add in if

678
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,640
needed

679
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,558
is definitely recommended what specs

680
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,200
should i worry right now i aim for more

681
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,599
lumens

682
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,919
for less watts i actually just released

683
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,319
an entire video on this what to look for

684
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,160
when

685
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,359
purchasing an led grow light i sat down

686
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,279
with austin from

687
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,479
chill tech and we talked about a bunch

688
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,798
of different things that you can look

689
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,558
for when buying these led grill lights

690
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,720
to sum things up i personally look for

691
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:11,519
par first i want to make sure that the

692
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,400
grow light is emitting enough par for

693
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,480
that space

694
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,320
then i like to factor in efficiency

695
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,000
light spread across the footprint

696
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,918
there are a lot more things that you can

697
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,759
look at when buying an led grill light

698
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,480
so on the outro card of this video i

699

718
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,279
first or second grow

719
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,120
i did write a book specifically for you

720
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,599
here is my book it is available

721

this is going to take you through the

723
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,720
entire growing process

724
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,359
everything from gathering the equipment

725
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,919
seeds

726
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,558
different stages of growth harvest dry

727
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,320

728
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,558

please leave a review on there it is my

730
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,678
goal to get

731
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,678
500 reviews i'm so close to getting

732
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,759
there actually after i post this video

733
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,840
you might have enough people to get over

734
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,759
there and leave enough reviews to get up

735
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,038
to 500 that would be awesome

736
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,200
and then from there the goal would be to

737
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:27,759
get a thousand so we're quite a ways

738
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,000
away

739
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,359
from that but uh i think i can get there

740
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,558
