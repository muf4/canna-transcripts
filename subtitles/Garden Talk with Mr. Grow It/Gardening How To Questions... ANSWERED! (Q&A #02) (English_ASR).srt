1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,389
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:05,369
know me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it

3
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:07,830
and you watch a Max's channel got

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,710
another Q&amp;A video for you this week

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,138
the last Q&amp;A video was very popular that

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,960
a lot of thumbs up and we got a lot of

7
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,429
positive comments in the comment section

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,740
we've got a lot of good questions as

9
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:22,410
well so I am going to answer the

10
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,659
questions in this video and I'm also

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,309
going to answer some questions from the

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,629
video I released on my main channel the

13
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,108
other day so let's just get right into

14
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,788
it

15
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,740
got a question it's been about 40 days

16
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,750
and about a week ago my plants started

17
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,729
sexing in the vegetate now a pollen

18
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,890
sacks showed but no pollen came out and

19
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:39,929
hair came out of it so is it a hermie or

20
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,469
a fem I'd actually have to see a picture

21
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:46,619
to give you a more accurate answer if

22
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,090
you're only seeing one what you think is

23
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:50,729
a pollen sack and a hair coming out of

24
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,649
it it's probably not it pollen sacks are

25
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:55,558
in clusters so give it some more time

26
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,929
see if pollen sacks forum if there's

27
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:01,169
like a cluster of pollen sacks and then

28
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:03,899
you'll have your answer now even if your

29
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,030
plan is showing a lot of pistols hairs I

30
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,820
always keep an eye out for the potential

31
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,890
for the planter arms so I've had plants

32
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,500
in the past where you know they've gone

33
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,450
two weeks in the flowering stage and

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,430
they had tons of pistols real nice buds

35
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,350
starting to form and all of a sudden

36
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,659
that clusters of pollen sacs forming

37
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:24,509
right underneath them right next to them

38
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,618
so it's hard to tell sometimes you

39
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,290
really just got to make sure you're

40
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,540
constantly inspecting your plans for

41
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,700
both signs of it being an army as well

42
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,320
as pest look for pests why are you

43
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,840
respecting your plants as well you could

44
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,599
always post a picture on my forum mr.

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,799
grower calm slash forum post picture on

46
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,199
there I'm long they're just about every

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,390
day every one to two days answering

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,649
questions so if you post a picture on

49
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,299
there it can advise a little bit better

50
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,099
about the question someone asked about

51
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,840
fans not lasting I used to have problems

52
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,989
with fans until I realized I wasn't

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,460
using all real water my human fires

54
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,780
started using ro now and they're fine no

55
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:59,669
calcium buildup in the motors just

56
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,599
wondering if anybody else had this issue

57
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,509
great cold out so when you are using non

58
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,788
all RO water so it's two tap water for

59
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,919
example that has minerals in it you

60
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,099
could experience problems both in your

61
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,599
humidifier just might not last as long

62
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:18,150
one of the main issues that a lot of

63
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,280
people have is when using tap water in

64
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,490
humidifiers is they'll get calcium

65
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,930
buildup in their carbon filter and that

66
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:27,810
carbon filter that the pre-filter other

67
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,520
coverin filter sock gets all clogged up

68
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,400
and you got to remove it and clean it

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,709
but it quickly clogs up the carbon

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,800
filters so it's definitely not

71
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:41,129
recommended to use tap water in your

72
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,080
humidifier definitely use RO water it's

73
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:45,269
some type of filtered water or distilled

74
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,400
water so that way you won't have that

75
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,230
calcium buildup but yeah that's that's a

76
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,300
very common thing that happens now you

77
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:52,919
mentioned that there's a buildup and

78
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,900
motors I've never had that happen but

79
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,059
that's a good call out I can definitely

80
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,340
see that potentially happening can you

81
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,930
do an all-organic grow really interested

82
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,360
in organic grows so I've actually done

83
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,879
an organic grow before on this channel I

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,739
used organic dry amendments definitely

85
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,280
didn't turn out very well to be honest

86
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,530
with you I wasn't didn't get a good

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,430
result from the organic amendments I'm

88
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,199
not sure if you're talking about the

89
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,219
organic amendment way to do organic

90
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,889
growing or if you're talking about

91
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,239
no-till living organics yeah I'll

92
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:22,919
definitely do some organic grows in the

93
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,090
future great videos and thanks for

94
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,039
taking the time to share your knowledge

95
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,750
so I'm about to start my first crew and

96
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,179
I'll be using Fox from ocean for soil

97
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,030
and I have the Fox farm nutrients my

98
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,860
question is do I wait 30 days then start

99
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,169
feeding them or do I start the first

100
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,780
week of veg so I'm not sure what you

101
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,189
consider their first week and veg people

102
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,110
consider it different some people

103
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:44,789
consider the first week of veg the week

104
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,799
that the plant sprouts from the soil

105
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:48,389
other people consider that the seedling

106
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,280
stage some people consider the seedling

107
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:51,809
stage the first two or sometimes some

108
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,329
people even think the first three weeks

109
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,009
are the seedling stage then there start

110
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:57,659
cutting veg so I'm not sure what you're

111
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:59,399
talking about there to make things

112
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:02,639
easier for you it's basically about

113
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,250
twenty to forty days from when the plant

114
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,169
sprouts from the medium now you could be

115
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,780
transplanting into fresh soil during

116
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:11,669
that first 30 days and that fresh soil

117
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,080
has nutrients in it so it might be a

118
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,929
little bit longer than the

119
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,790
period twenty to forty days just kind of

120
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,350
a rough guideline now if you're planting

121
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,819
directly into your final container let's

122
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,700
say your final container is a five

123
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:25,230
gallon pot I've grown like that before

124
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,879
it's roughly about thirty days if you

125
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,160
hit if you had your plants with

126
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,899
nutrients on the 30th day you're fine

127
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,520
we're growing infox from ocean force

128
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:35,339
well I've had my plants with nutrients

129
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,079
as early as day 16 from sprout and

130
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:39,810
actually that's a really good results in

131
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,279
doing it that early but you know those

132
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,930
genetics could have just kind of a

133
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,509
nutrient hungry be a general guideline

134
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,490
20 to 40 days from when the plant

135
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:49,079
sprouts when the medium good hit that

136
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,519
with a fox arm nutrients I would start

137
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,319
with a half dose maybe even start with

138
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,029
the quarter dose and always check the

139
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,180
ppm of the run off when you're using

140
00:04:54,029 --> 00:05:00,259
synthetic nutrients you could do the run

141
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,819
off ppm some people argue that a slurry

142
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:05,279
test would be better than a run off test

143
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,659
really you can measure it either way sir

144
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,639
in a five by five grow ten how many

145
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,350
plants will fit depends on how big the

146
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,879
plants are right so you could actually

147
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,270
shove a whole bunch of some plants in

148
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,490
there

149
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:16,949
and keep them small flip them to flower

150
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,870
super early and you'll be fine or you

151
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,219
could just plug one plate in a 5x5 and

152
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,620
vegetal longer and fill up the whole

153
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,720
grow space so it really depends on how

154
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,668
many plants you're looking to grow me I

155
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,740
personally like a variety of plants well

156
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:31,469
for a five by five I would typically

157
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,410
shove in five maybe six plants in there

158
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,300
and veg him for 30 40 days and flip them

159
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,919
and that should basically fill up the

160
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,990
grow space depending on genetics

161
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,939
actually genetics lighting nutrition and

162
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,639
all that stuff is going to impact plant

163
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,899
growth but yeah it really depends on the

164
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,819
plants you want to grow you couldn't

165
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:50,009
keep a bunch of plants in there and just

166
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:52,259
keep them small and flip or one large

167
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:53,939
plant that's for a while great video bro

168
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,099
how far do you keep your electrics guide

169
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:58,889
lights from your plants of flower and

170
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,810
flowering I really like to do 20 inches

171
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,769
I've gone down to 18 inches before

172
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,199
however

173
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:05,589
kind of late in flowering I experienced

174
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,740
a fox tailing

175
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:11,589
Fox telling it can be genetics but it

176
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:14,050
can also be due to too much lights I

177
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:15,639
kind of have a gut feeling that I just

178
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,879
had my legs too close and I started Fox

179
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,189
tails you know 20 21 inches away and

180
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,079
flowering is what I like to run with the

181
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:24,819
Elector sky lights that's on full power

182
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,800
how much blast this - how many gallons

183
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:29,019
of water I do one tablespoon per gallon

184
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,509
of water at what height do you start

185
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:33,459
flowering depends on growth depends on

186
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:35,259
the genetics some indica strains

187
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,699
I'll let veg a little bit longer and

188
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:38,469
grow a little bit longer because they

189
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,019
tend to be more compact and don't

190
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,100
stretch as much in flowering when I flip

191
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:44,319
them into flowering that three-week

192
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,480
stretch period now I've come girl it's

193
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,550
just Eva strains those are gonna kind of

194
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,970
be quicker to grow and longer into notes

195
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:54,879
take up more space so I won't i won't

196
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,860
veg for as long depends on genetics

197
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,019
usually I go by the number of days and

198
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,490
veg usually it's around 30 to 40 days

199
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:04,449
and veg it's usually about the right

200
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,280
height before flipping a flower but yeah

201
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,680
it depends on genetics really and growth

202
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,909
how often do you use microbes so I've

203
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,650
been using mammoth peat and I've been

204
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,229
using blue plant and nutrients reso mix

205
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:16,060
I kind of rotate with them kind of every

206
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:18,189
other so watering I'll water with

207
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,819
menapii and exploring they'll toss in

208
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:23,740
some microbes sometimes I'll skip it and

209
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:28,269
yeah it's just kind of randomly but

210
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:30,490
things like microbes can be added every

211
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:34,019
watering and you shouldn't see an issue

212
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,939
no inoculating your medium with microbes

213
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:39,099
isn't gonna do any farm my question is

214
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:41,709
do I have to start my photos in a small

215
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,330
pot or a cup and transplant I know me

216
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:45,279
just grow Otto's keeping them in the

217
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:47,649
same home now you don't necessarily have

218
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,509
to start in a small pot and then cup and

219
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:50,679
then transplant up you could just do it

220
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,569
red in the final container

221
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,310
some people will plant directly into the

222
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:56,529
final container some people will plant

223
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,310
in a small cup and then transplant up

224
00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:02,829
there are pros and cons to putting in a

225
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:05,050
small cup and then transplanting up and

226
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:06,699
there are pros and cons to just plant it

227
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,990
directly into the final container I

228
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,909
actually did create a video on train

229
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,280
planning multiple times I'll link that

230
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,530
video in the description section below

231
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:17,809
explain more detail about the pros of

232
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,068
trance playing multiple times and

233
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,228
actually in the comment section that

234
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:23,360
this video there is some good call-outs

235
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:25,068
additional information that I didn't

236
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,810
mention within the video so I'll link

237
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:28,639
that down below for you was the winner

238
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,829
picked from the grill craft giveaway

239
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,288
yes chilled led they already picked a

240
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:35,059
winner for that and I think that winner

241
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:36,110
already received a light as well really

242
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,278
good information I've been watching your

243
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,690
channel for some time and actually I'm

244
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,490
quite up there from you so thank you I

245
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,810
have a question about hydroponic growing

246
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,490
though I know this doesn't have anything

247
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:46,549
to do with your current growth but I'm

248
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,320
starting a DWC grow DW c stands for deep

249
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:50,629
water culture i'm using right at rear

250
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,430
plus and I'm starting with seeds so my

251
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:55,159
question is when should I put my seeds

252
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:57,079
and plug into my five-gallon bucket and

253
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,759
net pots in other words how long should

254
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,100
I keep the seedlings of plugs separate

255
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,799
so unfortunately Erin I don't have any

256
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,850
experience in dwc at all I don't want to

257
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:06,379
give you an answer and then all of a

258
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,060
sudden I tend to be wrong so what I'll

259
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,009
do is I ask this amazing community that

260
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:12,469
we have here with the whole wealth of

261
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:14,028
knowledge if anybody has dwc experience

262
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,528
that has an answer to his question

263
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:16,220
please leave it down in the comment

264
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:18,169
section below

265
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,360
help Erin oh great video and thanks for

266
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:22,490
sharing your knowledge I also have read

267
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,659
your book as well as heard you talk

268
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,639
about how you're gonna do a revision

269
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:27,740
soon what kind of stuff can we expect to

270
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:30,439
change any update on when this will take

271
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,329
place a great question yes my book has

272
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,920
been updated although it has not been

273
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:36,259
released yet there's a couple things

274
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:39,860
that are pending and I'm waiting on so

275
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:43,100
soon I hope I updated several of the

276
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,889
sections within the book just adding

277
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,259
information so it's not going to be a

278
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:49,939
complete revision as far as the text but

279
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:52,519
there's a lot of additional text in

280
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,720
there good information for example the

281
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,970
feeding nutrients section has been

282
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,800
expanded to be a lot more clear than it

283
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,690
is in the version that you have right

284
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,909
now also a lot of the photography is

285
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,649
different I actually went on to

286
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:04,259
Instagram and found some cannabis

287
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,629
photographer

288
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,999
I think I've got like eat Peter 9

289
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:11,249
photographers they ended up purchasing

290
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:12,839
some of their photos I wanted to include

291
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:14,668
in the book so it's not just my photos

292
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,339
in there that there's other photos as

293
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:19,289
well from good photographers in the

294
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,359
canvas community and also the design is

295
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:23,938
different so I hired a designer to do a

296
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:26,549
redesign and I'm looking to do a hard

297
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:29,188
copy as well so all that's kind of in

298
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:31,470
progress I'm hoping that the e-book is

299
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:33,328
released within a month

300
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,038
okay well this video is getting long so

301
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:36,899
I'm going to stop it there thank you

302
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:38,759
guys for all the questions that you left

303
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,828
in the comment section if you have any

304
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,178
other questions please let me know in

305
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:44,159
the comment section and maybe I will

306
00:10:42,178 --> 00:10:46,048
answer them in a future video also if

307
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,269
there are any specific topics that you

308
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:49,798
want me to cover let me know and I'll

309
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:53,929
leave it at that thank you so much for

310
00:10:49,798 --> 00:11:09,548
