1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,520
are you using some synthetic line of

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:07,278
nutrients and what's the EC or PPM that

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,558
you aim for for the different stages of

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:12,320
growth oh yeah I'm running uh all

5
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:15,160
salt-based nutrients right now recently

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,760
I've been running um Athena and I've

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,439
been liking it a lot it's my first run

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,599
with Athena and I've also recently been

9
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:27,399
running autof flowers which I'm not used

10
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:29,278
to so usually I might be and a lot of

11
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:33,320
times I'm just testing this in like a

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:37,280
PPM so a lot of times in veg I might be

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:40,320
getting up to 700 or 800 ppms in the

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,000
peak of veg and then maybe even over a

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,679
th000 ppms in the peak of flow but I

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,719
found that these autof flowers have been

17
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:52,000
running it's just a few but they seem to

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,679
like a lot or need a lot less nutrients

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,320
so I've been running about half of that

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,399
strength with the autof flowers I've

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,000
pretty much been taking the feeding

22
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,280
chart that Athena recommends and just

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,840
cutting it straight in half and it's

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,359
been working really well yeah that's a

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,799
common question that people ask is about

26
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,319
autof flowers and their feeding it's

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,080
often here that there it requires less

28
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,919
nutrition and there's some people that

29
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,239
say no it requires the same amount so I

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,920
think that's one of like the debated

31
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,919
topics amongst the community is whether

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,118
or not Autos should be treating

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,519
differently when it comes to feedings so

34
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:25,519
it's interesting to hear that your

35
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,759
experience that yeah you've had to cut

36
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,078
the dose in half there I heard the same

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,078
thing and so I tried I went with the

38
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,478
full

39
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,039
strength and I could just you could see

40
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,200
the normal signs it it just wasn't happy

41
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,479
you could see the leaf tip burn

42
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,439
starting and then I just backed off I

43
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:46,200
was like I let it go for maybe a whole

44
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:48,879
week before I was like I got to change

45
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,680
this Reservoir it's just too much cuz it

46
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,239
felt like too much because I think what

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,520
it was recommending even early in vegge

48
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:00,959
was 1100 PPM and it said that this

49
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,840
formulation is made to run at a higher

50
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,759
EC and I was like all right let's let's

51
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,200
try it never tried these nutrients

52
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,639
before I'll go with what they recommend

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,159
and I think it was just this particular

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,000
cultivar because the whole plant I mean

55
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:16,039
finished is only this big and so it

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,318
makes sense that it doesn't need that

57
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:20,560
much salt true yeah I know some aut

58
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,679
flowers can grow massive and then some

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,239
just stay squat really comes down to

60
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,319
genetics obviously it comes down to

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,519
other things lighting environment

62
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,919
nutrition all that stuff but yeah some

63
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,239
could be real small so it makes sense

64
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:35,000
for those smaller plants to need lesser

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,200
nutrition right yeah it does to me now

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,560
mixing up those nutrients in water what

67
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,560
is your water source are you just using

68
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,158
tap water or are you filtering the water

69
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,840
in some way like reverse osmosis or

70
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:51,799
what's your water source I have a uh 75

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,920
gallon per day Ro filter in the house

72
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,719
it's just hooked up underneath my

73
00:02:53,919 --> 00:03:00,799
kitchen sink and it's off 90% of the

74
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,639
time but I know like every time I'm

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,319
about to have to say I have to fill my

76
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,679
reservoir tomorrow I'm going to change

77
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,919
it I'll go ahead and turn on the filter

78
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,360
tonight fill me up a few five gallon

79
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:14,119
buckets and get ready so I always have

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,599
uh the RO water at the house I don't

81
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,959
have to worry about going and trying to

82
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,919
get distilled water worrying about

83
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,319
what's in my water supply because I know

84
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,000
just a few years ago here in Denver go
