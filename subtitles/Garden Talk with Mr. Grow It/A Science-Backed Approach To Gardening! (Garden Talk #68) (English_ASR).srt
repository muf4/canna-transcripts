1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
coming up on garden talk reputable

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,240
companies will test for terpenes should

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,320
also be looking as a side note for heavy

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,080
metals microbiology and aflotoxins and

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,919
making sure there's no pesticides and

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,080
all those boxes are chucked

7
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,399
a lot of the background of certain

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,560
growers is not botanically based so

9
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:22,159
they're using these genes of cultivar

10
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:24,479
strain and variety or hybrid when really

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,800
they're probably dealing with simply a

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,880
unregistered trademark name

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,880
you're probably getting less than 10 of

14
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,759
the actual plant production standpoint

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,280
they'll be bright they'll burn your

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,559
retinas out but they will not

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,640
necessarily be as advantageous to your

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,079
plants as you may think no matter what

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,480
plant you're growing what environment

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,719
that science-based approach is really

21
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,000
what allows anyone to improve their

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,359
gardening skills or just better

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,920
understand the plant that they are

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,920
tending to

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,320
what's up everybody if you that don't

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,600
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,079
and you're tuned into the garden talk

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,079
podcast this episode number 68. in this

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,478
episode interview matt from debacle

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,879
university he has been gardening for 22

31
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,799
years and he takes a more science-backed

32
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,798
approach to gardening he talks about a

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,400
variety of topics in this episode and

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,400
explains the science in a more

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,080
beginner-friendly manner thanks to all

40
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,158
to acknowledge that one of my goals for

41
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,799
this podcast is to bring zero costs for

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,280
information about gardening all plants

43
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,799
to the general public that being said

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,560
i'd like to thank the sponsors of

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,280
today's episode who helped make that

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,439
goal possible thanks to aec infiniti for

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,359
sponsoring this podcast they sent me

48
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,679
over their grow tent which has a canvas

49
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,840
density of 2000 d making them the

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,520
thickest grow tent on the market today

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,359
it has an aluminum plate that mounts

52
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,280
your controller to the grow tent with

53
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,319
the light proof pass-through for cable

54
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,640
routing the frame has 50 thicker steel

55
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,199
poles and carries two times more weight

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,200
than the standard grow tents coupon code

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,880
mr grow it will get you a discount on

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,800
their products and i'll leave a link to

59
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,000
their website down in the description

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,560
section below

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,520
and we are back welcome to the garden

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,280
talk podcast today i am joined with matt

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,080
from tobacco university how you doing

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
today

65
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,760
doing well thanks for having me

66
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
yeah thanks for coming on

67
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,399
i think a lot of people know you i

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,639
actually had a large handful of people

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,080
on my channel comment on my videos

70
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,159
requesting you to come on to this

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,640
podcast and i think a lot of people

72
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,120
really admire your science-backed

73
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,518
approach to horticulture right so we're

74
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,200
talking about really all plants

75
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,120
gardening

76
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,679
indoors outdoors

77
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,239
you really go over a lot of that

78
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,640
in your videos on your youtube channel

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,239
and very detailed very straight to the

80
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,759
point which i think i've seen some

81
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,519
comments in those videos saying that

82
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,878
people love the street to the point

83
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,879
topic videos

84
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,639
uh you do a really great job all around

85
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,959
so i'm really excited to to have a

86
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,719
conversation today and ask you some

87
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,640
questions that are really backed by

88
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,000
science always great to hear and help

89
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,679
support that because that's the one

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,598
thing that does hold true no matter what

91
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,080
point you're growing what environment

92
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,318
that science-based approach is really

93
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,519
what allows anyone to improve their

94
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:18,878
gardening skills or just better

95
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,039
understand the plant that they are

96
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,878
tending to but before we get too deep

97
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,479
into things can you tell us a little bit

98
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,439
about yourself and how you got into

99
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,199
gardening

100
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,560
so i've been growing for the last uh at

101
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,719
least 22 years or so my claim to fame is

102
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,199
giant pumpkins so that's what kind of

103
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,120
got me started and interesting in uh

104
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,280
plant growing in general because of the

105
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,799
giant pumpkin literally you can kind of

106
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,199
watch it grow

107
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,000
they will put on on average about a

108
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,079
pound every hour so once you kind of see

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,318
that happen from a plant standpoint

110
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,920
you're always just inquisitive of like

111
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,839
well why is it happening and how can i

112
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,158
improve that i can get more pounds per

113
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,560
hour or a longer duration for that and

114
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,719
of course that led me into the science

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,719
which i also like to kind of read up on

116
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,120
and look at and making those connections

117
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,680
the photosynthetic process the water

118
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,519
humidity nutrients how all that plays

119
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,040
into it the giant pumpkin is kind of in

120
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,200
your face and

121
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,919
allows you a great understanding of how

122
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,918
your influences can impact the uh

123
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,199
production of the plant

124
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,839
yeah it was the other day you actually

125
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,759
sent me a picture of one of the plants

126
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,159
that you had grown one of the pumpkins

127
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,439
and a massive massive pumpkin i mean

128
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,800
what was it on like a pallet or

129
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,478
something like that and was like on a

130
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,079
scale at the time or something do you

131
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,839
always have enough skin

132
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,359
yeah we've got to transport them by

133
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:40,239
pallet and um i'm way back about about

134
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,840
seven eight years ago i purchased a five

135
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,319
foot by eight foot trailer to hold the

136
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,560
pumpkins around and now i had to buy a

137
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,399
new one because that one won't fit the

138
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,639
pumpkins anymore so i've got the

139
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,758
legalest wise trailer you can kind of

140
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,040
get

141
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,000
and that's kind of just part of the

142
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,319
hobby and as i say that's usually a good

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,240
problem to have in the sense that when

144
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,159
you're out growing the containers for

145
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,160
transportation always turns a lot of

146
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,240
heads on the highway and always get the

147
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,720
thumbs up around the fall time so just a

148
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,600
nice way and a good year to end the

149
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,840
season

150
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,919
that's incredible yeah and i know a lot

151
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,000
of things with pumpkins kind of relates

152
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,079
to medicinal varieties that a lot of

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,839
these growers do grow

154
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,199
that are tuning into this content i want

155
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,399
to first talk about the naming

156
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,919
convention

157
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,719
in plants a lot of people are using the

158
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,959
word strain when really that's actually

159
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,199
incorrect can you talk to us about

160
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,159
properly daming plants from strain to

161
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,478
cultivar versus variety versus land race

162
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,759
so on and so forth so there's a whole

163
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,159
official

164
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,360
plant taxonomy and nomenclature is kind

165
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
of the main

166
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,280
term there and it's like well how do we

167
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:48,159
break that down and a lot of these terms

168
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,319
get tossed around and because they heard

169
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,960
it from someone that they may regard

170
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,719
they just keep tossing that same term

171
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,680
around and i think the one you mentioned

172
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,840
in particularly strain and that is used

173
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,879
quite a bit and that really comes more

174
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,239
from the

175
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,399
microbiology bacteria i'm kind of naming

176
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,478
a nomenclature system but has been

177
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,198
applied to all sorts of plants and

178
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,318
really that is kind of an improper term

179
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,478
really the in it's called the

180
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,639
international code for nomenclature for

181
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,719
cultivated plants is kind of one of the

182
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,478
gold standards it's abbreviated the

183
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,080
icncp

184
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,439
they are the ones that really set the

185
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:28,639
rules for naming any plant any new plant

186
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:31,038
and a lot of those rules can get lengthy

187
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,639
can get very laborious as you know how

188
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,560
you write things or what should be

189
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,879
italicized in single quotes and all of

190
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,759
that but that's really what sets um the

191
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,159
standards and some growers of plants

192
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,840
have kind of disregarded some of those

193
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,319
so they use the terms like strain and

194
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,638
cultivar and variety all interchangeably

195
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,400
when really they're not so a cultivar a

196
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,720
true cultivar it really means a

197
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,519
cultivated plant one that's been kind of

198
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,840
modified by humans selected for

199
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,000
cultivated by humans most are developed

200
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,918
by kind of like plant breeders and

201
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
borderline on probably what we may think

202
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,839
of as hybrids

203
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,759
a variety is basically a variation

204
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,839
within a plant species that develops

205
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,240
naturally in the environment it really

206
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,918
doesn't require human intervention by

207
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,439
the definition of the term so a lot of

208
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,560
people say i've got this new variety

209
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,319
well

210
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,879
really it kind of develops by its own

211
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,560
kind of relative mutations

212
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,000
i guess is the best way to put it and

213
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,038
how you write these there's all these

214
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,279
sort of established rules many disregard

215
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:32,159
them of the genus the specific epithet

216
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,839
the cultivar common names and exactly

217
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,800
what gets italicized and then single

218
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,879
quotes um there what is interesting is

219
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,038
that um these hybrids that we speak of

220
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,159
natural or man-made are really what a

221
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,719
lot of people

222
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,960
are growing and they're human generated

223
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,400
in a lot of cases so a lot of times

224
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,959
those human generated seeds if you grow

225
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,878
a hybrid you plant that seed

226
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,239
and it gets a beautiful plant you take a

227
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,919
seed from that plant and grow it you get

228
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,280
something that like doesn't quite look

229
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:58,799
like the original

230
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,038
particularly it happens a lot with

231
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,560
squash but in the compost pile throw the

232
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:03,839
rotted squash in the compost pile the

233
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,478
next year you're like i got my free

234
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,959
squash and lo and behold they don't turn

235
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,639
out anything like the original so that

236
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,120
kind of gives you an idea of a true

237
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,560
quote hybrid a lot of times we hear the

238
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,120
term land race i'm used quite a bit and

239
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,639
land race is really that people might be

240
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,319
more familiar with i think the term

241
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,160
should be used as heirloom

242
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,400
and an heirloom is just one of those

243
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,160
open pollinated varieties that's been

244
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,038
passed down from generation to

245
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,959
generation it is very stable

246
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,278
in that sense and people will argue oh

247
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,199
it's got to be 50 years stable 150 years

248
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,958
stable 100 years

249
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,039
it's just there's some variation there

250
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,119
but something that is probably going to

251
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,240
come true from type

252
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,720
so land race heirlooms those also are

253
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,159
interchangeable um terms with some of

254
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,480
the plans we're seeing out there with

255
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,039
all these crazy new names and you know

256
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,800
they get you know very well publicized i

257
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,679
think what we're getting to is really

258
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,958
something in the border lines of trade

259
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,559
names or um trademark names or trade

260
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,879
designations would be a great way to

261
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,039
kind of contact this

262
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,480
and really for the most part there is a

263
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,079
registering process that you'd have to

264
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,480
go through but we're doing a lot of

265
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,160
unregistered trademarks and these are

266
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,519
names that you say and people

267
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,360
immediately make that connection with

268
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,959
they understand that oh yeah that's you

269
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,240
know it was grown here and passed from

270
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,479
here and went from the west coast to the

271
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,360
east coast or from south to the north

272
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,879
but really by botanical definition

273
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,600
unregistered trademarks is what we're

274
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,679
referring to a lot of plant names by but

275
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,080
a lot of the background of certain

276
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,159
growers is not botanically based so

277
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,839
they're using these gems of cultivar

278
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:44,159
strain and variety or hybrid when really

279
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,399
they're probably dealing with simply a

280
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,399
unregistered trademark name that's

281
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,799
interesting yeah i know i've improperly

282
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,000
used the word strain for many many years

283
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,679
and then i was corrected uh cultivars is

284
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,679
really kind of what i've what i've been

285
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,919
growing so i've been trying to say that

286
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,359
instead of strain and i get a get some

287
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,719
pushback you know people like hey it's

288
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,959
strained what are you talking about and

289
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
try to educate and people get frustrated

290
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,559
because they've been doing it for so

291
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,719
long and now they they need to change

292
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,559
their ways and so on and so forth but

293
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,639
thanks for clarifying that one let's

294
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:19,039
dive into lighting

295
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:20,958
you have a hps versus led video on your

296
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,919
channel it's it goes over a very good

297
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,319
study

298
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,078
can you talk to us about that study hps

299
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,240
versus led

300
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,159
so this is probably the two

301
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,959
hot topics when it comes to lights the

302
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,559
old

303
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:37,039
uh hps lighting and then the new kid on

304
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,799
the block the led lighting and which

305
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,838
one's better and you've got people kind

306
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,359
of in both camps that are old school hps

307
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,399
and then people are dumping all the hps

308
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,839
and going straight um to led and it's

309
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,200
not quite as clear-cut as many growers

310
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,120
kind of associate

311
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,120
hps technology

312
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,759
as we speak today is very good it's

313
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,200
basically 20 plus years refinement of

314
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,759
technology

315
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,680
so there are still some benefits on to

316
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,919
the hps technology led technology is in

317
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,439
its infancy it's improving year to year

318
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,240
it's amazing when you look back five

319
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,519
years how rudimentary it was to kind of

320
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,799
what we see nowadays having said that if

321
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,200
a manufacturer is producing led lights

322
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:25,519
it's not just an led to hps comparison

323
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,440
there are variable forms of led lights

324
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,600
so and they're all not necessarily

325
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,640
treated equally shall we say

326
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,278
so

327
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,039
and it's it's not leds or nothing

328
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,639
there is needs to be an understanding

329
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,958
from a grower to make that educated

330
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,919
decision on which one is the best for

331
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:44,399
them in the study that i found and

332
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:47,919
posted on my channel and it is if you

333
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,679
type in just um led and hps lights and

334
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,639
tobacco university should come up for

335
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,399
you

336
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,240
and it does it tells you what hps

337
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,078
they're using it's a thousand watt um

338
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,519
double ended hps which is pretty much

339
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,479
the gold standard for commercial

340
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,278
production

341
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,039
and then they had three led lights of

342
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,559
those three they determined based on

343
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,679
their own tests in the study that only

344
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,078
one kind of

345
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,679
rose to the top and was worthy of uh

346
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,319
comparison

347
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:15,599
they ended up going with the fluence

348
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,278
spyder x plus led light uh they had two

349
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,759
others that they simply determined were

350
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,919
not near of comparison so that just

351
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,078
shows you right there that here's three

352
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:27,039
led lights and only one made it to be

353
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,638
competitive to the hps light

354
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,639
and when they were looking at comparing

355
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,879
you know they're looking at uh really

356
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,879
not so much the photosynthetic process

357
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,799
but what are the plants uh secondary

358
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,919
components what are they producing and

359
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,039
comparing

360
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,879
hps to led lights led lights did come up

361
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,039
a little bit higher um in their

362
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,639
comparison which a lot of growers point

363
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,039
to and say that's why

364
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,000
i need to be using led lights they're

365
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,759
producing so much better than hps lights

366
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
and i just kind of as a caveat just

367
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,000
remind you that there were two led

368
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,278
lights that were tossed out of the study

369
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,919
and that's probably because they were

370
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:05,039
not producing anywhere near

371
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,559
as competitive as the hps lights so

372
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,199
that's really what needs to be taken

373
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,719
into consideration by growers a lot of

374
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,839
wear are still producing very high

375
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,200
quality end products uh grown completely

376
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,680
under

377
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,240
flowering time to end to harvest with

378
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,199
hps lights so it's not liking to throw

379
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,120
them all out they're all the old

380
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,200
technology they're all horrible

381
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,600
led lights are of course the new and

382
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,560
upcoming idea but

383
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,560
not necessarily um a direct kind of

384
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,638
throw old one out go all with the new

385
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,559
one and go all in on that growers really

386
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,320
need to be a little bit more

387
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,359
choosy with their led lights and really

388
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,519
do their

389
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,759
research looking at the spectrums that

390
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,560
they produce and kind of a little bit of

391
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,360
a saying is good led lights right now

392
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,759
are not cheap and cheap led lights are

393
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,759
not good so again what is cheap what is

394
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,240
you know you're looking at led lights

395
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,838
costing well over a thousand dollars for

396
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,639
one light when you combine four hundred

397
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,079
dollars i mean i can buy ten to one well

398
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,560
you're probably getting less than 10

399
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,679
percent of the actual plant production

400
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,759
standpoint they'll be bright they'll

401
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,919
burn your retinas out but they um will

402
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,480
not necessarily be

403
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,759
as advantageous to your plants as you

404
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,199
may think

405
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,039
and there are other forms of lighting

406
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,599
out there right i think one of the ones

407
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,559
that people are still using very

408
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,480
frequently is cmh grow lights can you

409
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,638
talk to us a little bit about them so

410
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,519
cmh and that stands for uh ceramic metal

411
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,198
halide on the lights i think growers

412
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,480
need to really start considering them a

413
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:33,838
little bit more they are gaining

414
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,879
popularity

415
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,199
for those that may have been growing a

416
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,720
couple of years ago metal halides were

417
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,078
the old school version this is the

418
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,000
improvement of

419
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,359
the metal halides image lights

420
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,919
what's great about the

421
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,600
is is if anyone's growing currently with

422
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:51,198
fluorescence particularly for the

423
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,600
seedling clone early stages um cmh

424
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,359
lights are a much easier replacement for

425
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,159
that you don't have to worry about you

426
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,079
know ten bulbs eight bulbs one bulb will

427
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,319
cover that same area

428
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:05,519
so that's great also the cmh is the

429
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,000
ceramic of the cmh really adds a very

430
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,320
long bulb life there

431
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,078
now the downfall of cmhs is that they're

432
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,320
not really great for the flowering phase

433
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,399
uh as a standalone light

434
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,800
however they are being used to kind of

435
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,480
intermix with some spectrums

436
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,078
they do produce a fair amount of heat so

437
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,720
they are not you know completely you

438
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,479
know no heat but no real light is

439
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,120
and as always because of the metal

440
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,680
halide in the bulb disposal while a long

441
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,600
time away is of course worth um

442
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,919
consideration as far as what you're

443
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,680
actually going to be doing uh with that

444
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,838
now having said that

445
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,679
we're looking at the sometimes are

446
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,199
called lec lights just their light

447
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,638
emitting ceramics

448
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,159
i think cmh is going to be the term

449
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,159
that's going to carry on but sometimes

450
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,159
they use leds and cmh interchangeably

451
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,879
and they are pretty much talking about

452
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,480
the um same thing on there

453
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,399
something else that's great about cmhs

454
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,680
for anyone that has used them is they

455
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,639
have a great what's called a cri

456
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:05,120
which is a color rendering index so this

457
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,919
is something we talk about leds as well

458
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,519
the

459
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:11,360
cris for most cmhs are up there in the

460
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,879
you know high 90s itch area which

461
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,639
basically means the colors that you're

462
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,278
going to look at your plants under that

463
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,198
light are going to be very true to type

464
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,559
versus hps lights are going to have very

465
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,599
much that heavy

466
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,198
yellowish orangish kind of tones to it

467
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,040
and that goes back to the led lights

468
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,439
when i'm talking about led lights i'm

469
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,039
talking about full spectrum led lights a

470
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,720
lot of people think when they see led

471
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,759
lights think of those purple high power

472
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,160
lights

473
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,919
and those really wreak havoc on the eyes

474
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,480
you need to wear special glasses it

475
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,439
makes it very difficult to be able to go

476
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,000
through and view your plants for disease

477
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,720
diagnosis for scouting purposes and that

478
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,799
is one great advantage of on the cmh

479
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,759
lights is they have that high

480
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:56,879
cri index now they do come very much in

481
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,959
a 315 and a 630 watt so a lot of growers

482
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,720
might be thinking well i have an hps

483
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,719
light at a thousand well why am i even

484
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,038
going to consider these lights and based

485
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,959
on par readings they do produce very

486
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:11,439
high on par so for example a 315 uh

487
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,160
wattage cmh light that's going to cover

488
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,959
about a three by three flower area or a

489
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,880
four by four veg area and a 630 is going

490
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,279
to be about a 5x5 veg or 4x4

491
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,919
flower there so don't let those smaller

492
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,318
wattages worry about the small footprint

493
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,520
they still can cover quite a bit of

494
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:34,639
square footage area in addition to cmhs

495
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,879
there's a lot of bulb options um as well

496
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,960
most are lasting 20 000 hours and still

497
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,559
producing over 80 of their initial

498
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,720
brilliance which is great

499
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,798
i'm personally a fan of the philips

500
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,600
master color one but there's a lot more

501
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,519
coming on scene to be a little bit more

502
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,399
competitive you're getting a lot that

503
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,160
are producing uh particularly spectrums

504
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,160
getting into more of a flowering light

505
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,240
more of a daytime light

506
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,519
so it's great just pop a bulb out pop a

507
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,960
new one right in

508
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,480
and it really allows you to keep the

509
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,480
same fixtures but also have the ability

510
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,279
and even in flower to produce some of

511
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,960
that uv light and some of that far red

512
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,399
spectrums that are very important for

513
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,240
their full

514
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,200
secondary compounds productions of

515
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,440
plants

516
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,279
they allow the production of that which

517
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,679
is why they're being interested to mix

518
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,798
in with some hps lights or some led

519
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,798
lights

520
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,839
used throughout the entire grow cycle

521
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:29,679
but use kind of alone or singly in the

522
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,038
veg cycle and then using it as that

523
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,960
spectrum mix because they're able to

524
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:33,839
produce some of those wavelengths that

525
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,360
other

526
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,199
brands of their

527
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,879
classifications of lights tend to

528
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,600
struggle with i know there are some

529
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,760
studies out there with people who are

530
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,439
using lighting and seeing its effects on

531
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,119
trichomes so for the plants that have

532
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,440
trichomes cannabinoids terpenes they're

533
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,678
taking a look at what lighting can do

534
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,240
for that cannabinoids they get a bunch

535
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,038
of acknowledgement a lot of people talk

536
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,798
about them terpenes not as many people

537
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,279
really talk about them or really focus

538
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,038
on them or really test them as much as

539
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,038
they do cannabinoids so i want to get a

540
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,798
little bit deeper into terpenes can you

541
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,798
talk to us about terpenes you know what

542
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,639
are they maybe some of the common ones

543
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,720
et cetera et cetera

544
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,480
so what are you know terpenes in the

545
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,160
basic sense uh some people come in

546
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,679
terpenoids as well i tend to use

547
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,320
terpenes most people i find these

548
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,559
terpenes it's the largest most diverse

549
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:28,879
group of naturally occurring compounds

550
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:31,200
so it is a very broad category and we're

551
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,280
carving you know all spectrums here uh

552
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,798
they are naturally occurring uh they are

553
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,160
chemical compounds but everyone freaks

554
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,400
out when they hear the term chemical but

555
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,320
they are naturally derived

556
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,400
in the plant actually found in plants

557
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,918
and couples and some animals as well

558
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,120
they're what they're really responsible

559
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,440
for is the aromas the flavors sometimes

560
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,199
even colorations associated with various

561
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,480
types of variegation

562
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,360
plants can be

563
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,759
based on terpenes for the plants

564
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,240
and the reason why plants produce them

565
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,079
is they're the plants response to like

566
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,240
harsh weather conditions that could be

567
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,558
stresses such as high light or

568
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,200
temperature fluctuations uh and also

569
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,240
predators uh herbivores in particular

570
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,679
um

571
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,759
for what they do in humans you know how

572
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,519
they impact when humans consume them is

573
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,679
different ways we're still currently

574
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,158
doing research on that uh because there

575
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,759
are quote just so many of them so how do

576
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,039
we kind of go about classifying them and

577
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,119
this might get a little bit more into

578
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,759
the um science of things but they're

579
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,519
kind of initially classified from a

580
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,919
scientific standpoint it's kind of like

581
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,480
the number of carbon atoms so how big is

582
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,840
the molecule you know a monoterpene and

583
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,360
a lot of people think monoterpene they

584
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,678
think oh it's got one little carbon atom

585
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:42,079
and really those monoterpenes really

586
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,480
have 10 carbon atoms and then diterpenes

587
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,759
have 20 and tri-terpines have 30. so

588
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,120
it's kind of like think about it as

589
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,839
little packages of

590
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,678
uh 10 carbon atoms and those mono

591
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,639
terpenes a lot of times for medicinal

592
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,038
purposes you're looking at fragrances or

593
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,280
repellent type properties your diet

594
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,279
terpenes can get into some advantages um

595
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,839
humans for what we might use them for

596
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,720
medicinally such as

597
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:06,240
anti-inflammatory issues or

598
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,558
cardiovascular diseases there's been

599
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,640
some indications that classification can

600
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,519
help and then try terpenes like wound

601
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,480
healing can help increase uh circulation

602
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,879
help us speed up the recovery time of a

603
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,679
potential wound or laceration of the

604
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,240
dermal layer so um and because this is

605
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,919
so diverse you can't just say oh this

606
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,798
terpene has to do this and only this

607
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,960
there can be a lot of also interactions

608
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,639
um with these um you know how to give

609
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,079
about these interactions why do we need

610
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,880
these studies well they do impact the

611
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,558
brain the neurological on pathway so

612
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,120
some can have potential psychoactive

613
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,359
effects but they don't produce like

614
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,359
intoxicating effects like some

615
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:48,798
cannabinoids have a little bit stronger

616
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:51,199
binding to receptors there so early

617
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:53,440
research is being done on these because

618
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,400
they are produced in a wide variety of

619
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,279
plants and what's warranting the greater

620
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,200
investigation is that they potentially

621
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:04,399
for um some help with mental health or

622
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,640
anxiety depression by bipolar disorder

623
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,720
there is some early research indicating

624
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,759
that it might be worth studying these or

625
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,079
it might be worth going on this

626
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,480
classification because there could

627
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,038
really be something um there now

628
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,319
terpenes is for you know tossing out the

629
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,000
general term you know the the tea tree

630
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,839
is an example that contains active

631
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,359
ingredients to create potential

632
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:30,000
infections um there uh citrus fruits you

633
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,519
know that's a very commonly associated

634
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,079
you know aroma

635
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,000
or smell that you're getting and some of

636
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:37,279
those like for example

637
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,880
lemongrass

638
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:42,639
you know has that nice lemony uh kind of

639
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,559
odor to it and that is actually while it

640
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,640
smells you know nice and lemony to us

641
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:49,759
it's actually the plant's response to

642
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,600
repelling insects from feeding on it

643
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,960
some have certain anti-microbial

644
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,918
properties you know anti-fungal

645
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,840
properties so there is a lot there

646
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,919
within the vast amount of terpenes and

647
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:03,599
if you you know search up any you know

648
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:06,080
terpene uh poster or profile or list you

649
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,599
know uh lemony just for one that i

650
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,439
mentioned there one of the most common

651
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,599
found terpenes

652
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,038
distinct citrus notes there

653
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,359
potential you know anti-anxiety

654
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:18,240
properties but the plants producing it

655
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,158
to like repel insects per se so there is

656
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,079
a reason why these plants are producing

657
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,559
these it's not quote for our benefit

658
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,960
we're just simply taking uh advantage of

659
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:27,839
that another common one like the pinenes

660
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,600
you know it comes from the

661
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,319
connoisseurous forest ever walked into a

662
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:35,759
pine tree the carnivorous um you know

663
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:38,158
tree aroma that is kind of that key sent

664
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:41,599
there and those may have antidepressant

665
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,320
properties as well as well as a host of

666
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,480
others there and really comes down to

667
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,278
you know doing that science there doing

668
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,400
that research doing those studies

669
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,880
and that's really what's going to be

670
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,320
important taking these forward from a

671
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,559
consumer standpoint if you're looking at

672
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,439
purchasing products for terpenes as you

673
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,918
mentioned

674
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,400
the cannabinoids get all the attention

675
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,480
but if you're purchasing anything

676
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,960
plant-based should be looking for a cla

677
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,480
certificate of authenticity or a label

678
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,558
and a lot of times that will have lab

679
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,759
test results that people may just flip

680
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:15,678
over but they will often or reputable

681
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:17,679
companies will test for terpenes should

682
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,759
also be looking as a side note for heavy

683
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,519
metals microbiology and aflotoxins and

684
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,359
making sure there's no pesticides and

685
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,519
all those boxes are checked but

686
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,519
oftentimes there will be terpenes as

687
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,839
well tested for and that leads us to

688
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,359
like terpene profiles where you're

689
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,158
looking at okay well produces high of

690
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,678
one well how may that interact with

691
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,760
another terpene

692
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,360
how is that interacting with this

693
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,200
profile of like it's not just one

694
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,359
terpene it might be a mixture there

695
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,200
might be some advantages of some

696
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,399
synergistic effects which is really a

697
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,960
great

698
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,278
aspect where i always say one plus one

699
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,558
doesn't always equal two one plus one

700
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,159
could have an additive effect it could

701
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,319
equal three where you're getting uh

702
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,159
additional benefits that if you had

703
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,519
consumed just one terpene and then just

704
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,159
another terpene well adding them

705
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:04,798
together causes this synergistic effect

706
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,919
kind of like a cal bag a lot of times

707
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:07,119
you don't just find calcium products

708
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,880
from magnesium products we find a

709
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,119
calcium magnesium product and that's

710
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,200
another example of a nutrient having a

711
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,359
synergistic effect to increase its

712
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,120
uptake in the plant

713
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,119
for those concerning certain certain

714
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,599
terpenes heat

715
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,599
they are unstable that's not unstable to

716
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,599
mean that they're you know bad unstable

717
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,839
to mean in really high heat situations

718
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,158
the molecules these carbon molecules

719
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,639
basically fall apart so if you're

720
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,720
looking at adding a lot of heat

721
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,000
to your method of consumption that could

722
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,558
really

723
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,919
negatively impact the amount of terpenes

724
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,079
you might be getting you want to keep

725
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,960
the heat on the lower end so you're not

726
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:47,678
basically vaporizing or dissociating

727
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,679
those valuable terpene molecules and as

728
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,559
everyone should be keeping you know for

729
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,559
those who are growing but also using a

730
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,000
log you know just a little diary it may

731
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,038
sound a little old school may sound a

732
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,519
little uh basic but just having an idea

733
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,679
of you know what profile did you have

734
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,599
what effects did you feel did you like

735
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,400
it not like it and then you could start

736
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,558
to find some commonalities and kind of

737
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,038
go that route as far as what you might

738
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,359
be investigating uh going further to

739
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,519
help make something that matches your

740
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,359
condition the best way possible

741
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,960
you mentioned a key point there that i

742
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,439
think a lot of people aren't aware of is

743
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,200
that the temperature as it's increasing

744
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,880
these terpenes are volatizing right

745
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,080
they're disappearing so a lot of people

746
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,000
walk into the garden they'll open up

747
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,480
their grow tent for example and they'll

748
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,640
get a huge whiff and like

749
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,400
ah smells wonderful everything's going

750
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,080
great is it really going great are you

751
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,038
losing all those terpenes because your

752
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,278
heat is too high right so um like you

753
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,319
mentioned lowering the temperature you

754
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,159
know certainly towards the end of

755
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:49,038
flowering can help conserve some of

756
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,200
those terpenes from my understanding

757
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,038
different terpenes will volatize at

758
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,558
different temperatures i wish there was

759
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:55,839
a chart i've been looking online i wish

760
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:57,678
there was a chart where it broke down

761
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,359
the terpene and then what temperature it

762
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,960
volatizes at not sure if you're aware of

763
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:02,798
that or not but if you can find one and

764
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,079
send it to me i would love it

765
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,599
because i think that's beneficial i

766
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,720
think the general knowledge is to keep

767
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,558
it under

768
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,159
i think it was like under 75 degrees

769
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:13,119
fahrenheit in order and you can you're

770
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,440
conserving most of the terpenes

771
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,519
yeah that 80 degrees anything i've seen

772
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,679
eight of fahrenheit i should say is kind

773
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,839
of the friction point where you start

774
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,080
going above 80 degrees and it's kind of

775
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,480
exponential decay at that point um just

776
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,960
more and more uh breaking it down for

777
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,798
those that um you know might be you know

778
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,079
hearing this and going whoa oh that's

779
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:33,119
much lower

780
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,639
you might want to try that lower

781
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,519
temperature um and you might be

782
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,440
surprised at whatever you you know the

783
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,879
same batch you got one effect will you

784
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,480
lower that temperature and you're like

785
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,320
wow that's what i've been missing that's

786
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,679
been looking for when really it's been

787
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,158
there the whole time

788
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,120
you're just self-degrading it with

789
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,039
excess of heat so just a good kind of uh

790
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,359
word of caution there that you know when

791
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,519
you're dealing with chemicals uh they do

792
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:00,240
dissociate they do fall apart

793
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:03,038
so there is a you know a method of you

794
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,679
know regulating that so you're not just

795
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,440
vaporizing them into oblivion

796
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,960
i used to run the low 80 degree

797
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,200
fahrenheit all the way through all the

798
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,679
way up until harvest and then once i

799
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,720
started dropping it in late flowering to

800
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,360
the high 70s fahrenheit i definitely i

801
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,720
can clearly notice a difference so

802
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,119
definitely for those folks that are

803
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,000
tuning in that are maybe running it

804
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:28,158
at low 80s all the way up until harvest

805
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,398
maybe try the next round in the high 70s

806
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,640
and see if there's a difference there i

807
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,918
i certainly had noticed one myself

808
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,759
now is there anything that can be done

809
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,960
in guard while gardening in order to

810
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:41,359
increase terpenes or cannabinoids so

811
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,360
pretty much um you know a lot of growers

812
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,678
want the quote the quick fix and how can

813
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:48,158
i maximize this and of course a lot of

814
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,360
it is genetic so the genes aren't there

815
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,799
i don't care what you do the plant and

816
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,798
it's not going to really you know help

817
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,398
anything but kind of going back to the

818
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,398
previous point that we had mentioned is

819
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,959
you know the lighting there is some

820
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:02,000
great information coming out that you

821
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,759
know the importance of lighting is um

822
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,278
important for those plants to be able to

823
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:09,278
maximize their you know final output of

824
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,278
you know total products there and this

825
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:14,880
is looking at not to say just a bright

826
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:17,359
light but the you know intensity of that

827
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,640
light does play into it as well and the

828
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:22,479
spectrum um of light also plays into it

829
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,159
so you know i just wanted to buy the the

830
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,839
miracle light that's going to solve all

831
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,559
of your problems there

832
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:31,119
that's where we're getting into more

833
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:33,678
experimentation with different you know

834
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:36,398
light levels and spectrums of light so i

835
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,320
mentioned par earlier which is referring

836
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,879
to that mainly that photosynthetically

837
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,798
active kind of portion of the light

838
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,360
spectrum but as we're you know doing

839
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,359
more research and looking at more things

840
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,918
there's you know wavelengths beyond that

841
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,918
just that simple that par um reading uh

842
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,880
there and sometimes or what we're

843
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,440
finding is potentially intensifying

844
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,360
wavelengths outside of just that par

845
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,360
might be advantageous there there's

846
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:04,798
ultraviolet light which is kind of under

847
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:07,038
that 400 nanometers or so or that far

848
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:09,599
red pretty much talking about that 700

849
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:11,519
or so nanometers and when we think of uv

850
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,918
light we think of purple um coloration

851
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,319
and that is true um that's touching the

852
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,799
um uv light spectrum but there are

853
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,200
important wavelengths that are basically

854
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,200
out of the visible spectrum we simply

855
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,798
can't see it what's interesting is some

856
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,519
bees can actually see those wavelengths

857
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:27,200
and

858
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,519
flowers can look very different under a

859
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,519
uv light to a bee than weekend

860
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,038
but there are wavelengths that plants

861
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:34,240
are able to receive there are receptors

862
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:36,000
for these

863
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,480
wavelengths outside of that range that

864
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,839
doesn't mean you go down to you know 200

865
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,079
nanometers or up to a thousand

866
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,439
nanometers and your cell phone or radio

867
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,000
waves are gonna do something to a plant

868
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,480
not necessarily but really that 300 to

869
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,319
800 or so nanometers when par is only

870
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,798
400 to 700 do play a role and you know

871
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,200
what they're doing is there are some cmh

872
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,480
lights uh that are basically a high uv

873
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,640
light spectrum

874
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,679
and they are recommending you only use

875
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,840
those lights in your last 10 days or 7

876
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,200
to 10 days of flower and it's what it's

877
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,359
doing that uv light is actually

878
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,200
stressing the plant out now the reason

879
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,519
why you only want to use it for the last

880
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,798
week or so is it stressing the plant out

881
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,120
in the sense it's not going to grow a

882
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,440
whole lot more but it's going to signal

883
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,199
the plant to produce those terpenes to

884
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,000
produce those cannabinoids to produce

885
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,840
those secondary components um quite

886
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,159
quite a bit as a stress response because

887
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:29,678
as i mentioned you know the lemon scent

888
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,919
you know in lemongrass that's really to

889
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,480
repel insects so you're kind of forcing

890
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,559
the plant uh stressing out a little bit

891
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,880
to get it to produce the necessary

892
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:41,440
compounds that you're looking to produce

893
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,159
there and i said that uv and far red

894
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,720
light probably are the ones that are the

895
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,480
ones to focus on now a lot of or some

896
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,480
companies are coming out with lights

897
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,640
with all these dials on it and they say

898
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,319
you can choose your spectrum um you can

899
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,399
choose whatever you want how i increase

900
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:58,960
the reds and the blues and everything in

901
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:00,398
between and that's great

902
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,919
but i think this is a case where the

903
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,918
lighting technology the physical

904
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,840
products are getting ahead of the plant

905
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,360
science so knowing the best lighting

906
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,720
spectrum recipe some growers may call it

907
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,558
i would argue and say it's still being

908
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,919
researched i think we're seeing

909
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,319
definitely uv light is showing an

910
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,240
indication but how much uv light what

911
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:19,439
spectrums of uv light and for what

912
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,720
duration

913
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,840
i would argue

914
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,200
is still not well um understood

915
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,678
definitely it does have an impact as

916
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,720
well as far red but what is the

917
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,559
correct recipe i really can't tell you

918
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,159
um i would suggest experimenting and

919
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:35,440
there's continue to be experiments going

920
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,120
on with that

921
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,200
so it's great that you so in some cases

922
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:41,439
you can adjust everything but

923
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,038
i don't think we're at that stage yet

924
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,880
where at this many days in you're going

925
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,798
to turn this dial at this many days and

926
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,559
you're going to flip this other dial

927
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,119
i don't think we're at that level yet

928
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,639
despite the technology uh being there it

929
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,359
might make it feel good well i can

930
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,080
change all these spectrums but as far as

931
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:00,158
increasing and what's the best spectrum

932
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,839
i would say still be debated and science

933
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,519
really is still looking at

934
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:06,158
that to be honest

935
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,720
i've heard about precision stress as far

936
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,240
as triggering the terpenes and

937
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,558
cannabinoids and you already mentioned

938
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,679
with lighting with it i've also heard

939
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,639
about

940
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,679
these baby falls but everything from

941
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,038
adding more wind to parts of the plant

942
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,960
in order to

943
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:26,079
stress it out that way i've heard about

944
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,640
uh depriving it of nutrients or or even

945
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,879
over feeding nutrients in order to

946
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,038
stress the plant that way is that true

947
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,120
are those precision stress techniques

948
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,558
will that actually trigger more terpenes

949
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,158
and cannabinoids are there any things

950
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:39,519
that people should avoid any techniques

951
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,760
that they should avoid

952
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,919
so there's many ways to stress the plant

953
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,000
we're looking at stressing a plant to

954
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,399
produce the compounds we want

955
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,240
so for example if you let's just say

956
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:51,518
over water the plant that's going to

957
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,519
definitely stress it is going to stress

958
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,679
it to the point that it produces more

959
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,000
you know terpenes cannabinoids probably

960
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,840
not i'm just going to stress it in ways

961
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,640
that are going to cause it to kind of

962
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:05,038
like go into shutdown mode um and not

963
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,720
stress it in a good way

964
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,039
you're right with wind that can be

965
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,559
utilized um to you know stress plants

966
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,918
but probably not

967
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:15,519
increase those uh terpene production so

968
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,039
with that lighting the weight why is

969
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,519
that why is lighting you know a main

970
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,838
focus there well what it's doing is that

971
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:23,358
uv light a lot of the times the parts of

972
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,358
the plant we want are the ones exposed

973
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,119
to lighting so when they're exposed to

974
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,519
that harsh uv light they're going to

975
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,039
produce those secondary compounds and

976
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,039
those secondary compounds they produce

977
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,358
in response to that are typically in

978
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,000
those flavonoids terpenes cannabinoids

979
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:40,480
um kind of classification if you look at

980
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,039
some early plants uh poison ivy is a

981
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,280
major one everyone always says um you

982
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,239
know three leaves three shiny leaves of

983
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,919
green stay away um well early on when

984
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,398
poison 90 first comes out actually is

985
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:55,279
very heavy red tones to it and that's

986
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:56,878
the way of those very early leaves

987
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,560
self-protecting themselves from the

988
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:00,880
harsh uv light

989
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,639
you might see that with blueberries for

990
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,640
example or certain fruits that change

991
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,078
color or peppers or something you wait

992
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:07,759
for a different color to turn well

993
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,920
that's kind of that same compounds in

994
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,599
there that are changing coloration and a

995
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,480
lot of times it does come with you know

996
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,680
lighting

997
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,599
and you're looking at producing those

998
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,799
phytocompounds and a lot of those if

999
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,880
you're making a very broad stroke those

1000
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,119
cannabinoids those terpenes are

1001
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,440
basically kind of those fido which is

1002
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,280
light kind of base components there

1003
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,119
as a result changing the lighting is

1004
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,720
really what's going to change that other

1005
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,400
things as you mentioned there well you

1006
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,399
know different pruning methods can also

1007
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,000
stress the plants but are those going to

1008
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,000
stress the plants in a way to produce

1009
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,239
more cannabinoids more terpenes

1010
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,440
probably not to the greatest degree we

1011
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,039
would want

1012
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,200
some point city grower some greenhouse

1013
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,279
growers will actually to keep their

1014
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,519
plants shorter to keep their plants

1015
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,440
stunted but not in a negative way they

1016
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,759
actually take what looks like i'm going

1017
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,280
to order this kind of like a if you go

1018
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,280
to a car wash you know they've got the

1019
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,960
big you know the kind of brushes that

1020
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,320
you kind of drive through there well

1021
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,240
they actually take

1022
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,079
fine pieces of plastic and they go over

1023
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,919
the plants like a big giant brush down

1024
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,119
the whole row and they just touch the

1025
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,800
plants they tickle the plants so to

1026
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,320
speak and that sense there because

1027
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,240
they're in a controlled environment not

1028
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,320
a lot of wind is it the sense of them

1029
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,879
being outside and helps reduce the

1030
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,640
internode spacing so that is a stress to

1031
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,559
the plant but is that your internet

1032
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,960
spacing going to produce more terpenes

1033
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:24,719
probably not so just a little comparison

1034
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,480
there of stressing the plant is one

1035
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,559
thing stretching to produce

1036
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,000
terpenes cannabinoids a little specific

1037
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:31,519
stress there

1038
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,920
what you mentioned about keeping the

1039
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,320
plant short brings us into our next

1040
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,760
subject which is plant growth regulators

1041
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,400
a lot of people using plant growth

1042
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,560
regulators to alter the way the plants

1043
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,480
are grown some are naturally occurring

1044
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,400
right can you talk to us about what you

1045
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,039
know about them and how they impact

1046
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,039
plant growth sure so a lot of the times

1047
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,960
when we're selling an end product

1048
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,559
uh there are a lot of times there are

1049
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,880
tests for

1050
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,799
pgrs plant course regulators and pretty

1051
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,960
much across the board not really

1052
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,760
permitted to be used and often tested

1053
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,000
for

1054
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,520
so but there can be a substantial impact

1055
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,679
on the plant morphology meaning how the

1056
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,759
plant actually looks which is why

1057
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,000
they're kind of being used there um they

1058
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,079
can help increase density um of plant

1059
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,159
and it can be a very night and day

1060
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,320
difference um there um and that can

1061
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:20,159
really improve the return on investment

1062
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,800
which is a lot why a lot of growers

1063
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,920
start to seek seek them out for example

1064
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,680
as you mentioned there are naturally

1065
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,119
occurring uh plant hormones so let's go

1066
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,440
with regulators we'll broaden that to

1067
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,280
hormones there and animals are taking

1068
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,320
like a regular um you know high school

1069
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,480
biology or botany class uh auxins

1070
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,960
gibberellins um

1071
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,440
abscisic acid ethylene all these should

1072
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,679
come to mind so probably the one most

1073
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,720
growers are utilizing and is often

1074
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,480
allowed

1075
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,480
in pretty much all production again

1076
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,599
depending on different regulations but

1077
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,960
auxin as a rooting compound now it does

1078
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,640
other things but

1079
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,119
it's found in a lot of rooting compounds

1080
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,118
if you're making clones or cuttings

1081
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,480
or air grafting or something like that

1082
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,119
auxin might be something you might want

1083
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,559
to be utilizing to help increase that

1084
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,760
root formation

1085
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,838
gibberellins has kind of helped the

1086
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,839
plants stretch so if you want to keep a

1087
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:11,679
plant you know more dwarf tighter

1088
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:13,440
internet spacing well there's you know

1089
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:14,799
you want to kind of like block or reduce

1090
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,480
the jib around so you don't want to like

1091
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,960
stretch out like crazy

1092
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,358
abscisic acid is involved a lot and

1093
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,358
usually seed dormancy keeping the seed

1094
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,119
dormant so you don't want an apple tree

1095
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,480
to fall an apple to fall off the tree

1096
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,559
and immediately grow into another apple

1097
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,719
tree there's epicyc acid in there to

1098
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:32,400
delay it from germinating because the

1099
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,199
offspring don't want to directly compete

1100
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,960
with the mother or stock plant there and

1101
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,639
ethylene most

1102
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,480
people not even growers are probably

1103
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,799
most familiar with that's usually the

1104
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,320
ripening hormone so if you ever get that

1105
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,000
hard piece of fruit and throat in a

1106
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,000
paper bag and you wait a couple days and

1107
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,760
you pull it out it's nice and

1108
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
soft well what you've done is you

1109
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,720
basically condense the ethylene speeding

1110
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,239
up that ripening process originally it

1111
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,879
was a big problem because ethylene is

1112
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,719
actually in very small amounts a product

1113
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,559
of internal combustion engines very

1114
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:05,199
small amounts but they were shipping

1115
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,880
tomatoes from the west coast to the east

1116
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:09,118
coast and having an issue with them

1117
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,200
speed ripening it was literally the

1118
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,440
slight exhaust from the truck

1119
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:14,960
causing those tomatoes to ripen much

1120
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,720
much quicker than they originally

1121
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,639
anticipated so

1122
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,559
something else to just consider there

1123
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:23,118
when we're talking about these impacts

1124
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,320
of these plant hormones now can they be

1125
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,599
dangerous you know why are they testing

1126
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,359
for these well

1127
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,280
it's often still debated on how

1128
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:31,598
dangerous or which ones are maybe more

1129
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,280
dangerous than others but from a medical

1130
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,160
perspective it's really best to avoid

1131
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,920
them

1132
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:36,960
particularly the synthetic ones whenever

1133
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,358
possible

1134
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,199
simply because we don't know i guess

1135
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:42,559
it's the best way to put it there is

1136
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:45,598
some indication that there could be some

1137
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:47,440
dangerous ones there is um the european

1138
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,280
union as well as the united states do

1139
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,599
have some regulations there as far as

1140
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,200
what might be approved what not might be

1141
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,800
approved which ones they might be

1142
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,319
scanning for

1143
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,400
not approved for certain use in food

1144
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,320
products the united states versus canada

1145
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,400
and other regions so there is some early

1146
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,559
indications that we would definitely

1147
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,838
want to proceed with caution uh when

1148
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:09,279
using pgrs and know where your end

1149
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,358
product might be going if it is

1150
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,720
regulated if it is tested for

1151
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:16,480
try to find other means uh for you know

1152
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:18,078
obtaining the same plant morphology

1153
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,199
without utilizing those particular

1154
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,640
compounds

1155
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:21,838
you mentioned ethylene gas i want to

1156
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:23,519
bring that i want to bring it back to

1157
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:26,639
that real quick some of these medicinal

1158
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,559
varieties that folks grow some may have

1159
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,879
they might be on a timeline

1160
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,358
and it may not be finished

1161
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,358
at at that time

1162
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,880
now i've heard a little trick is to

1163
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:39,679
place that plant

1164
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,440
next to tomato plants for example which

1165
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,440
are releasing ethylene gas to help with

1166
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,440
the ripening process

1167
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,440
uh you know you also hear about don't

1168
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,838
put your tomatoes next to your bananas

1169
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,920
because that'll you know impact the

1170
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:52,960
bananas it'll it'll turn them a lot

1171
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,960
quicker

1172
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,679
is it true what i mentioned before about

1173
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,440
the

1174
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,358
putting the tomatoes next to the

1175
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,720
medicinal varieties and to help with

1176
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:02,400
ripening

1177
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:03,679
it will help speed up the ripening

1178
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,039
process

1179
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:09,118
will you necessarily get the full

1180
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:11,440
profile of cannabinoids and terpenes

1181
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,280
when you speed up that process maybe not

1182
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,200
necessarily but you will

1183
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,359
improve it in a shorter

1184
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:19,039
duration of time another

1185
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,480
key example

1186
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,719
you know which is flowers in general

1187
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,800
there we had a flower display of you

1188
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,799
know cut flowers for sale and it was the

1189
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,000
only refrigerator in the area and people

1190
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,760
would put their lunch in there and

1191
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,920
they'd put their apples and bananas and

1192
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,240
that was extremely frowned upon because

1193
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,720
as you mentioned that ethylene is a gas

1194
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:38,000
it does speed ripen anything so you

1195
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:39,439
reduce the temperature and you know cut

1196
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,199
flowers to try to slow down the ripening

1197
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,119
well if you add ethylene that's going to

1198
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,480
cause an issue now for the medicinal

1199
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,559
plants you know adding uh you know a

1200
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,719
banana there or you know spraying with

1201
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,519
ethylene anything like that

1202
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:54,318
it could help with the overall ripening

1203
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,960
uh process but you're really looking at

1204
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:59,599
i'm timing it with that plant to also

1205
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,679
produce those compounds so just because

1206
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,160
you're speeding up that that peach or

1207
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,358
that nectarine you know in the paper bag

1208
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,598
it really didn't change anything it just

1209
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:09,358
kind of you know started to break down a

1210
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,039
little bit quicker so

1211
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:12,318
my recommendation for those that want to

1212
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:13,440
speed up that

1213
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:15,599
process

1214
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,838
and that instill return an investment to

1215
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,680
be relatively high if they are not

1216
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:23,039
adding it i would recommend keeping your

1217
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:25,679
light par very high and then also adding

1218
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,838
carbon dioxide enrichment there that

1219
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:30,480
definitely will help speed along that

1220
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:32,239
process we're still kind of getting

1221
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,800
all of the goodies that the plant will

1222
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:37,358
naturally produce without just kind of

1223
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,640
like producing an artificially quick end

1224
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:40,559
product

1225
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:43,759
okay that makes sense

1226
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,199
let's move on to humic and fulvic acids

1227
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,000
i think these are

1228
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,919
very underrated i know um chelation

1229
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,920
comes to mind when you talk about humic

1230
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,639
and fulvic acids can you talk to us

1231
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,720
about humic and fulvic acids sure so you

1232
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:58,559
know basically human folk i'm kind of

1233
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,639
i'm going to talk about them kind of one

1234
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:02,880
in the same they are slightly different

1235
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:04,960
but they basically they're a breakdown

1236
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,680
of prehistoric deposits so if you've

1237
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,358
ever used a true hemichromic acid i know

1238
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:12,159
some come in liquid form but the

1239
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:13,759
powdered form is um kind of like a coal

1240
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:15,358
a very very fine coal if you haven't

1241
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,160
used it before

1242
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,159
there are kind of sedimentation layers

1243
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:22,399
and they are ground to a very fine

1244
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:25,440
granular type fertilizer and it is

1245
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,960
basically really old organic matter

1246
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,039
not really you know true cold but kind

1247
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,760
of gives you that same uh coal-like

1248
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,519
consistency and kind of look to it

1249
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,119
um so again in my channel i've got you

1250
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,880
know a little bit of a research article

1251
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,318
looking at some of the production of

1252
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,880
utilizing some of them because they are

1253
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:43,440
typically used as a

1254
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,000
kind of in combination with other things

1255
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,240
with nutrient treatments and um humic

1256
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,318
acids can enhance phosphorus

1257
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:52,959
fertilization or actually enhance just

1258
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:55,440
regular npk your natural your nitrogen

1259
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,559
phosphorus and potassium fertilizers

1260
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,639
there

1261
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:01,599
they can you know also potentially have

1262
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:03,838
a negative impact on some uh cannabinoid

1263
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,000
production so this is where you've kind

1264
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,679
of got to look at and balance certain

1265
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
things out they can help make nutrients

1266
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:11,118
more available which of course is a

1267
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,760
great thing

1268
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,000
but there can be they can shift uh

1269
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,160
metabolisms implants and potentially

1270
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
cause kind of uh an impact on these

1271
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:21,598
cannabinoids that we're talking about so

1272
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,599
while phosphorus can be you know

1273
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,760
enhanced treatment it may not have

1274
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,200
effect on the cannabinoids they don't

1275
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,960
think that just necessarily oh more

1276
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:30,239
nutrients to the plant a little more of

1277
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,440
everything

1278
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:36,159
not necessarily on the case there

1279
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,720
npk supplementation uh may have an

1280
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:40,799
increased uh in the flowers

1281
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:42,239
but can you know impact other things can

1282
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,240
impact you know some of your other

1283
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,358
cannabinoid production there so this is

1284
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:47,279
where i say

1285
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,279
you know scientific studies are what's

1286
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,240
important and what i try to do again in

1287
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,599
my channel is trying to take some of

1288
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,118
these complex studies because i know

1289
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,760
they're not everyone's great bedtime

1290
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,599
read and try to break them down to the

1291
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,480
simplicities you know you may understand

1292
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,800
all the specific uh plant signaling

1293
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,318
interactions in there but just what are

1294
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,000
some of the bigger pictures and what i

1295
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:06,880
think it really makes some people think

1296
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,480
about

1297
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,119
is you know some practices that they

1298
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,358
just hear people do and just assume um

1299
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,039
they're making you know potentially

1300
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:16,880
incorrect connections as i said with

1301
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,559
that great more nutrients plant

1302
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,000
available perfect you know that's going

1303
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:21,599
to be exactly what the plants need i can

1304
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,760
use less fertilizers

1305
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,440
well everything in moderation on there

1306
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,119
because you can also have an impact on

1307
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,639
other things they may not be you know

1308
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,240
what you necessarily may have thought of

1309
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:34,318
you know you can get a reduction in some

1310
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:36,559
of those uh final end products there

1311
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:38,079
because quote you're not stressing the

1312
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:39,358
plant out you know to go back to our

1313
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,960
previous conversation where if you make

1314
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,559
it too easy for the plant well the

1315
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,920
plant's going to grow just fine you know

1316
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:45,199
and perfect and it's going to think i

1317
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,318
don't need to produce those secondary

1318
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:47,519
compounds because i'm in a perfect

1319
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:50,800
environment

1320
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:53,679
so those levels of stress um you know

1321
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,560
are key um there so i don't i don't mind

1322
00:45:53,679 --> 00:46:00,480
using uh humic and fulvic acids they are

1323
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:02,239
used a lot in fertilizers and great for

1324
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,719
you know high stress nutrient

1325
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,000
applications but just watch the amount

1326
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,000
that you're getting more is not

1327
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,358
necessarily better even though they'll

1328
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,280
often say you can add as much as you

1329
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:13,358
want you know humic acid isn't going to

1330
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,960
completely you know growing in a ph of 2

1331
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:16,799
or anything like that

1332
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,800
but it is just something worth

1333
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,400
consideration that yes you can

1334
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,880
incorporate a lot of products do come

1335
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,519
with it incorporated but just watch the

1336
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,400
amount that you add because more is not

1337
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:30,960
necessarily better in this case well

1338
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,440
said let's get into flushing

1339
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,119
controversial topic you have several

1340
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,119
videos on flushing

1341
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,200
what's your overall stance on it and

1342
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,318
what's the best way to go about it so i

1343
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:41,279
guess the most important part with

1344
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:43,119
flushing

1345
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,960
in general and if you type you know

1346
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,079
properly how to properly flush on my

1347
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,480
channel

1348
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,800
i found a great thesis related to

1349
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,240
irrigation events and doctoral

1350
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,920
dissertation

1351
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:55,519
and you know it goes through and it

1352
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,440
really provides a great kind of

1353
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:58,960
breakdown here of some options that they

1354
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,800
chose and why you would flush so first

1355
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,880
off i guess flushing in general you know

1356
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,560
kind of what is it it's typically done

1357
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,400
at the end of a flowering cycle to kind

1358
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,159
of flush away and that's where it gets

1359
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,880
its name the root zone

1360
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:13,679
of a nutrients because if you over pack

1361
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,920
the root zone with nutrients and salts

1362
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:18,480
that can have a negative impact on you

1363
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,240
know flavors and aromas you can reduce

1364
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,240
those you know aromatic compounds by

1365
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:24,000
salts and a lot of growers will tell me

1366
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:25,598
well you know i'd stay away i look make

1367
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,440
sure there's not a lot of salt you know

1368
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,720
in any fertilizer i'm using

1369
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:33,119
well from a plant standpoint a botanical

1370
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:35,759
standpoint a chemical standpoint

1371
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,200
every nutrient is basically a salt

1372
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,960
that's how their plant available you

1373
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,598
know we're not fertilizing with pure

1374
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,519
iron we don't take you know an iron nail

1375
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:46,000
and go through and file it down and you

1376
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:47,358
know add iron filings um that's really

1377
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,639
not gonna be plant available so we're

1378
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:50,000
getting a lot of these compounds you

1379
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:51,440
know that just straight nitrogen that's

1380
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,559
in the air we're all breathing so why do

1381
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,240
they need nitrogen

1382
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,760
well it needs to be in you know our

1383
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:57,598
nitrates are ammonia things like that

1384
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,599
are plant available and those fall into

1385
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,519
classification of salts so just because

1386
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,200
it's not sodium chloride doesn't mean

1387
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:04,318
necessarily that it's not

1388
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,000
a salt

1389
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,239
so they went through and they had

1390
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,400
controlled um treatments they did mild

1391
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:11,838
stress they did moderate stress and they

1392
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,920
just started to look at you know dry

1393
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:16,318
matter you know what just a nice

1394
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,599
comparison um there and in any graph

1395
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:19,440
you're looking at

1396
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,559
uh be mindful you might see letters

1397
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,079
above these different bars and for the

1398
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,480
statisticians that you know they can get

1399
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,800
into the details but for the the lay

1400
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,280
person just understand that if the

1401
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,359
letter is the same even if one bar is

1402
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,000
higher than the other bar if the letters

1403
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:37,920
are the same they're basically the same

1404
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,760
there's the variability means that

1405
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,079
they're basically the same thing and

1406
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,359
they're statistically the same i guess i

1407
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,039
should say

1408
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:46,719
so we see all these bars of high and low

1409
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,279
look at all these differences well the

1410
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:51,598
p-value the letters are are the same

1411
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,440
then it's basically uh the same thing so

1412
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,000
what did you know what the general kind

1413
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:59,838
of summary really is that there really

1414
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,800
is not any one method of flushing a plan

1415
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:04,239
there's not just that one way that this

1416
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,880
is how you flush if you're not doing it

1417
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:08,479
this way then you're wrong

1418
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,920
and a lot of what why you're like why

1419
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,679
all this variability can i hear about

1420
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,920
everyone doing it well it also comes

1421
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,000
down to what media you're growing in are

1422
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,400
you growing in a soilless media are you

1423
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,599
growing in a rockwool media are you

1424
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,440
growing an aeroponic media um there you

1425
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,318
know that's really where a lot of this

1426
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,599
variability um does come in how old are

1427
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:29,599
your plants you know what are you

1428
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,599
fertilizing with are you feeling more

1429
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,119
organic fertilizers with or more

1430
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,280
chemically based

1431
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,200
for the organic growers organic based

1432
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,280
nutrients you might have to flush for

1433
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:41,838
longer those organic nutrients take

1434
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,359
longer to break down those chemical

1435
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:45,119
based nutrients which chemical is not

1436
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:47,119
bad and a lot of people think chemical

1437
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,480
bad organic good that's so always the

1438
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,318
case

1439
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,880
those chemical fertilizers they're going

1440
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,480
to flush much closer to their harvest

1441
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,920
time because you're going to be able to

1442
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,559
get rid of those nutrients much quicker

1443
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,680
and no one's really studied the exact

1444
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,359
like you know

1445
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:05,358
chemistry behind all the different

1446
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,440
flushings based on all the medias or to

1447
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,838
get into some of the details the cec or

1448
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,880
cation exchange capacity that plays into

1449
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:12,880
it

1450
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,440
remember just that goal is to reduce

1451
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,440
those nutrients in the root sound you

1452
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,920
kind of want that plant as a stress to

1453
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,599
pull any last availability break down

1454
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,318
those nutrients produce those high

1455
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:27,280
aromas produce those high aromatic

1456
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:30,159
compounds and avoid some of the salt

1457
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,160
contamination which can cause that now

1458
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:33,199
another variable to the aspect you don't

1459
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:34,399
have to make people think that i'm never

1460
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,318
going to flush again because there's too

1461
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,880
much variables but consider the water

1462
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:42,000
you're flushing with consider the ph the

1463
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,800
ec or parts per million of that water

1464
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,159
you know the purer and more ph neutral

1465
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,318
the better

1466
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,318
because if you have a well water that

1467
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:52,000
has a lot of just natural calcium or

1468
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:53,440
magnesium deposits in there a lot of

1469
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,800
lime in that water

1470
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,039
you think you're flushing on flushing

1471
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,359
with just pure water well just because

1472
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:01,119
you didn't add nutrients is it really

1473
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:02,400
pure water so you want to consider that

1474
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,200
um as well

1475
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,119
and

1476
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:08,000
when you're flushing am i flushing too

1477
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,079
early too much too little i will say

1478
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,920
that if you're starting to see yellowing

1479
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,440
of the lower portion of the plant

1480
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,440
nitrogen typically is that first

1481
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,960
nutrient that's flushed away so if your

1482
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,720
lower leaves are starting to turn yellow

1483
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,480
when you're flushing you're probably

1484
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:21,838
just flushing just a little bit too much

1485
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,760
because you're reducing that nitrogen

1486
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:25,599
you're flushing that out um and that'll

1487
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,200
be the first nutrient to go that's kind

1488
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,720
of like a grower's warning sign that hey

1489
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,039
my lower leaves are turning a little

1490
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,078
lighter green a little yellowish that

1491
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:34,800
could be a sign you're a little

1492
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:37,280
aggressive on your flushing and

1493
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,119
timing is very important you know that's

1494
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,400
why keeping notes keeping logs very

1495
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,838
important

1496
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,800
in the sense of depends what media

1497
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:44,558
you're growing with if you're growing a

1498
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,800
soil base if you're an outdoor grower

1499
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,319
you'll be flushing for a lot longer than

1500
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,839
someone who's hydroponic to kind of give

1501
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:52,079
you both ends or extremes of the

1502
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:53,119
spectrum there hydroponics if you lose

1503
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,440
that nutrient the plant's going to be

1504
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,599
devoid of it very quick turnaround time

1505
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,519
soil high buffering capacity going to

1506
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,800
take a lot longer to kind of go through

1507
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:04,000
and flush those nutrients um free from

1508
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,000
there and that's really what comes down

1509
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,400
to knowing your substrate using clay

1510
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,358
pebbles also very short duration

1511
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,200
of time there so the key part is for any

1512
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:14,719
grower looking at trying this that if

1513
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:15,919
they hopefully haven't scared them away

1514
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,519
you take a

1515
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,680
reading of the water going in to take a

1516
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:22,000
parts per million or an ec or tds

1517
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:24,318
whatever unit you're using and then you

1518
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,119
flush that to the water comes out of the

1519
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:29,599
container and you capture that water and

1520
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,318
you test that water and you see

1521
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,079
what nutrient levels are at initially

1522
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,920
and then what they're at after five

1523
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,599
minutes of flushing and did you reduce

1524
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,079
that part per million did you reduce

1525
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,720
that ec levels down that's a good sign

1526
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,240
that you are removing those nutrients

1527
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:45,598
from that root sound

1528
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,838
and that's again goes to your indoor

1529
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,838
outdoor um people just you're gonna have

1530
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:52,078
to flush for a different duration and

1531
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:53,440
also based on the substrate that you are

1532
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,800
utilizing

1533
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,639
even if you don't flush i know there's a

1534
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,240
lot of folks that don't flush that don't

1535
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:01,358
believe in flushing they feed all the

1536
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:03,838
way up until the end or they will just

1537
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:05,759
simply stop feeding like a week before

1538
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:08,000
two weeks before some people call that

1539
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,599
leaching as well even if you feed up all

1540
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,440
the way till the end

1541
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,800
this is an annual plant at least the

1542
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,480
medicinal plants that most of people are

1543
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,079
growing that are listening this podcast

1544
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,318
is an annual plant and there's going to

1545
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,920
be a natural senescence that happens

1546
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:21,838
right so the the leaves are going to

1547
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,440
fade no matter if you feed all the way

1548
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:26,078
up until the end or not right now it

1549
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,838
could be it's genetic variability

1550
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,839
some will stay green for longer than

1551
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,920
others but eventually if you push that

1552
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:33,838
plant long enough it's gonna senescence

1553
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,760
the the leaves will fade and if they are

1554
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:37,838
green all the way to the end you're

1555
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,440
probably over fertilizing

1556
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:40,719
as a side note i can usually tell

1557
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,159
cornfield of course you guys tell in the

1558
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:44,000
end if you're driving down to the area

1559
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:46,399
see a corn field and right before they

1560
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,719
harvest if that plant is entirely green

1561
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,000
they over fertilize that bottom leaves

1562
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:51,358
as you're saying should be starting to

1563
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,119
senescer and starting to yellow should

1564
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:55,920
be starting to lose their vibrance of

1565
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,680
green because most growers i know aren't

1566
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,880
selling the leaves they're selling the

1567
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:00,480
other products and that's where you want

1568
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,160
those nutrients to ultimately go to and

1569
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,318
a little senescence at the end is

1570
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:06,960
assigned you with the nutrients just

1571
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:09,039
right so after you harvest the plant

1572
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,720
next up is the drying process which i

1573
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:12,480
want to get into can you talk to us

1574
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:15,118
about some of the best practices for the

1575
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,480
drying process so first off it's really

1576
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,240
after you harvest you're kind of looking

1577
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,480
at those environmental conditions you're

1578
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:21,279
putting that final product in

1579
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,480
and

1580
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:26,480
in general 60 humidity 60 degrees

1581
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,880
fahrenheit that's kind of like the

1582
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,280
target um temperature and humidity to go

1583
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,720
for but there are other factors uh to

1584
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,480
consider air circulation um is one

1585
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:39,118
maintaining good air circulation in any

1586
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,679
you know dry cure room is definitely um

1587
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:44,000
important um you know mixing the air

1588
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,598
vertically as well as horizontally and

1589
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,280
that doesn't mean a fan blowing right on

1590
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:50,559
all the leaves you know for 100 of the

1591
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,240
time just moving that air just be

1592
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:54,880
mindful of the environment you walk in

1593
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:57,279
there a little breeze is okay to feel um

1594
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,240
you know not like speed drying but just

1595
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,559
movement

1596
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:02,239
of air and that's really important

1597
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:04,079
through the whole process but especially

1598
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:06,159
early on when plants are gonna wick a

1599
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,400
lot of moisture early on you want to be

1600
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:10,399
mindful of ensuring that you have

1601
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,599
control over that when you're getting

1602
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,119
that moisture in there that's also

1603
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,599
potentially going to impact your

1604
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,960
temperature or your means of controlling

1605
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,519
temperature i guess i should say and the

1606
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,720
general range is you know 60 to 70

1607
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:22,559
degrees we definitely want to be going

1608
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:23,679
much over 70 as we said those terpenes

1609
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,040
you don't want to break them down in the

1610
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:27,199
drying process

1611
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:29,759
um some groceries low as 58 to 62

1612
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,598
fahrenheit fahrenheit being ideal uh you

1613
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,400
know that i just said to make it easy 60

1614
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:36,240
60 60 humidity 60 degrees fahrenheit

1615
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,000
good target but if your plus or minus a

1616
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,959
couple degrees don't automatically freak

1617
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,159
out that general range is a key for

1618
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,760
temperature

1619
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:46,399
humidity some growers you know target a

1620
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:49,520
little lower that 55 to 65 is again that

1621
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,639
general range there

1622
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:51,838
and it's important to maintain that

1623
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,039
particularly early on when plants are

1624
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:54,239
going to be wicking a lot of that

1625
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:56,400
moisture

1626
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,479
in humidity that is humidity but we're

1627
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,639
talking here about that end process

1628
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,318
if you're early on on the clone or

1629
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:05,838
seedling you know you're looking at

1630
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:08,960
humidity levels 80 90 100

1631
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:10,558
um so this is not a moisture content or

1632
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,720
midi level you want to maintain

1633
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,480
throughout the entire grow cycle of the

1634
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:16,318
plant we're specifically talking that

1635
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,920
end part because growers are here oh

1636
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:20,798
yeah i'm only concerned about the end

1637
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,400
product if that 60 to 60 is my target i

1638
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:24,559
want that plant to be a peak performance

1639
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,760
of 60 the entire time and that is not

1640
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:27,359
the case

1641
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,880
you want to reduce that humidity ideally

1642
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:30,318
as the plant grows

1643
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,079
because there are advantages to having

1644
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:34,719
some moisture

1645
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:37,440
in the air earlier um in the in the

1646
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:39,439
plant cycle there so um lighting is

1647
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,599
another important consideration

1648
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,679
it should be dried in a dark environment

1649
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,480
but this doesn't mean like absolutely no

1650
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:46,159
light

1651
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,159
ideally yes no light but if you have to

1652
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:49,598
go into the room or do something you

1653
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:51,440
don't need like a little candle light to

1654
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:54,640
be kind of like going through the room

1655
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,159
you can turn a light on i would um not

1656
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:58,000
recommend any of your grow lights you

1657
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:00,159
know you want super bright lights uh but

1658
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,318
your regular you know shop lights are

1659
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:04,318
perfectly fine you don't have to stumble

1660
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:06,960
through the dark um to go get whatever

1661
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:09,838
you need just try to keep it as minimal

1662
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:13,280
as possible in intensity and as minimal

1663
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,719
as possible in duration um as well

1664
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,880
and with all these conditions that i've

1665
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:18,798
talked about here you know the even air

1666
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,200
circulation the 60 degrees fahrenheit

1667
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:23,280
temperature the moisture content around

1668
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:25,439
60 percent the minimum light you want to

1669
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,040
keep those consistent through the entire

1670
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,318
dry process and cure process you're

1671
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,358
looking at one or two weeks for this

1672
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:32,000
process

1673
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:33,440
and a lot of times a grower's

1674
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,358
environmental control systems will

1675
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,720
struggle early on as i mentioned they

1676
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:38,480
first cut everything they throw it all

1677
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,399
in the room and they can't control

1678
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,798
humidity because there's just so much

1679
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,559
initial moisture released so you

1680
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:46,798
definitely want to be making sure that

1681
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,839
you're over sizing your equipment you're

1682
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:51,599
checking your equipment if you have a

1683
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:53,279
dehumidifier you are emptying that

1684
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,200
because usually when they fill up with

1685
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,359
with water they'll automatically shut

1686
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:59,279
down if you're an area that's really dry

1687
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:02,078
you might be adding humidity that's

1688
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,798
always the fun part of seeing growers be

1689
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,559
experts in one area and then get hired

1690
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:10,159
by a firm somewhere else in a different

1691
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:11,599
geographic area and really struggling

1692
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:13,039
sadly that was the case from some

1693
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,160
growers that came from a very dry

1694
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:15,039
environment

1695
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:17,039
to

1696
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:18,000
the northeast in particular where

1697
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:19,599
there's a lot of humidity in the

1698
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,599
northeast and there's not a lot in kind

1699
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,359
of the rocky mountain region

1700
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,318
and those growers that were experts

1701
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:26,480
where they were growing and that's why

1702
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:29,199
they were hired really looked like

1703
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,880
newbies because of the change or shift

1704
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:33,358
in that environment so

1705
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,880
knowing do you need to do humidifier or

1706
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:37,119
do you need a humidifier i don't care

1707
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,880
what you need sometimes you need both

1708
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,760
maintain that sixty percent that's

1709
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,240
really the cure that's really the focus

1710
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,240
of that dry and cure um temperature

1711
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:47,759
temperature and humidity to focus on

1712
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:49,439
whether you need to add or subtract

1713
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,520
that's based on your

1714
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,280
environment so why do you maintain this

1715
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,199
well as we talked about earlier we're

1716
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,319
trying to maintain all that work we did

1717
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,318
for those cannabinoids and those

1718
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:00,960
terpenes really trying to maintain those

1719
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:02,798
at the highest level within the plant if

1720
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,679
you dry them improperly and cure them in

1721
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:07,519
properly you're further breaking down

1722
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:09,598
those components that you put all that

1723
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:11,119
effort into and if you're adding high

1724
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,640
heat well you're destroying them there

1725
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:15,519
as well so you're trying to just

1726
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:17,039
maximize every portion of the process

1727
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,039
starting with the plant to maximize the

1728
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:20,400
production once you cut that off the

1729
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:21,838
plant there's your hundred percent you

1730
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,639
can only go down from there and your

1731
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:25,199
goal

1732
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:27,679
as a professional grower drying and

1733
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:30,558
curing is really to reduce the amount of

1734
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:32,078
percentage that you might be losing on

1735
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:33,839
there and then as always you should be

1736
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,039
sending a sample out to get tested so

1737
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:36,480
you have something to show potential

1738
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,558
consumers there

1739
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,639
um and that's really a great way to kind

1740
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,920
of you know prove what's in what the

1741
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:44,400
plant actually took up and good for the

1742
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,240
grower to know hey what what is what

1743
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,160
kind of cultivar what you know what was

1744
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:50,318
this kind of producing as far as

1745
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:52,000
european profile good for you to know

1746
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:52,960
good for potential consumers to know as

1747
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,798
well

1748
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,559
now after the drying process comes

1749
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:58,880
curing can you talk to us about some of

1750
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:00,640
the best practices there so there's you

1751
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,039
know there's no again no one you know

1752
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,879
kind of proper uh method uh a lot of the

1753
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:07,358
environmental controls that kind of end

1754
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,200
process will be very similar a lot of

1755
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:11,519
people grow for that you know 62

1756
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:13,439
humidity is kind of like the ideal

1757
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,599
um most growers growing in some form of

1758
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:19,039
i'll call a sealed container

1759
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,798
type for um in that final curing process

1760
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:22,159
and when you hear container a lot of

1761
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:24,400
growers are thinking well i want to get

1762
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:26,639
you know big five gallon pail

1763
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,960
bigger is not always better in this case

1764
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,798
as well um depending on you know if

1765
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,960
you're large scale sure 5 gallon

1766
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:35,358
containers would be fine but really

1767
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,519
those smaller more controlled

1768
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:38,400
environments might be a little bit

1769
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:40,159
better

1770
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,680
the chosen container you know just as

1771
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:43,920
you know the gold standard looking at

1772
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:46,078
usually wide mouth mason jars

1773
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,519
usually about 32 ounce jar that's kind

1774
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,880
of the standard because you're not

1775
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,358
packing the jar of course you want to

1776
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,599
leave about 25 about a quarter percent

1777
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:55,279
air space allow that breathing process

1778
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,960
to occur you want to like pack

1779
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,160
everything in there i always stress the

1780
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,760
wide mouth you can get away with the

1781
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:01,358
smaller but just easier to kind of like

1782
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,440
when you put your hand in there that

1783
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:04,480
wide mouth does just make it so much

1784
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,400
easier

1785
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,318
um and the reason why you leave that air

1786
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,599
space is you can kind of like move

1787
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:12,079
things around that doesn't mean you kind

1788
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,359
of go up to it and like like they

1789
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,798
say like the powerball you're kind of

1790
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:16,558
like shaking everything up and bouncing

1791
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:18,559
everything around like crazy but just

1792
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,160
you know you want the um and product

1793
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,920
developing those flat spots you kind of

1794
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:23,118
want to keep that area appearance you

1795
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,798
don't want to get two things close

1796
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:27,680
together because what that's going to do

1797
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:29,280
is trap potential humidity in there

1798
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,279
so you just move them around a little

1799
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:34,400
bit now that curing process i mentioned

1800
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,000
before dark place is uh important now

1801
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,400
what a lot of growers take this to mean

1802
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,079
is that i need a light block container

1803
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,920
if you have an option for that

1804
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,160
all the better but by simply putting

1805
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,480
them in a dark room with minimal amount

1806
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:48,480
of lights that accomplishes the exact

1807
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,798
same thing and still allows you to go

1808
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,280
through and inspect the final product

1809
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:54,480
now and that inspection is important you

1810
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,960
don't want to set it and forget it like

1811
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,039
oh it was 62 i sealed them up i put them

1812
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,960
in the room and

1813
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,880
see in two months you do want to kind of

1814
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,400
just be checking that make sure the room

1815
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,798
is maintaining the conditions make sure

1816
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,960
there is no mold developing uh make sure

1817
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:10,960
there is kind of nothing is quote

1818
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,880
changing you're kind of checking that um

1819
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,400
so you have that kind of routine just to

1820
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,079
check on things

1821
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,358
a lot of growers to it industry process

1822
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,440
particularly early on we'll call what's

1823
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:21,358
called burping the containers

1824
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,519
is basically like opening the lid

1825
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:25,358
cracking the lid just kind of like just

1826
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:27,280
allow any build up of anything to kind

1827
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:29,440
of be released there allow some moisture

1828
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:32,319
potentially to escape allow oxygen to

1829
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,760
kind of replenish in on there any follow

1830
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:35,519
odors that you're noticing during this

1831
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,200
stage as a sign mold might be developing

1832
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:40,000
even if you don't see it you might want

1833
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:41,679
to put those in a separate um location

1834
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,599
there and this burping will be done more

1835
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:46,480
frequently early on as those plants kind

1836
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:48,960
of settle in it'll be done less and less

1837
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,798
and less frequently um to maintain that

1838
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,960
humidity a lot of people are throwing uh

1839
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:56,880
humidity control packs in there again

1840
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:59,280
that target 60 to 65 percent is really

1841
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,680
that that target that first week some

1842
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,680
people might burp you know twice daily

1843
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:06,239
um weeks two to three and beyond you're

1844
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:08,879
kind of cutting down to once a week

1845
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:10,318
every or every other day to every third

1846
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,640
day to once a week

1847
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:14,880
kind of so on and so forth there and a

1848
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:17,118
bit of tell based on the aromas end of

1849
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,798
curing two to three weeks

1850
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,240
really don't go much beyond uh eight

1851
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:21,838
weeks if you're still curing after eight

1852
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:23,279
weeks you're doing something wrong

1853
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:26,558
after that step you're kind of at the

1854
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,839
final uh storage if you will of that end

1855
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,440
product there

1856
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:31,838
very detailed answer i think a lot of

1857
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,599
your answers here were very detailed and

1858
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:35,279
uh straight to the point and like i

1859
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,960
mentioned the beginning of the episode

1860
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,519
that's what uh i think a lot of people

1861
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,039
like about your style of teaching there

1862
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,639
just sinked into the point you can say

1863
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:45,119
it in three words satan three don't give

1864
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:46,879
me 30. right

1865
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,400
so wrapping things up how can the

1866
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,798
listeners find you and what do you have

1867
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:53,680
upcoming in the future so i would say uh

1868
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:56,400
debaco university on youtube would be a

1869
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:58,399
great way um to review some of this

1870
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,960
content search the channel

1871
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:04,559
i do have different um you know

1872
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:06,639
playlists there so uh i will say that i

1873
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,839
also teach a forensic science course so

1874
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:09,759
if you're watching some of my videos and

1875
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:11,358
all of a sudden five stages of body

1876
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,880
decay come up which is i don't know why

1877
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:14,639
it gets frequently recommended that is

1878
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,400
okay that is one of my videos

1879
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:18,078
it's of interest to you watch it great

1880
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,480
but people wonder like how do we go from

1881
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:22,559
plants to this uh it is also on the

1882
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,318
channel there uh encourage if you like

1883
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,798
it you know try to um you can send

1884
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:29,440
comments in i try to respond

1885
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:31,038
to every comment that i can there's over

1886
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,798
a thousand videos on the channel so i'm

1887
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:34,960
sure you'll find something of interest

1888
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:37,440
to you encourage others to subscribe

1889
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:39,519
i've been very fortunate with a great

1890
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,679
community here sharing out the channel

1891
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:43,599
so if you know a new grower struggling

1892
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:45,759
to tell about the channel reach out to

1893
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:48,400
it you know help them out i try to touch

1894
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,280
on everything from basics of growing to

1895
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,280
some more advanced level um items so

1896
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,839
new growers old growers everyone can

1897
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,000
hopefully learn something i've got a

1898
01:04:55,838 --> 01:05:00,078
couple more kind of videos

1899
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,480
planned i've been updating recently

1900
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:05,200
because i do teach at the university of

1901
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:08,000
connecticut running a a course two

1902
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:10,960
courses there new york botanical gardens

1903
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,159
as well as florida gulf coast university

1904
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,280
so you're talking about different

1905
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:16,399
environments growing different

1906
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:18,000
environments those are one gets snow and

1907
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,838
one's uh concerned that there's a

1908
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,519
crocodile that's going to eat the you

1909
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:23,838
know the birds outside their bird

1910
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:25,759
feeders so it's a great little contrast

1911
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:27,679
there on the eastern seaboard there the

1912
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:30,000
united states so

1913
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:31,919
other ways you can more professionally

1914
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,239
you know potentially take one of my

1915
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,680
courses going forward but if not

1916
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:36,798
hopefully enjoy what you find on the

1917
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:38,639
channel

1918
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:40,480
like subscribe or at least subscribe and

1919
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:42,318

1920
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,679
channel it's much appreciated i'll

and then if you're listening on one of

1924
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,559
the podcast platforms just search for

for me we definitely dipped our toes

1937
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:14,159
into some of the science behind the

1938
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,838
plant which is always good it's always

1939
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:17,759
i'm always learning when it comes to

1940
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:19,279
that and i know my audience is right

science with some interested people
