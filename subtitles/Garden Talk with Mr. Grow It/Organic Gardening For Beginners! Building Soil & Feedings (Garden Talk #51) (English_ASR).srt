1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,120
coming up on garden talk benefit of peat

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,119
moss is it's very acidic and to that

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,280
acidity we can load it with calcium

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,519
that's alkaline and that brings us to

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,199
the ph that we desire and that also

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,359
creates a situation where the plant has

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,118
access to a lot of calcium if you're

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,879
intelligent and building infrastructure

9
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,359
and assets that allow you to manage your

10
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,799
farm without buying it again every year

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,359
you can start to create profit margin

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,880
for yourself i do not want to to put it

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,199
lightly that if you're making soil and

14
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,038
you're counting on it the local compost

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,800
could be the thing that that bites you

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,600
so make sure that's good but what we

17
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,199
found

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,600
is that doubling your container size

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,960
usually increased your yield by about 60

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,200
for a living soil it was better to use

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,200
pumice and rice holes and that became

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,559
one of the standards for the base

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,719
even if you don't stop what you're doing

24
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,039
add one new thing and make some soil

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,558
from scratch get your own hands in there

26
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,719
i think you'll never go back if you try

27
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:52,718
it

28
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,840

101
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,239
everything works and when i said um

102
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
hello to you guys i should say hello to

103
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,640
you but i was also saying hello to

104
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,559
everyone and i appreciate them asking

105
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,039
for us to interact because

106
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,719
um unbeknownst to you dean who does our

107
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,400
video editing had pointed you out

108
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,560
immediately when we started youtube and

109
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,319
said this guy is professional he's

110
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,400
helping people and he's got a good

111
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,919
platform and

112
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,080
then to have you reach out i thought wow

113
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,158
how cool is that full circle

114
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,519
and um because of that respect it was

115
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,798
just a no-brainer for me to come on i

116
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,599
didn't feel like you were going to be

117
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,120
some

118
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,280
weird show that i hadn't heard of that

119
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,360
was uh not going to be good for business

120
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,680
or something and i also saw a big

121
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,760
opportunity you talk to a lot of people

122
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,840
that maybe you haven't heard from us yet

123
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,679
and so i look at as a big opportunity to

124
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,120
maybe share more of the message if that

125
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,280
makes sense

126
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,719
absolutely for sure i think one area

127
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,399
where you're clearly known for is

128
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,839
organic gardening and i really want this

129
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,599
episode to be i thought it'd be most

130
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,358
appropriate to have it getting into

131
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,120
organic gardening right so more

132
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,519
specifically i like to cover the

133
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,040
foundation building soil and i also want

134
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,639
to get into the organic feedings

135
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
throughout the plant's life but before

136
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,280
we get into all that things i like to do

137
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,560
with every guest is introduction so can

138
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,399
you tell us a little bit about yourself

139
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,360
and kind of how you got into gardening

140
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,519
yeah sure

141
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,040
my name is jeremy silva and i started

142
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,560
build a soil

143
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,919
almost 10 years ago it feels like more

144
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,399
than 10 years but it's kind of like

145
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,758
where's the day where it became official

146
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,638
and

147
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,000
i came into gardening

148
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,439
maybe differently than a lot of people

149
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,360
but i'm finding it's more of a normal

150
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,199
story i grew up in a cul-de-sac i grew

151
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,360
up where this was not normal

152
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,800
and so for me when i finally

153
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,120
saw it like my grandma had a vegetable

154
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,400
garden i was young so i didn't didn't

155
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,720
mean that much but when i moved to

156
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,839
colorado in 2009

157
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,360
it became something that i was

158
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,279
fascinated by and the fact that you

159
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,439
could just take a potato

160
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,038
dig a hole i mean

161
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,399
arguably you don't need to dig a hole

162
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,399
now that i've learned about no-till

163
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,719
gardening ruth stout she would just put

164
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,319
in the mulch but you could put one

165
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,000
potato and come back months later and

166
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,918
have a dozen potatoes and it's like

167
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,720
nature's 3d printing it's so abundant

168
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,198
and

169
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,840
i was also at that time um wanting to be

170
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,360
more positive wanted to create

171
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,119
a lack

172
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,280
maybe more stability by knowing hey at

173
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,840
least i can grow my own food

174
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,758
and i was also growing medicinal plants

175
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,159
and so it seemed like all of that came

176
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,680
together as sort of a gateway to turn me

177
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,600
into somebody who cared about gardening

178
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,759
and i never thought that i'd be like

179
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,160
yeah gardening

180
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,400
but it's been huge in my life and it's

181
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,400
taught me a ton besides

182
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,758
uh just about the result but there's a

183
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,000
lot that's affected me as far as the

184
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,840
process and the discipline and so

185
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,038
because of that

186
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,879
over a decade ago i was in a place where

187
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,318
i was looking for where my life was

188
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,719
headed i had a lot of changes that

189
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,720
happened when i moved to colorado

190
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,800
and i was working somewhere that i

191
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,319
wasn't really excited about and my

192
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
american dream was to have some small

193
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,199
internet business

194
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,720
that would allow me the freedom to

195
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,720
garden more and go disc golf and

196
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,680
snowboard and kind of live the life that

197
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,680
i've dreamed about and i had no family

198
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,600
at the time and so it wasn't a huge risk

199
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,918
but it was still really scary i went

200
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,960
into my job on a saturday with almost no

201
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,758
reason i'd thought about it and i quit

202
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,038
and i figured if i didn't do it i was

203
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,479
too comfortable i was going to wake up

204
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,399
it was going to be 40 years from now and

205
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,758
i'll be doing the same thing

206
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,478
and

207
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,919
it was hard but i made the decision

208
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:49,359
and everything worked out i had like a

209
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:50,719
propane tank that was hard to buy one

210
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,560
time a few things that happened in

211
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,960
between as part of the story but

212
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,038
eventually um i placed a few ads on

213
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,038
craigslist and people started buying

214
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,959
worm castings and then i was always

215
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,478
answering questions on the forums and

216
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,680
all of a sudden it turned a corner where

217
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,000
we had more orders than i could deal

218
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,439
with i had to start hiring employees

219
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,959
and it went from this little idea that

220
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,240
might pay for a couple bills to a huge

221
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,918
opportunity that

222
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,759
consumed a lot of my time and i had to

223
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:14,399
decide is this really what i want to do

224
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,759
and

225
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,598
it's been the best decision i've ever

226
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,720
made build a soil now has about 40

227
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,319
employees

228
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,319
and we have a vegetable farm and we

229
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,000
distribute to multiple countries as well

230
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,598
as all over the united states

231
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,680
and none of it would have been possible

232
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,279
had i not just made that

233
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,720
you know five second decision to walk in

234
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,478
and quit and say this is what i'd rather

235
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,639
do with my life and so

236
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,318
um that's pretty much the the story in a

237
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,240
nutshell if that helps

238
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,840
yeah absolutely i'm a customer of build

239
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,918
a soil i actually did a whole bunch of

240
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,519
stuff like a good haul during black

241
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,240
friday you guys have a crazy black

242
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,839
friday sale every year so i actually did

243
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,439
a haul and then actually did an unboxing

244
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,878
video to show my audience kind of what i

245
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,879
got from you guys

246
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,800
and people seem to really like that one

247
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,039
i know you were blasting out content on

248
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,560
instagram for a long time finally made

249
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,240
the switch to youtube

250
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,720

252
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,960

253
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,240
have a 10 by 10 with all different quad

254
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,159
you know several different quadrants in

255
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,079
there different things going on you're

256
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,639
showing your audience how to grow

257
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,478
organically you know use your products

258
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,519
and do things in a sustainable way can

259
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:18,639
you talk to us just a little bit about

260
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,959
your youtube channel kind of what you

261
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,160
got going on there yeah definitely so

262
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,239
for those of you that don't know we have

263
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,479
a 10 by 10 grow tent and that came

264
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,720
serendipitously i had it at my house

265
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,719
i moved i no longer had space for it and

266
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,879
i decided well there's we're moving our

267
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,320
shipping area out of our retail store

268
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,320
and we're moving that into its own

269
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,919
building so i had the space in the tent

270
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,680
and i decided to throw it up

271
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,598
and man it was really nice to come into

272
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,718
work and have this oasis that i think

273
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,080
most people are looking for when they

274
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,160
set up a greenhouse they want to walk

275
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,639
into a jungle and have it be

276
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,719
um a little bit of peace in their life

277
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,799
and it was great and um we were already

278
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,800
documenting four by four grow tents and

279
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,039
the idea of sharing it in a walk-in

280
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,278
space became an idea and so we started

281
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,439
doing different methodologies we'd have

282
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,439
some customers that had raised beds we

283
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,519
had some customers that wanted to do

284
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,040
sub-irrigation or five-gallon containers

285
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,959
or small containers and we don't always

286
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,799
recommend it so the youtube channel

287
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,799
became a way for us to

288
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,639
prove it walk the walk show people that

289
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,159
these things actually work and for me

290
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,278
when i was learning that's all i paid

291
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,039
attention to there's a lot of

292
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,838
information a lot of people that want to

293
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,519
teach gardening that have never done it

294
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,440
but i've watched some videos and they

295
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,519
kind of teach what they feel should work

296
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,240
and that leads to a lot of problems so

297
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,839
it was unique i think to have a producer

298
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,919
that didn't sell just other people's

299
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,600
stuff and actually showed you how to use

300
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,599
it in a method where we could fail just

301
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,959
live in front of everybody usually you

302
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,240
see these girls start and then they just

303
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,119
don't update

304
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,799
right like ah it didn't go that well um

305
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,120
and that obviously put a ton of

306
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,479
responsibility on us to perform that's

307
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,759
what it should feel like like if you're

308
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,680
gardening for your family back in the

309
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,399
day and you didn't produce

310
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,639
that's a problem right and it doesn't

311
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,639
always go perfect so the 10 by 10 has

312
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,559
basically been just a display of that so

313
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,759
if you're interested check out the 10 by

314
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,599
10 we do

315
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,838
as you mentioned a different style in

316
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,560
each quadrant and we're about to start

317
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,760
the next 10 by 10 series um in the next

318
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:11,359
month we've got a little bit of

319
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,200
groundwork delay so

320
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,720
awesome i'll definitely have a link to

321
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,399
jeremy's youtube channel down in the

322
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,759
description section below and then if

323
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,440
you're on one of the podcast platforms

324
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,759
listening to this just search build a

325
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,920
soil on youtube and his channel will pop

326
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,200
up and you can check that out so we'll

327
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,120
do a lot more this year we've got the

328
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,879
vegetable farm where we've threatened to

329
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,799
document it and it's so much work we

330
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,399
don't usually take the time to but this

331
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,719
year we're going to be documenting a lot

332
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,600
of what we do on our vegetable farm

333
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,040
because

334
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,200
there's a lot of little tips and tricks

335
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,879
and we want to share it so i'm looking

336
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,000
forward to that this year i get advice

337
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,838
from you because i just started

338
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,120
vegetables well honestly just started

339
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
like three years ago you know what i

340
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,078
mean i got a little little something

341
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,480
going on you know with leafy greens and

342
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,239
stuff and yeah i i like to watch your

343
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,759
content there and get tips from you on

344
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,320
that so thanks for doing the vegetable

345
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,879
content you know yeah definitely

346
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,720
building soil let's get into it so

347
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,240
you're often recommending coot's mix you

348
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,240
know you give credit to him give credit

349
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,240
where credit is due he does the one to

350
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,759
one to one ratio so 33 3.33 percent

351
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:16,000
33.33 to 33.33 percent what do you say

352
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:18,879
33 33 33 moving forward but the first 33

353
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,519
is the base so sphagnum peat moss

354
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,600
coca-cola pit moss can you talk to us

355
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,600
about what those things are

356
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,519
pros and cons to them and which one you

357
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,200
generally recommend to use yeah

358
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,799
absolutely so

359
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,720
i've noticed there's a lot of confusion

360
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,719
with new gardeners about volumes they

361
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,120
get kind of straight like weird almost

362
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,160
like they're over thinking recipes so

363
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,399
the 33 33 33 the easiest way i think to

364
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,838
describe it is it's a three-part recipe

365
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,759
to make the base

366
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,200
one part of each ingredient that happens

367
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,879
to be 33

368
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,320
if you want to add another part you can

369
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,600
some people add some biochar or

370
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,680
something and they'll call it a

371
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,159
percentage but at the end of the day

372
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,159
where all these formulas came from were

373
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,679
based on what was available in size and

374
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,919
so if you're using peat moss we'd

375
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,239
usually go to the local supplier home

376
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,319
depot or something garden store they

377
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,720
have either a three cubic foot or more

378
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,560
commonly the 3.8 cubic foot of peat moss

379
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,560
and it's in a big bale and it's

380
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,119
compressed so you have to fluff it up

381
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,599
when the 3.8 was fluffed we found out by

382
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,600
just manually doing it by bucket most of

383
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,879
us found there's about six cubic feet of

384
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,639
material in there

385
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,519
and that's where we started the recipe

386
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,919
so one bale of canadian sphagnum peat

387
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,639
moss 3.8 cubic feet that would be

388
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,559
considered six cubic feet of peat moss

389
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,919
to that if that's one part we would then

390
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,159
add one

391
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,599
part of compost so six cubic feet of

392
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,439
compost

393
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,759
many people use worm castings and

394
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,720
compost but the base recipe is just at

395
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:47,600
least it has to be one part compost one

396
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,200
part peat and one part aeration

397
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,360
aeration

398
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,120
most people were familiar with perlite

399
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,440
it's the white little pebbles and all of

400
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,360
the miracle-gro soil in the fox farm

401
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,639
and on the on the forums what the guys

402
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,600
were doing that were making soil from

403
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,440
scratch

404
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,519
is they were trying to make a conscious

405
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,519
decision to be unique

406
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,959
choose a better ingredient if they could

407
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,959
and make it a more sustainable

408
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,239
ingredient if possible

409
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,559
and so people started questioning the

410
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,000
use of perlite we found out that

411
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,838
we can go deeper i could talk all day on

412
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,120
it but essentially instead of using that

413
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,360
for a living soil it was better to use

414
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,839
pumice and rice holes and that became

415
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,079
one of the standards for the base

416
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,839
so building your own recipe from scratch

417
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:29,039
one part peat moss

418
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,040
one part compost one part aeration a lot

419
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,958
of people use black lava rock red lava

420
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,639
rock there's pros and cons to all of

421
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,479
these and i'd be happy to go into a

422
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,320
little bit of detail there for you but

423
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,399
once you built the base

424
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
now the idea was how do we amend it how

425
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,839
do we add

426
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,000
minerals and nutrients that are going to

427
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,519
feed the soil and in consequence feed

428
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,600
the plant and how do we get it in some

429
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,839
sort of balance well before i took any

430
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,159
soil testing classes before i read any

431
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,160
books and before i understood

432
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,759
i would just blindly follow recipes i

433
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,600
found online and so how we found the

434
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,838
koots recipe was

435
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,519
a desire from the grow forms to document

436
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,199
side-by-sides which is still kind of

437
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,240
what build a soil does we just document

438
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,958
what we do

439
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,120
and i ran a recipe from afghanistan who

440
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,039
was in the farm at the time i ran

441
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,039
the true living organic style we ran the

442
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,958
sub cool style recipe

443
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,879
and then something was telling us to try

444
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,278
this coot's recipe because he was just

445
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,838
it was so simple right he only added

446
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,679
kelp neem crustacean and a mixture of

447
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,440
rock dust and calcium

448
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,759
every other recipe from the form was

449
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,680
like 30 ingredients you know guanos and

450
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,958
blood meals bone just everything in the

451
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,759
kitchen sink

452
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,439
and so i made the recipe and to honor it

453
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,360
i actually went up in the forest and got

454
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,040
some forest litter to make it really

455
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,560
alive and it was one of the best

456
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,319
experiences i'd ever had growing it was

457
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,958
the first time that every single plant

458
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,560
that i planted was all uniformly

459
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,159
healthy and it wasn't like one was

460
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,759
rented and stunted with

461
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,278
leaves that were you know curling and

462
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,958
twisted

463
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,159
and so that i think that connection

464
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,479
really brought us to want to share that

465
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,198
recipe with everybody and everybody who

466
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,000
uses it swears by it and i think all of

467
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,879
us eventually move on once we understand

468
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,159
to tinkering with what we want out of it

469
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,320
and i think that's what anybody should

470
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,559
do you get a recipe for the best meal

471
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,480
ever do exactly what the chef says and

472
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,799
then tinker it to your preferences

473
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,120
and the coots mix has been a really good

474
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,719
way to do that so

475
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,240
i noticed that you mentioned sphagnum

476
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,199
peat moss but you didn't really touch on

477
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,278
cocoa or pit moss is there something

478
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,599
like against it on a sustainable side of

479
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:32,000
things that you know prevents you from

480
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,040
from going towards cocoa or pitmas for

481
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,120
that base

482
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,719
um it's pure quality so every decision

483
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,720
we made at build a soil was to have the

484
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,959
best quality regardless now that we're

485
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,800
getting bigger as far as scale

486
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,278
we have multiple desires one is to have

487
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,958
a very sustainable recipe that is more

488
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,958
environmentally friendly and i'll

489
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,239
discuss the pros and cons of that

490
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,000
because we're a little hypocritical kind

491
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,639
of mixing soil bagging and shipping it

492
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,039
so sustainability is very important but

493
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,360
our goal when we started the recycled

494
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,838
logo as far as build a soil that's

495
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,959
because we all recycled soil we would

496
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,959
keep it

497
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,000
not necessarily that we were recycling

498
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,919
our ingredient to be the most

499
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,360
sustainable in the world but we all also

500
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,799
cared about

501
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,480
probably even more than the carbon

502
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,439
footprint the treatment ethically of the

503
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,399
animals

504
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,079
and not

505
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,799
giving our money to the monsanto

506
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,879
subsidiaries and so the desire to like

507
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,799
not use bone meal or not use a

508
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,120
particular ingredient oftentimes chem

509
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,039
came from who it was funding

510
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,879
and what those animals were fed like if

511
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:33,039
a cow is fed roundup sprayed crops

512
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,360
and then their waste is deemed approved

513
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,120
for organic use we said we don't want it

514
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,199
that's not good enough for us and so

515
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,198
when it came to peat moss we trusted

516
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,879
cute because he said that was the best

517
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,039
quality and when we did soil testing

518
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,439
eventually we found that when we made

519
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,519
the same recipe with coco coir it didn't

520
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,600
hold as much nutrients it's cation

521
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,159
exchange capacity its ability to

522
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,759
magnetically hold the nutrients was

523
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,360
lesser than

524
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,800
and that's a big benefit when it comes

525
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,000
to hydro because now you can flush it

526
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,159
out fairly easily and you can load it

527
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,400
back up with what it needs but in soil

528
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,078
that was one now arguably it's not

529
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,959
terribly different so you could still

530
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:12,000
make a great soil with coco coir but

531
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,199
coco core is mined on

532
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,279
it mind it is procured from islands and

533
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,679
other places far from here

534
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,838
and it is one of those crops that now

535
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
can be grown

536
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,678
non-organically

537
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,759
and those chemically grown coconuts can

538
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,160
be harvested and sold as organic cocoa

539
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,160
core because any waste from a farming

540
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,919
industry is deemed approved for organic

541
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,038
use so now you're questioning where

542
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,559
you're getting the cocoa core from and

543
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,759
depending on the continent or i'm sorry

544
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,079
depending on the location you get it

545
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,919
from it could be near the ocean and it

546
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,759
could be very salty

547
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,280
and in organics they don't buffer it

548
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,038
with the chemicals so a lot of the cocoa

549
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,918
core that you buy is already buffered

550
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:49,919
with

551
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,000
chilean nitrate or it's loaded with

552
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,000
different minerals to offset some of the

553
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,599
challenges that cocoa has and so an

554
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,359
organic soil company they can't just go

555
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,038
buy the pre-charged cocoa because it has

556
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,639
chemicals

557
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,240
and so then you have to use raw cocoa

558
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,400
and raw cocoa is a little bit more

559
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,960
neutral on the ph

560
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,200
and while ph isn't mentioned a lot when

561
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,200
we talk about organic growing it's

562
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,240
important it's just that the soil is

563
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,240
normally

564
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,319
the derivative of the ph not the water

565
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,000
so talking about it every day is not as

566
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,159
important right you can't change it like

567
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,839
you can change the hydro water that

568
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,320
dramatically changes the uptake of your

569
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,399
plant but cocoa core is a little more

570
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,798
neutral the benefit of

571
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,120
peat moss is it's very acidic

572
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,440
and to that acidity we can load it with

573
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,678
calcium that's alkaline and that brings

574
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,679
us to the ph that we desire

575
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,840
and that also creates a situation where

576
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,000
the plant has access to a lot of calcium

577
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,159
and it's now in the target ph where if

578
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,839
we're starting neutral already we have a

579
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,200
little bit less choices as far as how

580
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,798
many minerals we can load it with so

581
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,640
that was part of the concern

582
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,480
personally for me because i loved peat

583
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,320
moss made these recipes

584
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,880
the way we run build a soil is to teach

585
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,558
what we do and so for us to offer a coco

586
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,240
mix was disingenuous

587
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:01,678
and now we're only getting the point

588
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,359
where we've had a lot of customers

589
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,960
request it we have data on it we know

590
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,119
that it works we're considering

591
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,279
releasing a coco version we also have

592
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,199
some wood fibers in the past they were

593
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,200
very alkaline and they were more like a

594
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,400
money saver but there's a couple of

595
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,000
products in the market that are very

596
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,840
acidic made from wood and they're very

597
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,919
sustainable because they grow very young

598
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,918
trees and they harvest them into a wood

599
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,520
pulp that's more like peat moss but

600
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,919
those are robbed nitrogen so you can

601
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,440
only use a percentage so the most

602
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,600
straightforward for the home gardener is

603
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,320
to use peat moss and then what happens

604
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,759
is

605
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,200
occasionally they'll go in a gardening

606
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,879
form and they'll tell them peat moss is

607
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,080
ruining the world and so then they go oh

608
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,880
i don't want to do that i'd rather use

609
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,558
coco coir or whatever so now the burden

610
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,960
of knowledge is that cocoa is freighted

611
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,879
in using fossil fuel on big tankers that

612
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,798
are locked up because of trade war

613
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,919
issues and coming from other countries

614
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,400
and that's volatile and then when you

615
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,240
get it it may be salty maybe not maybe

616
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,720
there's some it's not as straightforward

617
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,880
where peat moss

618
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,720
overseas across the pond they burn it

619
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,960
for energy and they have very small

620
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,480
amounts of peat moss so using it is not

621
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,000
sustainable

622
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,919
where here in the united states we get

623
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,720
it from canada and the canadian peat

624
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,640
moss association has a very tight lock

625
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,000
to the point where i can only get so

626
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,759
much allocation of peat because they

627
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,359
only mine so much and it restricts what

628
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,599
we can produce last year we made about

629
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,839
10 000 cubic yards of soil and we're

630
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,119
slated to go to over 20 000 cubic yards

631
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,558
of soil this year

632
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,279
peat moss is going to be a real issue

633
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,279
for us as far as availability but as far

634
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,399
as hurting the earth that availability

635
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,839
is capped because the canadian

636
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,798
government won't let them mine it in a

637
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,399
non-sustainable fashion and so obviously

638
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,158
it's not the greatest to go dig up

639
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,840
portions of our earth but

640
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,440
the peat moss is arguably less of an

641
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,199
environmental impact than the cocoa core

642
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,880
depending on how you look at it

643
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,038
and either way none of them are

644
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,520
sustainable as making your own on-farm

645
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:48,960
product and so ways to do that that koot

646
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,038
talked about back in the day would be to

647
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,400
make your own leaf mold you rake the

648
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:53,919
leaves in your yard you put them in a

649
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,679
black trash bag and let them sit there

650
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,759
for a year and they turn into black leaf

651
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,480
mold compost which would be a good

652
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,640
suitable replacement for peat moss

653
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,400
and then the other alternative

654
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,759
would be to we've considered this to

655
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,679
build a soil we're still looking into

656
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,759
the numbers but setting up a worm farm

657
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,320
that only recycles cardboard and paper

658
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,960
and that way you have kind of a new a

659
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,798
lesser nutrition worm casting that could

660
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,640
act like a

661
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,480
peat moss if you will

662
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,159
but pmos is ancient

663
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,960
and it has a lot of benefits and it has

664
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,039
biology and it makes a very very good

665
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,720
soil so i hope that sharing this data

666
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,558
with you at least will let you know no

667
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,798
matter how you make potting soil kind of

668
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,240
a hypocrite as far as sustainability the

669
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:35,599
better answer is

670
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,599
we keep our soil we don't throw in the

671
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,439
trash so once you make this it could be

672
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,639
a lifetime that you're keeping the soil

673
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,600
that should ease in the burden a little

674
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,880
bit

675
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,399
the old way was just to literally throw

676
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,880
the soil away every single time and get

677
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,960
new soil and the whole idea was well

678
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,640
um we don't want to

679
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,240
make a mistake so just throw it away buy

680
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,679
new soil and as long as the profit was

681
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,679
there it didn't matter now we're all

682
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,759
wanting to make sure that we're

683
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,200
more sustainable but also

684
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,038
the profit margin is pretty tough in

685
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,080
farming so we can't just all afford to

686
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,960
throw everything away we've got to be

687
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:07,839
intelligent one of the ways that

688
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,840
organic farming can win is that it has

689
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:11,678
ways if you're intelligent and building

690
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,759
infrastructure and assets that allow you

691
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,600
to manage your farm without buying it

692
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,919
again every year you can start to create

693
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,918
profit margin for yourself

694
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,759
while improving the land so

695
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,759
we use peat moss

696
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,720
and there's also pit moss which you

697
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,319
mentioned

698
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,000
we just found that it doesn't produce as

699
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,519
quality of the soil i really like the

700
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,440
idea of using it it's lightweight for

701
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,119
like hanging flower baskets there's huge

702
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,038
benefits to using it but it essentially

703
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,798
looks like it looks like

704
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,240
you took shredded newspaper or shredded

705
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:39,519
paper from your literally from your

706
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,960
paper shredder

707
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:42,798
because of that it's off-putting like

708
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,640
there's ink on it you can see

709
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,798
and i'm sure it's soy-based ink so it's

710
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,200
not bad for potting soil but

711
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:52,000
it doesn't scream the highest top shelf

712
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,919
quality it streams recycled and so we're

713
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,159
wanting to work more with pet moss but

714
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,080
the blends that we've made rob so much

715
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,760
nitrogen that now we need to offset that

716
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,000
and it's not quite as sustainable in

717
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,798
that regard

718
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,159
but

719
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,279
the future is that build as well is

720
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,600
going to be putting a lot of research

721
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,359
into the wood pulp the cocoa core

722
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,959
and the pit moss to find recipes that we

723
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,798
can use different percentages of these

724
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,558
not to be so dependent on peat moss so

725
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,558
hope that answers your question

726
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,359
lots of good information there for sure

727
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:23,440
so your first 33 base next 33 you

728
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,439
mentioned compost or some people use

729
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,679
worm castings now there are several

730
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,919
different types of of compost right

731
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,320
which one do you generally recommend and

732
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,400
are there any that should be avoided

733
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,879
yeah this is a difficult question

734
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,720
and this is what's kept organics

735
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,559
out of the mainstream for a long time

736
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,159
what i mean by that is if you're in

737
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,918
california and you're on the grow forum

738
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,919
and you're talking to a guy in florida

739
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,960
you can tell him use this nutrient use

740
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,840
ro water ph it and use this cocoa core

741
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,240
or this rock wool or this bucket of deep

742
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,480
water culture and they can produce

743
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,759
ideally basically exactly the same as

744
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,960
what you're producing

745
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:00,400
and then you can have an intelligent

746
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,000
conversation back and forth about the

747
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,200
differences

748
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,880
the environment might be slightly

749
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,038
different but you can game that right

750
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,640
acs and humidifiers and everything so

751
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,879
now we literally created the duplicated

752
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,240
to grow environment in organics as best

753
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,840
as we could do is say we'll find some

754
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,679
local compost

755
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:16,879
now the guy in california in florida are

756
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,159
having night and day different

757
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,600
conversations and they're trying to help

758
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,559
each other out and have no idea how to

759
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,480
do it

760
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,000
so compost quality is of paramount

761
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,839
importance and that's what kept a lot of

762
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,519
people away from making their own soil

763
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,798
they would go find some compost on

764
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:30,158
craigslist they'd make a potting soil

765
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:31,599
follow the coots recipe and all their

766
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,400
plants would die

767
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:36,319
so there's a few things to consider one

768
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,960
you can find local compost and a great

769
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,879
way to test it is put a plant into it

770
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,038
you can mix it down in your soil recipe

771
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,159
at a 33 recipe

772
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:45,599
you could go a little lower and you

773
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,360
could put three or four containers one

774
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,719
with ten percent one of thirty percent

775
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,759
one with twenty percent just see how

776
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,120
they do

777
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,599
um within a week you're going to know a

778
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,639
lot more than had you not done that

779
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,240
however

780
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,600
a lot of times if you find a big compost

781
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,038
yard they should have a lab test on it

782
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,038
they can share it with you

783
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,558
what i've found is most these yards do

784
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,319
not know what their own compost test

785
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:06,158
means and so they share it with you and

786
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,759
they just hope you don't either and then

787
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,039
everybody goes well it's tested i should

788
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,319
use it and then they buy it and it

789
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:11,679
doesn't work and they go oh no i bought

790
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,599
it was tested

791
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,600
we'll test it for what it's typically

792
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,278
like the local compost for instance

793
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,639
there's so much compost around me i

794
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:20,240
would love to use it all because then i

795
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,360
wouldn't be paying freight on better

796
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,359
compost

797
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,079
but when you get it tested lab it has

798
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:28,000
potassium that is maybe 10 times the

799
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,678
phosphorous level and sodium that

800
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,519
matches it so

801
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,720
it's alkaline and it's full of stuff

802
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,879
that we're trying to keep out of our

803
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,400
soil recipe so if you use any more than

804
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,120
five or ten percent

805
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,480
like the 33 we're suggesting it'll just

806
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:41,678
fry your plants

807
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,759
that's what unfortunately a lot of

808
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,038
municipal compost is so if you're

809
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:46,960
fortunate enough where you have a

810
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,640
gardening club locally or you have

811
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,079
people that are active like michigan

812
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,480
california there's a lot of states that

813
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,720
do have some premium inputs you're gonna

814
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,880
have to go by word of mouth like who's

815
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,960
got the best compost that everybody

816
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,400
knows about is the goods then from there

817
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,759
you can probably trust it a lot better

818
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,278
and that's how gardening's always been

819
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:04,558
done you trust the recommendations

820
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,159
you're given you find the guys got the

821
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:07,200
good plants the good nursery the good

822
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,400
soil

823
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,200
what build a soil did to build a

824
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,880
business is used testing and data to

825
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,440
take some of that guessing out so we

826
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,039
have to trust we can verify

827
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,720
and so i would recommend you learn a

828
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,038
little bit about that you can always do

829
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,400
a test on your compost um if you're

830
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,158
commercial and you're looking to buy

831
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,400
compost i would test it before i buy it

832
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,760
if you're just a home gardener you can

833
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,679
read the test that they have and maybe

834
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,599
understand it better and we could do a

835
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,440
whole episode just on that

836
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,079
but one of the things you can do is

837
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,880
typically worm castings is a safer bet

838
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,879
worm casting will reduce the problems

839
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,960
and what i mean by that is if it's

840
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,360
locally made compost from people just

841
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,200
dumping green waste and they compost it

842
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,918
it could have some residual herbicides

843
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,919
in it and the compost may be too young

844
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,000
it could have dewormer from manures

845
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,440
where once the worms have worked it even

846
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
if that was originally in there it's

847
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,320
usually ripped to treads

848
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,240
and the biology and enzymes

849
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,399
make it safer it's one of the magic of

850
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,159
the worm so i find a lot of people use

851
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,919
worm castings in their recipes because

852
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,720
it seems to be less

853
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,480
wild as far as quality and then here's

854
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,319
the other weird thing that happens when

855
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,360
you go to a large-scale worm casting

856
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:19,200
producer they typically make a

857
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,278
casting that is not

858
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,278
it's not very rich in material and

859
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:24,880
nutrient it's so quickly made

860
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,038
which means that it's unlikely to cause

861
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,760
a problem in your soil recipe so worm

862
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,440
castings often is the default

863
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,759
for a long time people would just guess

864
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,399
and do 50 50. so for their one part

865
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,079
33.33 of compost

866
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:40,239
they would go half compost half worm

867
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,519
castings and they'd make their recipe

868
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,359
all i'm going to leave you with is that

869
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,720
if you're going to get compost and

870
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,479
you've never heard of the brand before

871
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,240
like we recommend malibu and ollie

872
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,200
mountain not because they're the best in

873
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,278
the world but because they've been

874
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,759
proven to be standardized so you can

875
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:54,720
make a recipe at known percentages and

876
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,200
it will

877
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,120
duplicate what we're experiencing

878
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,519
and that works really really well but if

879
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,599
you don't have access to that

880
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,200
when i was on the forums historically

881
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,439
coast of maine was a great brand on the

882
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,679
east coast malibu and oldie mountain was

883
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,960
good on the on the west coast and if you

884
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,440
couldn't find those what you would do is

885
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,640
just reach out online and go through

886
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,640
what i mentioned

887
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,799
just growing a plant in it i mean if you

888
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,480
put a tomato plant straight compost then

889
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,480
it grows you're probably fine

890
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,720
if you dilute it percentages and it does

891
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,000
well maybe you found something great

892
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,240
so i guess what i'm trying to say is you

893
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,599
don't always need a lab i don't want to

894
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,480
paint this picture that you have to be a

895
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:34,319
scientist to grow organically but i do

896
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,759
not want to to put it lightly that if

897
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,558
you're making soil and you're counting

898
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:38,240
on it

899
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,000
the local compost could be the thing

900
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,278
that that bites you so make sure that's

901
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,398
good

902
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,839
okay and then the last 33 is aeration

903
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,000
and there are several options for that

904
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,959
you already talked about some perlite

905
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,319
rice holes lava rock pumice biochar

906
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,079
right can you talk to us get a little

907
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,759
bit more details in regards to some of

908
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:57,599
those things kind of you know their

909
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,759
benefits if anything should be avoided

910
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,199
or be aware of yeah let's talk about it

911
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:02,720
so aeration

912
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,080
originally what we did on the forums is

913
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,759
we would look for something more natural

914
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,398
than perlite the reason was we found

915
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,240
that perlite was obsidian which is not

916
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:11,599
an unlimited source it's like a black

917
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,200
beautiful rock

918
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,879
and they mine it and then what they do

919
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,240
is they run it through a factory with a

920
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,480
lot of energy

921
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,919
and that puffs it like popcorn and so it

922
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,399
expands and that's what you see is the

923
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,240
white very lightweight material now if

924
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:26,079
you understand that most the products we

925
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,599
buy on the shelves are are basically

926
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,678
we're paying for the freight

927
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,959
like if you go to a grocery store most

928
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,320
of the cost of that didn't go to the

929
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,759
farmer it went in the freight getting it

930
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,918
there and then we try and put as much on

931
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,278
one truck as possible so freight

932
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,600
ends up being the biggest portion of

933
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,759
what we pay as far as a hidden tax and

934
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,079
when it comes to soil it is a lost

935
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,519
leader at a lot of hydro stores and it's

936
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,278
heavy and it's hard to get it there they

937
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,079
have to buy a whole pallet at a time to

938
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,519
justify the freight so perlite is like a

939
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,278
game changer when they started adding

940
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,519
perlite not only is it really fluffy for

941
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,359
the cells starting off thousands of

942
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,558
seeds in the in these commercial

943
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,079
greenhouses

944
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,319
and light weight to send all the starts

945
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,918
to home depot for everybody's garden but

946
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:05,359
it's also a whole bag of soil is pretty

947
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,880
light you can sell two three cubic foot

948
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,798
in one bag throw it over your shoulder

949
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,720
because it's peat moss and it's perlite

950
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:12,720
well the idea in living soil was we

951
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,480
wanted to keep the soil forever

952
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,240
so that's why we started using larger

953
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,240
volumes but we also looked at the

954
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,000
aeration and when you keep soil around

955
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,599
forever the perlite starts to break down

956
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,359
right away the powder and it starts to

957
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:24,719
float up to the top of your recipe when

958
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,918
you're watering

959
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,600
and it doesn't lend itself to keeping

960
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,440
without impaction over a long period of

961
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,398
time so we were wishing to get away from

962
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,200
that

963
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,038
for a number of reasons not sustainable

964
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,240
not really a real mineral like it was

965
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:39,839
puffed up

966
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,599
even though arguably it holds a lot of

967
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,720
air like it has some huge benefits to

968
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,240
soil

969
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,480
but what started to come out in the

970
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,480
forums was lava rock is very porous it's

971
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,319
a microbial condo it's made from the

972
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,480
minerals and where are good where's good

973
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,240
food made in the world hawaii pacific

974
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,960
northwest anywhere where volcanic

975
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,359
activity created really abundantly

976
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,798
mineral rich soils so we thought oh

977
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,119
we're using lava rock and we started

978
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:05,038
buying lava rock and the red one is more

979
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,558
iron rich and the black one might be

980
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,558
more rich i'm not positive but

981
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:10,639
potentially manganese but at least less

982
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,480
iron and so we were playing with recipes

983
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,240
there and it makes a pretty good soil

984
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,960
but i will tell you the lava rock it's

985
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,599
heavy and it's not quite as good at

986
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,519
being an aeration amendment more than

987
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:23,199
just a drainage it doesn't hold as much

988
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,880
oxygen in the soil

989
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,960
now it works and it works well but the

990
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,240
learning curve from building a soil like

991
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,600
if you were to just go to a healthy

992
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,759
organic farm

993
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,599
dig out their black rich soil and put it

994
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,359
in a pot and try and grow

995
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,959
and now in a container

996
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,879
that container the biggest challenge

997
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,720
even though it might test well is the

998
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,679
physical characteristics will make it

999
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,519
almost impossible to to keep the air and

1000
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,880
the water in there

1001
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,319
enough to make the plant grow it's just

1002
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,399
going to be over water right away it's

1003
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,720
going to get stagnant in areas

1004
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:55,119
that's why potting soil

1005
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,600
is mimicking the native soil but to be

1006
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:59,678
in a container it has to be different so

1007
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,038
we we put some lava rock in a bucket of

1008
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,640
water and it would sink we did some

1009
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,519
character we did like some research on

1010
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,320
the porosity and pumice it floats in

1011
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,679
water it's closer to what perlite does

1012
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,278
but it's real in the sense that it's

1013
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,798
just mined from the earth people use it

1014
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,159
in other industries so there's a lot of

1015
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:16,960
data like they use it in the beauty

1016
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,840
industry for foot you know lotions and

1017
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,440
scrubs and all sorts of stuff to be uh

1018
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:22,879
to help with skin

1019
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,080
and because of that there's lots of

1020
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,399
testing done on it to make sure it's

1021
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,439
safe so it's really logical to go that

1022
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,278
direction

1023
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,960
also people build water filters with

1024
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,440
like biochar and pumice and all sorts of

1025
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,640
weird things so pumice became a go-to

1026
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,159
it's lighter weight which means it

1027
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,919
didn't ruin the freight

1028
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,919
and it held air and it's a good

1029
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,278
microbial condo which we need the

1030
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,399
bacteria to live in all those little

1031
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,398
space

1032
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,000
it has so much surface area a lot can

1033
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,719
happen there and then from there we

1034
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,038
thought well rice holes they use because

1035
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,360
it's lightweight and it replaces perlite

1036
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:55,759
because it adds drainage the reason why

1037
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,038
is it's made of silica and so all the

1038
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:58,558
growers on the forums were like man

1039
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:59,759
we're all buying silica that'd be great

1040
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:01,599
if we could just put some rice holes in

1041
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,158
there and add silica

1042
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,599
and what kept us from using 100 rice

1043
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,519
holes was the fact we wanted to keep

1044
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,199
soil forever so you're thinking well if

1045
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,640
i no-till the soil and the rice holes

1046
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,640
are eaten by the worms over the first

1047
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,840
year or two and they're gone where's my

1048
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,120
aeration

1049
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:19,119
so the goal was okay of the 33 aeration

1050
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,199
let's use like 10 or 15 percent of that

1051
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,518
as rice holes so worst case we still

1052
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,120
have a lot of pumice in there best case

1053
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,519
we get some fluff out of the rice holes

1054
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,359
and we get some long-term silica

1055
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,960
so that was it and people started saying

1056
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,519
you know what i'll do whatever i have

1057
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,840
pumice rice holes i'll use 100 of one 50

1058
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,720
50 didn't matter as long as i used it as

1059
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,959
one third of my recipe now i will tell

1060
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,600
you you can use less compost some of our

1061
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,840
best recipes are closer to 20 compost

1062
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,639
they tend to they they tend to balance

1063
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,959
out

1064
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,038
much better and then you can add

1065
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,200
minerals and amendments more pointedly

1066
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,480
to your recipe so the old coots recipe

1067
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,000
at 33

1068
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,399
that's because he made his own

1069
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,960
vermicompost with his own amendments in

1070
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,158
it he was done at that point a lot of us

1071
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,480
when we're unsure of the quality of

1072
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,440
compost we're adding more to that

1073
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,720
so

1074
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,800
sometimes all you have to do is reduce

1075
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,320
the percentage a little bit and add

1076
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,200
maybe a little more aeration and a

1077
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,519
little more

1078
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,519
peat moss and you can make a spicier

1079
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,759
compost work very very well and what's

1080
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,679
easy about organics is

1081
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,480
if you didn't overdo it you can always

1082
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,358
come back later and brew a tea or top

1083
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,800
dress and give it more later so kind of

1084
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:28,878
like an athlete can only eat so much

1085
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,800
protein at one time we can only front

1086
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,799
load our soil with so much nutrients at

1087
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,639
once before we upset the balance

1088
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,519
eventually if this is sustainable we're

1089
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,639
going to have to come in and

1090
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:40,800
intelligently add more as we go so

1091
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,079
that became the goal

1092
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,679
other things variation you mentioned

1093
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,599
biochar

1094
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,559
biochar holds about 10 times its weight

1095
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,519
in water

1096
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:51,119
and so because of that i try not to

1097
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,599
categorize it as aeration because if

1098
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,879
someone used 33 of that

1099
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,280
instead of one of the others it could

1100
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,960
cause a catastrophe it's very carbon

1101
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,280
rich one of the things you can learn

1102
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,199
about organics is that carbon is very

1103
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,040
important it feeds the biology that then

1104
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:06,879
breaks down and makes the nutrients

1105
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,440
available to the plant but

1106
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,200
too much carbon can rob nitrogen

1107
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,039
and that can upset the balance and so

1108
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:14,960
there's this carbon to nitrogen ratio

1109
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:17,920
that makes good compost and just front

1110
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,800
loading your soil with too much biochar

1111
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,400
can be a problem so good rule of thumb

1112
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,440
if you're not familiar with the biochars

1113
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,119
to use maybe maximum five percent

1114
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,000
there's definitely times you can use

1115
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,838
more but without knowing for sure i

1116
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,320
would just say it's all one-third make

1117
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:36,639
my base and you can add an extra

1118
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,200
percentage of biochar to that

1119
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,159
but i i more consider the aeration to be

1120
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,319
pumice

1121
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:44,559
perlite and rice holes or lava rock

1122
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,240
those are the four main now some people

1123
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,559
have used pea gravel some people

1124
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,078
literally take hydrotin the clay balls

1125
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,119
from their old hydroponic grow and they

1126
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,119
go well i don't want to waste them i'm

1127
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,358
going to put that as an aeration

1128
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,358
it kind of works as a drainage as taking

1129
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,440
up space in your recipe but it's the

1130
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:00,880
hydrogen clay is so smooth there's no

1131
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,159
porosity there

1132
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,079
and in our experience it just doesn't

1133
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,078
work very well so

1134
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,760
um take that for what it's worth about

1135
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,280
for vermiculite

1136
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,320
vermiculite is something that we don't

1137
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,440
use here but it is of benefit and part

1138
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,960
of the reasons why is i just want my

1139
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,639
crew breathing and dealing with it like

1140
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,400
eliminating perlite vermiculite is

1141
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,480
fantastic for the crew the air quality

1142
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,400
is already bad enough one of our goals

1143
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,920
for 2022 is to improve the air quality

1144
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,800
in our soil mixing building that we just

1145
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,480
built

1146
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,720
and so keeping some of those ingredients

1147
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,400
out is always a benefit but vermiculite

1148
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,279
has a very high cec

1149
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,200
it's very lightweight and people use it

1150
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,440
to hold water so it becomes more like

1151
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,960
biochar in that sense so for instance

1152
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,599
let's say you're a producer and you're

1153
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,400
going to have 100 000 little seedlings

1154
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,119
that you're starting and you're going to

1155
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,280
sell them to home depot eventually

1156
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,720
if you're growing something that is it

1157
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,920
needs to be dry

1158
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,838
you would want to do their peat moss

1159
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,680
perlite recipe because you could water

1160
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:54,799
every day and it would just dry out if

1161
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:56,159
you're wanting something to hold some

1162
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,839
moisture for a little while so you can

1163
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,598
lower the irrigation and this and the

1164
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,838
plants you're growing don't mind being a

1165
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,880
little more moist or they prefer it

1166
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,039
you're going to get the recipe with a

1167
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,800
little more vermiculite in it

1168
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:08,719
so from a soil building perspective it

1169
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,920
has textural qualities as far as holding

1170
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,159
more moisture

1171
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,400
but the one reason why i would consider

1172
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:15,920
adding it to a recipe right now the way

1173
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,519
build a swell does it is it has a very

1174
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,159
high cec

1175
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,039
and so the the difference in potting

1176
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:22,480
soil

1177
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,039
is that potting soil

1178
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,960
while it has cation exchange

1179
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,358
it's not really used it's not really the

1180
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,960
same in soil the cad exchange is based

1181
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,239
off of clay

1182
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,320
minerals that have broken down in the

1183
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,479
organic matter for thousands of years so

1184
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,200
it's very very real to base your whole

1185
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,119
farm off that map but a potting soil

1186
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,039
that math is more like a gut check it's

1187
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,640
not as accurate

1188
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,320
so we haven't ventured to the

1189
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,960
vermiculite but if we wanted more

1190
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,559
nutrient holding capability biochar

1191
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,480
vermiculite

1192
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,759
things like that can potentially hold

1193
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,559
more in your recipe if that makes sense

1194
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,960
okay

1195
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:01,599
and then after you have your 33 33 33

1196
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,358
mix organic amendments should be added

1197
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,119
as well so microbes will work to break

1198
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:06,559
down those organic amendments turn them

1199
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,320
into nutrients that they

1200
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,239
take i've been using the build of soil

1201
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,760
craft blend the past several grows and

1202
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,598
my plants love it

1203
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,760
what are the options for initial

1204
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,440
amendments that could be added to the 33

1205
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,440
33 33 mix

1206
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,679
so i'll go over what kutz recommends and

1207
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,358
i'll also give you some rules of thumb

1208
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,440
to go by so that you're not blindly

1209
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,679
following my recipe a lot of this was

1210
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,119
based on steve solomon so steve solomon

1211
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:32,078
the intelligent gardener's got a great

1212
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,480
book he's in tasmania i was talking to

1213
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,839
him right at the onset of covet and

1214
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,599
he's just been a very he's been

1215
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:39,519
inspirational to me and been willing to

1216
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,800
take my phone calls and so i'm always

1217
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,199
asking him questions about some of this

1218
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,519
stuff and he had this three-way line mix

1219
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,039
that he used and it was like dolmat lime

1220
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,400
agricultural lime and gypsum or

1221
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:50,800
something like that and so coot

1222
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,960
referenced the three-way lime mix but he

1223
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,280
always wanted to add uh glacial rock

1224
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,119
dust and eventually change that to be

1225
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,760
basalt and that's because it's a

1226
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,720
volcanic rock dust so

1227
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,720
coot's recipe was hey if soil is made of

1228
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:06,799
rock dust ground up in organic matter

1229
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,639
that's what he wanted to duplicate

1230
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,519
so the rule of thumb for the coot's

1231
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,879
recipe across the board was a half a cup

1232
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,280
of each one of your nutrients you're

1233
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,280
adding per cubic foot

1234
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,880
a cubic foot came to be known as about

1235
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,760
seven and a half gallons if you look

1236
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,838
online

1237
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,160
its mathematic formula is anywhere from

1238
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,320
6.8 to 7.5

1239
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:28,879
depending on and what i mean by that is

1240
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,640
you can fill a perfect 12 inch by 12

1241
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,280
inch by 12 inch box you can make it

1242
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:35,440
exactly one cubic foot you can fill it

1243
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,440
perfectly with peat moss and call it one

1244
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,720
cubic foot but then you can just press

1245
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,240
it down with your hands and now is that

1246
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:41,039
really a cubic foot or is there room for

1247
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,078
more

1248
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,199
so we use seven and a half gallons for a

1249
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,440
cubic foot

1250
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,358
and if you add a half cubic foot of each

1251
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,240
one of your amendments you should be

1252
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:51,920
safe

1253
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,118
maximum that we like to see is up to

1254
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,720
three cups

1255
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,800
the koots recipe is only one and a half

1256
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,879
cups of nutrients you can always add

1257
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,240
more later i think less is more and

1258
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,720
that's the way to go

1259
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,159
then on the mineral side you could add

1260
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:07,199
up to about a cup or two of your

1261
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:09,519
favorite mineral totaling no more than

1262
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,960
four to six cups of minerals four cups

1263
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:13,838
of minerals per cubic foot is the koots

1264
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,800
recipe half of it two of those is rock

1265
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:16,318
dust

1266
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,960
most people would mix some glacial and

1267
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,480
some basalt or you just use all basalt

1268
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,720
the other two was a mixture of your

1269
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,318
calciums very very important number one

1270
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,598
mineral for plant growth is calcium

1271
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:30,559
calcium calcium it's everything so

1272
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:33,359
he would usually add oyster shell flour

1273
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:36,480
and that was the calcium side

1274
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,838
or an ag lime or a mixture of the two so

1275
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,679
that's what we started doing we would

1276
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,400
mix in two cups of basalt

1277
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:44,480
uh one cup of some oyster shell flour

1278
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,920
and one cup of some gypsum and funny

1279
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,358
story when i first started this i didn't

1280
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,400
know there was a difference between rock

1281
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:50,000
dust

1282
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,760
and he was encouraging me to buy local

1283
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,719
so i messaged and i said all i could

1284
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,160
find was calcium sulfate and and they

1285
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,439
can't even sell it at the local farm

1286
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:59,039
store so they told me it's going to be

1287
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,920
like 50 cents a bag they were 50 pound

1288
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,599
bags

1289
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,960
i was blown away so i bought a whole

1290
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,599
bunch of them brought them home and i

1291
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,199
used that four cups of gypsum

1292
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,119
solely as my rock dust and it was one of

1293
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,719
the better recipes i'd ever made

1294
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,480
so that's when i learned that overdoing

1295
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,399
calcium especially gypsum was not

1296
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,159
necessarily a bad thing

1297
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,639
but to round it out

1298
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,639
we wanted the coot's recipe specifically

1299
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,078
one and a half cups of amendments four

1300
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:23,358
cups of minerals

1301
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,880
and so what i'm

1302
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:26,239
telling you is like if if you have

1303
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,680
alfalfa meal

1304
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:29,598
you could add a half cup of that to this

1305
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:33,039
recipe and it would be fine

1306
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:36,240
but his recipe is one half cup kelp meal

1307
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:38,960
one half cup crustacean meal and one

1308
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,719
half cup neem or karanja better yet a

1309
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,480
mixture of the two

1310
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,279
that's the fertilizer

1311
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,960
and if you learn about it a a neem or

1312
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,839
karanja that's a seed from a tree so

1313
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,838
that's a seed meal soy is another seed

1314
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:53,119
cotton is another seed the reason why we

1315
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:54,799
don't use soy or cotton is they're the

1316
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,240
most gmo pesticide sprayed products

1317
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,920
around the world and then they're

1318
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,199
totally approved for organic use and so

1319
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,400
you could be growing in roundup without

1320
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:01,919
even knowing it

1321
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,880
that's part of the reasons why we avoid

1322
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,639
some of those and the karanja is a

1323
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,720
nitrogen fixing tree

1324
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:10,480
it's an um it's good for the earth okay

1325
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,559
and it's very clean on heavy metals and

1326
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,400
everything else so adding that in as

1327
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:15,599
your seed meal that's great

1328
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,079
the kelp meals for all the

1329
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,079
micronutrients the entire periodic table

1330
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,599
comes from the ocean and the kelp has

1331
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,359
hormones because it grows

1332
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,480
it grows feet in a day it is one of the

1333
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:28,239
fastest growing plants so kelp

1334
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,280
big reason all the trace minerals all

1335
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:32,719
the magic from the ocean neem or coronda

1336
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,880
a seed meal that's where the protein is

1337
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,399
going to come from that's like if you're

1338
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,000
vegan or a vegetarian you need the

1339
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,680
protein from the nuts and the seeds and

1340
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,679
all that not just from the from the

1341
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,598
lettuce there's none in there

1342
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,759
then the last one was crustacean meal

1343
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,200
and crustacean means a mixture of like

1344
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,040
shrimp or crab

1345
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,279
the reason why coot recommended that was

1346
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,599
very simple it was calcium carbon it was

1347
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,040
loaded in calcium it had some protein

1348
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,359
from the leftover meat that might have

1349
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,679
been in the crustacean right had some

1350
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,519
phosphorus but really it had this

1351
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:02,719
advantage also that the shells are made

1352
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:03,920
out of chitin

1353
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:05,519
and if you don't know chitin is the

1354
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,159
second most abundant substance on the

1355
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,920
earth first is cellulose next is chitin

1356
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,879
chitin i used to call chitten i have no

1357
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,318
idea what it was c h c-h-i-t-i-n

1358
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,640
uh you gotta be chittenden we used to

1359
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:18,318
joke until we learned it was chitin

1360
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:20,639
wasn't as funny then

1361
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:22,639
but chitin is something that plants have

1362
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,039
come to use

1363
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,440
potentially activating their systemic

1364
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,199
acquired response their sar their in

1365
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,358
their defense system kind of like when

1366
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:33,439
we talk about having an immune system

1367
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:36,239
and the reason why is insects are also

1368
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,920
made of chitin so it would i i guess it

1369
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,358
would make sense that if titan's around

1370
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,720
maybe that means insects are around and

1371
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,279
there's some sort of defense response

1372
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:46,159
there but there's benefit and we knew

1373
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,960
that so his recipe was simple but

1374
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,920
arguably not simple in his choice for

1375
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,519
why

1376
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,760
so to keep it basic

1377
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:56,000
half cup of crustacean meal half cup of

1378
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,720
kelp meal half cup of neem cake or neem

1379
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,400
seed meal it's the same thing just words

1380
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:03,118
that's one and a half cups of total

1381
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,960
amendments per cubic foot a lot of

1382
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,200
people just doubled that thinking

1383
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,280
ah if that's good twice as good

1384
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,679
but what we learned since is that kelp

1385
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,920
less is more it has arsenic in it it has

1386
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,679
lots of trace minerals in it it's better

1387
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,358
to keep that one at a lower level you

1388
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:18,559
could double the others if you'd like if

1389
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:20,719
you know you have a really nutrient

1390
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,759
hungry plant

1391
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:23,039
one of the other things that a lot of

1392
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,200
people did is they would add their

1393
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,199
favorite extra they would copy the koots

1394
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:29,439
recipe and then say you know what i'm

1395
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,439
going to add a half cup alfalfa and i'm

1396
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,440
going to add a maybe a half cup of fish

1397
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,960
bone meal or guano or whatever their

1398
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,559
their favorite thing was that they

1399
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,318
couldn't not use

1400
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:39,599
and in that way the koots recipe is

1401
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:41,759
really the

1402
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,440
the infinity base recipe that everybody

1403
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,480
uses and then soups up according to

1404
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,480
their own needs like if you're going to

1405
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,159
go to really small containers you might

1406
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,358
up the nutrients a bit and top dress if

1407
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:51,279
you're going in huge containers you

1408
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:52,880
might just keep it standard if you have

1409
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,599
a local compost you might lower the

1410
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,519
percentage but it was such a working

1411
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,920
model i think it's what took off like

1412
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,280
wildfire out there for people to just

1413
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,358
trust that they can make a soil from

1414
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,400
scratch that would actually work right i

1415
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:06,078
mean when you're

1416
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,519
making something from a recipe online

1417
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,800
like for food

1418
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:10,318
typically you want at least one review

1419
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,839
saying hey this didn't taste awful it

1420
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:13,679
did work and then you go okay cool i'll

1421
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:15,838
try the recipe that's what happened

1422
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:16,879
everybody had success in the kudz recipe

1423
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,880
so

1424
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,599
i have to ask like i mentioned i use

1425
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,480
build a soil craft blend right and i

1426
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,960
swear and you probably know this 24 to

1427
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,079
48 hours after watering it in is like

1428
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,519
this putrid smell like the smell is just

1429
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,119
i thought somebody was dead in the room

1430
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,599
or something at one point

1431
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,800
what is that horrible smell so after

1432
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,880
your top dress because i don't get any

1433
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,280
odor out of it no i know the water in it

1434
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,640
if it gets wet or if i brew it right

1435
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,880
yeah you water it

1436
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:46,318
so typically what i do though is i i

1437
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,079
wiggle it into my mulch layer now it's

1438
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:49,920
covered in worm castings and mulch and

1439
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,160
so the odor just typically can't be a

1440
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,920
thing but um what it is is there's

1441
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:55,920
crustacean meal and if you ever smell

1442
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,200
some old crab i mean get pretty gnar

1443
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,480
when it's breaking down right and

1444
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:01,679
biology that's of decay is what's going

1445
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,358
to make those nutrients available

1446
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,279
there's also fish meal there's fish bone

1447
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:06,880
meal in there um and then there's

1448
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,960
camellina meal and it's a weird one

1449
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,800
because it's a wild flax and it's kind

1450
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,920
of like mustard in the sense that it

1451
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,560
smells

1452
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,079
unique and it's got like this

1453
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,519
the oil that's in it because they don't

1454
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,960
de-oil it first it's almost like

1455
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:22,880
like linseed oil or something like it

1456
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,240
has like a turpentine like it has a

1457
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,559
weird odor and so you can block you

1458
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,719
combine the protein it's rich in protein

1459
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,239
that wants to kick off that fermentation

1460
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,399
you've got neem in there which smells

1461
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:34,078
like garlic mushroom gnar like it's just

1462
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,000
weird mean cake is gnarly if you're not

1463
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,440
used to it smells gross

1464
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,440
and you combine that with like the ocean

1465
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,920
stuff and then you get it wet and we did

1466
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,679
not build this to be a potpourri of good

1467
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,240
smells we built it solely with the

1468
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:48,960
intent of making a diverse

1469
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,799
fix-it mix if you will uh uh what can i

1470
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,000
add to my soil without having to guess

1471
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,599
every time

1472
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,599
and the craft one actually came from a

1473
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,760
buddies last name's craft we didn't call

1474
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,760
it craft because it was crafted his last

1475
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,040
name is craft and he grew a lot of

1476
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,800
plants and he's like bro can you just

1477
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:04,960
mix all that together so i don't

1478
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,560
have to do it and be a good seller and

1479
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,960
it's one of our best-selling products

1480
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,318
and what i did do is i took his idea and

1481
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,400
instead of just blindly mixing it

1482
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:14,159
together i measured the npk of all of

1483
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,680
them put them equal by weight and then i

1484
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,000
did some testing to make sure p was

1485
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:20,239
above k and it actually made some sense

1486
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,519
from a soil testing background

1487
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:23,598
and it's our favorite product we use it

1488
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,119
on the vegetable farm because

1489
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,800
i mean for us to get

1490
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,000
two bags of fish meal two bags of kelp

1491
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,280
it's just there's a lot then the mice

1492
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,440
can get into it then you have to unroll

1493
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,680
the bags so bringing a tote of craftland

1494
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,200
to the farm it's just all in one scoop

1495
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:37,679
and now we can tell anybody that works

1496
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:40,000
on the farm if you're doing a bed grab

1497
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:42,078
one big scoop 18 pounds and amend the

1498
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,480
bed with it and if it's a

1499
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,480
longer season crop we can say do double

1500
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,480
and it makes it easy and so then all of

1501
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,599
a sudden growers were telling us even

1502
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,039
before we knew it was going to be

1503
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,800
popular that it was their favorite

1504
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,480
product and so when you're researching

1505
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,280
amendments we mentioned a half cup of

1506
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,838
each

1507
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,119
no more than three cups

1508
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:00,960
the craft one gets confusing because

1509
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,640
there's minerals in there as well so i'd

1510
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,159
recommend most people have kind of

1511
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:05,759
followed our recipe that's on the bag

1512
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:06,558
there what to use

1513
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,960
but

1514
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,400
um you can go a little above like if you

1515
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,000
take three cups of nutrients and the

1516
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,480
four cups of minerals per cubic foot

1517
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
that's about seven combined cups

1518
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,838
i would say be less than that with the

1519
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,679
craft blend because it's not as high a

1520
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:21,920
percentage of minerals as if you made

1521
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,159
the coots mix from scratch and because

1522
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,680
of that we use craft blend as our

1523
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:27,519
supplementary meaning

1524
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:29,358
we'll make soil according to the recipes

1525
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:32,318
and then craft blend will now from now

1526
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:33,519
on be the amendment to because we've

1527
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:35,199
already front loaded with so much

1528
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,119
minerals the minerals don't necessarily

1529
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:39,039
go anywhere and like the basalt is not

1530
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,800
going to disappear in the first cycle

1531
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:42,639
so now the craft blend becomes in a

1532
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,039
great addition but where craftlin came

1533
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,799
from if you look up steve solomon he

1534
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,400
would teach you how to make an organic

1535
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,079
fertilizer mix

1536
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,000
and he would recommend that you added

1537
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,318
something with phosphorus

1538
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,559
something that had the seed meal

1539
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:58,079
and he would also add something that had

1540
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,079
like the kelp or alfalfa like to have

1541
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,318
the trace minerals and so it was a way

1542
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,359
to construct a complete recipe if you

1543
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:05,199
weren't just

1544
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:07,440
buying something off the shelf

1545
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:09,439
that's where craft blend came from

1546
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,599
and the immediate reaction growers get

1547
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,519
is because it also has some calcium and

1548
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,800
some magnesium in it which you all know

1549
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:16,880
if you're in hydro it's like cow mag

1550
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,160
will fix a lot of things right and so

1551
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,519
immediately when they're watered in or

1552
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:21,519
top dress

1553
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:22,719
before the biology even has a chance to

1554
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:24,318
break some stuff down they're getting

1555
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:26,159
some mineral release right away which is

1556
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:27,358
very helpful oftentimes

1557
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:28,719
um

1558
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:30,159
yeah craft blend is one of my favorites

1559
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,159
so thanks for bringing it up yeah it

1560
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:33,598
makes it really really easy i mean you

1561
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,799
mentioned what you could do for initial

1562
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,240
amendments but you could just do the

1563
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,480
craft blend right if you want to keep it

1564
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,078
simple just you absolutely can now

1565
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,440
here's the thing when i used to go to

1566
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,960
the garden store and try and buy like a

1567
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,720
pre-blended organic you know there's a

1568
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,240
lot of companies that have individuals

1569
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,399
like you could go buy alfalfa or you

1570
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,318
could go buy fish bone meal but when i

1571
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,240
got to the blends i didn't like it and

1572
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,079
here's why if you go to the local

1573
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,759
gardening store or the hardware store

1574
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,240
and you grab an organic blended

1575
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,800
fertilizer all purpose or tomato

1576
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:02,719
fertilizer or rose fertilizer they'll

1577
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,720
even put pictures of roses on there as

1578
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:05,759
if the rose has a particular diet that

1579
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:07,279
it prefers

1580
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,760
that's not the case and so i don't want

1581
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:13,200
people to be misled that a tomato needs

1582
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,520
a specific fertilizer medicinal plants

1583
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:17,358
annual flowering plants tomatoes they

1584
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:19,599
require the same thing so there's

1585
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:21,838
nothing special about them obviously we

1586
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,838
all feel our chosen plant that we prefer

1587
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:25,440
to grow is going to be special to us

1588
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:27,279
some people love tomatoes and it's the

1589
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,480
only plant that matters

1590
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,240
but just because of that doesn't mean we

1591
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,679
need a special fertilizer for it and so

1592
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:33,679
then you'd flip the box over and you

1593
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:35,919
start reading it well guess what they

1594
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:38,078
did to get it organic listed you had to

1595
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,760
use ingredients that are approved for

1596
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,200
organic use they don't have to be

1597
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,040
organic

1598
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:44,318
and when you read it

1599
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:46,079
it reads like

1600
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:47,440
what has the highest profit margin now

1601
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,839
that i understand it so you read it you

1602
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,960
go oh cottonseed meal soybean meal uh

1603
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,159
what is the other one that's really

1604
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:58,000
popular that's uh highly contaminated

1605
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,598
uh cotton and soy are two of the big

1606
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,760
ones but then you'll see bone meal and

1607
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,119
blood meal and all these waste sources

1608
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,640
so essentially if you're a fertilizer

1609
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,079
manufacturer you'd be like hey you got

1610
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:08,239
some waste can i have it for free

1611
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,079
perfect and you'd clean up shop form

1612
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:12,239
handle the freight that's how a lot of

1613
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,160
these fertilizer businesses came to be

1614
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:17,358
and so when i'm reading a box that says

1615
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:19,519
cottonseed meal magnesium sulfate bone

1616
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:21,920
meal i'm just reading cheapest on

1617
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:24,719
the market with the widest profit margin

1618
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:28,240
and when you think about cotton

1619
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:30,480
it's not fed to animals so the it can be

1620
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:31,759
literally sprayed at harvest to make

1621
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,358
clothing out of

1622
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,280
and then as soon as you do that and

1623
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,279
you've taken what's made for cotton all

1624
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,480
the waste is now considered approved for

1625
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,640
organic use

1626
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,480
it can be very toxic and so now people

1627
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,920
are carrying more and obviously there's

1628
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,599
been huge instances where some of that

1629
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,440
waste killed big gardens and they had to

1630
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,440
do research about how it happened so

1631
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,760
we're all learning but

1632
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,920
when you go to the typical garden store

1633
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,520
comparing it to craft blend

1634
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,200
night and day difference in the quality

1635
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,719
of inputs and that's why we continue to

1636
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:59,439
produce it it's a nightmare to make i

1637
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:01,118
mean

1638
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,880
truckloads of materials from all over

1639
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,519
the country have to land

1640
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,720
and be here and all 13 ingredients or

1641
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:08,480
something have to be on the ground at

1642
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:09,919
one time and multiple thousand pounds

1643
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,920
then we have to weigh them and mix them

1644
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,280
and i kind of wish we hadn't done it but

1645
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,720
at the end of the day

1646
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,720
eventually it might get big enough where

1647
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:20,000
we can have maybe a machine that helps

1648
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:22,799
us with all of the blending of it but um

1649
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,800
it's really really good so

1650
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,640
i feel like we should also quickly touch

1651
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,240
upon container size

1652
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:30,318
it seems with organics it's often said

1653
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:32,318
that the bigger the pot size the better

1654
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:34,558
talk to us about pot size yeah it's a

1655
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,838
bigger buffer and what i mean by that is

1656
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,359
if you're in a small container it's

1657
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,199
doable so when i first started learning

1658
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:40,558
afghanistan um

1659
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:42,159
was

1660
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,079
on the forum and showing his growing a

1661
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,440
lot of us borrowed from the vision we

1662
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,720
saw he had like a room that was full of

1663
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,760
like home depot buckets there were like

1664
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,000
a hundred of them there and they were

1665
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,119
just stacked bamboo poles everywhere it

1666
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,800
looked like you're gonna gouge an eye

1667
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,400
out just walking in there

1668
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,839
but it was in five gallons and he would

1669
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,838
literally just dump it out on the tarp

1670
00:52:55,838 --> 00:53:00,639
re-amend it and plug him back in and go

1671
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:01,759
and i'm like dude that is epic and

1672
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:03,199
around that time a lot of people were

1673
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,040
saying well what happens if i just don't

1674
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:06,239
dump my soil out so

1675
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:08,639
um

1676
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:10,078
they were just making compost teas and

1677
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:11,598
keeping the same five gallon there and

1678
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,599
planting right back into it and it

1679
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,440
became clear that if we grew a pretty

1680
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,960
big plant a five gallon container was

1681
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,960
almost root bound and cannibalized to

1682
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,720
the point where re-amending it or

1683
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,599
recycling it was probably the better way

1684
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:23,598
to go

1685
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,039
and so to offset that we didn't want all

1686
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,559
the labor like literally dumping 100

1687
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:28,719
pots on the ground in the tarp shoveling

1688
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,400
it and putting it back in was it's it's

1689
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:32,480
no small task

1690
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,680
and while it sounds great on paper when

1691
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,280
it's the fifth time you've done it and

1692
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:37,440
you just don't want to do it anymore

1693
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,200
you're looking for a better way and the

1694
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,960
no-till became the goal

1695
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,439
and mountain organics blue jay away at

1696
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,800
the time was starting to do back-to-back

1697
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,639
no-till cycles and everybody was

1698
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,039
increasing container size a lot of guys

1699
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:50,480
were growing like hundred gallon pots

1700
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:51,759
and then we wanted to see how far that

1701
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,639
went and it seems like there's some

1702
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,240
magic

1703
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:55,920
somewhere around container size that

1704
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,558
we're still learning like a big

1705
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,159
container but still getting close

1706
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,760
to maxing out the volume creates a

1707
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:04,558
better finished product than one that's

1708
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,839
so big you never even come close

1709
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,440
but what we found

1710
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:09,679
is that doubling your container size

1711
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,358
usually increase your yield by about 60

1712
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,318
and there's a lot of studies that show

1713
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:14,400
why

1714
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:16,159
we found that plants are intelligent and

1715
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,838
because the nutrients aren't immediately

1716
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,759
available in soil

1717
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:22,960
they're dependent upon the speed the

1718
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,319
biology can feed him at in a five gallon

1719
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,519
container if we consider it like a

1720
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:29,759
bioreactor we put organic amendments in

1721
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:31,759
and biology breaks them down and feeds

1722
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,599
them to the plant when our plant really

1723
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,440
starts growing because we get the grow

1724
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,200
room dialed the grow lights are good or

1725
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,599
we're in the sun and it's just raging

1726
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:41,039
good environment greenhouse whatever

1727
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,280
now the biology just all of a sudden

1728
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,838
can't keep up your plant is is growing

1729
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,240
faster than it can keep up with the way

1730
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:49,838
to bypass that is to give it more soil

1731
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,439
so now the root instead of being

1732
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,358
circling on itself looking for new food

1733
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,358
can just go further away from itself

1734
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:56,960
looking for new food in fact the world

1735
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:58,639
record tomato grower he would do this he

1736
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,039
would make his own compost he would make

1737
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:03,598
his holes he would mulch it and he would

1738
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:06,000
irrigate it but then he'd go plant vetch

1739
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,240
a nitrogen fixing plant like eight to

1740
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,079
ten feet behind his rows that would grow

1741
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:11,358
and fix nitrogen in the ground when the

1742
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,960
plants got bigger in their growing

1743
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:14,960
season their roots would tap into the

1744
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,559
nitrogen the veg produced and then hit a

1745
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,440
surge of growth and they would never run

1746
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,519
out

1747
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,358
and so the bigger container size started

1748
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:22,880
being the mimicking of the earth of what

1749
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:24,960
would produce more yield i mean you can

1750
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,200
see the guys in cali would put 400

1751
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,079
gallon containers out grow 99 plants and

1752
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,759
they're all 10 pounds plus so we knew

1753
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:34,000
bigger could be bigger

1754
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,040
but as far as indoor goes if you're

1755
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,400
calling a four by four space your space

1756
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:39,759
a lot of people were hesitant to add

1757
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,838
more soil they're like five gallons a

1758
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,040
big container that's plenty big

1759
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,239
but when you do it for a while it just

1760
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,920
seems so small you look around you're

1761
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,598
like well i can fit way more in the same

1762
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,599
four by four if i'm growing four plants

1763
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,720
and five gallon buckets what's the

1764
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,318
difference if i just make them 30

1765
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:53,118
gallons it's still a four by four grow

1766
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:54,719
tent

1767
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,880
and what we found was the difference was

1768
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,639
significant in a 30 gallon or 100

1769
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:02,079
gallons something that really

1770
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:03,838
was more soil per canopy

1771
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,599
five gallons times four that's only 20

1772
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,199
gallons under your grow light

1773
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,519
but if you put

1774
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:12,318
30 gallons now you're talking 120

1775
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:13,759
gallons in the same 4x4 space

1776
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:15,440
and now you just didn't run out of food

1777
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,520
you didn't have to be an expert at

1778
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,358
feeding and making the right tea and

1779
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:21,039
then when you were done you used less

1780
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:22,000
than half of what was available so you

1781
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:23,920
could

1782
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,239
arguably guess with some craft blend and

1783
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,680
still have a pretty balanced soil and so

1784
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:29,439
what we tried to do just like life is

1785
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:31,118
take our highs and take our lows and

1786
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:34,480
flatten them to a curve that was more

1787
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:36,000
manageable a big container of soil makes

1788
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,199
the big harvest

1789
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,838
it's just like this it's not like you're

1790
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:41,598
depleting the soil and when you flatten

1791
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:43,279
that curve it seems like everybody gets

1792
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,720
better results now are there people that

1793
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,440
are using smaller containers in living

1794
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:49,279
soil and doing well yes a lot of times

1795
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,679
they'll use maybe a little bit less

1796
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,240
light intensity to grow really high

1797
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:56,960
quality without driving the plants so

1798
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:59,679
fast it outpaces biology or they will

1799
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,358
flip to flower significantly sooner or

1800
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:03,199
they will put it out on the patio when

1801
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:05,679
it's just a small tomato plant they're

1802
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:07,279
basically not trying to overgrow what

1803
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:08,239
they're using and so i think in living

1804
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,079
soil

1805
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:12,798
what we need to do is picture the final

1806
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:15,599
size of our plant and try and match the

1807
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:16,880
soil somewhat similarly to that as above

1808
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,318
so below

1809
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,440
and there's no breaking that rule when

1810
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:23,599
it comes to organics so to fill a 4x4

1811
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,440
canopy completely

1812
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,200
full of yield i think the best way is to

1813
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,798
fill it full of soil

1814
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:30,318
here's the the other side of it though

1815
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:32,559
when you're brand new

1816
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:34,639
if you really don't know about watering

1817
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:37,519
you could easily under water or over

1818
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:40,159
water a hundred gallon plant much

1819
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:41,920
easier than a five gallon the 5 gallon

1820
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:44,159
or a 10 gallon you can lift it and you

1821
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,599
can go that's way too heavy even i can

1822
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:47,440
tell that i'm brand new but that seems

1823
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,519
way heavier than day one

1824
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,960
that's probably has plenty of water

1825
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:52,239
where when you have 100 gallon or

1826
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,440
several thirties you're kind of slapping

1827
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:54,558
them and lifting them and like i don't

1828
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,559
really know

1829
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,400
and so then it becomes that you must

1830
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,000
know that your watering style is working

1831
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,880
and we have some rules of thumb for that

1832
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,318
but

1833
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,000
that really does determine your

1834
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:06,079
container size

1835
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,838
a lot of people will ask me how to

1836
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,280
choose their container size and i always

1837
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:11,440
recommend

1838
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,160
maxing out as much as you're comfortable

1839
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,318
with that's always the better answer

1840
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:17,759
the caveat is learning to water so in a

1841
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:21,519
four by four space

1842
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,920
i love doing 15 to 30 gallons times four

1843
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:25,679
or 100 gallon or

1844
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,240
a big planter now

1845
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:29,679
in a 4x4 i prefer a 3x3 planter if i'm

1846
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:32,078
going to use something square then i can

1847
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:33,679
step a foot in and reach to the back i

1848
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:36,480
can have some airflow where the tent's

1849
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:38,960
not right on my my grow container

1850
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,798
so a 5x5 tent would be great for a 4x4

1851
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,880
but these are rules of thumb you can

1852
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:45,039
break every one of these rules the

1853
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,039
reason why experts can break rules is

1854
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:49,119
they know the consequences of that and

1855
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:51,119
they offset it so if you're in a small

1856
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,880
container and that's all you can do

1857
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,798
keep your light intensity a little lower

1858
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,640
keep your plants a little smaller before

1859
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:59,838
you go into flower and i think that will

1860
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,358
make significant quality differences in

1861
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:03,039
organics we're not trying to just

1862
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:04,880
maximize yield

1863
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,119
we're trying to increase yield

1864
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,798
so long as quality is brought up with it

1865
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,680
but if there's a cost in quality we'd

1866
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:13,838
prefer not to do that

1867
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:15,118
and that's what we found so i hope that

1868
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:16,480
people listening to this may be

1869
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,720
encouraged to go up slightly in

1870
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,719
container size i find that

1871
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:22,959
10 to 15 gallons is the minimum to start

1872
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:24,959
no-tilling in my opinion you can

1873
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,358
definitely do fives but it's not as easy

1874
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,639
our last 10 by 10 series are five gallon

1875
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:30,159
containers we had three of them on a

1876
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:32,318
drip system

1877
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:33,920
they were ugly the whole way and harder

1878
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,400
to deal with and took more daily

1879
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,798
interaction but they produced what's in

1880
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,599
you know what's finished product now is

1881
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:41,280
you wouldn't be able to tell the

1882
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,359
difference it's arguably just as good if

1883
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,040
not better than the other ones but what

1884
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:47,199
was better than the other was the yield

1885
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:49,599
and the effort i got way more yield for

1886
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:52,639
way less effort and to me that's why

1887
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:55,119
bigger containers is very attractive so

1888
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:57,199
lots of good information there for sure

1889
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:59,440
so we talked about building the soil you

1890
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:00,399
know 33 33 33 adding the initial

1891
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,920
amendments

1892
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,680
now these initial amendments they're

1893
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,920
going to break down and the plant will

1894
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:08,399
uptake the nutrients and the soil can

1895
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,000
get depleted so oftentimes additional

1896
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,880
feedings are required throughout the

1897
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,880
grow

1898
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,079
when does the first feeding typically i

1899
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,280
know it's going to depend on pot size

1900
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,240
and stuff like that but generally

1901
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,880
speaking

1902
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:21,358
when do you first look to do that first

1903
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,039
feeding and what does it consist of so

1904
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:24,960
there's a couple ways to look at this

1905
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:26,318
when we first started most of us had

1906
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,280
bare soil

1907
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:30,318
on top meaning no mulch no top dressing

1908
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,000
just

1909
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:33,440
rich organic soil that we mixed

1910
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,880
according to these recipes put it in the

1911
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,039
container and you go

1912
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,039
and what we would all do is before the

1913
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:41,679
plant showed any hunger

1914
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:43,199
just maybe once a week or a few weeks

1915
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:45,039
after we got started and the plants were

1916
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:47,039
visibly growing happily and we know

1917
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:49,519
they're stable now

1918
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:50,798
then we just brewed compost teas

1919
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:53,440
and back then

1920
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:56,239
micro man tim wilson

1921
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,920
great guy totally transparent with info

1922
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:59,759
he would geek out he'd be like you need

1923
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,920
one point three four percent of this and

1924
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,680
what so we were all trying those recipes

1925
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,838
and essentially the most basic recipe

1926
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:08,000
was worm castings molasses and you'd

1927
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:09,119
bubble it for 24 to 48 hours and you'd

1928
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,239
water it in

1929
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,160
and there's a couple things that happen

1930
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:13,279
from that one is we made a lot of

1931
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:15,118
microbes

1932
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,040
and when we poured them in the soil even

1933
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,119
if they did nothing but die

1934
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:21,119
their dead micro bodies would feed the

1935
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,480
soil so it didn't have to be perfect and

1936
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,440
then you know the molasses has some

1937
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:27,039
trace minerals in there and the compost

1938
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,280
had some npk

1939
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:32,239
so making these compost teas once a week

1940
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,359
or so usually got great results but we

1941
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:35,439
wanted more

1942
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:37,119
and so we started to find out that is in

1943
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,519
organic farming you would apply what

1944
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,119
they call a side dress or a top dress

1945
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:42,318
and there's some implications to what

1946
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,400
that meant but

1947
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:46,239
essentially the way the forest does it

1948
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,400
if we're trying to mimic nature is the

1949
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:51,118
forest drops all its leaves

1950
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:53,039
and it slowly starts to break down and

1951
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,599
animals die and bugs die and everything

1952
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,960
and that eventually feeds the soil and

1953
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,440
it takes time

1954
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,679
and fungus is what really built our

1955
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,079
forests here and built our soil and

1956
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:05,440
worms eventually kind of took over and

1957
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,119
they're now part of that process but

1958
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,838
they were an invader

1959
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:12,640
either way worms build soil fungus built

1960
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:14,000
soil and so when we started looking at

1961
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:15,838
how we would want to feed it we said

1962
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,280
well how would we make nature i mean no

1963
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:18,798
fertilizer salesman's going to the

1964
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,720
redwood forest and saying hey you need a

1965
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:23,199
little more nitrogen to grow 200 feet

1966
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:25,199
taller it just happened and so in a

1967
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:26,960
living soil we started thinking instead

1968
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:28,960
of mixing it in there where it has to be

1969
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,960
accurate or it could be too much what if

1970
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,639
we just started pouring it on top and i

1971
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,318
got to tell you at that time

1972
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:35,920
everybody was doing the opposite of

1973
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:38,558
nature it was crazy so they were doing

1974
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,559
sub cool and sub cool was a great idea

1975
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:42,400
he would mix a really potent soil with

1976
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,079
tons of nutrients and since it was just

1977
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,838
off the chart

1978
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,839
full of nutrients you couldn't really

1979
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:49,599
plant right into it i mean some plants

1980
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:50,960
maybe right but some of these land racy

1981
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,119
plants they just did not want the

1982
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,119
nutrients so what you would do is you

1983
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:57,119
would put that in the bottom of your pot

1984
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:59,039
this spicy rich soil and then you put a

1985
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:01,838
really light soil with no nutrients on

1986
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:04,000
top the idea was you put your plant in

1987
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:06,000
and it doesn't go into the hot nutrients

1988
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,039
until it's ready for it and then it's

1989
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,199
balanced

1990
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:10,960
but nature does it the opposite it has

1991
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:13,038
all of the minerals and water down below

1992
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,358
with no nutrients and it pours all the

1993
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,480
nutrients right on top and slowly decays

1994
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:18,078
them into the soil

1995
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,159
and so as such the plants have actually

1996
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,920
developed this feeder root system that

1997
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:23,519
lives up top to eat the food and it

1998
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,599
develops these water tap roots that go

1999
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:27,519
down to get water and minerals deep from

2000
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,838
the earth depending on the type of plant

2001
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:31,599
so in living soil what we do is right

2002
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:33,759
away you don't have to wait

2003
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,599
because when we mix it in the soil it

2004
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,240
could be too much if we overdo it but

2005
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:40,318
once you put the 15 gallon pot let's say

2006
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,078
of your homemade

2007
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:44,159
three-part recipe

2008
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,920
and you put the plant into it you could

2009
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,239
literally top dress some craft blend or

2010
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,760
your homemade version put some more worm

2011
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:51,759
castings on there and cover it with

2012
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,079
mulch and put a few worms in and you

2013
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,680
could do that day one and the reason why

2014
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:57,760
like if you buy fox farm they say don't

2015
01:03:55,679 --> 01:03:59,199
feed it for a few weeks is it's already

2016
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,839
charged with food

2017
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:03,519
where in our soil it's charged with

2018
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,880
amendments that are going to take time

2019
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:06,798
to break down

2020
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,640
and so we want that to be there and it's

2021
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:10,880
a balanced amount but when we put stuff

2022
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:12,318
on top we're day one creating the

2023
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,000
biomimicry of the forest that's

2024
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:15,920
eventually going to start adding food

2025
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,838
from the top which means that as our

2026
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,280
plant grows and it eats the soil we made

2027
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:20,239
for it it's going to go i wonder where

2028
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,319
my food is and it's going to start

2029
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:23,838
reaching up to the top putting feeder

2030
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:25,679
roots up there especially if we use

2031
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:27,519
mulch and it'll say oh here i'm good

2032
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:28,960
i've got more food and then you can feed

2033
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:30,880
it right through the top

2034
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,720
and when you develop this is game

2035
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,079
changer we used to top dress and not a

2036
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:35,439
lot would happen it would take weeks

2037
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,280
every time you'd water it in and kind of

2038
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,599
go in there eventually it would break

2039
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:41,359
down but when we added worms that would

2040
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:44,559
eat it and immediately make it available

2041
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:47,279
and we covered it with straw some mulch

2042
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:49,119
of some sort it became shady

2043
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,760
the light wasn't hitting anymore the

2044
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:53,680
worms would go right up to it the fungus

2045
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,200
was growing underneath it and all of a

2046
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,199
sudden the feeder roots would literally

2047
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:58,719
set up shop and they would hang and wait

2048
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:00,639
and next time you top dress you could

2049
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:02,719
see the roots like literally matted

2050
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:04,879
right there and they would start to work

2051
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:06,558
on your top dress within days so all of

2052
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,240
a sudden it became

2053
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,720
oh you got to be three weeks ahead in

2054
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:12,639
organics too well if i build from day

2055
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:14,318
one this feeder root system

2056
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:15,519
i could go top dress every couple weeks

2057
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:18,318
if i want and they're going to make

2058
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:21,119
immediate good use of it and if any is

2059
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:23,199
left over well it's on top and the thing

2060
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,119
that we found is that plants annual

2061
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,598
flowering plants when they go to die

2062
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,559
like they've lived their time

2063
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,079
they're going to die whether they have

2064
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,599
nutrients or not which means they're not

2065
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:32,798
going to just be continually forced

2066
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,400
feeding themselves they're going to stop

2067
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:36,318
taking up nutrients

2068
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,480
some of them now the idea is that they

2069
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:40,719
will stop if they can in hydro they

2070
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,318
can't because they need water

2071
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:43,759
and the nutrients are already in the

2072
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:45,038
water which means for them to drink

2073
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,599
means they're going to get nutrients

2074
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:49,839
whether they like it or not but in soil

2075
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,920
where you have underground aquifers and

2076
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:54,000
food up top the plant can almost start

2077
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,400
to self-fade

2078
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,318
to sense to senescence is what they call

2079
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,000
it and even if there's an abundance of

2080
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:01,759
food in the top dressing

2081
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,358
so long as you're slowing watering down

2082
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,720
and the biology is not breaking it down

2083
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:06,558
completely because the plant roots have

2084
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:08,000
said i don't need it anymore the plant

2085
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,839
will still fade and it will still

2086
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,519
senesce even though there's nutrients in

2087
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:12,400
the soil which sets you up for the next

2088
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:14,960
round

2089
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,240
without completely depleting it so

2090
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,798
for the new grower that's setting up

2091
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:20,959
their container don't be scared to top

2092
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:22,318
dress right in the beginning because by

2093
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,480
the time you get into full fruit

2094
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:26,880
production and flowering that top dress

2095
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,318
will start to be available to the plant

2096
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,640
and that's how i build my what i call

2097
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,960
the checking account that's in the mix

2098
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:35,279
it needs to be available and the savings

2099
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,559
account and when your plant can say oh

2100
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,720
my checking account's pretty good but my

2101
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,160
savings account is great it will put

2102
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,919
more fruit out

2103
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:43,358
where if you don't have any of that even

2104
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,720
though your soil is good your plant's

2105
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:46,558
not stupid it's not going to put out

2106
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:47,838
more than would kill itself

2107
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,200
and so you might be cheating your plant

2108
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:51,119
by not building that checking and

2109
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:53,759
savings account and here's what's nice

2110
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,920
is in a big big container you can put

2111
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,799
less in your savings account across the

2112
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:01,039
surface and the plant will react better

2113
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:02,000
because there's a bigger buffer of soil

2114
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:03,760
you don't

2115
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,280
like if one cup was the perfect amount

2116
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,039
in a five gallon

2117
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,480
well it might be a ten cup range in a

2118
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:10,480
big hundred gallon like you could over

2119
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,920
under do it without causing a problem

2120
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,358
and that's where container size comes

2121
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,760
back into play now

2122
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:17,679
feeding compost teas i'm never scared of

2123
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,920
but if you're buying like liquid fish or

2124
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:22,159
anything that's arguably potent i want

2125
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,960
you to wait in your soil recipe until

2126
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:25,920
the plant starts to show some hunger

2127
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,159
meaning

2128
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,000
in living soil you'll start to see like

2129
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:31,519
dark green will be just a little bit

2130
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,679
lighter hue of green and as you're

2131
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:35,358
growing you'll start to think oh she's

2132
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:36,558
hungry the plants are a little bit they

2133
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:37,920
want something

2134
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:39,359
you can start to feed those liquids at

2135
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,639
that point but they're so instantly

2136
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:42,400
available

2137
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:44,400
you can't guess a month ahead of time

2138
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,880
like you can with organic amendments if

2139
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,480
that makes sense gotcha yep well it's

2140
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,640
episodes like this where i wish this

2141
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,079
podcast was two hours but it's only one

2142
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:53,920
hour we just scratched the surface on

2143
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:55,839
things there are so many other things

2144
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,200
that we can talk about i have a feeling

2145
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:59,199
the audience is going to be demanding a

2146
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:01,118
part two so maybe in the future we could

2147
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:03,519
do a part two and kind of pick up what

2148
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:05,838
we left off i mean we could get into ipm

2149
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:08,159
seed sparta teas cover crotch mulch

2150
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:09,759
layers all that stuff i think that would

2151
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:11,358
make for a great part too if you're

2152
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,440
willing to come i would be willing i

2153
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:15,199
want basically like i also practice jiu

2154
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,039
jitsu one of the things i learned there

2155
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:19,119
is that the black belt to be the best

2156
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:22,560
teacher he literally has to teach the

2157
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:24,479
fundamental basics every day over and

2158
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,400
over and over again because that's all

2159
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,238
that matters when they win competitions

2160
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:30,318
oftentimes it's a day one move they used

2161
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:31,919
and so this base recipe could be all

2162
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,359
that you ever need to know and some

2163
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,880
people don't require getting their black

2164
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,319
belt and learning the nuances of

2165
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,440
that just doesn't really help them get

2166
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,798
any further

2167
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,960
and so because of that i would be

2168
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:42,719
honored to do more of these with you and

2169
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,239
hoping that maybe instead of me saying

2170
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,399
it over and over again they can just go

2171
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:47,678
to the episode and watch from different

2172
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:49,920
people and what i've also learned from

2173
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:51,759
jiu jitsu is that just because one black

2174
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,279
belt told me doesn't mean i don't want

2175
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:55,198
to hear it from a dozen others that

2176
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:57,359
might describe it differently and help

2177
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:59,678
my brain understand and fully connect it

2178
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:01,520
and internalize it so

2179
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:04,079
for whatever reason your viewers really

2180
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:06,560
like the way your style of answering and

2181
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:08,719
asking questions and our growers like

2182
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,319
what i do but we're different and so

2183
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,520
combining our efforts i think reaches

2184
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:15,120
more people and i'd love to do it um ipm

2185
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,560
could be a whole episode

2186
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:19,198
we could really go down the rabbit hole

2187
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,719
soil testing all this but from today

2188
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:23,358
what i want people to get from it is

2189
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:24,798
that soil building if following some

2190
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,319
good principles doesn't have to be

2191
01:09:24,798 --> 01:09:28,079
rocket science and they should they

2192
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,080
should absolutely even if you don't stop

2193
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:32,000
what you're doing add one new thing and

2194
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:34,000
make some soil from scratch get your own

2195
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,238
hands in there i think you'll never go

2196
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,759
back if you try it well said

2197
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,358
so wrapping things up how can the

2198
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:41,198
listeners find you and what do you have

2199
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:43,359
acquiring in the future

2200
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:45,519
a good question build a soil.com is the

2201
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:47,359
best way to find us we also have a

2202
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,719
youtube at build a soil we have an

2203
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,400
instagram

2204
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,560
you can come down to the store anytime

2205
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:54,559
see our vegetable farm see our indoor

2206
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,400
grow here where we demonstrate all of

2207
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:59,039
it's very transparent we're in montrose

2208
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:00,559
colorado in western colorado

2209
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:02,158
beyond that

2210
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,520
as far as the future goes we have a

2211
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:05,519
number of things that we're working on

2212
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,159
right now um that we'll be sharing soon

2213
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,600
we've got a new powdered veg growing

2214
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:11,439
product that helps if you're in smaller

2215
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,640
containers helps if you need something

2216
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:14,559
for foliar

2217
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,960
so we'll be releasing that soon

2218
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,640
um otherwise most of what we're working

2219
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,640
on at build the soil is just quality

2220
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,920
control and scalability without giving

2221
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,840
up on that and that's just a lot of

2222
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,679
logistics and boring business stuff we

2223
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,159
could talk about all day but i'm more

2224
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:29,679
excited to talk about the soil stuff and

2225
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:31,519
as far as new

2226
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,760
a lot of it's just old school so nothing

2227
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:36,560
terribly new coming out just a repeat of

2228
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:39,039
the the mantra of the build a soil way

2229
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,719
of mimicking nature and using what works

2230
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:42,399
awesome like i mentioned the beginning

2231
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:44,719
of this episode i will have a link to

2232
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:46,158
jeremy's channel down in the description

2233

the comment section and let us know some

2238
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:58,479
organic methods that you do you know

2239
01:10:56,158 --> 01:11:00,000
whether it be building soil or feedings

2240
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:01,839
so on and so forth love to hear about

2241
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,079
that in the comments because there are

2242
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,600
so many different ways to do this and

2243
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:07,760
sharing those best practices within the

2244
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,199
comments i think can be value added for

2245
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,360
