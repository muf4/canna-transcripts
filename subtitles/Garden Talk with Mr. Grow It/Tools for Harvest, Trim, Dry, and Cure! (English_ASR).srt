1
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,039
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,279
know me my name is chris

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,039
aka mr groat and i'm back with another

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,558
video had a couple people reach out to

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,758
me recently they're either in the

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,919
harvesting process

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,278
drying process trimming process or

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,960
curing process

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,879
and they didn't have the tools needed to

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,359
do the job so in this video i figured i

11
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,960
would

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,400
show you some of the tools i use right

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,760
here you can see all the tools that i

14
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,278
have actually i don't know if the camera

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,720
is cutting that off or not but i have a

16
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:31,759
lot of the tools needed for the

17
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,000
processes

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,840
laid out right here and we'll go over

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,439
them in this episode but before we get

20
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,239

right hand corner of the screen

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,079
and i'll also provide this information

38
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,319
down in the description section below

39
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,359
all right so getting into it one of the

40
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,319
first things

41
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,159
to look at is harvesting or pre-harvest

42
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,199
actually before you harvest the plant

43
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,719
some people use a tool to check

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,920
the color of the plant now of course

45
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,640
this is going to depend on which plant

46
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,320
you're growing

47
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,000
there are some plants that have resin

48
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,599
glands that have different colors

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,359
and they need a microscope in order to

50
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,519
look at the color of those resin glands

51
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,359
now fortunately these days

52
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,640
this will do it it's a smartphone this

53
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,400
is the pixel 5

54
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,399
smartphone all you have to do really is

55
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,478
take a picture of the plant close up

56
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,519
then zoom into that picture and you're

57
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,438
actually able to see

58
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,560
the colors of the resin glass a lot of

59
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,158
people don't know about that

60
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,240
a lot of people instead what they'll do

61
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,320
is they will buy something such as a

62
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,759
microscope so this one right here is

63
00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:00,319
a jeweler's loop actually and it is

64
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,118
led so there is an led button on there

65
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,279
there's two

66
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,118
different i think it's a 10x and a 30x i

67
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,519
believe for this one

68
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,439
but the led light comes on and then you

69
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,758
basically just kind of hold it towards

70
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,280
the

71
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,839
the plant and then you gotta kind of

72
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,759
look in and get a view on it now

73
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,239
unfortunately with this type of

74
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,359
tool if you have a shaky hand it's not

75
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,719
gonna be ideal

76
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,000
i've had had people reach out to me in

77
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,840
the past that say their hand is too

78
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,360
shaky and they can't get a clear view

79
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,280
so if your hand is shaky you might not

80
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,840
want one of these a side note on this

81
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,598
this is also used to inspect plants for

82
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,280
pests for example really good tool

83
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,199
for that so this is a jeweler's loop

84
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,719
there's several different brands this

85
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,799
one is by happy hydro

86
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,239
there's this one right here this one is

87
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,040
by vivosun

88
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,480
so kind of very similar kind of pulls

89
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,239
out like this looks like the

90
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,039
led automatically goes in there i have a

91
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,039
30x 60x and a 90x on

92
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,400
this one by the way i'll link all the

93
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,919
tools that i show

94
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,599
in this video down in the description

95
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,439
section below so you can easily click on

96
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,280
that to get to it but again for this one

97
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,639
if you have a shaky hand it might not be

98
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,120
ideal you might not be able to get that

99
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,359
clear

100
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,519
view so this one right here is another

101
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,920
alternative this is the one that i

102
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,640
personally like to use when i am using a

103
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,559
microscope

104
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,559
and this one is really meant more for to

105
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,360
be placed onto a table right so a flat

106
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,360
surface

107
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,640
place it right down you get that clear

108
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,920
steady view

109
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,919
i believe this one is a 30 to 60 x

110
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,119
if i'm not mistaken and you can kind of

111
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,919
adjust it here

112
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,039
there is a button for led as well so you

113
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,798
need a clear view

114
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,239
but basically you'd be snipping off a

115
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,319
piece of the plant

116
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,519
placing onto a table and then placing

117
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,000
the microscope over

118
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,439
it and then adjusting that way now

119
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,878
downside is of course you have to clip

120
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,120
off a piece of the plant

121
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,039
but again if you have shaky hands the

122
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,039
other options aren't there for you

123
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,158
this is an alternative one other thing

124
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,639
if you do have a smartphone

125
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,399
you could get a happy hydro nug shot

126
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,759
this one has a few different lenses

127
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,158
uh alone it is the macro lens underneath

128
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,719
that

129
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,280
this is the wide angle lens and then

130
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,359
you've got

131
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,598
the fisheye lens again you're going to

132
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,439
need a steady view for this

133
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,119
so if you do clip this onto your

134
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,318
smartphone you may actually want to put

135
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,080
your phone onto a

136
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,359
tripod and then you'll be able to get a

137
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,640
steady clear view

138
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,400
on that one so that's pretty much

139
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,919
pre-harvest then we actually get into

140
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,560
harvesting the plant cutting down the

141
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,560
plant

142
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,720
the main tool i use for that are garden

143
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,238
shears these ones are by vivosun

144
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,160
and they're pretty good real if you have

145
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,638
a real thick stock you need to cut

146
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,560
through

147
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,840
these ones will get right through it i

148
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,560
actually use these

149
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,879
shears for i have palm trees outside

150
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,360
that

151
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,918
are a small height and i am able to cut

152
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,840
through

153
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,839
the palm tree leaves and so i get

154
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,719
multiple uses out of that it's not just

155
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,239
growing my indoor plants i also can trim

156
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,600
out to our plants with this so i did

157
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
actually have a cheap chinese brand of

158
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,759
this

159
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,000
it was like a red handle i forget the

160
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,720
name brand on it it was like 11 bucks on

161
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,279
amazon

162
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,639
it did actually malfunction it it ended

163
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,478
up breaking in this area

164
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,960
so i had to throw those away these ones

165
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,599
i've had for uh let's see a year and a

166
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,198
half now

167
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,560
and they've been working pretty good so

168
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,000
no complaints there the other

169
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,199
alternative to cutting down your plant a

170
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
lot of people will use

171
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,400
just regular trimmers these spring

172
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,639
loaded trimmers

173
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,599
one is by hydro farm so these will work

174
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,280
if you have real thick

175
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,280
stock though you're gonna have to you

176
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,119
know spend some muscle

177
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,799
working on to get in through there and

178
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,000
then some stocks might be so thick that

179
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,160
you can't even get through it

180
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,519
with these so i don't use these anymore

181
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,880
to harvest i mean if you're cutting

182
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,079
individual branches

183
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,519
you could probably get through them a

184
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,038
lot easier but yeah if you're trying to

185
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,198
cut that main stock

186
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,519
it can be very difficult so that's why i

187
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,560
recommend the shears over these ones but

188
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,000
there are so many different companies

189
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,639
that make these spring loaded ones i

190
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,439
have one by

191
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,759
hydro farm vivosun they have one they're

192
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,800
all

193
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,479
pretty much the same happy hydro these

194
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,680
ones i like the color on these ones i

195
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,800
believe happy hydro

196
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,639
now has a titanium blade

197
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,319
so it's supposed to help with either

198
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,120
cleaning it i believe is easier

199
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,719
or less gunk up if you have a plant that

200
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,399
kind of gunks up your trimmers

201
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,240
maybe less chances with the titanium

202
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,279
blade so that's an option

203
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,879
they actually these ones are the

204
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,159
titanium blade i can see right here

205
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,879
those three that i just showed you are

206
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,280
straight tip

207
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,360
i also have these ac infinity ones which

208
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,799
i've even taken out here i just got

209
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
these so i can't really tell you the

210
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
quality they look great

211
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,600
seem pretty standard i'm not sure how

212
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,519
the blade holds up on these but these

213
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
are new you see infiniti is one of those

214
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,959
up-and-coming companies that

215
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,800
produce real quality products so i'm

216
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,918
excited to use those for the first time

217
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,720
all the ones i just showed you are

218
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,959
straight tip

219
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,560
trimmers they do have i'm not sure if

220
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,359
you can see this real well this is a

221
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,120
curved tip

222
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,038
trimmer this is by happy hydro so you

223
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,639
can kind of get in you know on some

224
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,279
flowers that you're trimming

225
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,079
kind of having this curved tip can be

226
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,679
beneficial

227
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,959
so sometimes i'll use these but for the

228
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,879
most part i'm just using the straight

229
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,120
tip ones now one downside to all the

230
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,478
spring loaded ones i just showed you is

231
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,560
you know if you're trimming for several

232
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,478
hours it can

233
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,519
cause strain on your hand unfortunately

234
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,038
now it's good that when you're releasing

235
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,318
it's less stress there but when you're

236
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:52,959
pushing in there's definitely some

237
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,639
strain

238
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,478
i personally have kind of shied away

239
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,079
from these in recent harvests

240
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,839
actually not recent for the past couple

241
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,279
years or so i really

242
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,959
go towards these ones right here these

243
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,279
are by happy hydro there's no spring on

244
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,598
them

245
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,598
there's really a lot less strain in my

246
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,120
opinion than the spring loaded ones so

247
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,519
that's another option for you when

248
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,478
you're trimming i like to use gloves

249
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,879
these are just

250
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,800
standard gloves these are by vivo sun i

251
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,560
don't think they even make these anymore

252
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,360
but there are some that are very very

253
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,439
similar

254
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,960
on amazon these ones i can use harvest

255
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,000
have to harvest i know there are some

256
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,000
people out there that prefer the

257
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
disposable ones those are like the latex

258
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,680
disposable gloves that way once you're

259
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,560
done trimming you just throw them away

260
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
and then you get a new

261
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,038
pair but i personally like to reuse

262
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,800
where i can and so these ones have been

263
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,318
pretty good over the last few harvests

264
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,680
getting into drying there are several

265
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,639
different dry environments that you can

266
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,439
use there are

267
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,800
now tints specifically for drying with

268
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,560
drying racks built in

269
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,478
some people just use their grow tent

270
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,199
some people will use their bathroom some

271
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,680
people use

272
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,360
cardboard boxes to dry and they'll

273
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,639
basically just hang them on coat hangers

274
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,680
for example they'll just

275
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,680
either clip them on to a coat hanger or

276
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,720
yeah whatever they can think of a string

277
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,079
across the box

278
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,639
and then hanging on the string so there

279
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,680
are creative ways that you can create a

280
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,519
dry environment

281
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,879
a drying rack is something that folks

282
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,399
often use i don't have one here to show

283
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,800
you but i'll put one on the screen right

284
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,638
now

285
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,319
this one is by happy hydro and i believe

286
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,960
these come in several different

287
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,639
layers now the downside with these racks

288
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,359
from my experience i have used them in

289
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,400
the past

290
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,160
is that some flowers you know it can

291
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,560
kind of sink in if you keep them on one

292
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,280
side

293
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,160
so rotating them has been kind of

294
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,239
beneficial

295
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,158
for me at least in the past so drying

296
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,000
rack is an alternative compared to just

297
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,599
hanging them on coat hangers for example

298
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,799
oftentimes a dry environment needs to be

299
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
controlled

300
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,079
humidity wise i personally live in a

301
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,640
very dry climate so

302
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,320
i will use a humidifier i'm not sure if

303
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,600
you can see that humidifier right there

304
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,959
yep you should be able to

305
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,920
that's the humidifier i've been using

306
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,319
for the past six months i think eight

307
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,000
months

308
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,519
it's a smart humidifier and that one is

309
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,519
actually app controlled as well

310
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,278
so you know you download an app on your

311
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,839
phone you can turn it on off

312
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,120
you can adjust the humidity percent set

313
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,200
point through the app

314
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,799
it'll tell you when the water is out and

315
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,839
needs to be refilled it'll tell you when

316
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,278
it needs to be cleaned

317
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,959
so i'm actually really loving that

318
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,879
humidifier i bought three of those

319
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,000
for my grow tents and lung room and then

320
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,439
i take it and i use it in my dry

321
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,958
environment as well there are so many

322
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
different humidifiers out there that's

323
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,599
just the one that i

324
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,919
use now on the flip side if your

325
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,080
environment is too humid and you need to

326
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,599
reduce the humidity a dehumidifier

327
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
would be what you use for that again i

328
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,278
live in a very dry climate i've actually

329
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,959
never needed to use a dehumidifier but

330
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:29,838
i'll link one down in the description

331
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,278
section below for you

332
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,040
in the bottom of the dry environment i

333
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,399
like to put an oscillating fan this is a

334
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,719
small eight inch one

335
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,159
just put it on the ground and let it

336
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,600
blow back and forth that way there's

337
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,319
some air movement within the dry

338
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,800
environment

339
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,480
now there's this one also a clip on

340
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,319
option that clips on directly to the

341
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,039
side of a grow tent for example the pole

342
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,480
of a grow tent

343
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,000
i'll link that one down below as well

344
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,680
and then monitoring the temperature and

345
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
humidity in your dry environment

346
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,039
there's several different temperature

347
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,160
humidity monitors out there this one's

348
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,399
an accurite cheap

349
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,278
i think this was like 10 bucks 11 bucks

350
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
on amazon

351
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,399
it's going to tell you the temperature

352
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,600
humidity

353
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,000
and then the high and low values for the

354
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,240
past

355
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,759
36 hours if i remember correctly the

356
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,519
downside to this is if you have this in

357
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,200
your dry environment you need to open up

358
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,639
the environment in order to see

359
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,640
what the levels are at so it could

360
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,000
disturb your environment for example i'm

361
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,838
in the dry climate when i have a

362
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,519
humidifier in there raises it up when i

363
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,240
open up my dry environment well that

364
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,240
escapes

365
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,839
it lowers the humidity so then closing

366
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,278
it back up and needs to raise back up so

367
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,959
there's a little bit disturbance in the

368
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,919
humidity now is that going to ruin your

369
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,399
flowers

370
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,159
probably not right but still there is an

371
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,559
alternative option which is what i use

372
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,000
is the sensorpush wireless temperature

373
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,838
humidity monitor so

374
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
this is actually going to do temperature

375
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,279
humidity vpd

376
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,720
and it actually does dew point as well

377
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:46,480
so i use this in my garden

378
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,000
while my plants are growing and then

379
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,759
also transfer it over to my dry

380
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,240
environment and monitor the temperature

381
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,078
humidity in my dry environment with this

382
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,240
this is just bluetooth but there is a

383
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,759
wi-fi adapter that you can connect to so

384
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,720
you can see the temperature humidity

385
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,919
wherever you are

386
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,920
and this hooks up directly to your

387
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,958
smartphone so there is an app that you

388
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,000
download

389
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,199
and it gives you historical data as well

390
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,799
so you can see what the temperature

391
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,040
anemity was kind of

392
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,639
a line graph up and down up and down for

393
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,879
the past hour for the past

394
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,480
day the past week for the past month and

395
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,559
you can do certain set points

396
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,159
it'll give you alerts notifications so

397
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,599
if your humidity is too low

398
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,278
you'll get an alert on your smartphone

399
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,560
that you need to take action same thing

400
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,399
humidity is too high

401
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,000
you get alerted and you would be able to

402
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,360
take action from there also has set

403
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,600
points for the temperature

404
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,720
vpd dew point so on and so forth so i

405
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,680
really like this i've been using this

406
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,759
for

407
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,120
four years now roughly there are other

408
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,078
monitors on the market

409
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,519
like this pulse has a monitor i do have

410
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:42,000
the pulse monitor as well i've been

411
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,839
trying it

412
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,759
out for the past several months now i do

413
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,120
actually prefer the sensor push over the

414
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,600
regular pulse monitor though

415
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,039
mostly due to the actual app just

416
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,120
working better in my opinion

417
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,439
all right on to curing so you get your

418
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,519
standard mason jar here for curing a lot

419
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,600
of people use this i still use a

420
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,799
glass mason jar for curing as long as

421
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,959
it's air tight

422
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,399
sealed that's a good curing container

423
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,638
this is a 32 ounce

424
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,320
wide mouth wide mouth specifically so

425
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,560
you can stick your hand in there

426
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,720
this is going to hold about an ounce of

427
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,199
flowers it depends on the density of the

428
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,600
flowers right so if you have real dense

429
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,278
flowers for example it could look like

430
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,720
it's about three-fourths full maybe even

431
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:21,120
a little bit less than that if you have

432
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,560
more

433
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,078
airier flowers less dense stuff it could

434
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,359
actually fill this up to the top

435
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,199
you might potentially even need another

436
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,519
container but a lot of people use these

437
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,278
with success the alternative to that

438
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,078
there's so many different alternatives

439
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,720
to this

440
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,000
as far as curing containers one that i

441
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,079
use in particular is

442
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,919
the c volt so i got the c volt right

443
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,559
here these things are

444
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,360
kind of clipped down air tight seal all

445
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,799
across

446
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,639
now one thing i really like about these

447
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,039
is if you have a lot

448
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,680
right so i believe this size right here

449
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,159
is gonna

450
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,199
be able to easily store three to four

451
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,639
ounces of flowers

452
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,879
like i mentioned the glass containers

453
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,200
are gonna do one ounce each

454
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,039
roughly in the curing process oftentimes

455
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,639
you're doing a burping process so you're

456
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,120
removing the containers shaking it

457
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,720
around

458
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,320
some people do it multiple times a day

459
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,519
some people do it once a day so on and

460
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,760
so forth but

461
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,039
if you have multiple ounces with the

462
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,078
glass jars you're gonna have to open up

463
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,000
multiple jars

464
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,679
and it's a little bit of a process here

465
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,399
if you put three four ounces in one

466
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,838
container

467
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,759
it's a much quicker process you're just

468
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,880
doing one burp so when i harvest a whole

469
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,799
plant for example

470
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,639
usually i get three to four ounces of

471
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,240
flowers per plant it'll just go in one

472
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,200
container and then there's just one burp

473
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,039
that happens

474
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,440
uh you know however many times a day it

475
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,599
needs to happen now in these containers

476
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,959
having some sort of monitor in there is

477
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,320
beneficial there are a couple different

478
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,919
ones i used to use

479
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,519
these ones right here you can get them

480
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,599
super cheap on

481
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,360
ebay i think they're like two bucks a

482
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,720
piece less than that on ebay depending

483
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,560
on the quantity you buy

484
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,720
they're also on amazon as well now

485
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,000
there's some accuracy issues with some

486
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,399
of them that i've received

487
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,519
believe you can actually calibrate them

488
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,679
but i'm not 100

489
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,639
sure i can't say that i fully recommend

490
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,399
this one but

491
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,680
there are digital ones this one's not on

492
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,078
right now it needs batteries the

493
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,239
batteries it takes is the lr-44s

494
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,439
two of them need to get the replaced but

495
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,278
it would be a digital

496
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,959
hygrometer and you're able to see what

497
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:11,679
the humidity is and also i believe in

498
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,119
the bottom corners

499
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,879
the temperature as well and then you

500
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,560
simply place them in the jar or

501
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,838
container that you're using to cure and

502
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,679
then you'll be able to monitor

503
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,880
