76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,200
have a great talk today you're so much

77
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,719
into permaculture regenerative gardening

78
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,000
just organic all natural this time

79
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,598
around we're going to talk about Clos

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,878
Loop farming Clos Loop gardening clo

81
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,919
Loop operations whatever you want to

82
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:06,518
call it but Clos loop system this is

83
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,958
something that really interests me I

84
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,599
think it interests a lot of people

85
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,680
because it saves people money and we're

86
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,079
going to get into the nitty-gritty

87
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,159
details on it but first could you do an

88
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,719
introduction for those folks that didn't

cultivation and I have since kind of um

99
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:51,639
grown with that career but really

100
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,239
focused recently more recently on just

101
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:57,559
like educating homeg Growers um I love

102

writing that's probably my favorite form

107
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,878
of education is just reading writing and

108
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,160
of course being out in the gardener

109
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:18,399
garden and actually you know just doing

110
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,840
it getting your hands dirty being in the

111
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:25,120
sun um so I have learned so much since

112
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,758
we last spoke so I'm really excited to

113
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,399
talk again because every opportunity

114
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,600
every Garden every day is a chance CH to

115
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,918
learn more and I feel like my life is

116
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,840
just one long quest to learn as much as

117
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:40,879
I possibly can about honestly everything

118
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,560
I I question everything so um I can't

119
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,038
wait to you know share some more with

120
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,160
your guests and you awesome well like I

121
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:48,918
mentioned earlier it's been two years

122
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,520
since we last talked and I remember

123
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:53,038
those conversations where the knowledge

124
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,359
of you just have such deep knowledge on

125
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:56,079
so many different things that are

126
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,720
beneficial for gardeners and you had

127
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,439
mentioned you learned so much since I

128
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,000
just can't wait to dive into this there

129
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,560
something folks that are listening and

130
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,639
that don't know what a Clos loop system

131
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,478
is or what Clos Loop farming is can you

132
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,038
explain that to us yeah definitely

133
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,959
so if you just break down the word what

134
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:17,639
it is in itself right closed loop so you

135
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,560
are closing a loop that's a circle right

136
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,280
on your farm or your garden or your home

137
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,600
so that you're taking something that

138
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:27,918
would otherwise be a waste and turning

139
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,000
it into an input instead of having these

140
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:34,399
external sources to create like

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,360
fertilizers um or IPM tools you're able

142
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:41,079
to create that Loop within your garden

143
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,199
by um utilizing like multiple species

144
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:47,159
basically um and waste products so right

145
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:50,720
now like I mean first I have to say I

146
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,600
was raised Mormon so we were very like

147
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,319
self-sufficient you know have a year

148
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,840
supply of food and so it was kind of

149
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,960
ingrained in my like upbringing to be

150
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,599
resilient that kind of like pioneer

151
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:06,839
mindset and so I've always been deeply

152
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:10,039
interested in how I can um do things for

153
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:12,638
myself make my own products but as we

154
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,719
see the world coming into this kind of

155
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,400
um you know existential crisis or

156
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,080
whatever you want to call it inflation

157
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,359
we see more people trying to save money

158
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,318
trying to do things healthier because we

159
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,199
we have no idea what's in these products

160
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,120
that we're using we're feeding ourselves

161
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,160
we're consuming um and we come to find

162
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,120
out a lot of it is really bad for us so

163
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,840
being able to have that power of hey I

164
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,680
created this for myself for my plant I

165
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:42,038
grew it I consumed it and it gives you

166
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,400
the control um it's

167
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:47,639
definitely more labor intensive than

168
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,679
just going and buying something but for

169
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,478
those crazy enough to you want to just

170
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,199
do it all um it's very rewarding and

171
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:58,240
it's something that I'm trying to put

172
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,199
into place more and more in my garden um

173
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,120
so last we spoke

174
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,800
I was in California um completely

175
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,439
different farm and since then I have you

176
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,800
know I have a four-year-old son and we

177
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,719
moved back up to North Eastern

178
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,439
Washington on the Idaho border my whole

179
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,039
family is in Idaho but you know Idaho is

180
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:21,000
not so friendly with the kind of plants

181
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:25,519
that we like um so I'm right here on the

182
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,279
border and um it's a completely a new

183
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,719
Garden I built in May and so I have 12

184
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,758
acres I'm overlooking a little creek

185
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,120
that meanders through um I mean there's

186
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:40,680
tons of wildlife all different types of

187
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,680
species and I'm starting to build this

188
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,478
Homestead where I can try to create as

189
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,598
much of my own inputs for my garden and

190
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,719
for my family as possible so that means

191
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,478
um closing the loops wherever I can I

192
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,280
don't like I mean we're like 30 minutes

193
00:07:53,478 --> 00:08:02,279
from going into town um so for instance

194
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:05,318
a great example I have chickens right so

195
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:07,318
the chickens are helping compost their

196
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,840
Freer R well they were free ranging

197
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,560
before the puppy started killing them um

198
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:17,038
and you take you know all of your waste

199
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,478
your leaves from defoliation your weeds

200
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,519
uh you know from the ground um anything

201
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,519
that you're clearing any biomass any

202
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:27,240
plant matter you're composting it your

203
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,719
waste from your kitchen um and the

204
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,840
chickens are going through and eating

205
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,000
what they like scratching out getting

206
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,718
the you know maggots that are growing in

207
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,120
there worms are crawling through and

208
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,919
it's breaking it down right there in

209
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,719
your ecosystem and then you can turn

210
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,159
that compost into you know well it is

211
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,760
compost but you could do a compost

212
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:49,120
irrated tea or an extract and you can

213
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,399
apply that in your

214
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,679
garden um or for instance I have cherry

215
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:59,519
trees and pear trees and apple trees you

216
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:01,078
can make ferments or you can eat it um

217
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,560
uh but with the excess you know so it's

218
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:05,479
just like taking what you have and being

219
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:07,759
able to turn that into something else

220
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,680
not letting that it stop so there you

221
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:13,319
have that full circle that Loop got it

222
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,958
that makes sense I think kind of taking

223
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,519
a step back and trying to think about

224
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,799
what would probably be the most

225
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,120
difficult thing to manage when it comes

226
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,199
to a Clos system me looking in I'm

227
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,159
trying to figure out okay how would you

228
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,640
feed the plants right what are some ways

229
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:29,919
that plants can receive the required

230
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:31,120
nutrition through a closed loop system

231
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,120
and I know you mentioned a couple things

232
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,959
already but maybe kind of dive into

233
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,679
details on some of those things yeah

234
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:44,000
definitely so I mentioned ferments which

235
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:46,399
I'm not a huge fermentor I'm not I did a

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,120
class last year with Chris Trump on k&amp;f

237
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,039
stuff and I God bless you know the kfer

238
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,480
that is just not something that I that's

239
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,958
totally a option to go for your closed

240
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,519
loop system that's not me I am a

241
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:03,000
composter I love love the diversity the

242
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,519
microbial diversity of compost so when

243
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,639
you are making a ferment you're focusing

244
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,240
on a set of um microbial life and it's

245
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,399
going to do its thing but with compost

246
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,600
it's kind

247
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,919
of um a symphony and Orchestra you don't

248
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,079
know exactly everything that you're

249
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,879
going to get but it's beautiful um you

250
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:25,319
can check it out on the microscope and

251
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,120
you have different molecules of carbon

252
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,680
um

253
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,839
structured there's like no it's like a

254
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:35,638
snowflake you know there's no two of the

255
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,480
same one so you're getting um just so

256
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,240
much diversity and not only in that

257
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,278
microbial life but in the carbon

258
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,240
molecules themselves and what types of

259
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,039
nutrients you can provide to your plant

260
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,440
so the more diversity that you put into

261
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:50,759
your compost system um the more nutrient

262
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,959
diversity you can provide to your plant

263
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:56,799
now you can do targeted composts if you

264
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,719
you know you're interested in that kind

265
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,519
of a thing so with like um there's

266
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,240
databases online right where you can

267
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,720
look at the NPK ratios of every plant

268
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,159
almost like you can go look up uh for

269
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,079
instance I use a lot of barley in my

270
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:16,399
garden that is like super high in

271
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:19,199
phosphorus and so I'm growing barley

272
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,039
this next year I bought like bulk barley

273
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,720
from the you can get it at your beer

274
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,799
your local beer supply store so I bought

275
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,879
the malted barley this year but next

276
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,759
year my plan is to grow it myself cuz

277
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,399
that's a again that's part of the

278
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:35,919
closing that Loop and that cycle so

279
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:38,440
barley is really high in

280
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,120
phosphorus so you can either you can

281
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,399
compost that you can add it directly

282
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,440
into your soil um I like to make teas

283
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:49,639
out of it and so not only does it

284
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,920
contain high amounts of phosphorus but

285
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:56,200
it also contains the enzyme phosphatases

286
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:59,000
and so phosphatases is and I think this

287
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,278
is important to back up that um enzymes

288
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,720
are are complex chains of amino acids

289
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:06,799
and they are responsible for Catal like

290
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,079
catalyzing chemical reactions so that

291
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:12,039
the organic nutrients um that we are all

292
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,278
using in our Gardens can actually break

293
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:18,319
down and become available to the plant

294
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:20,958
and so uh like bacteria and fungi they

295
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,519
produce enzymes but enzymes are all over

296
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,239
the world they're in a lot of seeds and

297
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,320
so that's what barley is right it's a

298
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,799
seed the the barley grain itself so it's

299
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,240
packed full of enzy enes that contain

300
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:35,719
the specific direction to break down the

301
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,720
phosphorus to become available to the

302
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,360
plant it's like this amazing thing and

303
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,399
that's why you don't have to feed your

304
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,240
your seedlings right away right like

305
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,919
that first week you don't they don't

306
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,600
need nutrition because that seed is full

307
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:51,799
of all of the enzymes and nutrients that

308
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,320
make that available to the plant so by

309
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:56,639
growing things that you I mean obviously

310
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,920
this is complex and you have to have

311
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,039
like knowledge about what you're doing

312
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:04,479
to ensure that your plant is getting

313
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:06,240
sufficient amounts of NPK because if

314
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,920
you're just creating a compost with all

315
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,759
of your kitchen scraps and then hoping

316
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,360
that you put that on your plant and it's

317
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,039
going to provide it with everything it

318
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,320
needs you'll you'll probably be sorely

319
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:20,719
disappointed right um so knowing what

320
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,920
you're putting into your compost or what

321
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,959
it what it contains is really going to

322
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,439
help you uh ensure that you're feeding

323
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:30,479
your plant the proper nutrition that it

324
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:34,079
requires um you can do this this by

325
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,360
simple soil testing um I did a podcast

326
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,239
episode with the soil doctor and he has

327
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,360
like a tool um Bryant I think his name

328
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,879
is um on his website soild

329
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,639
consulting.com and you can enter your

330
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,078
soil testing results and he will give

331
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,799
you a customized reads because you know

332
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:56,159
not all of us are agronomists and can

333
00:13:51,799 --> 00:14:00,039
read these um s the data that's provided

334
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:02,278
but really having that Baseline to

335
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,120
make adjustments and create nutrients

336
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:07,039
for your plant is really what's going to

337
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,480
help you because we don't know I mean

338
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,799
what are what is everyone eating you

339
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,879
know we don't know what you're putting

340
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:13,359
into your compost is it going to be just

341
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,838
like a bunch of nitrogen is it going to

342
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,199
be what is it going to have everything

343
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,680
that's required so the great thing about

344
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,399
compost though and I think that this is

345
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:25,039
the beginner introduction for everyone I

346
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,519
think we talked about this in the one of

347
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,599
our previous episode like everyone

348
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:32,000
should compost and that is the beginning

349
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,240
of clo the loop because all of us create

350
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,519
waste so that should just be like a

351
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,240
baseline of something that we are doing

352
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,720
that we can provide nutrition for our

353
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,799
plant but that's not going to be enough

354
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,278
um to provide a well-rounded like if you

355
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:50,439
were just talking I'm in the middle of

356
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:52,439
harvesting my croptober and I would not

357
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,079
get the plants the beautiful buds that I

358
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,480
got if I just fed them compost right and

359
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:01,879
if anyone has composted they know that

360
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,480
uh three by 3x 3ft pile turns into

361
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:06,679
nothing after you know a few months of

362
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,759
turning it it it degrades and it gets so

363
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:12,319
small but the amazing thing about

364
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:14,079
compost is that all of the bacteria and

365
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,920
the enzymes the carbohydrates that are

366
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:19,278
in there you can make like I said a tea

367
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,838
where you're just um bubbling it with

368
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,720
airstones and you can extract some of

369
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,560
those that microbial life and the

370
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,800
nutrition and you can spray it across a

371
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,479
much bigger area than if you just had

372
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:35,879
that compost so then you're kickstarting

373
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,759
the biology in soil that maybe well

374
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,439
probably is pretty devoid of life cuz

375
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,159
most people that are listening to this

376
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,120
are going to be living in you know

377
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:46,600
Suburban sprawls where the top soil has

378
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,600
been scraped away which the top six

379
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,959
inches of soil is where most of our

380
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,278
microbes live um and so we just have

381
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:56,879
that base rock that base parent material

382
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:59,360
of soil which isn't quite soil yet it's

383
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,600
the beginning it's the minerals by

384
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,720
adding the carbohydrates and the

385
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,480
bacteria and the fungi protozoa

386
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,680
nematodes all of that microbial life

387
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,240
from the compost and then more food

388
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,599
source we can break down we can use

389
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,959
those enzymes to make the minerals

390
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,040
available to our plant so it's I mean

391
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:23,518
it's just the way the world works you

392
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:26,240
know this is how soil is made um and how

393
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,919
we can feed our plants with it is just

394
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,519
you know taking a little bit of time to

395
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,799
to understand how the world Works how

396
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,560
ecology works and so we talked about you

397
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:37,000
know previously what is ecological

398
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:38,838
gardening and we're going to talk about

399
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,399
that and I think this if you don't mind

400
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:45,120
I can just kind of segue into it yeah

401
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:48,600
absolutely so ecological gardening to me

402
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,360
is taking that step back and remembering

403
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,079
that we are nature that we are all a

404
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,318
part of this beautiful uh system of life

405
00:16:55,078 --> 00:17:01,159
that maybe um we can pretend like we

406
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:04,798
know and we're manipulating microbes to

407
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:07,318
work for us but in reality 99% of our

408
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:10,519
DNA is microbial DNA we are more

409
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:13,159
microbes than we are human and so it's

410
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:15,639
already happening around us and being an

411
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,839
ecological Gardener is taking that step

412
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,079
and understanding we're working with

413
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:23,399
nature we're working with an ecosystem

414
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:27,359
we are part of an ecosystem so how can

415
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,120
we um make observations to see how it

416
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,639
works and how to I don't want to

417
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:37,639
manipulate but you know uh work with in

418
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:39,520
harmony syn with ecology so for instance

419
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:44,360
um you know I've talked about this

420
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:48,400
compost tea so a compost tea versus uh

421
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:50,639
an extract for instance is when where

422
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,320
you take compost and you would put it in

423
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,160
like a paint strainer and you put it in

424
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,839
a five gallon bucket with some airstones

425
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,000
and you bubble it now let's bubble it

426
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:03,599
for 4 hours look at it under a

427
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,119
microscope look bubble it for 12 hours

428
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,079
look at it under a microscope what's

429
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,158
happening each time well if you know a

430
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:13,399
little bit about ecology you would

431
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:16,559
understand that every ecosystem has a

432
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,360
population according to the resources

433
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,639
there that are available and this is

434
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,439
called a carrying capacity so every

435
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,080
species has a carrying capacity and when

436
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,960
you take a bunch of diversity of

437
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,319
microbes from that compost and you put

438
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,400
it into a tea

439
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:33,678
that first 4our Mark we look at it under

440
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,038
a microscope we're going to see a lot of

441
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,240
diversity um typically in these te's

442
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:40,279
we're giving it a food source which is

443
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,159
like a molasses or a sugar or some kind

444
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:45,599
of carbohydrate for them to feed off of

445
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:49,760
and the further we get along we're going

446
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:53,240
to see less diversity but more

447
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:55,119
population count so um the stronger the

448
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,839
ones that thrive in that particular

449
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:01,038
environment are going to explode but

450
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:03,480
only to a certain point because every

451
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,200
ecosystem has a carrying capacity so if

452
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,640
you get past a point where there's no

453
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,480
more resources then that population

454
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,240
dwindles and it it dies off and so

455
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,759
looking at your garden as a way of how

456
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,480
can I provide the resources to attract

457
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,279
the species that I want that are going

458
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,120
to provide my plant with let's say uh

459
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:26,440
integrated Pest Management they're going

460
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:28,959
to have that's parasitic was lace swings

461
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,279
ladybugs um well what are are they

462
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,880
attracted to do I have enough of those

463
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:36,798
resources to support that ecosystem that

464
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,360
population in my ecosystem or am I

465
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:41,240
focusing completely on growing my

466
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:45,079
medicinal plant and wiping out all of

467
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:48,120
the Native species and not having this

468
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:50,038
diversity and so ecological gardening is

469
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,038
taking a step back and kind of looking

470
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:54,319
at your garden through the lens of an

471
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:55,919
ecologist because we all are ecologists

472
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,798
whether we like it or not we're having

473
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,240
an effect on the ecosystem that we live

474
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:04,359
in because we're nature and it's

475
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,679
everywhere um so that's I'm super

476
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:09,199
passionate about I mean before getting

477
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,960
involved in Industry I worked for the

478
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,679
nature conservancy and endangered

479
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,120
species management and so this is my

480
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,960
perspective on the world and I think

481
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,000
it's important to remember that the most

482
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,360
important part of every Garden is you

483
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,200
like you as the individual you're the

484
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:26,959
one your outlook your the Glens that you

485
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,319
see life through is the way that you're

486
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,120
going to garden and so can tell you how

487
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:35,240
to garden and you can tell people how to

488
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:36,918
garden but the garden needs to be it's

489
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,558
it's a beautiful reflection of the

490
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,400
person who is doing it the gardener you

491
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,639
know that that's saying like the best

492
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,600
fertilizer is a gardener Shadow right

493
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,559
and it's it's true because being out

494
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:50,240
there and doing what you love cuz maybe

495
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,279
you don't like composting maybe you

496
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,880
don't want to deal with this so finding

497
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:57,200
things like okay maybe a worm bin is

498
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,039
more your style than pile you know a

499
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,880
3-ft pile of rotting decaying matters

500
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:06,400
turning that around um and maybe you

501
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,159
know bugs aren't your thing or whatever

502
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,559
it is or maybe they are like focus in on

503
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:14,799
the thing that you love the most and

504
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:18,558
have your garden reflect that but

505
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:21,200
remember that we are all nature we're

506
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,720
all in an ecosystem and so regardless of

507
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,080
whether you think you're ecologically

508
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,120
gardening you are if you're doing it

509
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:30,558
outside I mean I guess indoors you could

510
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,798
be like not necessarily an E I still

511
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,480
think you

512
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:37,679
are but there that's my long tangent

513
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,679
rant on it now super informative now in

514
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,919
regards to ecological gardening you know

515
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,278
one thing that comes to mind is kind of

516
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,880
the Native species and I remember a

517
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:46,200
couple months ago now actually it was

518
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,120
like six plus months ago is that some

519
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,319
random Fair locally here I live in the

520
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,918
desert they had a booth and there was a

521
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:54,599
gardening booth and they were giving out

522
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,919
free plants and stuff tobato plants and

523
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,158
stuff but they also had information and

524
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,759
seeds and I actually got some free seeds

525
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,320
it was just native species it was like

526
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,158
wild flowers I think I ended up getting

527
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:07,439
I haven't planted them yet I just moved

528
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,880
to a new house actually and uh I'm

529
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,159
trying to get my outdoor Garden going

530
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,840
but I eventually plan to plant some of

531
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,400
those native species cuz they're for

532
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,079
this climate right so um yeah I think

533
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,440
kind of keeping things in mind more

534
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,879
about what is native to your environment

535
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,400
learning about those species and then

536
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,400
adding them into your system is kind of

537
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,840
a step in the right direction and I do

538
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,679
want to go back to composting real quick

539
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,798
though you mentioned you prefer

540
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,000
composting now there are several types

541
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:38,278
of composting we did get into composting

542
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,640
in our last talk but it's been several

543
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:42,440
years right so things have changed what

544
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,520
type of composting are you doing these

545
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,200
days thermophilic are you vermac

546
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,200
composting bokashi composting like what

547
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,159
are you doing and what type of

548
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,919
information can you kind of give us to

549
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:55,600
get going on that Avenue definitely so I

550
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,799
think that this is a great opportunity

551
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,719
to save where the gardener is the most

552
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:02,558
important part of the puzzle and that is

553
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,600
the same for the composter because when

554
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:07,879
we talked before I was I don't even know

555
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,678
if I'd had my son yet or it was like

556
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,679
just having him and I was still you know

557
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,200
F brigh eyed and fresh-faced and after

558
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,080
four years of

559
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,919
Parenthood my style of gardening and

560
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:23,678
composting is definitely um not as

561
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:26,200
strict like I was doing like a three bin

562
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,120
method keeping things separate layering

563
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,880
it according to like height just being

564
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:34,719
like so nitpicky and OCD about my

565
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:38,960
compost and now I'm like I got a compost

566
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:41,360
Corner in my garden so I fill it with I

567
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,000
weed you know every a few days a week

568
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,278
and I fill up a five gallon bucket with

569
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,798
weeds I throw that in I throw it doesn't

570
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:52,038
get measured it's just a pile in the

571
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:56,200
corner of the garden I water it um I

572
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:59,400
turn it once you know every other week

573
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:02,080
probably if I'm lucky uh and so that's

574
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,640
where you the gardener like it's your

575
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,960
perspective it's your life it's what's

576
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:10,520
going on for you so there's no one right

577
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:14,759
way to do anything um I was doing a worm

578
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:18,519
bin I am not doing a worm bin now that's

579
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:22,798
just again Parenthood has just changed

580
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:25,558
everything um so composting is literally

581
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,200
just a pile it sometimes it gets hot but

582
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:29,678
it's not even getting that hot and I'm

583
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,558
really looking into John sue bioreactor

584
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:36,519
for my lazy composting so it's like a

585
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:38,839
combination of thermophilic and static

586
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:41,000
so like static is basically what I'm

587
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:43,119
doing except I'm doing a little bit more

588
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,240
static is like you set it and forget it

589
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,239
it's like what people have been doing

590
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,319
for tens of thousands of years you like

591
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,079
maybe dig a pit throw all your waste in

592
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,960
there and bury it that's what we're you

593
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:58,398
know like and so the Johnson Sue

594
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,360
bioreactor is where you put like a

595
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:04,719
palette down and then you um use like

596
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:07,359
hog wire or some kind of fencing that

597
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,919
you wrap around itself like a hog panel

598
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:12,319
um so that it be creates a a circle and

599
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,320
then you put that Circle of fencing on

600
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:19,759
top of the palette and you insert I

601
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:22,079
think six um plastic tubes like you

602
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,679
would use maybe for like a French drain

603
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,960
and you drill holes in it um and you

604
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,840
layer it

605
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:34,079
with uh decaying leaves and wood chips

606
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:37,879
and you have it filled to the top and

607
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:39,599
you put uh like a sprinkler head on top

608
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,399
or some kind of watering system so it

609
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:45,278
automates and you let it sit for a year

610
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:47,199
so thermophilic versus static static is

611
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:49,880
where you're just letting it sit in a

612
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,558
pile not touching it uh thermophilic

613
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:56,840
you're yeah adding oxygen water and um

614
00:25:54,558 --> 00:26:00,319
it's creating heat from the bacteria it

615
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:04,199
reaches 170° for three days so the

616
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:06,480
Johnson Su um you're adding air with

617
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,880
with the pipes and you're adding water

618
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,880
with the irrigation but you're not

619
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,600
turning it you're it's just the air

620
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,000
moving from the bottom of the pallet

621
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:16,599
through the sides and through the center

622
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,960
of those pipes um and because you're not

623
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:23,678
touching it it actually um it's a fungal

624
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,840
dominant compost versus a bacterial

625
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,320
dominant compost where a thermophilic is

626
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,759
bacterial dominant and by not touching

627
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,960
anything you're allowing the fungal

628
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:35,440
spores um which using leaves and wood

629
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,640
chips as the primary source um which is

630
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,679
high in ligman which is what fungus

631
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:43,440
likes to feed on and so you're allowing

632
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,960
the fungal hyi um to grow throughout

633
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,640
this whole pile and so you're creating a

634
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,798
compost that is incredibly rich in um in

635
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,080
mycelium and then you can take that and

636
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:58,960
you can apply it all over and this is

637
00:26:54,079 --> 00:27:01,278
really um another ecological perspective

638
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,759
um really great for your garden

639
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:07,759
ecosystem because most of us are in a

640
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,319
bacterial dominant e ecology because

641
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:13,359
we're

642
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:15,639
um we're focusing on that primary like

643
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,879
ecosystem which means that we're

644
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,840
disturbing it all the time we're

645
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,200
breaking the ground tilling we're

646
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:23,918
pulling new plants in and out we're

647
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,919
doing all these things to disturb the

648
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,159
soil ecosystem so the first thing that

649
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:32,559
comes in in any ecosystem after a

650
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:35,360
disturbance is bacteria and you can see

651
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,000
this if you just take a pause and a in

652
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:41,240
nature and look at like places where

653
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,278
there's a wildfire or a a road grade or

654
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,798
fencing somewhere there's some kind of

655
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,159
disturbance you're going to see legumes

656
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,679
you're going to see hary vet you're

657
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,559
going to see Lupin these have Associated

658
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,798
relationship with bacteria now why would

659
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,798
they do this because there's a

660
00:27:54,798 --> 00:28:00,558
disturbance they need to provide life

661
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:01,918
for other plants to come in and so

662
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:03,720
they're pulling nitrogen out of the

663
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,519
atmosphere putting it into the soil

664
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,640
creating a habitable space now the

665
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,399
further you get along in an ecosystem

666
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,240
it's called a succession you'll get to

667
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:15,158
that primary is the beginning secondary

668
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,120
and then an established ecosystem we're

669
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:20,360
going to see it move towards fungal

670
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:22,759
dominant the more um stable the

671
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:24,199
ecosystem is the more time that it's had

672
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:25,640
you're going to see more trees you're

673
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,120
going to see more fungus you're going to

674
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:32,880
just see things have balanced out

675
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:36,759
fungus can spread like so far but it's

676
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,080
very slow moving and it does not like

677
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:41,759
disturbances so having the understanding

678
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:43,798
of how species interact with one another

679
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:47,278
and then like being able to apply that

680
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:50,038
to your garden and then like create a

681
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:52,240
compost specifically for that I just I

682
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:53,919
love it I love it so I'm I'm really

683
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,000
excited to get this Johnson Sue

684
00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:00,640
bioreactor built it sounds way more like

685
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,319
high-tech than it is but um I mean it's

686
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,840
beautiful it's going to bring in that

687
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,639
fungal dominance and that's something

688
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:10,000
that's really important to me now this

689
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,720
is it should be important to everyone

690
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,440
because phosphorus is such a limiting

691
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,360
factor because of its limited quantity

692
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,399
uh researchers today are saying that

693
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:26,398
there's 60 years of phosphorus for our

694
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:28,158
crops like 60 harvests left in in our

695
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,479
soils without with the amount of

696
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,039
phosphorus how we're using it um the

697
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,720
ways that you know we're applying it and

698
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,919
it

699
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:41,120
just it is mobile and water when we

700
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:44,000
apply it as a salt based um so it washes

701
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:46,038
down into the Gulf of Mexico causes ufic

702
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,480
we have all of these issues with

703
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:52,720
phosphorus and it's a limiting factor so

704
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:55,319
how do we notice how does phosphorus um

705
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,558
become available in nature well micro

706
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:58,918
isop fungi releases phosphorus micro

707
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:02,839
isop Fung

708
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,799
um creates acids and enzymes that open

709
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:06,798
up and make phosphorus that's otherwise

710
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:10,240
insoluble or locked in really tight in

711
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:14,440
soil particles and allows it to be used

712
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,640
um by plants so does barley with

713
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,278
phosphatases um so that's something that

714
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,600
like I am really focusing on in my

715
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:26,640
garden is how can I limit my phosphorus

716
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:28,480
use but like open it up what I have

717
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,278
maximize the potential of what

718
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,399
phosphorus is in my garden because

719
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,159
phosphorus is one of those especially as

720
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:38,239
an organic Gardener like if that's

721
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,840
important to you not using salt-based

722
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,000
things uh um well and that's a misnomer

723
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,119
salts are just a negative and a positive

724
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,278
put together but most people just call

725
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:51,158
synthetic salt so that's my mistake I

726
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:52,960
would like to not say that a synthetic

727
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:54,760
because salts are salts are fine it's

728
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,480
just a negative and a positive anion and

729
00:30:54,759 --> 00:31:03,278
a cation but um like

730
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:07,079
bat guano seabird guano um those are in

731
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:09,440
my opinion detrimental to ecosystems the

732
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:12,119
way that we Harvest them um you're

733
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,159
destroying islands that have been that

734
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,518
are nesting grounds to get the seab

735
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,720
guano you're destroying caves which are

736
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:21,120
such sensitive ecosystems I mean a cave

737
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,519
how many caves are there in the world

738
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,158
and what kind of interesting life forms

739
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,919
are in a cave and here we are like well

740
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,559
we need the bat guano so we're going to

741
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,240
just scrape it clean and get all of

742
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:35,879
these droppings out destroying this

743
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,440
sensitive ecosystem so then we have Rock

744
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,120
phosphate which is

745
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,558
mind and that has its own set of

746
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:44,759
problems I typically use Rock phosphate

747
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:49,000
or a bone meal because that's a

748
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:50,960
byproduct again it's probably also cafos

749
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,319
I mean you can just like go on and on of

750
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,120
all of the problems and you have to

751
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,798
focus on what's important to you and

752
00:31:54,119 --> 00:32:00,199
what you can control but I know that I

753
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:01,879
can control um accessing the phosphorus

754
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:06,840
that's naturally available in my native

755
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:09,440
soil by promoting a fungal dominance by

756
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,480
promoting um you know the barley and the

757
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,600
enzymes and acids that are going to

758
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,599
unlock the phosphorus that's already

759
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,638
there um and that's a great way of you

760
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:23,079
know another closing the loop of your

761
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:25,158
farm is using your native soil but using

762
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:28,199
uh perhaps the Johnson 2 bioreactor or

763
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:30,919
just establishing a micro isal Network

764
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,159
that um promotes you know the

765
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:34,960
availability of phosphorus so much good

766
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:38,720
information there I mean that the the

767
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,038
stat about phosphorus being gone in 60

768
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,240
years is just mind-blowing on its own I

769
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:45,558
mean it's it's kind of scary to think of

770
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,599
the Outlook and uh yeah I'm glad you

771
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:50,079
gave that us that information and some

772
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,439
things that we can do there I do vermac

773
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,599
composting I have a small worm bin and

774
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,440
then also doing uh I just got a compost

775
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:59,398
pile in my backyard static composting I

776
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,720
just dumping on things on there and then

777
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:03,599
just uh I'll revisit it later you know

778
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,519
and see how things have broken down but

779
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,599
uh I have not done thermophilic yet I

780
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:11,000
have uh bokashi composting which I I'm

781
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:13,158
just starting up now so uh yeah I'm

782
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,038
excited to to do some of this stuff and

783
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,120
actually get my outside going like I

784
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:19,720
mentioned I live in the desert I did a

785
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,319
soil test on there I had uh Bryant Mason

786
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,600
come onto the podcast and he did a soil

787
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:29,558
test he went over it 1% organic

788
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:31,240
matter so it's super low and Rock sand

789
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:32,879
like I've got some work to do out there

790
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,720
if I want to actually plant in ground

791
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,320
which would be kind of cool I it's just

792
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,278
a long process and I'm just in the

793
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:42,038
beginning stages of all that but

794
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:44,359
composting is definitely a key component

795
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:46,038
of Reviving my backyard so I've been

796
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:47,319
doing a lot of that and uh I'm going to

797
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:50,679
continue to do a lot of that in the

798
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:54,119
future awesome if you can try to get

799
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:57,880
wood chips as much as you can um there's

800
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:59,638
a website called chipdrop.com and you

801
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,799
can sign up and they will bring you you

802
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:04,959
have to accept it though it's 30 yards

803
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:07,599
so like a giant dump truck full of wood

804
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,480
chips um I've signed up but I live so

805
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:13,759
rural that um people in my area have

806
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,599
said like oh I got mine in three weeks

807
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,200
the people who live in town and then the

808
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,399
people who live rural like oh I've been

809
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,719
on it for 3 years and they've never

810
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:25,480
brought so I'm currently on the search

811
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,838
but when you're I mean most of us you

812
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,800
know we have sand silter or clay right

813
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:32,799
as our predominant those are the three

814
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,720
soil types and so you being in the

815
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,000
desert you're going to have a lot of

816
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:40,000
sand which means it's the biggest soil

817
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,760
particle right like the largest um wear

818
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,519
clay and it's the smallest it has a it's

819
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,000
so small that it has an electrical

820
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:49,358
charge and it actually attracts things

821
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,119
to it like water hydrogen that positive

822
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:56,480
molecule um and that's why you see like

823
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:58,760
you know compaction and uh pooling and

824
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,400
Clay because the water it it has a hard

825
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,040
time moving through the pore space it

826
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,320
attracts to the actual particle itself

827
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:09,838
and then your sand is going to be so big

828
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:13,240
and it's just going to drain out and 1%

829
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:16,199
organic matter so it's like as much as

830
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:17,239
you can I mean composting it's got

831
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:20,159
you're you're going to have to bring in

832
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:24,159
a lot more compost than than just your

833
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:26,440
hom produced um and your worms but if

834
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,639
you can get the wood chips that's an

835
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:32,240
amazing way to start and just lay it

836
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:33,639
down and have a huge thick um you know

837
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,159
layer and then it's also going to kill

838
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:38,719
weeds so that's a great uh great start

839
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,440
to adding organic matter and which we

840
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,239
haven't talked about what I mean I

841
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,800
briefly talked about the chickens but

842
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:47,358
animals if you can animals are like an

843
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,640
integral part of all closed loop

844
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:52,880
regenerative systems and you can be a

845
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:54,960
vegetarian you don't have to eat them I

846
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,358
mean I was a vegetarian for years I'm no

847
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,358
longer but um like animals of whatever

848
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:04,519
animal fits into your life so maybe it's

849
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:07,199
only worms because that's your lifestyle

850
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:09,318
but a few chickens I mean sounds like

851
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,960
you have more space than the last time I

852
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:15,440
talked to you so um chickens are

853
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,159
definitely a huge like an introductory

854
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,519
animal for anyone they're so easy to

855
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:23,358
take care of they lay eggs like

856
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:25,239
clockwork they're cute and funny and

857
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:29,000
they don't need a ton of space you can

858
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:31,479
get like you know maybe uh

859
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,239
10 foot by 10 foot and you would

860
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,039
have I don't know probably at least five

861
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:40,479
chickens in that amount of space I have

862
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:44,318
a 10x 20 foot uh run and I have 13

863
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,719
chickens in there and they're fine um

864
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:48,880
and then you're getting pest control

865
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,959
because they love eating insects you're

866
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,240
getting eggs that you can eat uh you can

867
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,039
make water soluble calcium with shells

868
00:36:55,239 --> 00:37:01,639
you just uh collect them them in the

869
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:03,838
oven dissolve them in vinegar and then

870
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:07,078
um you can apply that as a foler or you

871
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:09,119
can apply it as a root drench and a tea

872
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,359
there's your one of your feeding your

873
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,838
plant right there with a closed loop you

874
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:16,719
know system and then they're going to

875
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:19,199
help you compost you can throw scraps to

876
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:21,239
them um then you take their bedding and

877
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:23,318
their bedding is really high in organic

878
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:26,318
matter it's going to have the the

879
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:29,480
carbohydrates from either straw or I've

880
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:30,880
been using hemp her bedding for my

881
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,559
chicken so basically they take the

882
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,680
stocks of the hemp plants and Chip it up

883
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:38,880
into a fine material and so I was really

884
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:40,879
nerding out on like what's the best

885
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,240
bedding for my chickens because there's

886
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,720
you know there's pine shavings of course

887
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:47,559
and then there's um the hemp herd and

888
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:50,000
then there's straw and I was like going

889
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:52,519
through the pros and cons well like some

890
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,239
produce more dust than others and hemp

891
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:59,199
herd is supposedly like the superior um

892
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,959
bedding for chickens so I've been using

893
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,639
that and that in itself you could you

894
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,199
know what do we use with our our

895
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:07,960
medicinal plant stocks you could save

896
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:10,358
all of those stocks and you could chip

897
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,720
them and then you could create your own

898
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:14,480
bedding and then they poop in it and

899
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,078
then you take that out and you compost

900
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,039
it and then you throw it right back into

901
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,318
the garden and there you go there you

902
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:23,679
got another loop closed right there so I

903
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:25,599
think chickens are next on your

904
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,519
list that's awesome yeah I was going to

905
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,240
ask you about incorporating animals in

906
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,199
into your garden in order to make it

907
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:33,039
close loop I'm glad you got into the

908
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:35,919
chickens I know uh had somebody on the

909
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:39,079
podcast before that had rabbits and he

910
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,159
was indoors but he used rabbits and he

911
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:43,720
had it I think he had it go down into

912
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:46,679
his basement and they were pooping into

913
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:48,039
his uh living soil beds and so that was

914
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:51,078
pretty interesting to hear that he was

915
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:52,880
using his rabbits that's pretty cool I

916
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,839
was going just say that's amazing to be

917
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,079
able to like so they were pooping like

918
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,880
did he have it set up so it was like

919
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:02,079
autom it yeah I guess it had access to

920
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,599
upstairs as well as downstairs and I

921
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,240
think his living soil beds were

922
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,519
downstairs so and it was just above the

923
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:09,559
living Soul beds I don't know if he did

924
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,239
like a rotation I can't really remember

925
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:13,799
how his setup actually was but

926
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:16,759
interesting he was using his his rabbits

927
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,839
in order to uh get that fertilizer I do

928
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,599
want to make the distinction between

929
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:24,440
rabbits and chickens because um you know

930
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,400
not all poop is created equal and so

931
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,240
this is a good rule of thumb that um any

932
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,440
pelletized poo doesn't necessarily need

933
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,719
to be composted so if it comes out in a

934
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,679
little pellet like a rabbit or a goat or

935
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:38,919
an

936
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:41,598
alpaca that can be that's uh cool enough

937
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,838
it doesn't have as much nitrogen in it

938
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,838
um so you can use it like as a top

939
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:50,639
dressing whereas chickens poop and pee

940
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:53,279
at the same time so it's really high in

941
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,679
nitrogen I think 5% or something

942
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,040
nitrogen so you need to compost it or

943
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,399
it'll burn your plants you can't just

944
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:01,719
let it go straight on there so if you

945
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,160
are going to start incorporating animals

946
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:07,118
into your garden whether it's you know

947
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,960
worms would be the beginner worms poo

948
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,960
you can use they can be in there

949
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:16,480
chickens are also a great beginner um

950
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,838
rabbits don't take up too much space uh

951
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,280
I'm moving on probably I've had goats in

952
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:24,199
the past and I'm torn because I'm on 12

953
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,119
acres now and I have about 3 acres of

954
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:29,199
pasture that's like fenced in for cattle

955
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,920
and and we had cows this year that

956
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,759
grazed like our neighbors brought them

957
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,920
in and I really was like maybe I should

958
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,960
get a milk cow because milk is a great

959
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,200
excess nutrient you can feed your plants

960
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,880
with it you can feed other animals pigs

961
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:46,239
love milk chickens love milk you can

962
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,880
grow like giant pumpkins with milk for

963
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:51,679
some reason they just go crazy I wonder

964
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:54,680
if it's the calcium um and so I was like

965
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:56,799
oh maybe that but maybe the goat instead

966
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:59,000
because you can do a milking goat and

967
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,079
then it has the pelletized poo because

968
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,960
the cow poop is going to be you know

969
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,519
you'd have to go out and I I've already

970
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,358
thought this cuz my field is covered in

971
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:09,400
cow poop and I'm like really am I going

972
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:13,279
to go out there and pick up all these

973
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:16,519
Cow Patties and like what push my my

974
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,599
like no I don't think so so if you're

975
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:20,960
thinking about animals and incorporating

976
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:23,800
them so really think it through from

977
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,039
because it's another life form right um

978
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,000
how it's going to fit into your

979
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:31,679
lifestyle and then also about the poop

980
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,199
and you can actually use it uh alpacas

981
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:36,719
are great because they poop in the same

982
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:38,358
spot they just go back and so you just

983
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:40,719
get a giant pile and you don't have to

984
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:42,358
walk around and pick up the poop they'll

985
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:44,519
just go they create a little bathroom

986
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:46,719
area and they'll just keep pooping there

987
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:48,519
and I that if you have the space I've

988
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,838
really been thinking about alpacas just

989
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:53,280
for that but I I can't like justify

990
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,880
necessarily

991
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,400
like just having an animal for poop you

992
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,160
know like at least with the chickens I

993
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,639
have eggs that I can eat and the shells

994
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:06,960
and if I wanted to like kill them I

995
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:09,159
guess I could eat them um the same with

996
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,599
the goats for the milk but in alpaca

997
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:14,960
it's just like I guess I could learn how

998
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,720
to like make yarn or something from the

999
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,599
fur I'm not really

1000
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:21,838
sure um so that's like you know and

1001
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:23,880
think about it if you're going to

1002
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,000
incorporate animals for this closed loop

1003
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,960
system is like how are you really going

1004
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,838
is how is it going to fit into your life

1005
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,519
what byproducts are they going to create

1006
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,119
and then how are you going to feed them

1007
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,920
and how are you going to handle the poop

1008
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,960
because not all poop is created equal

1009
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,760
really good advice about all not all

1010
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,039
poop being created equal I had no idea

1011
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,559
that the rabbit poop was going to be

1012
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:46,039
more readily usable versus uh chicken

1013
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:48,440
manure I would love to have chickens

1014
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:49,759
eventually I know there are some people

1015
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,519
uh down the street from where I live

1016
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,720
that have chickens and uh I worry

1017
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:57,358
because it gets so hot here it's 100°

1018
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,959
every day June July August I don't

1019
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,159
really know too much about how well they

1020
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,559
do in heat I'm sure they obviously be in

1021
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:04,679
a coupe and there' be shade and stuff

1022
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:05,920
like that and then winter time not

1023
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:08,318
really sure so I'd have to do more

1024
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,838
research in order to figure all that out

1025
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:11,960
but um yeah it's something that I would

1026
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:14,119
definitely consider adding in the future

1027
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,960
guinea hens are also an option then for

1028
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:18,559
you I mean chickens can handle really

1029
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,838
severe temperatures but guinea hens are

1030
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,400
from Africa and they're wild and they

1031
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:24,480
don't even need a CP as long as you have

1032
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,838
like something for them to fly up into

1033
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,599
at night just an idea that's cool I want

1034
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:32,639
to flip flip it up now move on from that

1035
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,240
and let's get into IPM you know I think

1036
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:35,799
this is an area where a lot of folks

1037
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,919
that are going the organic or all

1038
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,119
natural route they kind of struggle

1039
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,079
because there are so many products that

1040
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,800
you can buy on there some being safe

1041
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:47,318
some really not being safe but they're

1042
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:50,800
all natural ways to go about IPM right

1043
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:54,400
talk to us about how you go about IPM

1044
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,000
yeah definitely um so I think it's

1045
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,160
really great that you said you know some

1046
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,559
are safe and some are not safe even if

1047
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:03,759
they're organic even if they say they're

1048
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:06,680
organic um I did some Consulting when I

1049
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:10,880
was in California as a licensed

1050
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:14,719
cultivator and really like your your

1051
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,559
product is being tested for dispensaries

1052
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,799
and they're doing really stringent

1053
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:22,839
testing and so I had one of my clients

1054
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:26,359
who was using a product called pyganic

1055
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:28,239
and it is pyrum based it's organic um

1056
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:30,078
but pyth are like made from

1057
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:34,199
chrysanthemum flowers and so it's like

1058
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:37,400
natural but it takes 64 days for it to

1059
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:39,799
leave the tissue of the plant and so

1060
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,639
that's like if you spray once in early

1061
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,160
flour you're it's going to show up in

1062
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:46,239
your testing and then you're going to

1063
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:49,279
fail uh then think or you may not fail

1064
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:51,039
for flour but then you make concentrate

1065
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,760
and then it shows up in your concentrate

1066
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:56,239
and this is like a big problem because

1067
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,040
we think that like just because it's

1068
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,239
organic and it's sold in the store that

1069
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:02,039
and it says it's safe that we can use it

1070
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,000
um same thing with like neem oil you

1071
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:07,800
know there's anecdotal evidence people

1072
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
suggest that you know hyperemesis could

1073
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,599
be correlated with neem oil we don't

1074
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,400
know definitively if that's true or not

1075
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:17,720
but it's like why spray our flowers with

1076
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:21,039
anything even if it says it's natural um

1077
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:23,639
that could cause issues for our health

1078
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,199
this is our medicine right I mean and

1079
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:26,799
same thing with our food food is

1080
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:29,118
medicine more than anything else in the

1081
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,240
world world like you eat three meals a

1082
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,519
day what you put into your body is going

1083
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:36,759
to determine your health like that is

1084
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:38,960
the hands down like biggest indicator of

1085
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:44,400
our health

1086
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:47,440
so for me to approach IPM in an

1087
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,358
integrated and holistic way first of all

1088
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,280
I'm creating the healthiest plant that I

1089
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:56,159
can because having natural

1090
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:59,200
immunity is right there in itself going

1091
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:02,558
to help prevent pest so that means um

1092
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:05,358
boosting it through things like aloe and

1093
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:07,599
salicylic acid spraying that or uh

1094
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:09,358
silicon you know and having the strong

1095
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,400
cell wall so that piercing biting

1096
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:14,519
insects can't you know it's harder for

1097
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:17,280
them not giving too much nitrogen I see

1098
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:20,239
this all the time people posting these

1099
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,760
photos and the leaves are really really

1100
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:24,439
really dark dark green and kind of

1101
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,960
curling a little bit and it looks

1102
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:30,480
slightly like if you can see any kind

1103
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:34,240
kind of nitrogen toxicity any kind

1104
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,039
you're over and that's a signal to all

1105
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,838
of the piercing biting insects aphids

1106
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:41,000
love it like the soft bodied insects

1107
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:44,000
know when there's High nitrogen and will

1108
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,519
go to that plant specifically so having

1109
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,679
your plants in a nice as healthy balance

1110
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:51,358
as possible is like the first thing that

1111
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:54,838
I would do and

1112
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:59,598
then companion planting I plant sweet

1113
00:46:54,838 --> 00:47:02,838
alysum I plant buckwhat I plant daon um

1114
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:06,240
always those three around my

1115
00:47:02,838 --> 00:47:07,759
garden and I do sunflowers so let's say

1116
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,919
let's go back to the swet alysum

1117
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,079
attracts Green Lace Wings Green Lace

1118
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,838
Wings eat like everything you want to

1119
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,920
attract beneficial insects that are like

1120
00:47:14,838 --> 00:47:19,000
omnivores that just go crazy and will

1121
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,838
eat the aphids and the spidermites and

1122
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,838
that'll just take on everything um

1123
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,119
parasitic wasps they'll do the same with

1124
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:27,719
the aphids and caterpillars um they come

1125
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:31,119
to the buckweed

1126
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:33,239
ladybugs come to the buckwheat um and

1127
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,440
trying to stagger like I really love

1128
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:36,759
buckwheat because it just keeps

1129
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,720
flowering same with the sweet alysum

1130
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,920
it's not just like a oneandone kind of a

1131
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:44,879
thing um sunflowers attract birds which

1132
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,000
are going to you know consume right now

1133
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,440
my garden well not right now but earlier

1134
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,960
in the season um my biggest issues were

1135
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,280
grasshoppers so it wasn't like too

1136
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,400
horrible right they just eat the leaves

1137
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,280
but because I live in the loose if

1138
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,519
you're familiar with that area it's um

1139
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,559
one like basically the Bread Basket like

1140
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:08,000
we produce almost most of the wheat for

1141
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:09,760
the US in Washington it's the a wheat

1142
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,880
growing area so everyone around be's

1143
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:18,040
growing like wheat and Timothy and

1144
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:20,119
Alfalfa it's like grass hay wheat um and

1145
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:21,838
I so we have all these Grasshoppers and

1146
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:23,400
they came down and they're nibbling and

1147
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:25,119
I didn't think anything of it I have my

1148
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,800
chickens Freer ranging they're eating

1149
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:30,039
the Grasshoppers I've got sunflower

1150
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:34,680
flowers attracting Birds to help eat him

1151
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:39,960
um but I saw on one plant this amazing

1152
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:43,919
variegation so it's like a uh white pink

1153
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:45,920
splotchy variegated um coloring on the

1154
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,960
leaves and eventually when it was

1155
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,760
flowering it did it into the flower as

1156
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,039
well and it was only on this plant that

1157
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:57,319
this one plant in this specific

1158
00:48:53,039 --> 00:49:01,759
area and it started I noticed um curling

1159
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:03,880
The Leaf tips as well and so I looked

1160
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,319
online I looked on Instagram I looked on

1161
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,119
Google Scholar people's pictures just to

1162
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:11,679
see if I could find anything that

1163
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:13,599
resembled this odd growth and the

1164
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,440
closest I could come to fine and I was

1165
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,760
looking specifically at viruses and

1166
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,119
viroids because they attack the

1167
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,240
chloroplasts which are responsible for

1168
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:24,318
producing chlorofil so a lot of the

1169
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:26,558
times when we have variegation in a sick

1170
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:28,719
plant it could be the result of a virus

1171
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,280
or Sur vroid because of that so that was

1172
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,239
my inference I was like going to look

1173
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:37,519
for that first and I found beet curly

1174
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:39,798
top virus and it's transmitted through

1175
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:41,400
Grasshoppers and freaking Leaf Hoppers

1176
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:43,838
which I'm surrounded by and then all

1177
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:47,440
these conventional Fields so I was like

1178
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:51,159
okay this is my um you

1179
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,679
know my hypothesis for this uh pathin or

1180
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:54,798
what's going on and then I saw it start

1181
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,318
slowly

1182
00:49:54,798 --> 00:50:00,039
moving further around different parts of

1183
00:49:57,318 --> 00:50:02,358
the plant and then also into localize

1184
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:05,039
spots on other plants that were just

1185
00:50:02,358 --> 00:50:07,119
around that so the grasshopper feeds on

1186
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:09,159
one leaf that's infected with the viroid

1187
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,880
goes to the other plant feeds on it and

1188
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:13,000
it

1189
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:17,599
spreads so this is like a little side

1190
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,599
tangent but um it it was just that's an

1191
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,760
opportunity to observe nature to see

1192
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,680
what's going on so what what what I'm

1193
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,240
already doing right is trying to boost

1194
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:28,239
my plant's immune system naturally so

1195
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,078
I'm working on this product right now

1196
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:31,318
I've been it's something that I use in

1197
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:35,160
my garden

1198
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:37,838
every every every week IM mmunity that's

1199
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:41,039
what I call it um and it's how can we

1200
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:43,279
boost our plant's natural immune system

1201
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:45,039
and it came as a result because I had a

1202
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:49,160
garden that was infected with hot latent

1203
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:51,199
thyroid about four years ago and uh

1204
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:54,199
what's associated with that is dutting

1205
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:56,798
but if you can boost your plant's immune

1206
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:58,798
system as much as possible it's not not

1207
00:50:56,798 --> 00:51:02,119
going to be what it would be if it was

1208
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:03,440
100% healthy but in a living soil system

1209
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:04,440
where you can't just get rid of all of

1210
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,318
your soil especially when you're

1211
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:10,119
planting in the ground the virus or

1212
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:12,119
virid can live within the melium of your

1213
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:14,358
living soil it can live it can just stay

1214
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:15,880
there so you can keep seeing it so what

1215
00:51:14,358 --> 00:51:17,519
do you want to do you want to boost your

1216
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,960
plant's natural immune system with

1217
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:23,880
things like salicylic acid jasmonic acid

1218
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,039
these two plant hormones are the

1219
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,559
hormones that communicate with the plant

1220
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:31,480
about what's going on in the outside

1221
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:33,960
world to the inside so jasmonic acid and

1222
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,798
salicylic acid are either abiotic or

1223
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:40,358
biotic factors so that's living or

1224
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:43,199
non-living so the stress of either heat

1225
00:51:40,358 --> 00:51:47,078
drought uh cold whatever you know that

1226
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:50,759
that kind of stress uh overwatering

1227
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:52,880
underwatering or we have um biting

1228
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,680
piercing insects so that's jasmonic acid

1229
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,160
where salicylic acid is like that heat

1230
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:58,919
the environmental um but they

1231
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:00,480
communicate with each other and they

1232
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,000
communicate with all of the other plant

1233
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,440
hormones inside of the plant and so how

1234
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,199
do we take our plant and increase the

1235
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,400
levels of jasmonic acid and salicylic

1236
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:13,118
acid within our plant to stimulate um

1237
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,760
that communication so that they have a

1238
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,480
better immune

1239
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:21,760
system first and foremost so things like

1240
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,400
insect frass which are going to boost

1241
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,920
the natural jasmonic acid things same

1242
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:30,160
with the micro isal fungi actually

1243
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:32,680
increases asmic acid um aloe and

1244
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,719
contains salicylic acid and increases

1245
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:36,558
your plant's salicylic acid levels

1246
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:39,480
within it and so I did like this is

1247
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:41,559
years of me reading white papers and

1248
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,440
going through different various

1249
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:46,359
instances in my garden so I'm working on

1250
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,240
this product um that's just natural

1251
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:50,480
things to boost your plants natural

1252
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:53,279
immunity so I'll give you some when I

1253
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,440
see you at uh MJ biscon in December and

1254
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,680
you'll have to let me know what you

1255
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:00,240
think but that would be the beginning of

1256
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:03,159
your plant's health and IPM is just

1257
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:04,759
doing everything you possibly can to

1258
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:08,920
boost its natural

1259
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:11,000
immunity and then create an environment

1260
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,039
that has that the Defenders the

1261
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,920
microorganisms that are thriving because

1262
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:17,119
that's right you think of your immune

1263
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,920
system you have the right microbes in

1264
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:22,079
place so you want to have a healthy

1265
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:24,760
microbiome in your soil you want to have

1266
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:27,119
a diversity of companion plants to

1267
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:30,920
attract beneficial insects

1268
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:34,640
um and then you can use specific

1269
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:36,639
microbes to combat specific pests and

1270
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:40,759
that's probably my favorite my favorite

1271
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:42,798
thing um is just knowing how how amazing

1272
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:45,160
these little microbes are doing specific

1273
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:48,119
things so uh for instance like Bavaria

1274
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:51,879
basana is a really popular one um I

1275
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:54,240
really like is isaria fumosa Rosia um

1276
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,599
the issue with these biocontrols so

1277
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,798
those two are types of fungus fungal

1278
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:01,240
spores that you can inoculate spray on

1279
00:53:58,798 --> 00:54:03,759
your plant and they're going to

1280
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:06,239
sporulate and infect pests and then the

1281
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,880
pest will die now the issue we have with

1282
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:11,239
that is that they need to be applied in

1283
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:15,160
a specific way it's typically at a uh

1284
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:18,318
like 80% relative humidity between 70

1285
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:20,440
and 80° so that it's the right parameter

1286
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:22,000
for that fungus to grow and so a lot of

1287
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,960
people won't have success with it

1288
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,400
because you know they're just putting it

1289
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,000
in a 62° water or whatever and then just

1290
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,880
spraying it and be like oh what what's

1291
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,400
going on um so you need to have that

1292
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,119
knowledge that's that ecological

1293
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,880
gardening to understand how species

1294
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,240
interact with one another what kind of

1295
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,519
environment do they need to thrive in

1296
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:44,558
and then understand the mode of action

1297
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:49,159
so like the isaria foser roia which is a

1298
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:54,119
strain that's in like Anora pfr 97 no

1299
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:56,920
fly um it really it's very particular of

1300
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:59,280
the environment that it needs to to grow

1301
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,680
and it needs at least 2 weeks so if you

1302
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,880
have an aphid infestation which aphids

1303
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:07,000
are born with 4 to 12 live young without

1304
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:11,519
having sex they're asexual reproducers

1305
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:14,440
so you are that's two weeks 14 Time 4 to

1306
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:16,318
12 per day your infestation is out of

1307
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,838
control at that point right you can't

1308
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:22,599
wait around for a zombie fungus spore to

1309
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:25,199
kill all it's just not going to work so

1310
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:27,280
then you think about like okay I've got

1311
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:29,038
my beneficials around

1312
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,880
that's one layer of integrated Pest

1313
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:34,400
Management I can use a bio control but I

1314
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:37,440
really want to knock it back so that's

1315
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,798
when you would use perhaps uh chemical

1316
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,960
right the three pillars of IPM are

1317
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:43,798
cultural biological and chemical

1318
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,280
cultural being your practice as the

1319
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:49,119
gardener so that's you know not coming

1320
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:51,640
into your garden with dirty clothes from

1321
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:56,480
visiting your friend's Garden or using

1322
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:58,639
dirty tools or um you know

1323
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,000
how you're you're observing your garden

1324
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:01,838
you know are you de leafing are you

1325
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,400
looking for insects are you doing these

1326
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:05,639
things this is your first layer of

1327
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,798
Defense how are you raising your garden

1328
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:11,199
is it healthy um are you over feeding

1329
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:13,038
nitrogen that's all that cultural and

1330
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:15,000
then the biological is the companion

1331
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:18,160
planting the beneficial insects the

1332
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:21,039
microbes that you're inoculating with um

1333
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:23,639
under either underground or spraying

1334
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:26,720
applying it as a fure um and then

1335
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:29,000
chemical is like a last resort right um

1336
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:32,480
but sometimes we need to use it and so

1337
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,280
like for vegetative phase I go for neem

1338
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:38,159
neem is something that has been used for

1339
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,160
thousands of years in aortic medicine

1340
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:43,000
it's safe to consume men would take it

1341
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:45,679
in India because it slows your sperm

1342
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,239
down um so it's a natural male birth

1343
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:50,279
control and it does the same thing for

1344
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,838
insects it is slows down the

1345
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,920
reproduction of insects it slows down

1346
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:57,798
their molting process it slows down

1347
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:00,519
everything the life cycle so so I use a

1348
00:56:57,798 --> 00:57:03,519
neem meal in my soil as an amendment it

1349
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:06,119
is a fertilizer as well um and then I

1350
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:09,358
use a neem oil in the vegetative phase

1351
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:12,680
if I need to if there is uh infestation

1352
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:16,679
I saw one aphid in veg this summer and

1353
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:19,038
I've had in the past I lived in like

1354
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:21,480
areas where everyone had a 75t

1355
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:23,880
greenhouse and everyone had aphids and

1356
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,798
spider mites and so I see one aphid I'm

1357
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:29,000
like no you are not going into this

1358
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:30,639
garden and I I luckily I'm out in the

1359
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,159
middle of nowhere no other Growers

1360
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:36,920
around me just wheat fields and I

1361
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:40,558
sprayed with the neem and then I sprayed

1362
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:42,318
with the isaria fosa Rosia and the neem

1363
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,559
what it does is like you're you're

1364
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:46,279
you're stacking things to make sure and

1365
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:49,119
doing it in the right order right

1366
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:53,640
because um the ne is going to slow down

1367
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:55,920
the reproduction of the pest and you can

1368
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:58,199
hit it a couple times and then you want

1369
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,440
to bring in the biological control like

1370
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:03,759
the fungal spores that are going to have

1371
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:08,838
time to do their thing um it's just like

1372
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:11,000
layering and using things in a like a

1373
00:58:08,838 --> 00:58:14,239
purposeful way and understanding how

1374
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,440
they attack um and I actually just

1375
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:19,000
started using a new product which I'm

1376
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:21,358
not a product person like I try to you

1377
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,920
know we have to have products right we

1378
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:26,838
can't make everything homemade but um

1379
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:30,358
Organ Shield have you heard of it or Ed

1380
00:58:26,838 --> 00:58:32,558
I have yeah so it is made it's

1381
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:37,038
synthetically produced but it's based

1382
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:40,079
off of uh sucrose octane which is a um

1383
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:43,920
sugar Esther that is found in a tobacco

1384
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,559
plant and they weren't able to uh

1385
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:49,358
extract enough of that so they

1386
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:53,039
synthesized that molecule in a lab and

1387
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:55,199
it is supposedly safe for I mean the guy

1388
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:57,240
I had I interviewed him and he's like oh

1389
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:59,919
yeah he uses it on his kitchen to clean

1390
00:58:57,239 --> 00:59:05,358
things and you could drink it and like I

1391
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:07,400
don't know about that but um I use that

1392
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:10,558
once

1393
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,680
after um in flour like in the begin of

1394
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,960
flower cuz I'm not going to use NE first

1395
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:16,879
of all we don't know if neem is safe if

1396
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,760
it's combusted there's anecdotal

1397
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,960
evidence about the hyperemesis and then

1398
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:24,160
also has a really strong smell like it's

1399
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,119
like Indian food you know what I mean

1400
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:30,440
like you don't want to be spraying that

1401
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:33,200
on your buds so that is the last you

1402
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:34,960
know that chemical and I did three

1403
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:41,960
sprays

1404
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:44,920
um four actually so neem in veg and then

1405
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:48,798
the fungal and

1406
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:51,440
then later on I did spray once with the

1407
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:54,480
Organ Shield just to see with the The

1408
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,119
Grasshoppers because he said supposedly

1409
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,559
that they would kill Grasshoppers and

1410
00:59:56,119 --> 01:00:01,760
and I did see dead grasshoppers so I was

1411
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:03,680
like okay you know I guess this works um

1412
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:07,920
didn't have a lot of issues and then I

1413
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:10,960
did spray once more for caterpillars

1414
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,920
with basilis thuringensis and it's

1415
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:17,039
roughly September for caterpillars

1416
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:18,599
Outdoors um and so I had some moths if

1417
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:20,599
you see moths then you're probably going

1418
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:24,720
to have caterpillars so I did spray for

1419
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:27,440
that um and basilis is you know it's a

1420
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:29,959
soil dwelling bacteria that only targets

1421
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,079
the family lepaera which is a

1422
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,838
caterpillar so it's pest specific it

1423
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:37,359
will only kill

1424
01:00:34,838 --> 01:00:39,960
caterpillars um but for instance if I

1425
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:42,759
was in flower other flower safe things

1426
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:45,880
that I would do would be like

1427
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:49,599
um other types of basilis there's a

1428
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:52,039
whole variety of basilis bacteria and

1429
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:54,599
they can out compete things like

1430
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:56,680
petritis and powdery mildew um same

1431
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:58,720
thing with trichoderma so I like to do

1432
01:00:56,679 --> 01:01:01,038
like a five blend five strains of

1433
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:03,598
different trichoderma trichoderma is a

1434
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:06,400
fungus that's super aggressive and so

1435
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,920
just by spraying your plant with it you

1436
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:11,599
can out compete for other pathogens in

1437
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:15,400
the fall like again Bettis or powdery

1438
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:17,880
mildew um and it's ubiquitous like these

1439
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,960
microbes are everywhere they're going to

1440
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:24,280
be on your plant but maybe not in that

1441
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:25,920
high of concentration um and so it's

1442
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,519
typically it's just safe to spray your

1443
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,838
your plant lightly with a trichoderma

1444
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:31,838
bacillus blend um and then you're not

1445
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:35,558
going to have to worry about so much

1446
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:38,199
like the bud rot and the PM that can

1447
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:42,760
that we know can have detrimental effect

1448
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:44,279
if you consume moldy plants um you know

1449
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,119
but like that's terrible for your health

1450
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:48,480
so those are things that I would do for

1451
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:51,160
a flower safe IPM so much good

1452
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,519
information every episode that we've

1453
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:55,440
filmed together it's just been

1454
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:58,480
jam-packed with information that's just

1455
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:01,200
so useful and you definitely have this

1456
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,119
Advanced knowledge that you're able to

1457
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:05,480
explain in a beginner friendly Manner

1458
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:08,039
