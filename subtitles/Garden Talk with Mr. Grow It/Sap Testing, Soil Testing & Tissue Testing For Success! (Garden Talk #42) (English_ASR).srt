1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,879
coming up on garden talk you know you

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,640
really have to be ruthless

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,638
and deciding you know what's going to

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,879
make it what's going to move forward and

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,879
i'd rather cut the plant down and not

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,280
deal with bugs in my greenhouse if you

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,240
have high nitrate levels in your plant

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,480
material you're very susceptible to pest

9
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,679
pressure do not change labs because all

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,439
their machines are different all of

11
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:24,879
their calibration is different trying to

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,960
compare two results from two different

13
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,038
labs you're gonna have a very bad time

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,599
employ some of the science and you'll

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,320
really be able to see and and have you

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,880
know recordable data next to what you're

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,359
seeing tissue testing sap testing soil

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,120
testing the whole reason i'm doing all

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,920
of that is so i don't have to fight

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,159
pests at the end zap testing has really

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,160
opened up a new level of cultivation for

22
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,479
me it's like the cheat codes for growers

23
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,479
for sure

24
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,558

how you doing today

103
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,920
doing great thank you so much for having

104
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,039

105
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,318
really love chatting with you we'll

106
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,359
never get a chance to this is gonna be

107
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:50,798
fun

108
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,480
yeah so we

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,200
known each other from mj biz con i think

110
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,039
that's what we met back in i want to say

111
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,479
2017 i believe is when we first met so

112
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,158
it's a long time ago and then we saw

113
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,318
each other a couple months ago a month

114
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,079
ago at mjbizcon

115
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,679
and figured we'd do a podcast episode

116
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,280
it's about time you have extensive

117
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,640
amount of knowledge in so many different

118
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,199
areas today we're going to be talking

119
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,759
about tissue testing sap testing

120
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,679
soil testing and then if we have time we

121
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,000
might talk a little bit about your

122
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,759
outdoor greenhouse operation uh that

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,600
you've been working in so

124
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,080
super excited for this one but before we

125
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,240
get deep into the whole testing side of

126
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,240
things the various ways to test can you

127
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,600
give us a little introduction tell us

128
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,720
about yourself and how you got into

129
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,040
gardening

130
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,639
i'm 32 years old i've been cultivating

131
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,040
to northern california for a little over

132
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,720
10 years um the beginning five years

133
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,960
definitely wasn't as successful as like

134
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,560
the most current five years um but uh

135
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,198
been working for grassroots for the last

136
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,918
six years and um honestly i've had a lot

137
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,478
of customers just pouring into me

138
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,599
what works great for them and the just

139
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,758
the

140
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,360
success they have in using our products

141
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,000
or using other products similar to ours

142
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,280
so i've been taking all those cool tips

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,680
and just putting them to practical use

144
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,918
my own personal garden and trying to

145
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,918
get down to the possible best quality i

146
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,680
can get to and you know one day i'd love

147
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,439
to enter into some competitions later on

148
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,759
down the road and come back on and

149
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,439
really show what i can do awesome so

150
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,680
what's your overall growth style would

151
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,918
you say i mean you indoor outdoor do you

152
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,959
grow in soil cocoa are you synthetic

153
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,399
organic what's your grow style

154
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,198
i mean i've tried them pretty much all

155
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,839
super deep water culture um but i am

156
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,199
predominantly i'm very very comfortable

157
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:35,038
um outdoors um preferably uh in a

158
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,038
greenhouse that doesn't have its cover

159
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,800
on it um and we put our cover on a

160
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,159
little bit later in the season

161
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,720
uh it's a really benefit towards the

162
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,080
flowering um but we're obviously

163
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,000
uh in the foothills so we have a low

164
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,159
amount of electricity some of it's on

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,240
solar power so you know i can't keep my

166
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,680
greenhouse cover on all year and pay for

167
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,840
all of those fans or even be able to

168
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,959
have power to move all those fans so we

169
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,318
don't have a cover on our greenhouse

170
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,879
most of the season so it's kind of like

171
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,720
outdoor and then when we get down to you

172
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,719
know that kind of season where we gotta

173
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,240
uh keep things going and get to get the

174
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,240
flower and really pushing forward we'll

175
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,319
put the cover on uh it's a poly weave

176
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,680
cover that's 12 millimeters so it's not

177
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,919
just some basic plastic you guys are

178
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,319
throwing on you know little things so

179
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,198
outdoor organic living soil i've been in

180
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,600
the same soil for four years now

181
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,520
and uh i've just constantly been seeing

182
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,600
improvements because i'm not counting on

183
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,000
bro science i'm using actual science to

184
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,000
amend my bets gotcha gotcha and that

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,439
kind of wraps right into what we're

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,839
going to talk about first which is soil

187
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,839
testing so i assume you've done soil

188
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,758
testing on the bed that you've been

189
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,279
using for four plus years can you talk

190
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,319
to us you know

191
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,079
what is soil testing and why do it you

192
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,520
know soil testing

193
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,918
is really something you should use to

194
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,000
take the weight off of your shoulders to

195
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,758
know what you put together is going to

196
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,839
go forward in the right direction

197
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,120
growing you know many maybe medical

198
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,560
plants that we're growing or whatever we

199
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,560
could be growing but there's so much

200
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,800
science and data that's been collected

201
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,560
over the last 50 75 years on what our

202
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,000
soil map should be

203
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,560
let the chemical make the composition

204
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,639
mpk your mirror levels uh we've got so

205
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,839
much data that we can really count on to

206
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,759
make sure that we're starting out the

207
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,000
right foot forward so you know why

208
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,960
wouldn't you use those tools just to

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,478
make sure things are going to be

210
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,560
successful

211
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,360
i have customers doing this in a 2x4

212
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,959
raised bed a couple fabric pots

213
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,160
just because they really want to see

214
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:28,159
that super high quality jungle boys

215
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,240
product without having to

216
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,240
go through all of the effort of you know

217
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,680
maybe some crazy fertigation or rock

218
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,840
wool you know people know we can do it

219
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,439
with living soil already so it's like

220
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,598
let's let's get rid of all the bs and

221
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,519
get down to really the meat and potatoes

222
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,079
of the situation because when you do a

223
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,159
soil test right you're getting i think

224
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,439
most people use logan labs i know

225
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,439
there's a ton of different places you

226
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,839
can get soil tests but i feel like the

227
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,519
most popular one is logan labs they give

228
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,679
you a breakdown right there's several

229
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,598
different tests that can be done and

230
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,840
they give you kind of a breakdown can

231
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,240
you explain kind of that process and

232
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,198
what it consists of that you see on that

233
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,478
breakdown

234
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,000
yeah and there's a lot of different soil

235
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,240
tests you could do you could do a very

236
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,240
simple soil test for just a couple

237
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,759
dollars for a local lab the main thing

238
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,280
is and the reason why people use logan

239
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,199
labs is because they took in the most

240
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,038
amount of samples in america and they

241
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,720
have the best rapport

242
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,560
and main thing is even if you find

243
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,759
somebody local which you might want to

244
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,759
do

245
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,160
just because of the cost of things stick

246
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,520
with that lab do not change labs because

247
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,199
all their machines are different all of

248
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,719
their calibration is different trying to

249
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,879
compare two results from two different

250
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,759
labs you're gonna have a very bad time

251
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,679
so uh pick a lab stick with it uh many

252
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,958
people are using logan labs because it's

253
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,359
just so easy to translate in common ways

254
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,919
but i still personally take my soil test

255
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,800
for that on over to

256
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,079
the

257
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,599
soil doctor

258
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
he charged you forty five dollars to

259
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,959
give you a big you know four page write

260
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,399
up on that and take all the guesswork

261
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,879
out of you and tell you exactly what to

262
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,360
amend per mineral so you can't go wrong

263
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,879
in that situation um and you should be

264
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,879
doing that soil testing a lot in the

265
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,559
beginning and then taper off later down

266
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,480
the road as we're seeing patterns i know

267
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,278
a lot of commercial facilities use it

268
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,480
right i mean it's it's so justifiable

269
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,000
when you're going to have such an

270
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,759
increase you know what i mean you

271
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,360
mentioned 45 dollars for the consulting

272
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,600
i think it's another 50 dollars for the

273
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,919
actual test it's a hundred bucks i know

274
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,399
sometimes they'll do it before they

275
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,079
plant and there's companies also will

276
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,600
spend the money and do it before they

277
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,200
flip the flower to make sure that

278
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,040
they're optimized going into the flower

279
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,278
stage and that's more of a commercial

280
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,958
facility so it's very useful there what

281
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,958
about home growers would you recommend

282
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,278
they get soil tests too or what oh

283
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,119
definitely um you know the

284
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,639
soil testing side of things takes a lot

285
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,080
less i mean you only need two cuts of

286
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,919
soil so if you're growing in any more

287
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,759
than two cups of soil you know you're

288
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,439
definitely a candidate for it it's just

289
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,759
can you justify spending that much money

290
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,399
in such a small situation you know for

291
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,319
me i want to reuse my soil forever my

292
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,839
soil is something like some of my

293
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,360
consider like some of my customers

294
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,440
consider their soil to be something that

295
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,680
i could pass on to the next generation

296
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,920
the next generation of feet on this farm

297
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,439
so then managing it moving forward is

298
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:06,879
very important to them i know in a tent

299
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,279
that's not that big of a deal you can

300
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,799
just wipe it clean and start over

301
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,078
but the main thing is return on your

302
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,759
investment

303
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,838
you know let's let's do this once let's

304
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,919
do it right and let's prove to everybody

305
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,519
else going along with viewing me to do

306
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,559
this that is successful and i know what

307
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,720
i'm doing um so a small grower small

308
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,399
tent grower um

309
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,879
you know five or seven gallon pots

310
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,039
situation kind of changes too much to do

311
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,958
this but if you're going towards living

312
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,120
soil or going towards just reusing your

313
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,159
soil more than once or twice definitely

314
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,759
do it

315
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,838
now what about the folks that are

316
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,240
running synthetics you know we say it is

317
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,000
they can justify the cost of the test

318
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,480
and the consulting but they're a

319
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,839
synthetic grower they go use synthetic

320
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,959
or salt based nutrients would you

321
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,240
recommend them also getting soil tests

322
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,439
we would recommend a little bit of a

323
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,799
different test

324
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,560
the test that we would recommend is

325
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,958
called a drip

326
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,319
drain test so we're going to send in a

327
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,919
little sample the water that we're

328
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,440
fertigating into the plant and we're

329
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,519
going to send a little sample of water

330
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,279
that's off you know draining off the

331
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,278
runoff so we're going to compare those

332
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,039
two in the laboratory and see what's

333
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,799
holding into the media by obviously

334
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,719
what's collecting on the bottom of it

335
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,719
and we can adjust our nutrients levels

336
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,920
with that drip drain test to know where

337
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,639
things are at and where we should move

338
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,479
forward okay gotcha and then i talked

339
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,159
about the frequency like i've heard of

340
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,560
commercial facilities getting testing

341
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,799
before they plant the crop also

342
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,039
flowering stage what is your

343
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,719
recommendation for how often

344
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,958
i've heard some people say only once a

345
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,560
cycle you know once before you plant

346
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,078
would you recommend

347
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,199
once before you plant would you

348
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:40,479
recommend

349
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,640
you know more than once throughout the

350
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,079
life cycle or what if this was me

351
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,639
helping somebody to set up a new

352
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,319
facility a new grow a new situation i

353
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,399
would start testing as much as you can

354
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,760
afford to so you know once that soil is

355
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,679
mixed it's in the bed you're getting

356
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,039
ready to plant or obviously before

357
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,559
you're getting ready to plant as long as

358
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,319
that soil is in the bed and you've done

359
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,679
everything you're going to do to it i'd

360
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,440
say that's a perfect time to pull a

361
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,439
sample because even if you do plant you

362
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,360
can still make adjustments by just doing

363
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,200
a basic fertigation that's got minerals

364
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,560
or the nutrients that you need to how do

365
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,920
you actually take a sample for those

366
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,359
that don't know how to do the whole

367
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,039
sampling process

368
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,720
um definitely with rubber gloves on

369
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,879
because we don't want any oils from our

370
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,320
fingers to you know affect that test or

371
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,919
anything like that

372
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,200
if you can afford to you should go to

373
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,919
amazon

374
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,000
and order a course sampling tool so

375
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,559
there's a cool t-shaped device you can

376
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,919
insert into the soil turn it pull up and

377
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,919
then it's going to collect that sample

378
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,599
so you can dump it into a bag so you're

379
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,120
not touching it with anything you can

380
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,040
guarantee it's going to be as best as

381
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,919
possible

382
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,159
logan labs requires two cups of soil

383
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,000
um i personally will do a saturated

384
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,199
paste test where i'm sending them my

385
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,879
soil and um eight ounces of my water

386
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,800
they're gonna combine the two together

387
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,120
and create a paste so they're best

388
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,319
trying to recreate my situation at home

389
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,799
and then they read the available

390
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,120
nutrients that's available to my soil

391
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,639
allowing me to know what to amend and

392
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,320
most most of the time i'm amending what

393
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,278
the plant has removed from the soil

394
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,800
gotcha okay and then what's the

395
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,078
turnaround time to kind of get results

396
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:10,159
back from them um i'm in california so i

397
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,559
will ship out my sample overnight and

398
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,559
pay a good amount of money for that um

399
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,000
you want to get your samples there by

400
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,838
monday or tuesday and then you're going

401
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,360
to get a email by about friday

402
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,440
requesting you to pay that invoice and

403
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,759
then you get your uh results back okay

404
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,040
so it's not too long of a process there

405
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,319
it looks like it sounds like they get

406
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,519
through them pretty quickly yeah they

407
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,200
get through pretty quickly and then the

408
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
next step would be forwarding that

409
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,680
information over to whoever's going to

410
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,679
translate out your soil tests

411
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,120
you can you know invest a lot of time

412
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,198
and effort into trying to figure out

413
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,278
where those levels would be

414
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,439
i recommend at least getting uh with a

415
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,198
soil doctor once to have them explain

416
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,880
what these levels should be

417
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,799
and so then gives you something to work

418
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,480
towards you know in the future

419
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,719
absolutely and if anybody wants to learn

420
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,800
more about soil testing i actually did a

421
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,278
whole podcast episode with the soil

422
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,639
doctor so i recommend you guys go check

423
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,078
that out if you want to learn more about

424
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,159
soil testing

425
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,919
because we are going to move on to sap

426
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,759
testing want to talk to us about what

427
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,159
you know about sap testing yeah you know

428
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,679
stop testing has really opened up a new

429
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:13,600
level of cultivation for me um

430
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,439
when you talk to jenny garli at new age

431
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,519
laboratories about stop testing and she

432
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,360
commonly tells how a lot of our

433
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,799
customers were referred to sap testing

434
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,199
as getting the cheap codes on these

435
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,958
plants uh for really trying to get the

436
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,120
best genetic

437
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,039
expression possible

438
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,639
we really want to have the best nutrient

439
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,319
load possible

440
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,799
we're asking

441
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,879
these plants whether it's a fruit tree

442
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,278
or whether it's a vegetable or anything

443
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,120
to run a race for us and to be producing

444
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,639
the best possible product at the end of

445
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,639
that race because we want something

446
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,720
that's going to be you know highly

447
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,600
highly minerally charged to really

448
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,639
benefit our bodies um so

449
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,399
you know using sap testing uh we compare

450
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,839
the top leaves at the top of the plant

451
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,679
and we compare the bottom leaves at the

452
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,120
bottom of the plant at the bottom you're

453
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,319
always going to see the deficiencies

454
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,159
you're going to see those yellow leaves

455
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,920
first you can see that discoloration you

456
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,639
see that weird stuff

457
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,639
also plants if they have an over of too

458
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,039
much nutrients of one kind they're going

459
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,120
to get rid of it in those lower leaves

460
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:16,078
so we're going to collect

461
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,679
about 90 grams of samples from the lower

462
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,278
leaf of the plant

463
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,799
we want leaves that are fully developed

464
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,039
but still have obviously you know a nice

465
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,479
green color in them

466
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,559
and then with the top of the plant we're

467
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,000
going to collect from almost the top of

468
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,399
the plant but a little bit lower where

469
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,759
we have full growth of the leaves you

470
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,360
know we don't want a brand new leaf

471
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,278
that's still let's go go and push it out

472
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,959
we want something that's gotten out to

473
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,720
its full full

474
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,958
stride at least we're going to take

475
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,480
those leaves the laboratory is going to

476
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:46,159
extract the sap out of those leafs so

477
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,759
they're going to squeeze it out extract

478
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,958
it out and they're going to compare it

479
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,879
to the bottom to the top and see

480
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,319
obviously the newest growth at the top

481
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,759
is going to have all the nutrients in it

482
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,639
and like we discussed a few moments ago

483
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,039
the bottom is going to have all the

484
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,519
deficiencies so they're comparing the

485
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,879
bottom leaves to the top leaves that

486
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,959
gives us a chance to see what's not

487
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,559
making it to the top of the plant

488
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,078
we can do the soil test and we can get

489
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,479
this soil absolutely dialed in and

490
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,319
perfect but the sap test allows us to

491
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,800
quantify what's processing through the

492
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,519
plant to create that end product

493
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,278
so

494
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,519
it's very important to do that you know

495
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,399
as soon as you have enough leaf material

496
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,120
to send in that 90 gram sample a 90 gram

497
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,440
sample is about a full one one gallon

498
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,278
ziplock bag i just fill up a whole one

499
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,279
down one gallon ziploc bag measure it

500
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,480
out and we're well over 90 grams every

501
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,360
time and that gives them plenty of

502
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,959
material to really uh go at that

503
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,159
um if you don't have enough leaf

504
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,479
material i think you would very find a a

505
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,000
tissue sample testing very simple and

506
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,000
very easy because you can take a small

507
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,399
sample of the plant whether it be the

508
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,720
petiole or the stock and send that in

509
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,679
and that allows them to do a different

510
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,920
um

511
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,479
where they ash it they burn it and then

512
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,240
they measure those those levels to see

513
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,480
what's in the plant unless it's what

514
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,399
it's going to do compared to a sap test

515
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,318
we're squeezing out the juice

516
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,000
and measuring that kind of like a blood

517
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,720
test that the doctor would do giving you

518
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,038
a real-time way of doing so uh so with

519
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,880
the soil doctor i know he counts on the

520
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,400
tissues testing he says that's the way

521
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,480
to go he counts on that he loves that

522
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,240
that's just been around for a lot longer

523
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,318
the testing is definitely a little bit

524
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,160
newer to the game and can give you a

525
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:23,918
little bit of a more real-time situation

526
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,038
with what's going on

527
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,720
um

528
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,599
first time i conducted sap testing i

529
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,120
found out if i feed any more nitrogen

530
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,159
i'm going to start creating a pest

531
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,599
problem if i don't feed my minerals that

532
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,440
i'm lacking in i'm going to end up

533
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,319
having some pm issues

534
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,400
so

535
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,960
it's very commonly known

536
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,440
in all agricultural all plants if you

537
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,798
have a deficiency in copper you're most

538
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,000
likely going to end up with mold or

539
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:49,759
mildew

540
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,759
so i saw those copper levels were almost

541
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,519
non-existent they measure them in parts

542
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,038
per billion so i said to myself

543
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,480
immediately okay i need to start doing

544
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,798
some copper

545
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,798
foliar sprays

546
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,798
now the only way to obtain a lot of

547
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:05,440
these minerals is to use a sulfate which

548
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:07,200
is a non-organic product

549
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,320
so that's a big shocker for some people

550
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,880
i don't want to use something that's

551
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,599
non-organic in my organic garden well

552
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,039
you have to understand that as far as

553
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,879
everything goes in the state of

554
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,919
california everything goes in the united

555
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,760
states if we're taking a test a sample

556
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,600
we're sending it into a laboratory that

557
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,919
laboratory is determining that we're low

558
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:28,719
on these levels we're allowed to use a

559
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,120
non-organic substance to

560
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,360
to get those levels where it needs to be

561
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,599
and it still remains organic because we

562
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,439
have not gone over those levels now the

563
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,678
second we add way too much we go over

564
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,919
those levels it's not considered organic

565
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,519
farming and you're synthetically feeding

566
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,720
the system or obviously and you're going

567
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,839
to have problems because you've given it

568
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,600
too much

569
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,599
so with that stop testing it really let

570
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:52,319
me lead forward with some corrective

571
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,240
foliar sprays and some improvements in

572
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,159
growth and

573
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,480
that year i was blown away you know i

574
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,080
planted july 1st in my greenhouse and by

575
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,960
i think june

576
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,399
or excuse me about august 14th or 15th

577
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,960
the time when everything flips over to

578
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,559
flower in california um i have

579
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,640
tremendous growth i had sometimes eight

580
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,720
foot growth in some of these plants uh

581
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,799
which is just absolutely insane but you

582
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,558
know i'm using that stop testing to be

583
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,558
feeding it supplementally like spoon

584
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,000
feeding it everything it needs and i

585
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,160
know what it needs because i collected

586
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,079
those samples and i'm not using bro

587
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,160
science um

588
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,839
so it's been fun it really has been it's

589
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,840
been quite a journey it's like the cheat

590
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:35,038
codes for growers for sure

591
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:37,599
so how often would you do a sap test

592
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,519
um you know just like a soil test you

593
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,839
want to do it you know frequently you

594
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,160
know for me the first year i did it i i

595
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,000
pulled my samples i saw these low levels

596
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,558
i did some corrective folder spray for a

597
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,400
week or two um i had to wait three days

598
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,119
after foliar spray before i can collect

599
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,720
my next sample so then i got to the

600
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,879
point where a friday afternoon i'd come

601
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,038
to my farm do my corrected foliar spray

602
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,200
i'd be there monday morning at 8 00 a.m

603
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,480
collect my samples before 8 a.m because

604
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,919
it's really important to collect those

605
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,200
samples as early as possible in the

606
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,640
morning

607
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,798
then we're gonna you know immediately

608
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,559
overnight ship those out uh we're gonna

609
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:13,119
cold pack them so they don't you know

610
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,558
get a chance to volatilize or anything

611
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,199
crazy happening and that's gonna be nice

612
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,599
and cold uh get that out there and it's

613
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,000
gonna give you um you know a great

614
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,519
response of what's going on so when i

615
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,038
first started doing this i did it a lot

616
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,480
because i wanted to see the changes and

617
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,640
see what's going on

618
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,480
this last year i felt it a little bit

619
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,880
more accurate to

620
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,120
do a test before i planted

621
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,039
so i saw my plants and what their health

622
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,479
was before going into my soil system

623
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,359
which i knew was in you know a really

624
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,519
good situation um i planted them in

625
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,038
there i let them sit for a week or two

626
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,200
and i'm still well in veg i pulled

627
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,200
another sample just to see how things

628
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,679
are going in the soil that i've put on

629
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,960
the right path and i still saw a couple

630
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:58,159
little things like iron copper um also

631
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,440
uh boron which creates the big holes if

632
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,919
you're low on boron you're gonna get a

633
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,200
big hole in your stem which slows down

634
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,120
the amount of water that can pass

635
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,440
through the stem so i decided i'm going

636
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,599
to spray some i was excuse me i was told

637
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,159
that i should uh correctively foliar

638
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,399
spray some boron but also at the same

639
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,000
time with calcium boron and calcium

640
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,919
should always be applied together and it

641
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,440
really makes the get into the plant a

642
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,919
lot easier i'm sure you've heard that a

643
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,600
lot of times before so i kind of went

644
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,400
through this process but twice a week i

645
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,678
do a boron calcium spray and i do a

646
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,720
little uh

647
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,440
iron and copper foliar spray to offset

648
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,360
that and um

649
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,558
if you're ever impressed by the way your

650
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,798
plants grow

651
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,240
if you do this stuff it's gonna just

652
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,079
blow your mind especially if you've been

653
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,679
working for the same strain for several

654
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,918
years and you're just so used to what it

655
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,840
looks like so used to what it does it's

656
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,440
just it this is the plan i know it you

657
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,959
put it through this process you're going

658
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,120
to see genetic expressions you've never

659
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,880
seen before gotcha so it sounds like sap

660
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,479
testing can be extremely beneficial in

661
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,480
certain circumstances especially if

662
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,079
you're at like a commercial facility now

663
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,480
let me ask you this

664
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,558
home growers do they traditionally get

665
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,000
sap testing done well with the stop

666
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,678
testing you have to have the right

667
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,359
amount of leaves to send in the sample

668
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,960
you got to have 90 grams with the top

669
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,558
and the bottom so you know you're gonna

670
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,480
have to be at least you know in a four

671
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,079
by eight tent pushing four plants per

672
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,079
four by four square to have enough leaf

673
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,918
material to do so if you don't have

674
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,678
enough leaf material to do so honestly i

675
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,240
think you're gonna find tissue

676
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,679
tissue testing um a better way of going

677
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,919
because it's a smaller sample and you

678
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,159
get pretty much the same amount of data

679
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,799
how much does a sap test cost

680
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,720
um new based laboratories if you just do

681
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:39,519
one test it's just once i think it's 75

682
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,960
if you sign up to do 10 tests over

683
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:42,240
whatever period of time you want to do

684
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,919
you can get it for a little bit of a

685
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,519
lower price i believe it's somewhere

686
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,480
around 60

687
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:50,158
okay and so that one test is that that's

688
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,519
for both the top part of the plant

689
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,960
leaves that you collect and also the

690
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,359
bottom part of the plant yeah that's

691
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,519
considered one sample the new and the

692
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,119
old and they're compared together

693
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,319
and then we get a breakdown of every

694
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,079
different mineral um your brix level so

695
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,759
we can see what the sugar levels are

696
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,759
we're going to see the ph of the the

697
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,240
plant material we're going to see so

698
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,480
many different things that

699
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,200
really allow you to become an expert in

700
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,558
your own situation

701
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,159
especially for people who are doing

702
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,918
side-by-side stuff or have the same

703
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,159
setups as other people you really want

704
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,400
to take a step ahead employ some of the

705
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,200
science and you'll you'll really be able

706
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,759
to see and and have you know recordable

707
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,880
data next to what you're seeing that

708
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,720
makes sense

709
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,799
yeah sap testing is something i've never

710
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,720
done before you know i'm just a smaller

711
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,319
home grower i grow no more than 12

712
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,319
plants that's all i'm allowed to grow in

713
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,558
my state soil testing i've done before

714
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,079
but the sap testing i haven't so i think

715
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,000
i need to kind of send one out and i

716
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,000
think for me being a home grower when it

717
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,839
would be beneficial to us maybe while

718
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,599
it's in veg big enough to where i could

719
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,038
pull the leaves off before flipping a

720
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,359
flower i feel like potentially that

721
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,640
would be beneficial because then i'd get

722
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,879
that report

723
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,559
know where i'm struggling and make

724
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,400
adjustments before flipping to flowering

725
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,079
what do you think that's exactly what i

726
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,278
would do at a bare minimum because you

727
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,439
know you're going to be flipping the

728
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,919
flower you've got several weeks of

729
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,278
foliar spraying that could be done there

730
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,720
until you get to a point where you're

731
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,319
like oh my gosh these buds are getting

732
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,880
big and i don't feel comfortable foliar

733
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,399
spraying i'm risking mold and mildew and

734
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,080
that kind of stuff

735
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,919
me i fold your spray quite a while

736
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,079
through flour because i'm supplementing

737
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,159
products to prevent those issues from

738
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,519
happening in the beginning

739
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,120
and i don't have my cover on my

740
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,200
greenhouse so i'm not trapping in a

741
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,759
bunch of humidity you know it's getting

742
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,880
a chance to dry out pretty fast so

743
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,640
everybody's situation a little bit

744
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,039
different that makes sense

745
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,559
let's move on talk about tissue testing

746
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,240
so you kind of touched on upon it a

747
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:45,119
little bit give us the details about

748
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,038
tissue testing yeah um i honestly would

749
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,439
count on somebody like the soil doctor

750
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,960
for all of that advanced information i

751
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,440
personally have never conducted a tissue

752
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,759
test myself uh two years ago i got into

753
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,600
sap testing and that was the first thing

754
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,359
that you know was shown to me is it's a

755
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,519
better form of testing because they're

756
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,839
not burning the material you're getting

757
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:07,278
you know the best information directly

758
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:09,839
out of the plant right then and there

759
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:12,159
so tissue testing i think can be better

760
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,079
for somebody that's on a smaller scale

761
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,320
and you know maybe you should be doing

762
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,319
one of each just to see what test is

763
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,240
more beneficial for you

764
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,519
um you know maybe it's stop testing

765
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,599
that's the only way to go because you

766
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,038
like that process and it's easy for you

767
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,959
maybe the tissue testing is going to

768
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:29,119
really be a better simpler process for

769
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,480
you in the end so you know me me

770
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,399
personally i'm going to imply some

771
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,519
tissue testing and i'm going to compare

772
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,600
some things and i'm going to see what's

773
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,278
easier what's what's more simpler for me

774
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,759
it's really about the less labor and

775
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,319
what what's you know making us

776
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,158
have to enjoy growing let's let's enjoy

777
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,759
growing and not be like oh my gosh i

778
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,200
have to follow your spray oh it's

779
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,679
ruining my life

780
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,278
so i like to keep things positive now i

781
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,159
assume tissue sample it sounds like

782
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,440
you'd need a lot smaller amount of plant

783
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,520
material

784
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,000
is that right so how is like a tissue

785
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,759
test done you know how much does it cost

786
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,519
things like that you know i actually

787
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:04,960
don't know because i haven't i haven't

788
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,519
done one myself

789
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,240
at all i've seen people take you know

790
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,918
samples of stock put in a ziploc baggie

791
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,720
properly label it and send it out to the

792
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,400
laboratory there's a lot less risk

793
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,079
because you don't have to worry about

794
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,519
keeping the sample cold

795
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,960
you can collect that sample throughout

796
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,720
the day and then ship it out once you

797
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,120
drive past the post office later on the

798
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,720
end of the day uh compared to a sap test

799
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,239
you have to be very critical about these

800
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,120
things you have to cold pack it you got

801
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,960
to get it out there immediately so um

802
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,599
it's going to depend on what works for

803
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,038
you guys and where and logistically how

804
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,639
far you've got to ship these samples as

805
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,119
well is a big thing

806
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,520
okay and then as far as the report the

807
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,278
breakdown i think you might have touched

808
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,519
on is pretty much the same information

809
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,839
as a sap test or are you going to have

810
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,119
different results no you're going to

811
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:52,798
have all the same results you're just

812
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,879
like not going to have a comparative

813
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,200
from the bottom to the top

814
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,840
so you know and now that i'm thinking

815
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,360
about it the real thing you know if if i

816
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,599
was looking at a plant and i was seeing

817
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:05,519
some definite deficiency issues

818
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,519
and were like what the heck is going on

819
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,038
with this thing uh you would definitely

820
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,720
want to do that sap test because it will

821
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,000
comparatively show you you know what's

822
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,919
in the top leaves what's in the bottom

823
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,599
list and what's moving through the plant

824
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,679
you know that tissue sample is just

825
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,038
going to tell you if we chop that stem

826
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,720
off right there it's just going to tell

827
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,558
us what made it to that point and what

828
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,278
the plant was able to create

829
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,278
at that point in time in growth and when

830
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,519
we collected the sample

831
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,519
so i think that tissue testing first

832
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,798
stop testing thing really depends on

833
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,879
where you're at and what situation

834
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,480
you're going to be best in okay yeah

835
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,640
that makes sense for sure let's talk

836
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,079
about the outdoor greenhouse operation

837
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,919
that you've been working in so you talk

838
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,439
to me before we start recording this

839
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,440
you're excited about everything you've

840
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,038
got going on there so talk to us about

841
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,278
it what do you get going on out there

842
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,519
yeah so i'm running a couple of 48 foot

843
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,119
raised beds uh we're in northern

844
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,038
california so

845
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,959
you know we're kind of uh

846
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:59,599
riding it and out as long as we can and

847
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,840
having a great time um obviously we're

848
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,359
growing our six plants but on a very big

849
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,000
scale that they can become you know

850
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,639
large and you know give us what we need

851
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,839
for for the year um

852
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,559
but uh

853
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,959
the soil testing has really progressed

854
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:17,278
in a way that is i'm showing less

855
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,360
amendments every year so my soil is

856
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:23,278
retaining nutrients and is moving

857
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:25,759
forward in a very positive way so i

858
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:26,960
i think by three or four years from now

859
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,038
there could be a point where i don't

860
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,159
have to do anything in my soil i could

861
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,319
go out there and make sure it's

862
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,000
saturated and plant my plants

863
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,398
so you know that's going to be a

864
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,480
beautiful day a really beautiful day

865
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:41,038
when i just walk out to my farm and

866
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,640
plant those those plants and they take

867
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:43,759
off and they do their thing that's

868
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,759
that's kind of

869
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,558
the goal everyone's getting to and i see

870
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,679
that on the horizon which is uh

871
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:51,678
it takes a lot of weight off your

872
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,840
shoulders

873
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,080
putting through a large crop without

874
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:59,038
having any pest issues

875
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:01,519
probably been one of the most

876
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:04,000
relieving things i could have to my life

877
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,960
um tissue testing sap testing soil

878
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,119
testing

879
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,960
the whole reason i'm doing all of that

880
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,759
is so i don't have to fight pests at the

881
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,079
end

882
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,599
um i'm really trying to set up the soil

883
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,759
and set up these plants to where they

884
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,519
can treat the soil like the kitchen and

885
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,839
get everything they need whenever they

886
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,158
want it and they can live the healthiest

887
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,918
best possible life they can so i'm

888
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,520
treating these things like my children

889
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,600
and i'm taking them to the doctor which

890
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,639
is my soil test my sap test and i'm

891
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,439
making sure that they're going to be

892
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,038
healthy throughout the way um taking as

893
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,278
much care for these things as you would

894
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,359
for your infant in a certain sense you

895
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,720
know on a scientific level

896
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,240
so it's going great i'm really happy

897
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,240
with it this year was some of the

898
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,960
highest quality crop i've ever turned

899
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,720
out

900
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,600
um

901
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,839
and

902
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,879
it's amazing i'm very happy with it

903
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,240
definitely

904
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,919
yeah it would be cool to get to a point

905
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,399
where you're just adding water and you

906
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,480
don't even add any amendments anymore

907
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:59,519
like the goal you had said i actually

908
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,558
just got done talking with blue of green

909
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,639
tank not sure if you heard of him he's

910
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,720
yeah he's got avocado attacks so he's

911
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,880
literally just at the point where he's

912
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,679
feeding his soil you know feeding the

913
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,760
the insects the worms avocados and

914
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,000
they're breaking that down and providing

915
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,759
nutrients for the plant now oftentimes

916
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,798
he does do i believe he calls it a mash

917
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,319
where he's

918
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,558
mashing together some amendments and

919
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,879
then putting that in with the avocado as

920
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,720
well but the worms and insects go crazy

921
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,720
for them and that's all he does he

922
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,360
applies one i think he said he applies

923
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,720
one in veg and one in flour half in veg

924
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,719
half a flour

925
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,399
and that's like so much hands off

926
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,839
compared to you know feeding liquid

927
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:39,839
bottle nutrients for example where

928
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,439
you're you're mixing up nutrients every

929
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,558
single week you know sometimes several

930
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,080
times a week

931
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,359
or even just growing with organic

932
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:46,960
amendments to where you have to top

933
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,639
dress you know two or three times

934
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,319
throughout the grow so becoming more and

935
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,480
more hands hands-off a lot of people see

936
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,158
that as the ultimate goal now what about

937
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,960
chop and drop did you do that can you

938
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,640
talk to us about that no i got i got rid

939
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,840
of cover props because they can harbor

940
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,159
bad pests

941
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,319
um we found out a long time ago that the

942
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,559
russet mites can feed off of the clover

943
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,879
can feed off of those kind of things so

944
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:11,440
if i ever do any sort of a cover crop

945
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,960
it's going to be maybe a dichondra maybe

946
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,480
some grasses

947
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,240
but that's mainly going to be in the off

948
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,319
season while my soil is taking a rest

949
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,319
and that kind of thing so now that i've

950
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,798
harvested my crop i threw down some more

951
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,960
dichondra seed it's rained like crazy

952
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,359
for the first time ever in california so

953
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,880
it's going to pop like nuts uh come

954
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,199
around next spring i'm going to have a

955
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,799
big old mess to deal with and have to

956
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,200
clean up my beds and get them all ready

957
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:36,720
to plant and everything like that so um

958
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,960
i don't do the chop and drop thing

959
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,839
that's not my style i'm more of doing a

960
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,480
one inch cover crop excuse me a one inch

961
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:47,759
mulch layer that most layer is broken up

962
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,558
three equal parts of straw

963
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,720
rice holes and wood chips i take three

964
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,558
equal parts i mix them together in a

965
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,480
wheel barrel i fill it with water i put

966
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,558
a couple bricks on top for a few hours

967
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,599
make sure everything saturates real well

968
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,000
and i add no more than one inch of mulch

969
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:06,079
on top of my soil

970
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,079
more than that can suffocate your soil

971
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,199
make things hard for the worms

972
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,000
so everything i've learned you don't

973
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,200
want more than an inch layer

974
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,519
and it's been working out very

975
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,159
successful for me and the main thing is

976
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,839
no pest problems that's that's the goal

977
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,919
i'm willing to sacrifice a few other

978
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,319
things but if i don't got to deal with

979
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,200
with pests at the end of the year

980
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,519
we're good

981
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,000
what's your ipm routine in order to try

982
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,679
to prevent pests uh soil testing stop

983
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,079
testing is the main thing because

984
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,640
that'll let you see your your nitrate

985
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,398
levels so when you do a sap test there's

986
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,000
gonna be breaking down nitrogen at three

987
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,879
different points you're gonna have

988
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,640
nitrate in excuse the nitrogen in a

989
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,480
nitrate form you're going to have

990
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,080
nitrogen in

991
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,599
two other forms i can't reference right

992
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,000
now i should have my soil my stop test

993
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,480
with me but we found out

994
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,640
if you have high nitrate levels in your

995
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,519
plant material you're very

996
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,840
susceptible to pest pressure and and

997
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,120
because pests they don't have eyeballs

998
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,038
where they view these plants they have

999
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,398
antennas and they're looking at radio

1000
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,158
signals and they're looking at radial

1001
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,918
waves that these plants are giving out

1002
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,080
so if they have high nitrogen nitrate

1003
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,480
levels they're giving out heavy signals

1004
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:17,599
wanting those bugs to come to them so

1005
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,519
for me if i have low nitrate levels and

1006
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,359
i have beautiful green growth i know

1007
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,679
that my plants are going to be very less

1008
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:26,398
susceptible to pests

1009
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,519
so this last year i did not foliar spray

1010
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:29,359
once

1011
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,839
for

1012
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,519
any sort of ipm i did not do that at all

1013
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,759
the only thing i do is i apply

1014
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,519
beneficial biology

1015
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,759
at grassroots we have the concentrated

1016
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,038
biology line which is beneficial liquid

1017
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:45,759
microbes it's a compost tea product um

1018
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,200
that has a one-year shelf-stable life

1019
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,119
when you want to use it you combine it

1020
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,120
with our microbial food

1021
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,639
that activates the microbes

1022
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,959
you can foliar spray that on the leaf

1023
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,559
surface and veg or obviously i've mainly

1024
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,038
just root drenched that into my soil

1025
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,359
system every single week

1026
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,119
so i'm mainly farming with microbes and

1027
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:05,359
i'm putting a protective layer on my

1028
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,119
leaf surface early in the plant's life

1029
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,799
so it's got beneficial microbes on the

1030
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:11,519
leaf surface

1031
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,599
due to science we now know that

1032
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,759
microbes do survive on the leaf surface

1033
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,440
after your your folder spray is dried

1034
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,119
out so you don't get the full life but

1035
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,240
you do get microbes left on the leaf

1036
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,519
surface and if let's say uh

1037
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,918
a

1038
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,440
powdery mildew spore lands on the on

1039
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,838
that plant surface but we've got

1040
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,440
beneficial microbes there to consume it

1041
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:32,878
and i'll compete it we're not going to

1042
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,960
have those issues

1043
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:39,039
so i'm a microbial farmer um

1044
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,800
using science and using science as much

1045
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,320
as i possibly can

1046
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,480
that's awesome that's interesting that

1047
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,960
you're not doing any ipm sprays i mean i

1048
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,398
talked to a large handful of outdoor

1049
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,480
greenhouse growers and everybody

1050
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,559
spraying with something whether it be

1051
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,358
neem oil or some some sort of essential

1052
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:57,279
oil you know peppermint rosemary some of

1053
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:58,719
those things in order to try to prevent

1054
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,400
pests that's awesome that you've gotten

1055
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:03,279
to that point where you're literally

1056
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,480
just utilizing sap testing soil testing

1057
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,359
you know looking at your plant for the

1058
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,280
health making sure those are in line

1059
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:10,960
that you don't have to spray at all yeah

1060
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,160
you know there was a grower a very

1061
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,920
famous grower in humboldt kevin jordary

1062
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,719
if you ever get a chance to have anybody

1063
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,800
else on you know that's a legacy grower

1064
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,239
from humboldt i would really look out to

1065
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,079
kevin drawer he's got some of the most

1066
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,519
amazing knowledge of anybody in the

1067
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,280
cannabis industry

1068
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:30,559
you know a long time about four years

1069
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,280
ago i got to sit down and share share um

1070
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,279
some medicine with kevin and

1071
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,400
he explained to me the difference in

1072
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,079
between

1073
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,920
a good grower

1074
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,079
and a great grower

1075
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,079
is the difference between the healthiest

1076
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,480
plant in the garden and the unhealthiest

1077
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,599
plant in the garden and how big that gap

1078
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,320
is

1079
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,760
do we have a very small gap in between

1080
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,160
the healthy and unhealthy and a very

1081
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,920
healthy crop or do we have a large gap

1082
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,440
and we have more unhealthy plants than

1083
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,358
we do healthy plants

1084
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,679
so my whole life i've been trying to go

1085
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,920
is you know let's close that gap and

1086
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,679
have those healthy plants that are there

1087
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,440
to survive and they're ready to run that

1088
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,199
race that we're asking them to run and

1089
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,280
be those athletes that we want them to

1090
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,118
be because they can they're already kind

1091
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,760
of there you know you wouldn't pick a

1092
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,000
320 pound man to be on the track to even

1093
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,760
expect them to win a race this season

1094
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,519
you don't do that you know so grabbing

1095
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,760
that plant that's got purple stalks

1096
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,519
purple stones fading leaves on it and

1097
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,520
picking that to go into your garden it's

1098
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:30,400
probably the biggest mistake you made

1099
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,838
that whole time and foliar spraying or

1100
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,519
doing a pesticide when your plants

1101
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:34,960
really don't need it is affecting them

1102
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,039
on a greater level than you really

1103
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,000
understand so i'm not gonna i'm not

1104
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,599
gonna use an ipm product unless i have a

1105
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,960
really bad issue

1106
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,240
and if you are going to use one i would

1107
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,720
suggest maybe stuff oil x

1108
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,639
which is retailed by arbico organics

1109
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,159
it's a mineral oil and the times that i

1110
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,000
have used it or need to use it the

1111
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,838
plants freaking love it and i'm not

1112
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,519
going to use it again for a week or two

1113
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:00,078
and if i have to use it again i'm

1114
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:03,119
debating getting rid of that plan

1115
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,960
you know you really have to be ruthless

1116
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,880
and deciding you know what's going to

1117
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,119
make it what's going to move forward and

1118
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,440
i'd rather cut the plant down and not

1119
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,960
deal with bugs in my greenhouse than to

1120
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,480
continue on and be like i'm going to

1121
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,400
fold your spray again i go to folders

1122
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,838
pretty good it's still not healthy you

1123
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,119
know if you're folding spraying ipm

1124
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,199
products and expecting the plant to be

1125
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,200
healthier that's not going to be the end

1126
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,358
result the plant you're just wiping off

1127
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,759
that those bugs and hoping that it

1128
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,199
doesn't continue you have not

1129
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,040
fixed the problem from the beginning

1130
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:32,879
that's creating the buds that's that's

1131
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,039
been my whole life purpose the last five

1132
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,039
years is what stops bugs from ever

1133
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,119
coming and what can we do i don't want

1134
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,519
to get to the ipm side of things that's

1135
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,119
a horrible situation it's stressful and

1136
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:44,079
you're not happy i'd rather be on the

1137
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,559
other side of things where we're

1138
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,560
constantly preventing it and having a

1139
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,400
happy life

1140
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,920
so yeah happy plants happy life i think

1141
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,320
that's a great way to go about it you

1142
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,559
know prevent the issue from occurring at

1143
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,880
all you know to begin let's transition

1144
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,239
let's talk about grassroots fabric pots

1145
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,400
you say you've been working with them

1146
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,159
for about six years i believe you said

1147
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,160
talk to us about what they do at

1148
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,480
grassroots what you've got for products

1149
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,639
and so on and so forth uh we're here to

1150
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,760
educate people that normal fabric pots

1151
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,279
are not smart they actually suck

1152
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,040
which is why we have the living soil

1153
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,880
fabric pots right here that have a liner

1154
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:21,679
in it that help you

1155
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,440
grow plants in an organic way

1156
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:26,078
so normal fabric pots that don't have a

1157
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,358
liner they dry out from the top down the

1158
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,280
bottom up and the sides in so there's no

1159
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:32,559
situation in the world where a plant

1160
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,480
dries out from all those different

1161
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:37,759
situations besides maybe something that

1162
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,000
grows in sand straight sand 24 7.

1163
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,760
so you know

1164
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,679
throughout the years we had people that

1165
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,920
we thought were crazy telling us the

1166
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,279
fabric pots sucked we're just like man

1167
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,599
these things are great everybody buys

1168
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,240
them leave me alone you know go go have

1169
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,400
fun now you know a couple years later

1170
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,799
people were telling us

1171
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,039
i'm having problems and then we're like

1172
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,119
what you're having problems

1173
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,039
so they started telling us how the soil

1174
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,800
was drying out unnaturally

1175
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,960
and i'm like unnatural explain to this

1176
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,560
me to explain this to me further and

1177
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,720
they said well when you plant native

1178
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,039
soil the sun is going to dry out the

1179
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,319
soil from the top down

1180
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,000
you're not going to have it drying out

1181
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,320
from all these different angles we want

1182
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,920
to recreate native soil as best as we

1183
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,359
possibly can

1184
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,200
um we went into a grow um the first

1185
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:26,719
commercial situation

1186
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,598
we ever dealt with we did some custom

1187
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:31,759
pots we did some really cool stuff

1188
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,359
especially for uh scott of crested soil

1189
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,880
services which is another great person

1190
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:39,358
to have on here he's a soil scientist

1191
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,400
we did some really cool stuff with scott

1192
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:42,639
he was the first one to kind of

1193
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,800
implement that in fabric pots and one of

1194
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:46,960
the people he was growing with is kind

1195
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,400
of uh noticed like hey there's a big

1196
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,400
difference when i wrap these pots with

1197
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,160
saran wrap on the outside

1198
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,079
so if you're ever cruising around living

1199
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,159
soil hashtags or cruising around on

1200
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,400
social media seeing people playing with

1201
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,239
with living soil you'll commonly see a

1202
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,280
fabric pot wrapped with plastic on the

1203
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,519
outside

1204
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,519
so that is somebody who's trying to

1205
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,920
recreate native soil as best as possible

1206
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:08,960
and eliminate the dry rolls from drying

1207
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,000
out

1208
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,519
that fast so with that living soil liner

1209
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,239
we're allowing the roots to grow all the

1210
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,759
way to the edge they can grow down

1211
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,279
before they start circling they're going

1212
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,800
to realize this normal fabric down at

1213
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,760
the bottom and start their air pruning

1214
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,440
process

1215
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,319
so it's really cool how this is behind

1216
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,318
me it's just worked out

1217
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,519
um but your roots are allowed to grow to

1218
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,440
the edge and have a better utilization

1219
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:37,440
of the container in all areas

1220
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,039
one really cool aspect that we really

1221
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,880
were not expecting

1222
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:44,318
is these growers started reporting back

1223
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,480
to us lower energy costs as in their

1224
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:47,838
their pg e bills their power bills were

1225
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,519
coming lower

1226
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,759
because this liner right here was

1227
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:53,759
holding in the water from every time you

1228
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,200
watered instead of it going out

1229
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,240
immediately into the room it's being

1230
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,078
held back

1231
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:59,919
and it's making a lot less effort for

1232
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,720
your dehumidification system of your

1233
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:07,760
fans to battle all of that system so um

1234
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:09,519
safe water uh immediately have fungal

1235
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,200
life growing so that was one of the

1236
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,960
first things that if you wrap your

1237
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:14,399
fabric pot with saran wrap you'll

1238
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,720
probably see

1239
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,119
a mushroom or two pop up within 20 or 40

1240
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:21,279
24 to 48 hours so it's like oh my gosh

1241
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,358
all that biology is there but it just

1242
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,319
was never given the right situation to

1243
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:25,679
really

1244
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:27,920
cultivate

1245
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,519
and go crazy and be able to do his thing

1246
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,358
so anybody out there growing in a normal

1247
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,119
fabric pot i i

1248
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,639
really would urge you to wrap it and see

1249
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,079
the differences see how much water you

1250
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:37,920
save and see how much happier the plant

1251
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,000
is and then on top of that move to a

1252
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,838
living soil fabric pot or raised beds

1253
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,440
because you know that's really where you

1254
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:44,880
need to be in the future for growing

1255
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,679
your vegetables your plants your

1256
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,680
medicine all on the same program

1257
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,519
so grassroots faber poss we we really

1258
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:54,639
make a lot of custom stuff

1259
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,880
um we're in sacramento california and we

1260
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,879
have a 12 000 square foot manufacturing

1261
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,280
facility where we make all this stuff

1262
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,440
right here in sacramento

1263
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,160
our fabric is from the state of georgia

1264
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,240
so it's american-made um if you've ever

1265
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:10,239
been in the military or have any family

1266
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:12,318
members in the military this fabric will

1267
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,838
look very familiar for to you because

1268
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:16,880
this is the same fabric that's used for

1269
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:19,679
the us military and their hesco barriers

1270
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,280
barricades any forward operating base

1271
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,039
anything like that this is from the same

1272
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,319
exact manufacturer

1273
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,920
we just have a little bit different

1274
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,079
specifications

1275
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,519
as far as the thickness goes

1276
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,079
with those barricades they can go with

1277
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,920
the thinnest material possible and

1278
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,280
it does great so for us we went with

1279
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,079
something a little bit thicker we went

1280
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,839
with an 8.5 ounce material which shows

1281
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,200
the weight per square inch

1282
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,159
um

1283
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:46,159
american made no heavy metals a very

1284
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,358
consistent fabric

1285
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:49,199
indoors

1286
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:50,559
i can't estimate a life on it it's

1287
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,759
probably going to last for pretty close

1288
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:53,440
to forever

1289
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,720
because there's no uv light to break it

1290
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,039
down

1291
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,639
outdoors you've got the uv light coming

1292
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,239
down from the sun that's what's going to

1293
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:03,118
break down the materials over time

1294
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:04,879
there's not much you can do about that

1295
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,039
you know our products outdoors and the

1296
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,880
harshest harshest conditions are going

1297
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,480
to have a minimum life of about five

1298
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,480
years

1299
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,559
probably well well over that we know

1300
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,079
we're being conservative awesome yeah i

1301
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,159
have the two foot by ten foot bed

1302
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,039
outside i got some veggies there you

1303
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:23,118
gifted to me several years ago man i was

1304
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,880
i had to do a 2019 i think is when you

1305
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,039
you gifted me that one so i appreciate

1306
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,200
that i like them i agree with what you

1307
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:32,559
say about how like fabric pots it just

1308
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:34,078
dries from dry oats from all angles

1309
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,400
and when you've got microbes that you

1310
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,400
need to be there to break down those

1311
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,559
amendments for the plant you know turn

1312
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,240
them into usable nutrients for the plant

1313
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,599
well if they dry out and there's no

1314
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,118
water there

1315
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,119
they go dormant right they're in a sleep

1316
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,519
state so they're not able to work and

1317
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,079
break things down so you are more prone

1318
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:53,838
to see deficiencies potentially happen

1319
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,000
because the plants aren't getting a lack

1320
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:57,838
of nutrients so i'm a believer in

1321
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,318
grassroots fabric pots for sure i've

1322
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:03,119
actually also just done plastic pots

1323
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:04,480
over fabric pots just for the reason you

1324
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,519
you mentioned you know what i mean

1325
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,358
because i don't want them drying out

1326
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:11,519
from all different sides specifically

1327
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,679
yeah yeah well this has been a great

1328
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:15,119
talk kind of wrapping things up tell us

1329
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:16,799
how the can looser just find you and

1330
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,318
what do you have upcoming in the future

1331
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,839
yeah we've actually got some absolutely

1332
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:21,920
amazing stuff coming out in the future

1333
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:23,199
this is one of our new shirts we have

1334
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,119
soil life

1335
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:26,960
we have a new version of our logo coming

1336
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,920
out some really cool stickers save the

1337
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,000
soil

1338
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,119
so we haven't done any new marketing in

1339
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,880
about three years we've just been

1340
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,400
focusing on our products and focusing on

1341
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,800
getting out as much fabric pots and

1342
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,639
raised beds as we can to people but now

1343
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,079
for the last eight months the owner and

1344
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,159
myself have focused on some new

1345
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,280
marketing and we're really going to get

1346
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:46,879
down to showing how much we we benefit

1347
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,760
the culture and how much we are a part

1348
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,680
of

1349
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,240
the culture of the industry that we work

1350
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,159
in so we've got some amazing marketing

1351
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:56,639
some new boxes that all of our products

1352
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:58,399
