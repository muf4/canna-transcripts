1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,960
coming up on garden talk you don't have

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,560
to go buy calcium at the store

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,280
you can make your own calcium with

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,919
eggshells and vinegar i love

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,279
vermicompost using worm compost is one

6
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,120
of the best

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:19,600
natural ways to feed your plants you

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:21,519
don't need guanos or cow manure or all

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,519
any of those other things so the first

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,839
thing you need to gauge is how much food

11
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:28,239
waste are you producing

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,118
and then how much do you need to augment

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,119
on top of that and in general the worms

14
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,600
aren't going to escape because they

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,399
don't like light to get the full

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,719
benefits out of cover crops

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,679
you need to chop and drop in general

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,280
right you should never have naked soil

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,878
after a while if you have a good amount

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,239
of soil and you have a good process

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,878
going you don't actually have to go buy

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:50,878
soil either

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,640
what's up everybody if you that don't

24

regenerative gardening or regenerative

104
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,120
farming whatever you want to call it k f

105
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,759
you do a lot of these practices within

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,680
your garden i know you through instagram

107
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,798
i also seen that you've been on other

108
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,280
podcasts and shows and just spilling a

109
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,360
bunch of good knowledge so super excited

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,640
to have you on today this is going to be

111
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,720
pretty much like an

112
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,399
i would say an introduction to

113
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,000
regenerative gardening a lot of my

114
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,239
audience i would say

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,199
is i would say a majority probably are

116
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,639
home growers and that they are probably

117
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,919
more on the bottled nutrient side of

118
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,000
things

119
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,758
there's quite a few organic gardeners as

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,680
well that are part of it but i know

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,400
there's a lot of people that are looking

122
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,639
to transition over to the organic side

123
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,319
looking to start regenerative gardening

124
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,478
so i thought this would be a good

125
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,719
episode to kind of be an introduction to

126
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,399
it and then hopefully viewers will be

127
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,919
able to get an understanding of it at

128
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,679
least a basic understanding of what it

129
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,279
is and hopefully learn some practices

130
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,000
that they can implement in their garden

131
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:49,039
you know yeah yep and i'm gonna

132
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,199
hopefully provide some fantastic uh

133
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,040
names as well for people to follow up on

134
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,079
because there's just so much great work

135
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,600
going on

136
00:04:54,079 --> 00:05:00,319
uh all over the globe really uh in

137
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,639
regenerative farming practices so it's

138
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,399
it's fantastic um i personally got into

139
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,879
growing things

140
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,959
because i grew up in a food business

141
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,600
and so

142
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,239
i was always around

143
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,240
fresh foods uh fresh herbs and

144
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,319
ingredients that my

145
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,639
family used in the cooking

146
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,639
my grandfather was a butcher so he also

147
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,360
used to go get the full sides of beef

148
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,439
and my dad ran restaurants and used to

149
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,520
pick out all the vegetables and fruits

150
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,759
and things by hand and

151
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,439
we always had gardens going as well so

152
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,600
that we had fresh stuff to cook with

153
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,478
lots of rosemaries and

154
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,759
spices and garlic and onions and things

155
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:46,159
like that my parents were always growing

156
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,400
some type of an ingredient and as i got

157
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,720
older and was continuing to work in the

158
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,279
food business we always had

159
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,800
herbs available at the restaurants there

160
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,638
was usually something

161
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,400
growing out back that we would go and

162
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,240
pick at the beginning of the day or

163
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,719
excuse me we were getting

164
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,240
lots of fresh herbs in and i always

165
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,960
would

166
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,519
tend to gravitate towards helping care

167
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,000
for those plants and helping bring the

168
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,240
fresh stuff in and helping pick out the

169
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,160
right uh the right types of vegetables

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,918
and things to consume so so that was my

171
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,199
background and so i have a real

172
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,159
appreciation for high quality

173
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,199
food

174
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,160
and so that's really where i got started

175
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,639
and

176
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,520
i've always been really interested in

177
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,879
just gardening and having those

178
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:37,839
ingredients at hand year round i put you

179
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:40,560
know basil and parsley and

180
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,879
other things on my windowsill i keep

181
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,399
them under fluorescent lights

182
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,600
do different things to keep them going

183
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,519
year round

184
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,120
as i was talking with you earlier i've

185
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,719
started playing around with micro greens

186
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,399
too i love micro greens they're

187
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,479
fantastically

188
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,198
fantastic to taste and

189
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:59,038
tremendously beneficial uh health-wise

190
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,120
for you so that's uh that's kind of

191
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,199
where i got into it and

192
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,240
regenerative farming

193
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,240
is um

194
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,199
really really important

195
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,598
if you look at

196
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,280
how where our food comes from and

197
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:16,719
unfortunately we've gotten very

198
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,198
disconnected

199
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,599
as a society

200
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,800
on where our food comes from right most

201
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,959
people's interaction with food is at the

202
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,879
store the grocery store they have no

203
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,560
idea where it came from they don't know

204
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,120
what the plant looks like it was picked

205
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,800
off of they may not even know that much

206
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,759
about the animal that it came from

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,639
either

208
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,199
and

209
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,478
that disconnection

210
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,759
has allowed a lot of practices that have

211
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:50,000
been going on that have been harmful

212
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,439
to the environment and very impactful

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,839
to

214
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,160
all sorts of different things because

215
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,119
our environment is connected right you

216
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,400
can't

217
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,199
everything impacts everything else

218
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,758
the

219
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,439
um there the winds

220
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,759
that uh blow in the middle east pick up

221
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:13,120
nitrogen and sand

222
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,720
that blows across in the atmosphere and

223
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,800
lands in brazil

224
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,280
and is actually one of the is one of the

225
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,560
ways that that the rain forests are

226
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,959
nutrified

227
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,879
so we are in a big large global

228
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,638
connected system but when you look

229
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,360
closer to home

230
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,200
and you look at our

231
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,719
agricultural practices unfortunately

232
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,519
over the last 150 years

233
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,599
and and really the last 70 years

234
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,879
primarily

235
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,759
commercial agriculture has

236
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:51,360
followed practices that while they were

237
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,600
able to produce large amounts of food

238
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,879
that food did not have

239
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,200
a lot of

240
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,360
nutritive value to it

241
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,240
and all of those practices were

242
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,080
extremely detrimental

243
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,080
to the land

244
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,000
that those

245
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,080
foods and animals were being grown on

246
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,039
what you know the farmer will grow on a

247
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,879
bunch of land and use it until it's

248
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,000
basically just

249
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,159
dead

250
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,919
and then move on to another plot of land

251
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,759
and then move on to another plot of land

252
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
and they keep going and going and going

253
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,919
and

254
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,720
the the

255
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,000
property becomes so depleted in

256
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,440
natural

257
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,639
biology

258
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,399
and natural protections that it's not

259
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,360
able to heal

260
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,519
and so regenerative farming

261
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,680
is a

262
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,560
a whole bunch of different practices

263
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,000
that revolve around trying to re

264
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,759
regenerate

265
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,240
the area but

266
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,720
in general what we're trying to do is

267
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,799
leave the land better

268
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,480
than when we got it

269
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:02,078
so as opposed to this almost strip

270
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,560
mining approach

271
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:07,039
that has caused us to lose

272
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,559
70 of the top soil in the middle of the

273
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,360
united states

274
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,119
that was responsible for the dust bowl

275
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,120
that's been responsible for that's

276
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,759
responsible for a lot of our flooding

277
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,320
and runoff problems and pollution within

278
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,078
our oceans and rivers today

279
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,200
is because of this

280
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,958
destruction of the natural

281
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,580
environment

282
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,799
you can

283
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,399
[Music]

284
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,519
farm

285
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,919
in

286
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,360
ways though that help actually

287
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:39,039
regenerate the soils and help give back

288
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,800
to the land and

289
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,639
capture carbon

290
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,519
and

291
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,000
stop

292
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,639
runoff so there's less flooding because

293
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
it'll the water can flow down

294
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:55,278
into these really really healthy soils

295
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
so regenerative farming is again looking

296
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,519
is

297
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,559
looking for ways to rebuild and make

298
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,078
things better than when we left them

299
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,559
organic

300
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,879
is not the same

301
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,799
as regenerative and that's an important

302
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,278
thing to remember

303
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,519
organic means that

304
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:19,120
all of the things that went into the

305
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:22,159
making of that plant or animal were also

306
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,320
certified organic the seeds

307
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,600
the nutrients

308
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,440
the soils the teas whatever was applied

309
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,000
to those plants had to be certified

310
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,240
organic for them to be able to claim

311
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,278
that this is a certified organic

312
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,720
product

313
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,879
however

314
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,360
it's still in many cases following bad

315
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:46,399
commercial practices which continue to

316
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,159
destroy the land like tilling

317
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,159
tilling is one of the largest

318
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,600
reasons why

319
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,000
we've we have so many problems with our

320
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,920
soil health today

321
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,320
and and you know tilling's been around

322
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:05,278
for a long long time

323
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,800
if you go back even in u.s history some

324
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:12,559
of our first presidents were promoters

325
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:14,159
of tilling as a way to break up the land

326
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,719
and make it a little bit easier for

327
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,120
planting and in many cases the way that

328
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,480
we used to till in those days with like

329
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:26,879
just a big wedge dragged behind a horse

330
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,759
was not as bad as what we do today where

331
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,879
we have these huge mechanized spinning

332
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,600
discs

333
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,200
that

334
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,879
cut through

335
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,399
the soil and destroy

336
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,919
all of the natural

337
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,958
fungal

338
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:45,679
and biology biological life that's in

339
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:48,559
that soil all the worms

340
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:51,278
all of the uh orthopods

341
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:54,319
all of the fungal bodies they get

342
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:57,838
destroyed by tilling so what are you

343
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,160
left with you're left with a bacterial a

344
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,240
highly bacterial soil

345
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,838
that isn't as

346
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,000
balanced for the

347
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,639
plant this causes

348
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,799
increase in weed pressure

349
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,159
and causes increases in pest pressures

350
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,639
it again

351
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,120
it causes the soil to lose its ability

352
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,560
to retain water so we have to use more

353
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,120
water to feed our plants

354
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,838
because of the loss of the fungal and

355
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,159
back biological life in the soil

356
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,480
the plants aren't able to get as much

357
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,639
access to the minerals and nutrients

358
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,600
that are in that soil

359
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,839
so you have to add more stuff on

360
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,399
right so even if you're using an organic

361
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,240
product but you till your soil

362
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,039
you're still not

363
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,879
following regenerative practices

364
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,519
regenerative practices are also great

365
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:57,759
for animals as well it's not just about

366
00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:00,879
plants and in fact the two together

367
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:04,240
are a symbiotic combination that needs

368
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:07,600
to be followed one of the things that um

369
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,639
i think is is uh really interesting for

370
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,360
vegetarians to consider okay

371
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,039
is that we still need cows

372
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,639
okay

373
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,759
the reason is

374
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,198
that we don't have

375
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,559
the

376
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:26,639
herds

377
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,518
of animals that used to exist

378
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,039
in

379
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,120
nature

380
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,439
that would help with the basic

381
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,919
biological processes

382
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,639
that regenerated the soil

383
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:41,360
their urine and defecation their

384
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,639
churning up the land but primarily in

385
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,519
large herds that moved at very rapid

386
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,799
paces and didn't stay in one place for a

387
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,639
very long time because of predators

388
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,519
that type of movement that type of

389
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,680
activity is extremely beneficial for the

390
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,360
land and if you look at places in the

391
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,439
u.s where they've actually allowed the

392
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,959
wild buffalos to come back

393
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,360
those grasslands have come back from

394
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,759
what they once were to once they once

395
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,399
were that and they were

396
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,919
in some cases almost desertifica

397
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,559
desertified

398
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,399
because there were wasn't the proper

399
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:22,559
type of animals on that land

400
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,958
just holding cattle and pens outside

401
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:28,479
though is not enough you have to rotate

402
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,319
them much more often than our practices

403
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,560
are today and you also need to keep them

404
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,800
in smaller pens to keep them clumped a

405
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,078
little closer so that you get some of

406
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,958
the benefits

407
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:41,519
of them stomping the ground

408
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,799
and and kind of breaking down the cover

409
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,600
crop

410
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:48,078
and vegetation back into the soil

411
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,959
but also creating small pockets where

412
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,958
water and bacteria can build because

413
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,719
their hoof prints will actually create

414
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,039
these little puddles and micro

415
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,639
microbiomes

416
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,000
and again you're in the feces and all

417
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,440
those things and by keeping them

418
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,639
rotating

419
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,880
you don't allow those animals to eat all

420
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,680
the vegetation to the point where it's

421
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,519
detrimental to that land right

422
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,000
uh there's uh there's a couple of

423
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,159
brothers and i think it's last name is

424
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,839
silva but i can't remember the last name

425
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,719
but they're doing some stuff in in the

426
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,480
oaxaca desert which is in between texas

427
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,120
and mexico

428
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,079
and it's basically one of the largest

429
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,839
deserts in the world the oaxaca desert

430
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:33,198
and they

431
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:36,480
a large portion of their property is in

432
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:38,639
that desert and what they did was they

433
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,278
changed the way they

434
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,680
moved their cattle their cattle farmers

435
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,919
so they changed the way they moved their

436
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:51,679
cattle and were able to actually

437
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:55,519
rebuild the entire area of their land

438
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:58,078
through proper cattle rotation only by

439
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,120
using proper cattle rotation

440
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:03,679
the natural species came back in the

441
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,519
birds and the animals carried the seeds

442
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,240
the plants spread

443
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,798
the biology moved with the water and the

444
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,439
streams and things started to re

445
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,279
come back from being a desert actually

446
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,959
turned back into

447
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:20,399
a grassland

448
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,959
naturally just by changing the way

449
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,880
they moved their cattle but the use of

450
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,120
cattle was necessary and important so

451
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,200
bringing cattle across a field

452
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,918
before you do planting

453
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,798
is a great way to help reinvigorate your

454
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,200
field working with your neighbors

455
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,759
having your neighbors maybe feed on some

456
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,519
of your crops so that their

457
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,119
their cows are also getting some of the

458
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,839
benefits of your naturally grown

459
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,879
vegetable vegetation and they're also

460
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,720
helping

461
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,600
heal your land as well

462
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,440
so

463
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,639
lots of great things some people to look

464
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,200
at would be dr elaine ingham

465
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,799
who is the person who coined the soil

466
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,000
food web

467
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:02,879
and

468
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,558
really

469
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,720
learn about the soil food web because

470
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:09,678
it's a tremendous tremendous important

471
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,440
part of regenerative farming

472
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,080
ray archuleta

473
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,919
gabe brown are also some fantastic

474
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,879
people that you can go find out more

475
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,200
from

476
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,120
um and those are those are definitely

477
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,960
some some some names i would recommend

478
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,319
looking up and finding out more about if

479
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,720
you're interested in regenerative

480
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,960
practices i follow

481
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,120
primarily a family of farming called

482
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,600
korean natural farming

483
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,639
which is a family again it's a korean

484
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,038
based natural farming set of practices

485
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,720
that utilizes

486
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:44,558
natural inputs that you collect locally

487
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,440
in your environment

488
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:50,240
to feed your plants so you collect

489
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,279
plants to feed your plants you use

490
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,079
ferments fermentation

491
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,440
and

492
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,480
vinegars and sugars and other techniques

493
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,679
for

494
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,558
capturing

495
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,880
uh indigenous microorganisms

496
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,079
and building beneficial

497
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,919
inputs

498
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:11,279
for your own gardens i this is what i do

499
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,320
all the time

500
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:17,359
i make all my own inputs i don't buy

501
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,119
anything at the store at the groce store

502
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,069
if i go to a grow store it's because i

503
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,599
need a new fan

504
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:24,240
[Music]

505
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,918
or something along those lines i don't

506
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,558
go to the grow store for nutrients i

507
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,559
actually make all of my own nutrients i

508
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:33,678
make fpjs which are fermented plant

509
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:36,319
juice ffjs fermented fruit juices

510
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,640
you can make your own calcium your own

511
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,839
calcium you don't have to go buy calcium

512
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,440
at the store

513
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,599
you can make your own calcium with

514
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,080
eggshells and vinegar

515
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:49,199
or oyster shells in vinegar

516
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:52,960
seven days with a breathable cap and you

517
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,200
have your own calcium for pennies

518
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,720
and it's really really really

519
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,360
interesting

520
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,279
way of creating

521
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,158
nutrients and inputs for your plants

522
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,879
it's a wonderful way of farming and all

523
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,039
of the inputs are in many cases good for

524
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,880
us as humans as well they're good for

525
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,119
animals so there's approaches for

526
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,919
chicken coops for for no smell chicken

527
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:18,639
coops and no smell pig styes with korean

528
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,720
natural farming which are amazing using

529
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,960
lactic acid bacteria

530
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,679
um or lactobacillus

531
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,279
and some other techniques uh just really

532
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,840
really cool stuff

533
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,599
so i hope that uh helped kind of give a

534
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,279
little bit of a background and a primer

535
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,678
on regenerative farming

536
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:38,399
absolutely it has a lot very interesting

537
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,038
stuff there a lot to unpack so just a

538
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,640
quick recap i got a short list here so

539
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:44,000
regenerative gardening some of these

540
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,400
things you said some of them you didn't

541
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,159
say you know sun grown you know rely on

542
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,120
the sun to grow instead of kind of doing

543
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,520
it indoors crop rotation closed loop

544
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,879
on-site plant nutrition composting

545
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,000
systems

546
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,400
so for watering doing strategies through

547
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,119
soil management irrigation methods

548
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,880
using rainwater right right yep talk

549
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,558
about how it's beneficial to animals you

550
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,640
know healthy plants with companion

551
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,798
planting cover cropping on-site food

552
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,880
systems pest management not relying on

553
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,798
chemical pesticides and herbicides so a

554
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,080
whole bunch of different things can be

555
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:20,000
enacted here now narrowing it down to

556
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,000
kind of the home grower you know the

557
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,839
person indoors that's doing their own

558
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,400
gardening you know maybe they have a 6

559
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:28,558
or 12 plant set up or house plants or

560
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,400
whatever talk to us about closed loop

561
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,960
operations i know a lot of people that

562
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,400
is something that you can enact within

563
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,720
the home gardening so can you first tell

564
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,000
us like what is closed loop operations

565
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,319
and what are some things that people

566
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,839
could do at home in order to implement

567
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,678
that yep

568
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:47,279
so i've actually mentioned a few of them

569
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,400
already but closed loop has to do with

570
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,399
basically

571
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,519
getting everything you need from within

572
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,840
the confines of your own property right

573
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:59,200
so if you're running a farm

574
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:02,480
nothing comes in from the outside

575
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,279
you're building and utilizing all of the

576
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,839
things within your property to feed and

577
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,720
support and nurture and sustain your

578
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,839
farm

579
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,400
it's the same thing for us as home

580
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:17,199
cultivators whether you're growing

581
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,720
edible or medicinal plants it really

582
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,960
doesn't matter

583
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,480
even your regular house plants as well

584
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,200
in many cases can benefit from these

585
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,880
systems and um

586
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,159
as a

587
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,120
as as just a home owner in general

588
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,600
right composting is a tremendous

589
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:41,119
uh is a tremendous benefit

590
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:43,119
so if you're going to if you have some a

591
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,199
little bit of land

592
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,038
building an outdoor compost or getting a

593
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,519
compost box or something along those

594
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,919
lines is a fantastic way to start

595
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,440
and it's a great way to reduce your

596
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,159
food waste

597
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,919
and your overall trash that you're

598
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,600
sending to landfills and you're having

599
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,799
picked up and all those things you can

600
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,480
take your coffee grounds your used tea

601
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,960
your eggshells

602
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,839
the old vegetables

603
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,440
the ends the green ends on the carrots

604
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,439
that you don't want to eat all the

605
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,279
different pieces all the things that you

606
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,600
strip off of the vegetables when you

607
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,200
peel your carrots or you know the banana

608
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,918
that just was over ripe and you didn't

609
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,360
want to eat it all these things can go

610
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,799
in your compost pile and can be

611
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:30,959
recovered

612
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:32,960
and re-nutrify your own

613
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,759
for the benefit of your own garden

614
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,840
so composting is outdoors is one way to

615
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,240
do it another thing you can do is as i

616
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,959
mentioned vermicompost or or worm

617
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,798
farming and that's great for indoors

618
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,278
because you can have

619
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,839
worms in a five gallon bucket you can

620
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:52,159
keep worms in a little box

621
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,079
if you really want to obviously they're

622
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,278
only going to produce so much worm cast

623
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,038
things and they're only going to take up

624
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,480
so much waste if you have only a small

625
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,558
amount

626
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,360
but having a worm bin

627
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:06,079
is a tremendous benefit and actually one

628
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,798
of my favorite things i love

629
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,158
vermicompost using worm compost is one

630
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,000
of the best

631
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,799
natural ways to feed your plants you

632
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,759
don't need

633
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:19,278
guanos or cow manure or all any of those

634
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,640
other things

635
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,839
really vermicompost is mostly all you

636
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,400
need

637
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:29,038
and it has the benefit of providing a

638
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,080
lot of natural organisms and fungi along

639
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,400
with it

640
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:35,038
that help benefit the soil and build

641
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,000
soil structure and all those things

642
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,798
i do

643
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,440
put some worms in my pots

644
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:43,839
occasionally but i tend to keep them in

645
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,120
my worm bin actually and i use red

646
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,119
wrigglers

647
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,959
is the type of worm i use

648
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,000
i get my worms from uncle jim's worm

649
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,240
farm

650
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,679
i order them online every time i need if

651
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,599
i need some new worms but for the most

652
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,080
part once you get worms if you take care

653
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,119
of them you don't need more they will

654
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,918
double

655
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,639
every three months so if you have 250

656
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,480
worms you'll have 500 worms in three

657
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,759
months and you'll have almost a thousand

658
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,960
worms in six months so they

659
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,839
they will

660
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,600
grow to the size of your space and and

661
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,879
you can do them and you know get a bunch

662
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:21,199
of 35 gallon totes from target and make

663
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,960
your own worm bins and keep these things

664
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,960
in your basement

665
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,278
you can go year round

666
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,840
if you live in a cold environment like i

667
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:33,599
do i live in massachusetts it freezes in

668
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:35,599
the winter i can't stir a compost pile

669
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,079
the wood chips that i would normally add

670
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:42,240
for my browns are also frozen the leaves

671
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:44,399
are frozen they're buried in snow or ice

672
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,558
and so for me the alternative in the

673
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,880
winter is a worm bin uh or uh doing some

674
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,678
bokashi fermentation so another great

675
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,720
thing that you can do if you're in if

676
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,880
you have an apartment or a small space

677
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,159
you can actually do composting with

678
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,400
akashi

679
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,200
it's a it's a japanese technique that

680
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,480
uses fermentation

681
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,840
to convert your food wastes

682
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,558
over to a product that breaks down very

683
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:17,119
quickly in soil so you could do

684
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:19,119
a 30 day ferment

685
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,119
on your food waste in a four or five

686
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:24,399
gallon bucket with a lid

687
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:26,798
and then take that and mix it with soil

688
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,759
in a big tote

689
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:32,720
let that cook again for another 30 days

690
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:35,679
and you will have an incredibly rich

691
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,360
soil that you can use on your plants so

692
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,519
there's lots of great techniques that we

693
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,798
can use even if you have a very small

694
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,918
space you don't have to have a big

695
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:45,519
compost pile outside and turning it and

696
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,880
worrying about temperatures and all

697
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:51,759
those things worms are the best

698
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,278
but there's also great approaches with

699
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,359
bokashi

700
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,400
i know people who also if you have

701
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,959
chickens

702
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,759
soldier flies is also a fantastic way to

703
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,360
do composting

704
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,200
if you can deal with

705
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:08,479
with all the soldier fly larva and all

706
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,480
that which the chickens love

707
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,278
so that's um so that's um

708
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,440
a bit about composting i like to use

709
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:19,278
compost teas and

710
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,679
that's one of the primary ways that i

711
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:22,720
feed my plants is i like to brew up a

712
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,240
weekly

713
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,278
compost tea

714
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,278
uh with an airlift brewer so before we

715
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,720
get into that sorry to cut you off sure

716
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,960
i would like to dig a little bit deeper

717
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,960
into actually a worm bin

718
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,120
because i'm actually starting it for the

719
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,640
first time i actually had a podcast

720
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,639
episode with queen of the sun grown not

721
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,278
sure if you know who she is and she

722
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:47,120
actually found out i was not doing

723
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,640
composting and just her

724
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,719
you could sense like a little bit of

725
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,038
like frustration in her like her just

726
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,798
passion came out of her like once you

727
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,879
said that like you aren't doing it why

728
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,558
aren't you doing it so like it really

729
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,640
like it's kind of like a whip me into

730
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,480
shape type thing right so i went out i

731
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,200
started doing research i'm about to go

732
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,558
buy i have a plan in place about to go

733
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,200
buy the bins right now i'm going to buy

734
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,558
the i think they're 18 gallon bins okay

735
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,319
i think i'm going to buy two of them i'm

736
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,839
going to double stack it i'll have worms

737
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,278
in there but just talking about the

738
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,199
inputs i think a lot of people probably

739
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,359
in myself included i'm kind of getting

740
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,480
caught up on what to input in there to

741
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,240
begin so my plan is just things i have

742
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,720
around the house right so junk mail i

743
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,720
get a lot of junk mail that i come in so

744
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,440
putting it through the shredder

745
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,360
adding that in there coffee grounds i

746
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,038
was going to put in there i have i have

747
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,719
basil plant and i have some house plants

748
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,440
that are kind of you know some leaves

749
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,240
like die off and stuff put that in there

750
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,480
you know lettuce any salads that i don't

751
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,240
eat banana peels

752
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,798
hair i guess you can put your own hair

753
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,558
in there as well sure you could so you

754
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,240
can even go that far i'm trying to think

755
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:53,918
of what other things i plan to add in

756
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,759
there that's kind of the main things

757
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,919
that i'm going to be starting with oh

758
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,519
grass clippings clippings from plants

759
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,960
outside as well if i'm like trimming

760
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,720
bushes or whatever i was going to throw

761
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,640
that in there those tend to be a little

762
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,600
bit more for traditional compost piles

763
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,919
especially

764
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:10,158
clippings um so you wouldn't recommend

765
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,240
them bringing them inside to your worm i

766
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,240
don't know if i would do that um you i

767
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,159
mean you could bring in some of those uh

768
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,679
items from the outside but you also got

769
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,440
to remember your pl your worms are only

770
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,120
going to eat so much

771
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,240
so the first thing you need to gauge is

772
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:26,719
how much food waste are you producing

773
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,038
and then how much do you need to augment

774
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,919
on top of that okay

775
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:31,440
uh

776
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,038
in general you want to start with

777
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,278
shredded paper and some fresh cocoa

778
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,200
as the very beginning the base and you

779
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,679
wet it you know you want to squeeze it

780
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,840
so that you know it pretty much is dry

781
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,679
it's not like squeezing out water but

782
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,439
maybe a little bit of a drip

783
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,038
um you don't want it to be too dry but

784
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,360
you kind of mix that all together that

785
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,960
paper and that cocoa and then you put

786
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,599
your worms down in that and then give

787
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,079
them a day or so to settle in

788
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,278
and then what you want to start using

789
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,879
all the most of those things that you

790
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,640
said are great

791
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,840
with banana peels apple corers things

792
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,600
like that you want to try to chop them

793
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:12,158
up because the smaller they are the

794
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,359
faster they're going to break down

795
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,159
berries are awesome they love berries

796
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,959
some

797
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,039
you'll have to kind of gauge sometimes

798
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,480
some plants

799
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,119
they don't like

800
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,360
especially the fresh leaves

801
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,278
they may not like them they might be a

802
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,278
little bit too bitter or a little bit

803
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,720
too

804
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:34,079
odorous

805
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,240
they don't some things they will

806
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,798
actually move away from until they break

807
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,919
down or dry out so you might need to you

808
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:43,918
might want to let the plant material dry

809
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,399
another thing you need to to keep an eye

810
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,080
on is your moisture levels so

811
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:49,519
if you're putting in a lot of coffee

812
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,240
grounds and

813
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,798
fruit and things like that you may want

814
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,038
to add some extra paper or cardboard or

815
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,558
things like that that will help balance

816
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,879
off some of that you don't want it to

817
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,398
get too moist in there right and you

818
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,880
want to make sure that there's some good

819
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,038
drainage at the bottom of the of

820
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,360
whatever the bin is that you put them in

821
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,640
gotcha yeah that's all good information

822
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,398
that i'm i'm definitely gonna be able to

823
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,278
use and like i mentioned i was gonna do

824
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,278
the kind of like the double stack bin so

825
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:18,720
the the the bin that's stacked inside

826
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,240
the other one is gonna have the holes

827
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,919
drilled through just like you can look

828
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,919
up any youtube video and see how they're

829
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,480
drilling holes all around the bottom and

830
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,480
then upon the top as well like not the

831
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,798
top lid i guess a lot of people don't do

832
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,480
the lid but they'll do like a round

833
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,240
they'll put a couple air holes at the

834
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,000
top just because you don't want it to be

835
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,240
a closed

836
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,079
uh environment you want some airflow to

837
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,679
be able to get in there so that's why

838
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,000
they put a couple of those holes at the

839
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,640
top yep and in general the worms aren't

840
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,319
going to escape because they don't like

841
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,840
light

842
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,879
so they're going to stay away from the

843
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,038
light

844
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,200
as soon as you open up the bin the lid

845
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,720
on the bin they're going to dig down in

846
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,880
because they don't they don't want to be

847
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,558
near the light and so even if you have

848
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,559
some holes on the side they're not going

849
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,558
to crawl out

850
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,398
because they're going to try to avoid

851
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,000
the light and then from my understanding

852
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:09,678
it should be you know once once they're

853
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
stacked in there

854
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,519
you do it kind of like on a weekly basis

855
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,200
to where on one week you're kind of

856
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,200
putting things on one side of the bin

857
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,558
you know lightly covering it and then

858
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,240
the next week you're putting something

859
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:21,918
on the other part of the bin and kind of

860
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,159
moving things over so that way there's

861
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,200
some kind of rotation going on yeah and

862
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,320
then i

863
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,000
i do quarters quarters okay kind of

864
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,319
quadrants

865
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
um and move them around and and again

866
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,879
you need to gauge

867
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,880
how fast the worms are consuming what

868
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,519
you're putting in if there's a lot of

869
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,440
food left from the previous one

870
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,319
you just let them go don't feed them

871
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,519
again

872
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,158
because you want to give them time you

873
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,240
don't want a large buildup of composters

874
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,440
and other types of

875
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,679
smaller

876
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,000
organisms and insects that you'll see

877
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,240
you will see some other small bugs

878
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
crawling around in there

879
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,720
but those are composters they're

880
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,159
breaking those foods down worms don't

881
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,079
actually eat the food in most cases

882
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,080
they're eating the molds and bacterias

883
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:12,720
and things that grow on the foods as

884
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,639
they break down and their movements and

885
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,200
shooting through things is what helps

886
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,440
break down some of those materials they

887
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,360
also love avocado that's a great thing

888
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,798
to use melons

889
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,119
things like that

890
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,960
you want to stay away from meats and

891
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,119
dairy

892
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,880
if you're going to be doing mail be

893
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,439
careful to get rid of those little

894
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,600
plastic view windows you don't want

895
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,200
those in there don't be shredding your

896
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,359
credit cards because then you're putting

897
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,200
really sharp plastic

898
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,798
into your worm bin and the worms aren't

899
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,480
going to like that very much and you

900
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:45,519
really don't want plastics in there

901
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,120
anyway

902
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,480
and

903
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:53,199
you know i i always feel a little uh

904
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,519
have mixed feelings about using mail in

905
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,919
general just because you don't know what

906
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,558
they're printing it with

907
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,799
um and everything that goes into

908
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,119
your worm bin is going to go into the

909
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,558
worms themselves and into the castings

910
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,000
and then those casts whatever goes into

911
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,878
those castings is going to go into your

912
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,398
plants and then into you

913
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:19,118
so um i try to uh i try to you know

914
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,598
a lot of inks are actually soap based

915
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,838
and they don't tend to be chemicals

916
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,679
most printers and things like that they

917
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:27,199
actually print with it's kind of a kind

918
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,480
of a soap

919
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,678
but you know i mean things that are

920
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,800
really really

921
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,800
lots of colors i try to stay away from

922
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,639
things that are very glossy

923
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,960
i'll stay away from and just try to use

924
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,838
things that are really just paper you

925
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,838
know

926
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:44,000
things that are you know bill electrical

927
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,039
bills and things like that those are

928
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,878
fine

929
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,918
but i would shy away from some of the

930
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,598
really you know glossy printed stuff

931
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,918
that comes in the mail and some of those

932
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,679
flyers and things like that

933
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,759
cardboard also cardboard is good

934
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,320
especially if you see recycling

935
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,520
symbols on it or made from recycled

936
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,320
cardboard things like that um so those

937
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:08,159
are those are all good inputs okay and

938
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,640
then from my understanding you know

939
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,319
roughly 30 days could be longer you know

940
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,480
there's a lot of variables with the

941
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,400
temperature and so on and so forth but

942
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,400
roughly 30 days then you kind of have

943
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,800
verma compost which you can use you can

944
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,880
take that and and top dress your plants

945
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,280
with it for example and then my question

946
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,440
is underneath so that second barrel is

947
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,920
going to be collecting the the waste

948
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,240
right the the verma vermi tea right

949
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,200
vermicompost tea type thing right it's a

950
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,279
leachate

951
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:38,000
yeah okay how long does it take for that

952
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,240
to develop and then

953
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,519
will it ever go like anaerobic like is

954
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,959
there a chance that like do you need to

955
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,159
be moving it around so it doesn't go

956
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,838
anaerobic and bad pathogens yeah i would

957
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,358
use it right away it's not something you

958
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:51,920
want to store it's not something you

959
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:54,719
want to keep it's uh you know you

960
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,720
i would check your bins once a week

961
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,078
at least and and then make sure that

962
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,759
there isn't a lot of you know that

963
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,519
moisture that water and i would use it

964
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,680
right away that leachate if you're gonna

965
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,280
use it i would not store it or keep it

966
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,598
around

967
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,440
you may not get any i don't get any in

968
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,680
my bin it just depends on your uh

969
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,440
moisture levels of your inputs okay and

970
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:15,838
then that should be diluted is that

971
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,519
correct yeah i i i mean if you're going

972
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,838
to topdress with it you are kind of

973
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:21,519
diluting it right you're not

974
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,599
in most cases when you put if you pour

975
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:26,159
something on the soil it's kind of going

976
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,320
to dilute naturally but yeah you could

977
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,920
mix it in with some water or something

978
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,960
as part of your feeding

979
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,119
um

980
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,559
absolutely cool

981
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,079
nice well i appreciate you taking some

982
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,000
time to answer my questions there

983
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,160
because i am about to start which is

984
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,280
exciting for me something new you know

985
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:45,838
yeah like i said i like to use the the

986
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,880
verma compost in a compost tea

987
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:51,358
so what i like to do is i use a paint

988
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,519
sprayer bag that's actually paint

989
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:55,598
strainer bags so when you can get them

990
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,079
at home depot they're super cheap

991
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,240
um and they're they're great they make

992
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,680
these like five gallon strainer bags and

993
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:05,118
you can put all of you you can put

994
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:07,118
vermicompost and leaf mold and all sorts

995
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,119
of things for whatever you're using for

996
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,880
your compost tea mixture

997
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,720
and they're great and they're easy to

998
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,800
clean so you can wash them and use them

999
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,719
over and over again but that's how i

1000
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,480
like to use my vermicompost instead of

1001
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:19,838
top dressing with it

1002
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,679
because

1003
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:24,239
i don't have enough if i had a lot of

1004
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:26,078
vermicompost then maybe i would probably

1005
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,159
top-dress with it more but to stretch it

1006
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:32,079
out i think a great way to do that is to

1007
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:35,519
use you know a cup or so in a compost

1008
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,440
hebrew and feed all of the plants off of

1009
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,000
that tea brew

1010
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,679
as opposed to just you know putting like

1011
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,960
a tablespoon or two on every one of the

1012
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:44,639
plants

1013
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,880
but that's a great that's also an easy

1014
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,639
way to do it is to just walk around put

1015
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,200
a tablespoon or two right on top of the

1016
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:53,199
soil and the water will naturally wash

1017
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,598
that stuff in and and

1018
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,039
provide the benefit gotcha i'm talking

1019
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,880
about compost teas a little bit more is

1020
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,239
there anything beyond the traditional

1021
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,920
things that we hear i mean just

1022
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,598
traditional you know people use five

1023
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,000
gallon buckets they fill about four

1024
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,720
gallons of water they put about a cup of

1025
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,239
compost in there then you know they add

1026
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,959
a sugar source

1027
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:14,639
brew for around 24 hours some people up

1028
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,720
to 48 hours however i've heard that

1029
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:20,159
there's issues going that long anything

1030
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:23,039
to kind of add to that process

1031
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,159
sure sure um there's a there's a couple

1032
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,159
of things actually that i can add to

1033
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,838
that number one if you're going to use

1034
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:29,920
molasses

1035
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:34,400
as your sugar component

1036
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,240
make sure to work that molasses into

1037
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,358
some warm water

1038
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,838
before you pour it into your compost tea

1039
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:45,519
mixture okay and the reason for that is

1040
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,559
that molasses are highly viscous

1041
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:47,759
and

1042
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,039
they may

1043
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,040
in some cases end up coding some of the

1044
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:54,960
bubbles

1045
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,039
that are being that are you know showing

1046
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,280
up as you're brewing and that coating

1047
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,920
causes that actually creates a small

1048
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,079
little anaerobic pocket

1049
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,680
and so you end up brewing some anaerobic

1050
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,680
bacteria as well as your aerobic

1051
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,879
bacteria and so you're not fully getting

1052
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,319
the benefits so if you take that

1053
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,320
molasses and mix it with some water

1054
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,000
first some warm water first to thin it

1055
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,440
down and kind of break up some of that

1056
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,719
viscosity and then pour it into your

1057
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,720
compost tea

1058
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,480
good to go uh so that's the first thing

1059
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:26,078
the second thing is

1060
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,800
you should be aerating the inside of

1061
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,519
your compost tea bag

1062
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,960
as well as the outside process that's

1063
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:36,960
brewing right so i run an airline into

1064
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,920
the bag itself

1065
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,838
so there's air bubbling inside the bag

1066
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,720
so again i'm not getting an anaerobic

1067
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:46,799
pocket if all that material kind of you

1068
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:49,039
know meshes together

1069
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,720
and some ways blocks out some of the

1070
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:53,039
access to the oxygen and the water

1071
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,799
that's floating around it

1072
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,279
it's going to create an anaerobic pocket

1073
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,640
as well so you want to keep air

1074
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,720
inside those bags as well as the air

1075
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,480
that's happening from the rotation of

1076
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:06,559
the tbr process

1077
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,639
third thing i'll mention is air stones

1078
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:11,838
can be problematic

1079
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:15,199
because they build up bacteria

1080
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:18,960
and not good bacteria over time so if

1081
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:20,480
you clean them and and or replace them

1082
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,519
you probably aren't going to run into

1083
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,838
any issues but i would highly recommend

1084
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,800
just going without the

1085
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,639
air stone on there just running the tube

1086
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,119
of air directly onto the inside of the

1087
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:35,679
bag or into the bottoms of your of your

1088
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,640
thing or use an air lift brewer like i

1089
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:42,078
use as a better approach as from as

1090
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:44,719
opposed to air stones and you'll avoid

1091
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,480
any possible issues from those so that's

1092
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:49,039
my recommendations

1093
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,318
from korean natural farming

1094
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:56,159
compost tea or liquid imo is usually

1095
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:58,960
brewed for 24 to 36 hours and we tend to

1096
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:02,799
watch it by smell

1097
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:06,159
so uh when thing you'll the smell will

1098
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,880
change over time of your brew you'll

1099
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,239
start out with a sweet and earthy smell

1100
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,599
of course because you have the molasses

1101
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:14,559
and some of those other sweeteners in

1102
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,680
there so you'll get this like earthy

1103
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,159
natural

1104
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,039
sweet smell to them and and over time

1105
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:21,279
though

1106
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:24,400
if you go too far

1107
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,200
you'll actually start to get some moldy

1108
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,599
or rotting smells and that means that

1109
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:31,439
you went too far so that's kind of one

1110
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,200
of the things that we watch for a lot in

1111
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,838
korean natural farming are smells and

1112
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,759
tastes uh when we're creating our

1113
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,920
preparations so yeah

1114
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,440
usually we don't go beyond 36 hours

1115
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,119
because you do start to run into some of

1116
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,679
those conditions where you've started to

1117
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,800
burn out the good bacteria and you're

1118
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:50,879
left with nothing but the bacteria who

1119
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,280
actually are the cleaners the p the

1120
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,519
bacteria that eat the other dead

1121
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,839
bacteria

1122
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,559
that's good information i use air stones

1123
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,719
right now and i might switch over but

1124
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,719
one tip that i you i've heard and what

1125
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,480
i've been doing is in between

1126
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:08,559
brews right so if i'm done brewing i'll

1127
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,400
take the air stones and i'll boil them

1128
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,920
right boil them in water so that'll kill

1129
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,920
off you know the temperature gets so

1130
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,440
high it'll kill off any bacteria on

1131
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,079
there at all so that's what i personally

1132
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,480
do in order to prevent some hydrogen

1133
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,440
peroxide could also be useful

1134
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,358
um

1135
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,800
but yeah i you know as long as you're

1136
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,440
cleaning them and maintaining them if

1137
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,720
you use them again and again every day

1138
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,480
and they're just sitting there bubbling

1139
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:32,000
away day after day

1140
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,838
you're going to start to attract molds

1141
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,358
and bacterias inside that stone that

1142
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:36,960
will do bad things

1143
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:39,598
makes sense so i know we're kind of

1144
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,519
going off course here from the the list

1145
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,119
of questions i gave you but i think it's

1146
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:44,559
really good that we're going because

1147
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,920
there's a lot of good information here

1148
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,599
is there anything else can you talk to

1149
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,720
us about some other things that you

1150
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,559
think that

1151
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,239
home gardeners can do as far as

1152
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:56,318
implementation practices for generative

1153
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:58,639
gardening yeah yeah so um again i think

1154
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:00,000
using composting is an important

1155
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:01,759
practice

1156
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
that you should consider

1157
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,720
one of the one of the great resources

1158
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,719
that most home gardeners have access to

1159
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,959
actually is leaf mold

1160
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,719
leaf mold is an incredible input and

1161
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,800
basically leaf mold is the stuff you

1162
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,358
find underneath your pile of leaves

1163
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,760
that's not quite soil but almost soil

1164
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:21,279
well that's pure humic

1165
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,599
humus

1166
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,560
and it's a beautiful beautiful organic

1167
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,480
material and you can actually take that

1168
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,920
and put that in

1169
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:35,440
with mix that in with your soils to kind

1170
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,480
of give them a inoculation

1171
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,639
actually

1172
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,559
of natural organisms and life that will

1173
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:44,400
help those plants get started if you're

1174
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:46,960
trying to follow into a living and

1175
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,720
organic

1176
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,880
type of an approach and and you know i

1177
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,959
think one of the things that i we should

1178
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,640
probably cover is is just real briefly

1179
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,960
soils because there's a lot of different

1180
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:59,039
terms for soils right you have

1181
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,960
soilless mediums

1182
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:04,318
you have soil soil itself is sand silt

1183
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,838
and clay

1184
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,639
humic material and

1185
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:11,440
right

1186
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,679
so you can't have uh

1187
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,159
actual soil if you don't have the

1188
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:18,559
biological compound the biology in there

1189
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:19,920
too that's what turns dirt into soil is

1190
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,880
the life

1191
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,039
the humic uh the humic materials and the

1192
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,480
life the biology

1193
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,358
you also hear a lot of these terms

1194
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,880
living soil and super soil right that's

1195
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:33,119
common uh

1196
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,800
terms of phrase that are used out there

1197
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,720
uh often

1198
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,519
super soil is really a enriched soil

1199
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:42,480
okay

1200
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:43,759
super soil is actually a specific recipe

1201
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,880
created by a

1202
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,720
soup by a specific person

1203
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,838
that had a specific set of materials and

1204
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,879
inputs in it

1205
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:56,400
that's right

1206
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:59,760
and then we coined uh super soil but the

1207
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,318
reality is it's an enhanced medium it's

1208
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,480
not a true soil some people will refer

1209
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:06,559
to it as a soilless medium because

1210
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,039
you're taking soil and then you're

1211
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,119
mixing in a lot of other compounds and

1212
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,838
substrates peats

1213
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,838
perlites

1214
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:19,838
crab meal lobster compost different

1215
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:22,559
types of things and when you do that

1216
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:25,199
you're kind of getting away from real

1217
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,440
true soil and you're you're creating

1218
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,000
what i like to refer to as enhanced or

1219
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,559
enriched soil and that tends to actually

1220
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,358
be my base so i actually use coasta

1221
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,239
maine stonington blend is my primary

1222
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,480
base

1223
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:41,118
has a tremendous amount of really good

1224
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,599
organic compounds it's made here in new

1225
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,920
england where i live coastal maine i'm

1226
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,920
in massachusetts so it's it's um it's a

1227
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,119
product that's produced here it has a

1228
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,318
lot of peat

1229
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:55,358
in it it has lobster compost

1230
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:57,838
it has some kelp some kelp meal and some

1231
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:59,759
other great things so it's an enriched

1232
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,239
medium

1233
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,280
living soil on the other hand is

1234
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,719
actually

1235
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,280
true

1236
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:10,719
natural soil

1237
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:15,200
that is alive and you're relying on the

1238
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:16,959
biology worms arthropods ciliates all

1239
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:18,639
the bacterial and fungal life that

1240
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,760
you're promoting

1241
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:21,838
to

1242
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,520
create the nutrients that the plant

1243
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:24,400
needs to survive

1244
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:25,679
right

1245
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,079
and

1246
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,318
to do true living soil as a home

1247
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:34,079
gardener as a home grower you need at

1248
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:36,000
least a 35 gallon pot

1249
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,000
which can be difficult for people

1250
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,920
indoors especially you need you need

1251
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,880
something on wheels

1252
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,720
a lot of people have been moving into uh

1253
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,200
no-till beds

1254
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:49,199
living soil beds and i mentioned

1255
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:52,000
no-tilling

1256
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:54,960
earlier on in the podcast right and so

1257
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,880
this is a fantastic approach for anybody

1258
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,119
who's looking to go

1259
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,559
completely regenerative completely

1260
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,920
closed loop

1261
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:06,719
is using living soil beds

1262
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,838
as opposed to pots

1263
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:12,719
having a two by two

1264
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:16,719
soil bed is actually is is a two by two

1265
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:19,598
pot is about 35 40 gallons of soil

1266
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:22,159
a three by three is about

1267
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:25,359
75 gallons of soil

1268
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:27,679
a four foot by four foot bed is actually

1269
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:29,759
about a hundred gallons of soil so

1270
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:30,799
imagine trying to lift 100 gallons of

1271
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,240
soil

1272
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,359
you can't do it you actually have to

1273
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,279
shovel

1274
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:36,799
the soil out of those beds if you don't

1275
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,640
have them on wheels

1276
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,200
i've seen people fill their tent with

1277
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:43,279
one big 4x4

1278
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:45,679
living soil bed it's a beautiful

1279
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,040
approach

1280
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:50,078
you're allowing

1281
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:53,119
you're using cover crops

1282
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:56,960
you're utilizing worms

1283
00:47:53,119 --> 00:48:00,000
you're using utilizing um natural

1284
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,480
type you're using companion plants

1285
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,639
uh which is also great

1286
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,039
and you're allowing the

1287
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:08,879
you're building basically a natural

1288
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:12,079
environment

1289
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,480
that's alive and as close to

1290
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,640
a biodynamic approach as possible as

1291
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,240
close to a natural approach as possible

1292
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,879
you're trying to create the outdoors

1293
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:22,159
inside you're allowing the plant to

1294
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,358
naturally

1295
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:25,838
manage

1296
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:28,558
the biology and the soil to get what it

1297
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:29,838
needs and it's a fantastic approach i

1298
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,119
have a friend

1299
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:35,838
blue

1300
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:38,960
who uses avocado tech to help keep his

1301
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:43,199
living soil beds going and he

1302
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:45,440
he's gone 16 17 cycles

1303
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:47,919
in the same beds

1304
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,639
all he does is chop the plant he leaves

1305
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,480
all the roots and everything in

1306
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:54,879
he lets leaves and things fall to the

1307
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,639
ground he's got cover crops in there

1308
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,720
that he chops and drops and smashes down

1309
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,519
but he also uses this great thing called

1310
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:05,279
avocado tech yeah i'm actually uh having

1311
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:07,679
him on the podcast soon to talk all

1312
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,640
about avocado awesome yeah he's he's a

1313
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:12,799
fantastic guy and a great friend of mine

1314
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,558
uh we actually went to a regenerative

1315
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,519
conference together which is where i met

1316
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,599
him

1317
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,199
and his avocado tech is fantastic and so

1318
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:22,400
he makes kind of a guacamole

1319
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:26,239
with some

1320
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:29,039
crab meal and some other inputs azomite

1321
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:31,838
and some good natural inputs makes this

1322
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:36,079
guacamole and stuffs it back in the in

1323
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:39,759
the avocado skin and puts it face down

1324
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:42,160
on the soil and what happens is the

1325
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,640
worms actually come up out of the soil

1326
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:47,279
bed and run through the avocado

1327
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:49,598
and move and actually bring all that

1328
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,519
nutrient goodness back down into the

1329
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:55,200
soil naturally for him

1330
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:58,480
he put uses three avocados

1331
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,679
an entire cycle that's his whole deal

1332
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,519
that's incorrect and other than that he

1333
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:03,358
just puts he just has water dripping

1334
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,440
with the blue mat system

1335
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:08,239
um which is an incredible water saving

1336
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,039
system i love blue mat

1337
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:11,439
i

1338
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,679
don't i myself

1339
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,838
don't run i try to use as little water

1340
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:18,000
as possible so i don't

1341
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:21,039
i keep my plants wet

1342
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,960
but i don't water to run off which a lot

1343
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:25,119
of people do

1344
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:29,119
i'm just trying to use just as much

1345
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:31,838
water as i need to keep the plants wet

1346
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,760
i'm not trying to soak them down

1347
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:35,679
but i'm and i'm trying to make sure that

1348
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,160
obviously they don't develop dry spots

1349
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:41,598
but i'm just trying to keep them wet

1350
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:43,118
blue mats are a great system that is a

1351
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,039
passive system even you don't really

1352
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,400
even need any power for them you can use

1353
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:48,318
gravity

1354
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,519
and basically fill you fill a bucket of

1355
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:53,838
water

1356
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:56,400
and um you use these uh they have these

1357
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:58,639
carrots these electrostatic carrots that

1358
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,280
basically sit in the soil and detect

1359
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:03,838
soil moisture and based on the level of

1360
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,519
moisture they let water drip

1361
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:07,838
and so you get these little drips of

1362
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:10,480
water all day long and that's actually

1363
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:13,279
one of the most efficient watering

1364
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,079
systems around because you're allowing

1365
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,800
the plants actually to dictate the

1366
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,119
moisture level in the soil and they just

1367
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,119
get as much as they need they're really

1368
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,519
thirsty you're going to use up some more

1369
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:28,318
water but you're only using what the

1370
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:30,480
plant needs you're not pouring a ton on

1371
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,759
and having runoff and then throwing that

1372
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,920
out

1373
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,599
you're not you know trying to recycle

1374
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,200
you don't need to it's all

1375
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,079
keeping maintained and the only thing

1376
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:42,239
that you know it only drips as needed

1377
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,760
they're really really great systems i

1378
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:45,118
really enjoy using the bluemount i'm not

1379
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,400
using them i don't have them plugged in

1380
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,400
right now but i'm probably going to be

1381
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,680
going back to them too and they tend to

1382
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,920
develop some amazing root balls as well

1383
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,838
really really impressive root structures

1384
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,760
when you use the when you use that type

1385
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:59,199
of an approach i've been using bluemax

1386
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,359
and you see pictures online you can see

1387
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,199
like the roots coming up going towards

1388
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:04,799
the dripper you know where it's actually

1389
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,558
dripping and i believe it can kind of

1390
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,920
clog your lines too right if you're not

1391
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,280
if you're not keeping an eye on it the

1392
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,480
root will go all the way up into the

1393
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,640
there and clog it so you got to be

1394
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,199
careful there but yeah once you get that

1395
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:17,598
saturation rate down as far as what you

1396
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,118
want yeah in that container stick the

1397
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,440
carrot in there you got it hooked up to

1398
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,039
your res just all gravity fed you know

1399
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,639
if you're using organics you're just top

1400
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:26,159
dressing the medium staying that

1401
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:27,838
moisture level that it needs to be for

1402
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:29,759
that those microbes to break down those

1403
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:32,318
amendments and it's it's so much

1404
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,760
hands-off compared to a synthetic

1405
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:36,159
bottled nutrient line where you're

1406
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,000
mixing nutrients every week sometimes

1407
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:39,358
twice a week in order to you know hand

1408
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,800
water your plant or i mean you can

1409
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:42,318
always put you can always do that

1410
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,160
synthetic nutrients in the blue mat as

1411
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:46,719
well but just in general like you have

1412
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,719
to be careful yeah yeah because you'll

1413
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,480
clog though you can clog those lines if

1414
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:51,598
you're careful you'd have to flush them

1415
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,358
often

1416
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,119
um so you definitely have to be careful

1417
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,558
especially with some of the organic

1418
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,039
nutrients

1419
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:02,079
some of those tend to be uh thick like i

1420
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:06,880
used to use uh medi1 from green planet

1421
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:09,519
and that stuff is like just sludge

1422
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:12,559
the main base uh but it's an organic

1423
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,920
medical base it's a great product really

1424
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,559
beautiful but i definitely wouldn't have

1425
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,318
fed that through the blue mats

1426
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,920
so one more thing let's talk about

1427
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:22,318
before we wrap things up i kind of want

1428
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,000
to get into cover crops a little bit so

1429
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:25,679
i've been using cover crops i just use

1430
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
the white dutch clover right now i know

1431
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:29,440
it's well known for nitrogen fixation

1432
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,838
right it's going to take nitrogen in the

1433
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,358
air convert it to a form that's usable

1434
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:36,000
by the plant the plant will be able to

1435
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,440
uptake it now can you talk to us just

1436
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,519
about your knowledge about cover crops

1437
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,358
and what other cover crops can we be

1438
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:43,280
using in an indoor environment home

1439
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:46,719
growers you know the benefits of of

1440
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,960
cover crops yeah i um i i there's a lot

1441
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:50,959
of mixes out there already on the market

1442
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,440
and and most of them have a combination

1443
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,679
of different types of clovers

1444
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,679
white clovers red clovers

1445
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,078
which actually have different benefits

1446
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,118
both the red and the white clovers

1447
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,960
vetch

1448
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,358
sweet peas

1449
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,039
different types of grasses

1450
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:09,519
and

1451
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,759
having a mix of different types of cover

1452
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:14,480
crops is actually a benefit

1453
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:18,079
i think ray archuleta is up to like 16

1454
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:20,159
or 17 different crops uh in his mix that

1455
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,000
he's been testing and that he's using

1456
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,440
out in his fields for cattle and things

1457
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,679
like that

1458
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,358
it depends on

1459
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,519
you know what you're

1460
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:31,279
what you're trying to accomplish i know

1461
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:33,759
there's also been some information out

1462
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,798
recently about clover

1463
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:40,079
and i start avoiding clover in some

1464
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:41,119
cases because mites love clover oh

1465
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,318
interesting

1466
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:46,318
so um although you might you know you

1467
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:48,480
might not necessarily have mites on your

1468
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:50,558
plants they might be in your clover so

1469
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,318
it could be a trap plant might be good

1470
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,599
for a trap plant to keep the mites off

1471
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:55,838
of your plant

1472
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:58,160
uh it might encourage them to go after

1473
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:00,239
the clover because they love clover

1474
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:02,798
and i know there's a few folks out there

1475
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:05,358
i think tad hussey possibly kiss

1476
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:08,079
organics or one of the other gentlemen

1477
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:11,039
he actually stopped using clovers in his

1478
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,318
mixes because of the mite problems that

1479
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:13,599
can develop especially with your

1480
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:16,079
outdoors

1481
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,960
using clover in your mixes

1482
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,240
so

1483
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,519
i love vetch

1484
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:23,118
i love sweet peas beans are also great

1485
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:24,559
if you plant beans

1486
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,760
rosemary

1487
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,599
thyme

1488
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,880
um even throat you know you can throw

1489
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,599
some of your companion plants in there

1490
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:34,200
as well calendula

1491
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:36,079
is a great plant to put in there

1492
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:37,919
marigolds

1493
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,640
you can put those in there as well they

1494
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,720
have good ipm benefits they help keep

1495
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,719
pests away

1496
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:46,078
lavender thyme

1497
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:48,558
rosemary

1498
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,400
things like that and if you're doing a

1499
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,240
living soil bed

1500
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,160
you may want to consider some of the

1501
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:56,479
perennial forms of that because there's

1502
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:58,639
like climbing forms of rosemary and

1503
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,679
thyme that you could grow for years and

1504
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:03,358
years and kind of you know grow it uh

1505
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:05,118
throughout your bed or in your

1506
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:07,838
environment and

1507
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:10,720
maybe bonsai it even if you want but

1508
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:12,719
having a good variety of plants in your

1509
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:15,279
mix is really important

1510
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:16,959
blue even i think he even has squash

1511
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,880
growing

1512
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,199
and some other vegetables and things in

1513
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,680
his living soil beds as well but yeah no

1514
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,679
i i like the veggies and grasses and i

1515
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:27,759
still use some clover in my mix as well

1516
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:28,960
because of that nitrogen fixation i

1517
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,119
think some of the thing that people

1518
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,318
should also remember though is that to

1519
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:35,440
get the full benefits out of club cover

1520
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:38,159
crops

1521
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,599
you need to chop and drop

1522
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:42,000
explain that because i don't think

1523
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:44,798
people know what it exactly it is right

1524
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,719
so um in general right

1525
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:51,039
you should never have naked soil

1526
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:53,759
keep your soil covered

1527
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:55,440
i like to use rice holes

1528
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,160
and a mix of

1529
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,000
i do a mix with some wood shavings some

1530
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:02,798
bokashi

1531
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,239
and then a bunch of rice holes and i put

1532
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:07,280
about an inch

1533
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:08,639
inch and a half deep on the top of my

1534
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,440
soil

1535
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:13,679
keep your soil covered at all times

1536
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,318
indoors or outdoors

1537
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:18,639
exposed soil outdoor is actually one of

1538
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:20,318
the problem one of the

1539
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,759
things that is causing climate change

1540
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:23,039
and co2

1541
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,760
release

1542
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:27,679
again as they till the fields

1543
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,839
they turn the soil over and expose the

1544
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:31,519
carbon in the soil to the oxygen which

1545
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:34,159
creates co2

1546
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:35,440
carbon oxygen co2

1547
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,239
and it

1548
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:41,519
rises and they've actually photographed

1549
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:45,358
nasa has uh maps

1550
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:48,960
that show the growth the the increases

1551
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:50,798
in co2 release from space the increases

1552
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,318
in co2 release at the times when they're

1553
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:55,599
tilling all the fields

1554
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:57,679
you can actually see this from space

1555
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,119
um so it's it's it's definitely

1556
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,399
something that that

1557
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:04,720
you want to try to uh to avoid but um so

1558
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,519
you wanna you wanna use those mulches uh

1559
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:09,358
those green mulches or cover crops are

1560
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:12,159
also beneficial the cover crops

1561
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:14,400
themselves will in some cases release

1562
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:16,798
beneficial things into the soil

1563
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,358
uh nitrogen fixing like you were saying

1564
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:21,920
clover releases nitrogen actually that's

1565
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:24,159
a great thing for your lawn don't get

1566
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,079
rid of the clover in your lawn add the

1567
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:28,558
clover back in because if you add the

1568
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:30,640
clover back in you don't need scots

1569
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,960
fertilizer on your lawn because the

1570
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:33,920
clover will help your grass you don't

1571
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,358
need it

1572
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,200
get all the nitrogen you need from the

1573
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:39,440
worms and the clover

1574
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:39,439
but

1575
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,318
so you want to then um what's called

1576
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:47,519
chop and drop so

1577
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:49,920
you chop those cover crops you chop them

1578
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:51,519
down you cut them snip snip snip snip

1579
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,358
like mowing

1580
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,920
you don't cut them all the way to the

1581
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:57,679
ground or kill them the idea is you want

1582
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,599
to cut them so that you're leaving some

1583
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:01,279
of the plant to grow back like you're

1584
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,920
mowing the lawn almost

1585
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:06,798
and then you leave that material in the

1586
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,760
pot in the soil to become a natural

1587
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:09,679
mulch

1588
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:13,119
when plants grow

1589
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:17,358
they are carbon capture machines

1590
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:20,960
everything that a plant produces

1591
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:23,199
is car comes with a carbon exchange okay

1592
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26,079
everything whether it's their smell

1593
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:28,719
their body their leaves their stems

1594
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:31,280
their fruits all of it

1595
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:32,798
has to do with a carbon exchange and the

1596
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,040
and are created

1597
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:37,199
they have carbon they're part of carbon

1598
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:40,079
they have carbon everything has carbon

1599
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:43,039
in it and so plants are

1600
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:45,440
as they grow they are capturing carbon

1601
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:46,558
and other minerals and nutrients

1602
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,760
and

1603
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:50,480
if you

1604
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:53,760
drop them directly into the soil and

1605
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:56,000
allow them to go back into the ground

1606
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,960
you're re-nutrifying you're putting

1607
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,679
those minerals that carbon

1608
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:04,159
and those vitamins and nutrients back

1609
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:08,239
into the soil where they can be

1610
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:11,199
recaptured by the biology and the plants

1611
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:13,679
okay so cover crops

1612
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:15,838
themselves are beneficial because they

1613
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:17,598
help retain moisture in the soil they

1614
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:19,039
help keep your soil

1615
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,039
covered

1616
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:23,039
and in many in some cases as we were

1617
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:25,759
saying they'll help add

1618
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:27,759
nutrients back into the soil

1619
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,960
cutting them down and dropping them in

1620
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:33,520
also helps add re-mineralize the soil if

1621
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,199
you take that stuff out what's happening

1622
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:38,000
is those plants are leaching minerals

1623
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:40,318
and nutrients out of the soil

1624
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,280
and then if you chop them and take them

1625
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:43,039
away

1626
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,440
you basically lost all those minerals

1627
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:47,679
and nutrients from your soil if you drop

1628
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,798
them back in

1629
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:50,318
you're putting them back in the ground

1630
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:52,880
where they came from

1631
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:55,358
so that's kind of the idea and then

1632
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,200
ideally to really take advantage of chop

1633
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:58,480
and drop you need worms

1634
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:00,960
you need

1635
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,639
biology in the soil that's going to

1636
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,798
break down

1637
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:06,400
those

1638
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:08,960
compounds

1639
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,240
back into

1640
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,880
minerals and nutrients that the plant

1641
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:14,879
can absorb gotcha that makes sense yeah

1642
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,400
i've been practicing chop and drop for a

1643
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,000
couple grows now

1644
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,519
and yeah it's something i'm definitely

1645
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,838
going to continue to do because it makes

1646
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:23,519
sense you know it makes sense and

1647
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:25,519
you're saving on nutrients in a sense

1648
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:27,599
right i mean if you're putting it back

1649
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:29,519
into the system that it was in it's just

1650
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,039
breaking down and then the plant is

1651
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,719
uptaking it eventually and i think a

1652
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:33,920
perfect example of chop and drop which a

1653
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:35,439
lot of people don't really think of is

1654
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,760
when you're mowing your lawn right you

1655
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,838
should keep those lawn clippings there

1656
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,040
as ugly as they may be sometimes right

1657
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:42,960
keep them there because those are going

1658
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:44,480
to break down and that'll rejuvenate

1659
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,039
your lawn like you mentioned you get to

1660
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:49,199
spend less money on scots fertilizer if

1661
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:51,519
you do it that way so don't rake your

1662
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:54,000
leaves mulch them in mulch them in yeah

1663
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:56,159
good point absolutely because that's all

1664
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,280
fantastic beneficial nutrients back into

1665
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:59,519
the soil

1666
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,319
when you haul those things away you're

1667
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:04,960
robbing your environment of those those

1668
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:07,519
great great natural materials i mean you

1669
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:10,318
look at the rain forest

1670
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:12,239
right the rainforest nobody cleans and

1671
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:14,639
picks those leaves up

1672
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:17,118
right nobody the plants drop they fall

1673
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:19,679
they die animals swing through break

1674
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,519
stuff eat stuff

1675
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:23,838
and they're these extremely healthy

1676
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:26,318
environments why because everything's

1677
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:27,838
is retained within that environment

1678
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:29,599
nothing gets taken out of that

1679
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:30,798
environment and taken away

1680
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,200
well said

1681
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:35,280
well we covered quite a bit in this

1682
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:36,879
podcast i mean this hour flew by

1683
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,160
definitely a lot of great information

1684
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,079
here i definitely think there's some

1685
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:42,558
information here that home gardeners

1686
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:44,160
will be able to grasp onto let me

1687
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,440
explain it in a very beginner friendly

1688
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:46,879
manner hopefully some of you guys will

1689
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,639
be able to implement this into your

1690
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,240
gardens you know i'm doing composting

1691
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,719
now i'm doing chop and drop we covered a

1692
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:54,879
whole bunch of other things but really

1693
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:56,480
in the grand scheme of things we didn't

1694
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,559
cover a lot at all when it comes to

1695
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,280
regenerative gardening there's so much

1696
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,559
more to it and maybe in the future yeah

1697
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,160
yeah we just scratched the surface so

1698
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,839
maybe sometime in the future we can have

1699
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:07,279
you on for a part two and kind of get

1700
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:09,519
deeper into things because i definitely

1701
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,960
think there's a lot of other things that

1702
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:13,119
we could have covered

1703
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,960
so yeah i appreciate your time here i

1704
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:16,640
encourage people to

1705
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,920
look for opportunities

1706
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:19,358
to

1707
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,440
use

1708
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:23,679
the things they have around them in some

1709
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,960
way shape or form whether it's your food

1710
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:26,719
waste

1711
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,798
whether it's your

1712
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,558
leaves

1713
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:34,239
grass clippings

1714
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:37,280
plants all of the stuff around you are

1715
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:38,798
natural beneficial items that can be

1716
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,400
incorporated into your garden in some

1717
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:41,358
way shape or form

1718
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,880
keep your

1719
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:45,519
soils covered

1720
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,798
don't have naked soil

1721
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:50,798
and look for opportunities to

1722
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:53,199
keep the plants

1723
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:55,440
in the ground keep the ground intact

1724
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:57,439
when you harvest as well right so chop

1725
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,240
the plant at the stock leave the roots

1726
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:02,798
in there let that biology

1727
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:04,399
let that net all those natural wonderful

1728
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:05,599
things that are going on in that soil

1729
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,920
continue

1730
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:10,240
don't rip out that

1731
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,760
don't rip it out plant right next to it

1732
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:14,078
keep moving around

1733
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,440
if you're in small pots obviously you're

1734
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,359
gonna be

1735
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,760
having to redo those pots you can't

1736
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:20,960
really do uh living soil in a five

1737
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,880
gallon pot

1738
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,000
as i was saying earlier so if you're in

1739
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,640
pots

1740
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,000
you can actually recycle your soil even

1741
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:32,400
so when you're done with your cycle

1742
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,719
of that plant

1743
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,119
take the roots take the roots and rinse

1744
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:39,118
the soil off of it you can soak those

1745
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,880
roots in water

1746
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:43,119
and pull that will pull sugars and

1747
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,960
exodites out of them and you can use

1748
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,640
them also to feed your plants and water

1749
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,159
your plants with

1750
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:52,960
you can

1751
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:55,199
save that soil and actually add compost

1752
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,240
and natural things back into it and let

1753
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:58,558
it cook

1754
01:04:56,239 --> 01:05:00,558
over the winter

1755
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,240
and in the spring you can utilize it you

1756
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,440
can do it in bins in your basement as

1757
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:05,598
well

1758
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,280
you could take a mix in worm castings so

1759
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:10,160
take your worm castings mix it in with

1760
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:12,079
some of that used soil

1761
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:13,358
and maybe do a little avocado tech on

1762
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,960
top

1763
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:16,318
and you won't after a while if you have

1764
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,920
a good amount of soil and you have a

1765
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:19,838
good process going you don't actually

1766
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,039
have to go buy soil either

1767
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:22,400
you can build up to the point where you

1768
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,520
have a good pile of soil that you

1769
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,440
recycle

1770
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:27,599
and you can re

1771
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,960
you can re-mineralize so that you can

1772
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,798
use it over and over again that's

1773
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,199
another place where you can look to

1774
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:34,960
preserve and save some money and

1775
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:37,679
try to do some more regenerative

1776
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,440
practices and really looking to

1777
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:41,279
again reduce waste i think that's the

1778
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,880
best thing to do look look for

1779
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,160
opportunities to use the things around

1780
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,280
you

1781
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:46,318
don't

1782
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,720
if you're in the middle of kansas you

1783
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:51,199
don't need oyster shells

1784
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:52,798
well said well wrapping things up how

1785
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:54,879
can the listeners find you and what do

1786
