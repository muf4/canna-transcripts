1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
coming up on garden talk when you

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,240
completely

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,320
saturate your medium and get it to what

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,160
we call field capacity

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,359
and which is where you can pick it up

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,759
and squeeze it

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,879
and you don't get maybe but one drop

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,719
come off your hand

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,800
that's how moist your soil should start

10
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:21,278
out the stomata tend to open

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,800
right before sunrise or right before

12
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,879
your indoor lights come on

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,359
so if you can spray 20 to 30 minutes

14
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,919
before sunrise or before your lights

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,800
turn on

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,280
the stomata will open and soak up what

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,960
you just sprayed onto the leaf surface

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,880
and then you have what's called a green

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,120
manure or a green mulch

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,160
and then that will decompose in place

21
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,718
also and help

22
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,640
boost the nitrogen in your soil the best

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,920
advice for anybody starting new on an

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,640
organic route

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,679
is do less you're going to want to do a

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,119
bunch more stuff

27
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:58,480
because you feel like you're not doing a

28
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:59,679
whole lot but do less

85
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,518
we're going to talk about

86
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,280
you know getting started with organic

87
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,159
gardening and kind of what you do

88
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,759
in your garden um with organic inputs

89
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,199
growing organically so

90
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,799
first before we get into the growth side

91
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,560
of things can you just tell us a little

92
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
bit about yourself and how you got into

93
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,400
growing

94
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,760
well i got into growing mainly as a

95
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,719
medical benefit

96
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,399
um i broke my leg and sprang both my

97
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:08,000
ankles on a trampoline

98
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,120
and you know i got some injuries from

99
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,158
that and then

100
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,480
just from that i got lower back pain

101
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,919
from trying to take care of the lower

102
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,959
leg injuries

103
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:21,199
so that helps out a lot and then i got

104
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,680
into growing a lot because

105
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,518
my mom also has an autoimmune disease

106
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,159
and that also seems to help her out a

107
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,640
lot

108
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,759
nice yeah actually back in 2006 i broke

109
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,839
my well i

110
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,878
tore ligaments in my ankle from a bmx

111
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,878
bike accident

112
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,878
and i remember whenever i put my leg

113
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,639
down like the blood would just rush down

114
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:39,199
into my leg and it would be extremely

115
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,000
painful

116
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,759
swollen yeah and and cannabis was one of

117
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,598
the things that actually

118
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,039
solved that for me you know it covered

119
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,119
in my pain so

120
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,120
um you know that's kind of one of the

121
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,640
things that helped me over the years

122
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,000
and so you have a youtube channel you uh

123

something i really like so

152
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:57,040
cool all right let's talk about organic

153
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,319
gardening so what do you typically use

154
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,360
for a medium i typically

155
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,079
make my own medium i've been technically

156
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,720
reusing my own medium for around seven

157
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,959
or eight years now

158
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,360
and just re-amending with uh worm

159
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,478
castings and compost and

160
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,680
dry amendments and you know reworking

161
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,079
that in there and keep

162
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,079
using that same soil so what does it

163
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,918
consist of what was kind of the star was

164
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,478
it like a peat based or a cocoa yeah it

165
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,599
wasn't

166
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,079
based okay do you know what the ratios

167
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,039
were

168
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,319
on it it was the the the one-third

169
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,879
aeration one-third

170
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,839
sphagnum and one-third compost worm

171
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,800
castings the

172
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,239
you know what a lot of the recipes out

173
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,879
there on the internet

174
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,079
are got it and then what type of compost

175
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,360
you use i think i remember from one of

176
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,879
your videos used a

177
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,038
different type of compost compared to

178
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,959
what other people use i like using a

179
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,159
mushroom compost because it's a little

180
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,038
bit more

181
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,880
fungally dominated and having that

182
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,318
little more fungally dominated compost

183
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,319
in your soil mix

184
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,360
helps the uptake of phosphorus and

185
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,520
potassium

186
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,800
which are key elements later on in the

187
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,639
plant's life

188
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,400
and all throughout the plant's life but

189
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,439
and then what do you use for aeration

190
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:14,079
um i like to use rice holes and

191
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,399
clay pebbles i'll make sure those two

192
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,560
the clay pebbles don't break down

193
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,000
as quickly as the rice holes and then

194
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,000
the rice oils actually break down

195
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,439
a little bit and add a little silica as

196
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,478
they do break down

197
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,399
so a third a third a third of that

198
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:29,680
do you add any additional amendments on

199
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,038
top of that to begin

200
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,720
um that would i would call my base soil

201
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,800
and i would just plant like little

202
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,919
seedlings or

203
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,079
cuttings and into my base soil

204
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,198
and then i would take a portion of that

205
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,359
and also

206
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,639
add a bunch of amendments to that and

207
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,038
use that for

208
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,720
older plants more maturing plants got it

209
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:53,439
now what containers do you usually start

210
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,280
in

211
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,959
uh i usually start in either solo cups

212
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,758
or

213
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,719
similarly sized nursery pots okay and

214
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,000
then

215
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,000
i'm assuming you're transplanted into

216
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,279
larger containers at what point do you

217
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,639
usually transplant and then what

218
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,519
containers do you usually kind of go

219
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,560
into

220
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,719
i usually go from the solo cup size

221
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,079
up to maybe a one gallon and then maybe

222
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,120
to the the final

223
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,918
home that's mainly for space saving that

224
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,879
makes sense

225
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,719
so your initial mix has compost in it

226
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,680
right it has nutrients already in it for

227
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,240
the plant

228
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,038
at what point do you do your first

229
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,400
feeding

230
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,598
um about 30 days in actually about two

231
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,560
or three weeks after

232
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,598
they're you know sprouted or cutting or

233
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,598
whatever

234
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,959
they are i'll transplant them into that

235
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,719
one gallon

236
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,120
and inside that one gallon will have

237
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,639
some of that soil that i mixed up with

238
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,199
the amendments

239
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,560
and then i'll transplant it into the

240
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,960
seven gallon

241
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,879
and i'll also have amendments in that so

242
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,598
throughout that entire time span it's

243
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,919
getting food

244
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,519
and at the 30 days i'll top dress that

245
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,598
makes sense and then

246
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,959
uh when you transplant are you using any

247
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,719
mycorrhizal fungi in there

248
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,038
are you adding in like any worm castings

249
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,319
or anything like that or what

250
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:12,159
um i like to use a fungi

251
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,240
like mycorrhizae fungi want to have it

252
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,639
and if i don't i'll just go straight in

253
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,639
to the soil because when in a living

254
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,680
soil there a lot of it's already there

255
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,319
to begin with so adding some more never

256
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,639
hurts

257
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,720
but if i don't have it i'll just go and

258
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
transplant it right into my living soil

259
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,680
and then i don't think we talked about

260
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,318
what sat what type of containers do you

261
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,599
use do you

262
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,000
prefer plastic fabric or what

263
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
i like a plastic one there in the

264
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,719
smaller containers the one gallon solar

265
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,599
cup

266
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,200
and then fabric for the rest of the time

267
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,120
just easier to deal with the smaller

268
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,720
plants in the plastic containers

269
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,480
that make sense easier to transplant out

270
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,160
of right yeah okay

271
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,839
and then so your first feeding comes

272
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,199
around day 30

273
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,200
at that point you're saying they're in

274
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,720
their final containers which you use

275
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,560
seven gallon containers as your final

276
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,720
containers what does your first feeding

277
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,639
consist of and how do you apply it

278
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,480
well my first feeding consists of

279
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:08,000
literally a top dress of

280
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,159
craft pines uh build a soil craft blend

281
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,120
and uh it has a good mixture of a little

282
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,759
bit of everything

283
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,360
kelp alfalfa meal some rock dust some

284
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,039
oyster shell powder

285
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,519
just a nice mix a little bit of

286
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,599
everything and i'll use uh

287
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,120
two tablespoons per gallon of medium

288
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,839
which happens to work out to be about a

289
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,959
quarter cup

290
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,640
per seven gallon pot i'll top dress that

291
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,639
in and i'll

292
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,559
rake the amendments in to the top layer

293
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,120
of the soil a little bit

294
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,000
and i'll water that in sometimes i'll

295
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,560
use the compost

296
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,720
tea and water that in got it we'll talk

297
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,119
about compost teas in a little bit here

298
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,080
um now when you top dress do you also do

299
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,278
you do any

300
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,480
mulch layers or cover crops at all

301
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:54,159
i i like to use like barley straw as a

302
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,080
mulch i heavily endorse the use of cover

303
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,360
crops i just don't use them in my indoor

304
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,000
garden

305
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,560
i use them more in like my beds outside

306
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,039
and

307
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,119
stuff like that i find the cover crops

308
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,000
in pots to be a little more work

309
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,480
than they might be worth if you had a

310
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,639
decent like a 4x8

311
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,120
living soil bed that might be worth

312
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:18,078
doing the cover crops as well

313
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,360
but in smaller containers i don't see a

314
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,239
huge benefit

315
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,800
okay now when do you usually when you do

316
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,879
use

317
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,479
cover crops say outdoors when are you

318
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,799
typically planting them

319
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
typically probably a good month or two

320
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,159
before

321
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,800
the intended crop is planted in that

322
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,399
spot

323
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,679
and then i assume since the cover crops

324
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,200
growing up you're kind of like cutting

325
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,278
it down so you're able to

326
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,959
to plant in that seedling so it's not

327
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,519
yeah so lights

328
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,199
down to that spot and then you have

329
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,919
what's called a green manure

330
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,120
or a green mulch and then that will uh

331
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,439
decompose in place

332
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,959
also and help boost the nitrogen in your

333
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,800
soil so

334
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,838
often called chop and drop technique is

335
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,719
that kind of what you're referring to

336
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,000
there yep okay

337
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,639
so you're chopping it down putting it

338
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,958
right down as a mulch layer on top

339
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,958
do you put any you said barley straw i

340
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,479
use barley straw as well

341
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:11,039
do you put that over that green layer at

342
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,839
all or no

343
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,879
if i'm using them in combination i'll

344
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,399
lay the

345
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,799
cover crop seed down first and make sure

346
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,240
you know that's nice and watered in and

347
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,599
whatnot and then i'll lay the barley

348
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,039
straw over top of it

349
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,120
and they'll grow up in between the

350
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:30,559
barley straw and it creates a nice

351
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,839
like mat of protection on your soil

352
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,439
i've been doing something similar to

353
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,320
that and uh yeah it's been working out

354
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,360
pretty well for sure

355
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,920
all right let's take a step back and

356
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,720
talk about ipm so integrated pest

357
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,719
management

358
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,079
is there anything that you do in order

359
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,120
to prevent pests from

360
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:48,239
getting into your garden well other than

361
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,879
doing a weekly ipm spray of like

362
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,600
essential oils or a treatment enzyme

363
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,000
cleaner

364
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,839
or even just water just spraying your

365
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,320
plants down with water

366
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,760
just being diligent of not going out for

367
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
a hike and then going to visit the

368
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,200
plants

369
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:07,039
you know just things like that having a

370
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,079
very clean garden area

371
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:13,360
don't have any spots for pests to hide

372
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:15,278
and it's a lot easier to keep them from

373
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
attacking whatever plants you're trying

374
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,439
to keep protected

375
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,720
and then another thing i like to do is

376
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,800
um

377
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,000
i'll plant different bait plants per se

378
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,599
around my property and the

379
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,440
the insects will like to attack those

380
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,240
plants more and stay away from the

381
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,079
plants that

382
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,360
i would like to keep around what do you

383
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,039
use for bait plants

384
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,519
well that that's kind of the hard thing

385
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,039
to say for to recommend to people

386
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,799
because it's going to be different for

387
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,360
everybody's different location whether

388
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,439
you're in a

389
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,480
more northern climate or a southern

390
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,440
climate

391
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,399
or you know a more desert arid climate

392
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,079
but

393
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,600
honestly if you want to find out the

394
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,319
best one for your area

395
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,759
is to go take a hike and look at ones

396
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,760
that are being attacked

397
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,799
and you'll find the ones in your areas

398
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,879
that

399
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,039
will be great bait plants that you could

400
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,120
plant around your area

401
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,078
and there's a there's an app that i like

402
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,120
to use on my phone

403
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,519
i think it's called naturalist and you

404
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,560
can

405
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,200
take a photo of whatever plant you're

406
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,799
looking at

407
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,639
and it will try to cross check it

408
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,359
against a bunch of different plants in

409
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,839
the world

410
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,600
and it gets pretty close and it'll you

411
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,040
can

412
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,200
identify a plant relatively easily

413
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,360
by doing a little bit of research and

414
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,600
you can use that plant in your area

415
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,919
that makes sense so for essential oil

416
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,759
spray that you use what do you typically

417
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,679
use for essential oils and you said you

418
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,799
apply them on a weekly basis right

419
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,719
yep uh every week i like to do a spray

420
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,799
and i like to alternate it from like the

421
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,759
essential oil to maybe the treatment

422
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,479
enzyme

423
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,278
so maybe water to maybe need and i'll

424
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,278
just

425
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,480
keep rotating them every week just to

426
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,000
make sure that

427
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,560
if any pests happen to come along

428
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,440
they uh they get nipped in the bud right

429
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,759
away

430
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,839
the essential oil blend is i believe

431
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,600
it's clove

432
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,680
garlic it's a bunch of different

433
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,560
essential oils i use the essential oil

434
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,120
blend from

435
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,919
build a soil it just happens to be the

436
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,440
easiest way to go about it because they

437
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,319
blended it all together and gave it to

438
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,519
you in a bottle

439
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,040
off you know at a fair price

440
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,639
and then otherwise i could go out and

441
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,319
buy all the separate ones and mix them

442
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,560
myself but

443
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,519
it would get a little expensive i would

444
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,958
have more

445
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:36,000
but i'd rather support a good company

446
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,359
and get their product absolutely

447
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,639
builds the soil is doing great over

448
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,440
there they've got so much good

449
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,839
information

450
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,680
good products they're definitely kind of

451
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,440
leading the way when it comes to

452
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,039
growing organically and teaching others

453
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,079
how to grow organically so

454
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,919
definitely series over there yeah all

455
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,159
right so that's ipm now how about

456
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,159
foliar feeding do you need type of

457
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,240
foliar feeds throughout the grow

458
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,198
um every couple of weeks i like to do a

459
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,399
foliar feed that consists of a

460
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,078
full power fulvic acid and a little bit

461
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,958
of kelp meal

462
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,519
and i'll soak that in a bucket and then

463
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,078
for

464
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,120
maybe 20 or 30 minutes a tablespoon of

465
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,479
kelp meal

466
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,399
and that umic acid and

467
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,839
then if your sprayer can't handle it you

468
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,078
can throw it through a little bit of a

469
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,519
coffee filter or

470
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,679
strain it out a little bit because the

471
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,679
kelp meal might clog up your sprayer

472
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,278
and filter that out and i'll spray it on

473
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,159
my plants and they love it

474
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,759
the kelp meal has lots of enzymes and

475
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,879
minerals in it

476
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,680
and the humic acid helps release those

477
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,559
enzymes and minerals i've never used

478
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,198
kelp as

479
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,719
a foliar but i have used it as a top

480
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,120
dressing

481
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,639
and also kind of helps include it and

482
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,480
recharge as well so it's kind of like a

483
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,879
soil drench

484
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,079
i have to try it as a foliar now i

485
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,519
watched your video

486
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,278
on foliar feeding you have a very

487
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,560
in-depth video and i'll link it down

488
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,799
in the description section below so

489
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,958
people know about this but

490
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,159
a lot of good information very detailed

491
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,838
can we talk a little bit about

492
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,679
when to spray i thought that was very

493
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,000
interesting about you talked about

494
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,278
the stomata openings and kind of the

495
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
ideal time

496
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:15,519
to spray your plants yeah the uh the

497
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,159
stomata tend to open

498
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,078
right before sunrise or right before

499
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,159
your indoor lights come on

500
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,198
so if you can spray 20 to 30 minutes

501
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,480
before

502
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:29,679
sunrise or before your lights turn on

503
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,440
the stomata will open and soak up

504
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,919
what you just sprayed onto the leaf

505
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,480
surface and it'll be

506
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,919
more effective for your feet so about 30

507
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,199
minutes before now i know

508
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,159
some people are probably watching this

509
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,838
probably going to be a little bit

510
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:45,120
concerned

511
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,639
that you know with droplets being left

512
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,399
on the plant

513
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,480
the light comes on that high intensity

514
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,600
light it could potentially kind of burn

515
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,519
your plants due to

516
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,519
the droplets kind of acting as a

517
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,959
magnifying lens

518
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,560
i think in your video you had mentioned

519
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,359
if you're doing it 20 to 30 minutes

520
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,439
prior

521
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,800
and you have the oscillating fans on the

522
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,600
plant should very well

523
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,838
be dry at that point is that correct

524
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,798
they should be mostly dry and at least

525
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,759
not no more having the water drops on

526
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,400
the leaf surface

527
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:16,318
they may still be wet a little bit but

528
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,038
the big drops causing the magnifying

529
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:22,240
glass type effect should be gone

530
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:26,318
also if you use aloe or

531
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,318
yucca in there those are wetting agents

532
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,558
and it will actually help prevent some

533
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,399
of those dots from even forming

534
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,240
it'll just make a nice smooth coating

535
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,160
over the leaf that's awesome i've been

536
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,200
using yucca a lot lately

537
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,720
having my reservoirs just to my my spray

538
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,480
bottles that i use to spray the top of

539
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,200
the medium

540
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,400
and then also mixing it in with just any

541
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,080
soil drench that i use

542
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,160
this stuff's awesome you talked a little

543
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,480
bit about aloe i know on your channel

544
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,600
you use a lot aloe in a bunch of

545
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,679
different ways can you explain some of

546
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:59,279
the ways that you use aloe

547
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:03,519
i use aloe for in my foliar sprays

548
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:07,119
for cloning as a cloning gel

549
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:11,279
as a wetting agent for

550
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:13,439
watering and for pretty much anything

551
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,519
you know if i get a cut or a neck or

552
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,160
bruise in the garden

553
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,960
i'll use it right then and there and

554
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,960
it's a great

555
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,840
i have like three or four of them in my

556
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,480
garden and i just cut little pieces off

557
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,399
every so often when i need to use them

558
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,440
and i'm good to go i don't have to buy

559
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,480
cloning gels or wedding agents

560
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,320
as much yucca is a little bit more

561
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,640
powerful of a wedding agent

562
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:44,558
than aloe but aloe also has saprons and

563
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,640
different enzymes in it that help

564
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,759
the plant turn on its own defense

565
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,320
systems against

566
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,319
pests and diseases even though there

567
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:55,519
isn't a pest and disease around

568
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,000
so i also like using that as a in my

569
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,960
soil

570
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,880
drenches or foliar sprays to help the

571
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,558
plants just enact their defenses a

572
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,720
little bit early before they

573
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,918
run in any problems i haven't used

574
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,640
dallow yet but

575
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,000
after watching your videos on it and how

576
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,200
you use it step by step

577
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,798
i'm definitely have to try that in the

578
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,759
future because it's a common house plant

579
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,918
right it's something that a lot of

580
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,720
people just keep around their house

581
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,240
and uh you know being able to have that

582
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,798
in your house and then cut off a piece

583
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,359
to use

584
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:25,679
for for rooting or as a spirit or

585
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,279
whatever can be beneficial so

586
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,640
that's something i'm definitely gonna

587
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,759
best practice i'm gonna shamelessly

588
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,080
steal from you and

589
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,160
incorporate to my god and that's the

590
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,439
whole point of this this podcast really

591
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,279
is to

592
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,880
talk to girls from all over the world

593
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,798
all different styles are growing

594
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,360
and see what they do in their garden and

595
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,279
that's what they're successful doing

596
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,038
so people listening can incorporate in

597
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,798
their gardens you know trying out these

598
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:52,160
different things it can be really fun

599
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:54,558
to try new things so again thanks for

600
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,798
for sharing uh tips like that because

601
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,200
it's helpful for uh not only me but

602
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:01,279
everybody tuned into this so oh yeah not

603
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,200
a problem you gotta pass the tips along

604
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,558
all right so let's take a step back to

605
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,640
uh feeding again

606
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,038
now you've done your feeding in the veg

607
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,960
stage how long do you typically

608
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,480
veg your plants for do you do any other

609
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,798
feedings in

610
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,319
veg or are you flipping a flower and

611
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,720
then doing more feedings

612
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,038
usually i'll just do that one feeding

613
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,679
and veg veg might be

614
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:26,319
anywhere from a month to a month and a

615
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,480
half depending on the cultivar

616
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,399
some like to be a little squatty and

617
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,960
slow slower than the others and

618
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,038
some like to shoot up and grow a little

619
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,519
faster than the others

620
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,640
but uh yeah usually it's about a month a

621
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,279
month and a half

622
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,159
and i'll put them into flour about two

623
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:47,440
weeks into flour i'll use a compost tea

624
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,400
and that's usually about it i might do a

625
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,960
top dress

626
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,640
right when i do that compost tea another

627
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,159
top dress depending it

628
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,000
if it was the month and a half i might

629
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,640
do another top dress

630
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,079
and the compost tea when i flip but

631
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,880
other than that it's just water from

632
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,480
then on

633
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,240
so i assume the other top dress is going

634
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,798
to be craft blend more of the craft

635
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,359
blend

636
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,000
as the top dress same ratio as before

637
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,079
you know

638
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,200
maybe a little bit of insect for us

639
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,519
mixed in there

640
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,640
and then for your teas what does that

641
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,519
consist of

642
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,038
um worm castings and a good source of

643
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,918
compost whether that be a mushroom

644
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,440
compost or

645
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,400
a regular you know thermal compost

646
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,200
and then i'll use a cup of the buildus

647
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,600
oil

648
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,960
a little bit of the humic acid and a

649
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,158
little bit of the aloe

650
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,519
and bubble that up for 24 hours so you

651
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,880
usually do a

652
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,720
five gallon bucket like what's your

653
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,880
what's your ratios for that

654
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,240
five gallon bucket sorry about that yeah

655
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,760
and then what do you

656
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:49,599
use for a food source in your tees

657
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:52,240
um i like to use a it's a product from

658
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,199
florida it's a florida raw sugarcane

659
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,519
crystals

660
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,120
i like to use that it's a little more

661
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:00,720
easier to measure out

662
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:03,119
and put into the compost tea

663
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,120
and it's a i find it's a little bit more

664
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,359
of a simpler sugar for

665
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,119
the microbes to eat they don't have to

666
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,479
work through the molasses type

667
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:14,959
structure of molasses

668
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,919
you know that's the sticky runny-ness of

669
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,798
it

670
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,038
and it's much it like becomes a

671
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,400
homogenized mixture so that the microbes

672
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,240
can eat it easier

673
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,519
so you don't use molasses at all in your

674
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,759
garden to use any type of

675
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,359
sugars as a soil drench at all

676
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,960
throughout the grow or is it only really

677
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,279
sugars in your teas

678
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,919
just in the teas okay now do you use any

679
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:39,279
microbial inoculants throughout the grow

680
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:43,280
um i definitely do um i definitely like

681
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:46,079
a product recharge is a great product

682
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,599
and then also there's a product i use

683
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:51,038
called dr earth

684
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:53,199
flower girl that has amendments in it

685
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:56,079
and it's also inoculated with

686
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,200
mycorrhizal fungi and a few bacteria

687
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:02,319
and when i mix my soil i

688
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,038
use a cup of that along with the craft

689
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,558
blend

690
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,960
are you using them at all like there's a

691
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:10,558
soil drench throat to grow at all or no

692
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,400
nope just that initial inoculation

693
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,079
and then the compost tea does give them

694
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,440
a boost when i do that

695
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,399
i i do maybe two compost tea the entire

696
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,120
grow cycle

697
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,159
do you monitor i know this is a question

698
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,000
that um

699
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,520
well i was gonna say you might laugh at

700
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,960
me for asking but

701
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,400
it's a common question for beginners

702
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,440
especially though the ones are just

703
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,000
starting

704
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,600
growing organically is do you monitor

705
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,720
the ppm or ec

706
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:38,798
at all or no um the easy is

707
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,319
kind of all right to monitor as an

708
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:43,759
organic grower because

709
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,519
that tells you how active your microbial

710
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,519
life is

711
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:50,319
so that can give you some indication of

712
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,158
how good your soil is so

713
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,678
that number is not completely useless

714
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,200
but the ppm number

715
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,519
uh i don't use because there's inorganic

716
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,720
and

717
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,359
organic you know solids that are coming

718
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,480
out

719
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:06,399
of a runoff test and we don't

720
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,839
you can't determine what ones are which

721
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,519
with that ppm meter

722
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,678
got it and are you doing in order to

723
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,519
check the ec are you doing

724
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,919
like a slurry test were you doing a

725
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:19,119
runoff test or or what

726
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:22,080
um there is a nice probe test

727
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:23,439
from hannah instruments that you can

728
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,839
literally just

729
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,278
put in your soil and it will do perform

730
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,319
an ec test for you

731
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:33,278
now what about ph do you monitor the ph

732
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:35,038
at all either in your nutrient solution

733
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,679
prior to giving to the plant

734
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,960
or any type of like slurry or runoff ph

735
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,080
test

736
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:46,240
um every once in a while i do test

737
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:47,519
my ph and my coming off my tap to make

738
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,679
sure that it's

739
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,240
you know around the same i do have it

740
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,880
filtered with a

741
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,159
activated carbon filter that i replace

742
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,720
frequently

743
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,000
but i do test the ph coming from the

744
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,720
city of municipal because

745
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,880
once in a while it does change and i

746
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,079
might have to correct it because

747
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,559
it it'll go too far one way or the other

748
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,918
other than that i don't monitor the ph a

749
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,359
whole lot my soil

750
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,159
unless i'm running into issues i might

751
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,479
actually do a ph test for my soil okay

752
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,960
so

753
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,120
switching over to water you're using tap

754
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,319
water that's filtered

755
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,798
now is your filter also taking out like

756
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,000
any

757
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,400
chlorine or chloramine at all or do you

758
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,640
have to

759
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,480
let it sit out for an additional people

760
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,600
usually let it sit out for like 24 hours

761
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,558
or something like that so the

762
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,278
chlorine will dissipate that's why i do

763
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:41,440
have the uh

764
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,880
the activated carbon filter is that it

765
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,519
is a it does

766
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,480
filter out the chlorine and some of the

767
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,639
chloramines

768
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,000
not every filth not any filter will get

769
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,200
all of the chloramines unless you're

770
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,919
doing ro

771
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,038
but cutting it down to acceptable levels

772
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,200
of

773
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,359
parts per billion per billion not

774
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,240
million

775
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,278
is good enough for me now watering is

776
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,720
one of those things when it comes to

777
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:08,240
organics it could be a little

778
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,120
tricky right it's easy to over water

779
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,839
your plants

780
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,519
uh when it comes to it is there any can

781
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,879
you tell us like how you do your

782
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:15,440
watering you know are you using a

783
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,480
pitcher

784
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,880
to to dump it all in there are you using

785
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,640
a sprayer and slowly spraying or how

786
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,400
exactly do you water

787
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,480
and when do you know when to how do you

788
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,320
know when to water on the smaller plants

789
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,919
i do like to use a sprayer

790
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,759
to water them in the solar cups and

791
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,000
maybe even the one gallons

792
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,759
because it's a little bit more accurate

793
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,278
of measurement

794
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,599
of how much water you are giving them um

795
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,558
on the seven gallon ones i do use like a

796
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,918
pitcher

797
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:48,399
per say that's a one gallon pitcher

798
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,400
and it happens to be that most the time

799
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,880
i can use that entire gallon for that

800
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,480
seven gallon pot so it works out quite

801
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,120
well

802
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,319
when i know when i need to water is i

803
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,639
tell by

804
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,599
how the pot feels how the weight feels

805
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,679
of the pot

806
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,359
and i know it's kind of a vague answer

807
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,278
for a lot of beginners

808
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:11,759
but when you completely

809
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,839
saturate your medium and get it to what

810
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,759
we call field capacity

811
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,199
and which is where you can pick it up

812
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,599
and squeeze it

813
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,120
and you don't get maybe but one drop

814
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,558
come off your hand

815
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,119
that's how that's how moist your

816
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,599
shoulder your soil should start out

817
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,439
and be and then you should keep it

818
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:32,158
around that moisture level

819
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,960
while allowing it to maybe drop and wait

820
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,960
a little bit you can tell by

821
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,558
picking it up and then okay it's a

822
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,000
little bit lighter spray a little bit

823
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:43,038
more water in there

824
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,278
okay and then in between waterings

825
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,240
um you know soil will dry off kind of

826
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:48,319
from the top

827
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,679
down in a sense so that top layer is

828
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:50,558
drying out you know one of the first

829
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,120
things to dry out

830
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:53,759
um you know of course it depends on grow

831
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,798
pot

832
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:59,200
if you have the um the fabric pots

833
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:02,079
it might actually dry out from the sides

834
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,679
right are you spraying with a sprayer at

835
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,199
all the top of the medium in order to

836
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,278
kind of keep that moist in between

837
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,360
waterings and how if you do

838
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:12,000
how frequently do you do that um in the

839
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:15,119
one gallons and solos probably

840
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,759
once a day i'll spray a little bit of

841
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:20,959
water in there just to keep the

842
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,798
top and the sides moist um and

843
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,679
by a little bit of water i mean

844
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:28,558
literally like two seconds per pot

845
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,200
i'll spray some water in there and then

846
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,240
on

847
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,840
the larger pots um i have the good mulch

848
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,120
layer that we were talking about earlier

849
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,519
which helps

850
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,798
and they need water nearly every day in

851
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,000
that stage of their life

852
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:44,639
anyways so i'm watering nearly every day

853
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,359
anyway to keep it moist now what do you

854
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,360
do for

855
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,798
plant training so as the plants growing

856
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,558
um you know i

857
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:51,918
have seen your channel i kind of know

858
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:53,519
what you do for plant training not sure

859
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,520
if it's changed up

860
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,038
uh since you created that video but can

861
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,079
you talk about what you typically do for

862
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,278
plant training

863
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,639
typically i might top a plant maybe one

864
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,200
time

865
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,720
depending on the cultivar other than

866
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,159
that i like to low stress train

867
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,440
everything out

868
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,720
to get some nice branching happening

869
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,360
and then build some bamboo cages around

870
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,798
them

871
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:21,199
so they can be supported in the

872
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,558
you know later stages of life yeah the

873
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,159
bamboo cages is what i

874
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:25,599
i saw in your channel i thought that was

875
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,679
pretty cool technique

876
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,639
for keeping things upright you know

877
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,320
because uh

878
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,640
some of these cultivars i mean geez they

879
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:33,119
get so um flopping all over the place

880
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,799
towards the

881
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,719
flowering because the buds are so so

882
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,200
heavy and those bamboo

883
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,880
style that you did would definitely help

884
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,319
with that so

885
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,600
it's good stuff there now what about

886
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,240
lighting what do you typically use for

887
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,439
lighting

888
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,000
or what do you have for lighting in your

889
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,038
garden right now uh right now i'm

890
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,558
mostly led and i still have two

891
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:59,278
hps left most of my leds are

892
00:29:54,558 --> 00:30:01,678
hlg leds i got a 650

893
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,880
diy kit in which i put together over on

894
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,960
my channel

895
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:10,320
and then i also have a 480 watt

896
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,519
one of their older ones that's a 550 v2

897
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,200
and i also have a their 300 watt version

898
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,440
as well nice definitely have some

899
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,440
quality lights over there i had the 100

900
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,880
v2 for a while grew a plan with that

901
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,080
and i was super satisfied with that

902
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,559
they've got some really good products

903
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:24,558
over there

904
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,918
now for light distance do you have a par

905
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:27,119
meter are you dialing in your light

906
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,600
distance through a part meter

907
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,479
are you just going by the manufacturer's

908
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,798
recommendation

909
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,640
or what um for the longest i did not

910
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:38,398
have a power meter and i just went by

911
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,880
you know how the plants are reacting and

912
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,798
the manufacturer's recommendation

913
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,720
but now i do have a parameter so i can

914
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:48,319
kind of dial it in a little

915
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,159
closer than just

916
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,398
watching the plants and using the

917
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,720
manufacturer's recommendations

918
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,239
but by getting that par meter i did find

919
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,839
out that i was pretty close

920
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,038
without it so that was nice to see

921
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:06,158
as well which parameter are you using

922
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,839
i have the apogee m500

923
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,039
oh okay yeah i got that one i also have

924
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,798
the mq 600 620

925
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,119
i know the 620 is kind of the extended

926
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:17,440
range one it's good for leds

927
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,879
the 500 is just that what 400 to 700

928
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,159
nanometer range

929
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,600
yeah the blue the blue one the blue

930
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,159
sensor

931
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:28,000
of the apogee super useful to have one i

932
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,120
mean they're super expensive right 500

933
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,480
plus dollars

934
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:34,158
for a good par meter but being able to

935
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,399
you know for energy consumption purposes

936
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,399
you can dim down your light

937
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,158
and get it closer and if you have that

938
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,518
par media you can kind of ensure that

939
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,240
you're not giving your plants

940
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,399
too much light so i typically aim for

941
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,720
like 200 to 400 ppfd

942
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:49,518
in seedling stage clones and mother

943
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,200
plants

944
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,880
400 to 600 for veg 600 to 900 for

945
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,120
flower and then if i'm supplementing co2

946
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,799
i go get a little bit higher than that

947
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:04,398
uh maybe around a thousand

948
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:06,158
or so maybe yeah do you monitor what do

949
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:09,038
you typically aim for there

950
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,000
i i try to aim for right around 900 to

951
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:12,398
1000

952
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,079
during flower and same numbers for you

953
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,398
know seedlings and veg

954
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,918
i i don't supplement co2 so i can't

955
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:18,479
really push it too much further than

956
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,240
that

957
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,679
i was going to ask if you supplement co2

958
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,640
so you don't use any of those

959
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,200
co2 bags any canisters no tanks nothing

960
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,600
like that

961
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,038
just kind of relying on the air exchange

962
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,759
the air exchange and i do

963
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,000
i do grow in a basement and i do have a

964
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:37,759
couple of co2 sensors down here

965
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,480
and at all times it's around 800 ppm

966
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:42,398
so i mean i could supplement to get a

967
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,120
couple more hundred ppm

968
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,398
of co2 down here and maybe push the

969
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,599
plants a little harder but

970
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:52,000
i'm i'm good with what i get

971
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,599
800 is not bad at all i mean what is it

972
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,200
like 400 is natural

973
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,119
co2 is around there i know it's always

974
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,600
changing but right now it's about

975
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:00,879
400 so being at 800 that's that's

976
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,119
definitely a better

977
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,240
what co2 monitors do you use um i

978
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,719
actually

979
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,000
put them together myself i use a

980
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,919
raspberry pi

981
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,359
and i make a whole bunch of sensors and

982
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,640
have those sensors report

983
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:16,158
back to the raspberry pi

984
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,679
i'm a little bit of a geek in that

985
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,480
nature

986
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,200
and uh you know i like to do that myself

987
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,278
and

988
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,120
save a little bit of money in the long

989
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:28,240
run too that's awesome i

990
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,439
have the co2 monitor by co2 meter and

991
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,798
it's like this

992
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,558
round meter it's like pretty big and uh

993
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:36,079
i wish they had one that would you could

994
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:37,599
just hang i mean they do have one i know

995
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,960
troll master hasn't has one we can just

996
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,240
kind of hang down

997
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,919
so you can get it within the canopy

998
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,960
reading but like i have this big round

999
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,120
thing that i can't like

1000
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,798
shove into my canopy right now i feel

1001
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,879
like that's one thing that's lacking

1002
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:52,720
right now is good co2 meters

1003
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,919
especially one that could link to your

1004
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,360
smartphone right i don't even know if

1005
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,360
one exists for that

1006
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,798
i had to make one he had to make one

1007
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,519
right

1008
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,158
so i hope to see that uh that come out

1009
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,599
from

1010
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,200
some of these companies in the future

1011
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,799
cool so what temperature

1012
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,440
do you usually aim for um i'm usually 76

1013
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,879
degrees

1014
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,440
to up to 83 degrees in in the flower

1015
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:15,039
room

1016
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,639
okay that's flour do you do anything

1017
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,519
different for veg or ceiling or about

1018
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,800
the same

1019
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:23,119
they're about the same all the heat

1020
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,919
and temperature that's coming out of the

1021
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,358
flower room

1022
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:30,719
i just pour onto the veg room and

1023
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:32,398
keep them warm and then and any excess

1024
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,598
heat from there i'll pull from the veg

1025
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,719
out of the house so as far as air

1026
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,359
exchange

1027
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,239
are you pumping all of the air from the

1028
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,639
flower room

1029
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,479
over to your bedroom and then kind of

1030
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,119
like passively intaking into your flower

1031
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,519
room

1032
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,919
and then you have like another in-line

1033
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:53,039
fan in your bedroom that you're

1034
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,319
exchanging air from there or what kind

1035
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,599
of yeah i have a

1036
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,079
intake fan on my flower room

1037
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,880
taking in fresh air and then i have a

1038
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,280
out

1039
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,599
put fan from the flower room blowing all

1040
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,000
the high air onto the veg area

1041
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,720
and then i have yet another inline fan

1042
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,800
pulling air out of the veg area

1043
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,639
out of the house and there's around 24

1044
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,640
7.

1045
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,920
the one pulling out of the house is on a

1046
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:21,039
temperature

1047
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,639
um setting now how about humidity it's

1048
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,320
another thing that that a lot of people

1049
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,159
monitor throughout the grow

1050
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,240
what do you typically aim for humidity

1051
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,679
and the different stages of growth

1052
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:33,598
i'm usually at like 60 percent and veg

1053
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,199
maybe a little higher sometimes if i do

1054
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,200
a foliar spray it'll be a little higher

1055
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:40,559
obviously for a little bit

1056
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:44,078
um i'm around the same in

1057
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:46,239
flour 55 to 60 percent humidity

1058
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,440
and flower now what about air

1059
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,479
circulation

1060
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,760
so i mean humidity temperature there can

1061
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,280
be pockets

1062
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,240
of high humidity temperature so air

1063
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,800
circulation is huge do you have multiple

1064
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,078
fans

1065
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,920
in your grow environment where do you

1066
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,560
typically kind of place them within your

1067
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,800
environment

1068
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,400
i like depending on the model of fans

1069
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,920
some some are a little stronger than

1070
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,280
others but i like to place them around

1071
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,519
every four feet

1072
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,359
so around every four feet whether that's

1073
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,719
a one for a four by four

1074
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:18,799
area or two for a four by eight section

1075
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:19,919
but around every four feet i like to use

1076
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,400
a fan and

1077
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,639
keep it on low i always keep it on low

1078
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,200
because i like the air movement

1079
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,879
and i like the plant leaves to flutter a

1080
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,519
little bit but i don't want to push them

1081
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,039
too hard

1082
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,400
yeah that constant wind especially when

1083
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,679
you have a fan blowing directly onto the

1084
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,800
plan you'll see wind burn

1085
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:40,000
right the the outer edges of the leaf

1086
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,119
will kind of brown up and curl down i've

1087
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,519
had one burn

1088
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,200
so many times it's so easy uh with some

1089
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:47,358
of these fans because they're so strong

1090
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,960
to to get wind burns so

1091
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:50,639
that's a good tip to have it on low all

1092
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,599
right so we covered a lot in this

1093
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,559
episode

1094
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,000
is there anything else that you can

1095
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:55,279
think of that you kind of wanted to talk

1096
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,599
about in this episode

1097
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,519
i mean if i were going to add co2

1098
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,800
supplementation in my flower room i

1099
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,559
would start growing

1100
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,720
different mushrooms different gourmet

1101
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,559
mushrooms in my flower room

1102
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:07,759
and that way i get another product from

1103
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,078
it and i could

1104
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,960
you know eat it and cook with the

1105
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,440
mushrooms

1106
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,039
and i'd also get the co2 from it that

1107
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,920
way you get kind of the best of both

1108
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:19,119
worlds

1109
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,159
absolutely do you have any other tips or

1110
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,079
tricks

1111
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,879
for those that are maybe watching this

1112
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,560
and just starting the organic route

1113
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,640
what advice do you have for them the

1114
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,078
best advice for anybody starting new on

1115
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,799
an organic route

1116
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,920
is do less you're going to want to do a

1117
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,280
bunch more stuff

1118
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,960
because you feel like you're not doing a

1119
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,720
whole lot but do less

1120
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,960
watch the plant do a little bit of

1121
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:42,078
training you don't have to do a lot when

1122
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,119
you're growing organic

1123
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,240
and you have a soil set up so don't try

1124
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,640
to do too much

1125
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,319
