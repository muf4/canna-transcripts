i'm old school man it's a bic pen i got

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,278
a blue one and a red one and if there's

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,039
no issues everything's in blue and if

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:09,599
there's issues you'll see a couple lines

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,199
in red

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,880
you're gonna get some unique flavors i

7
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,558
had another one that smelled and tasted

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,400
like ballpark hot dogs

9
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,559
like you know like that steamy bun with

10
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,879
just the hot dog and ketchup and mustard

11
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,919
you give me seeds i'll grow them out and

12
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,079
i will pull

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,199
that genetic code out of that seed to

14
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:26,399
the best of my ability

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,800

16
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,079
struggling behind because in my

17
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,039
experience these

18
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,839

welcome northwest j how you doing man

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,519
i'm doing awesome and thank you very

55
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,478
much for having me

56
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,039
uh on the show um i'm excited to be here

57
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,280
man

58
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,280
i finally get to be on this side of uh

59
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,200
of the table so it's awesome

60
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,560
yeah so a few years back i was actually

61
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,240
on jay's podcast

62
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,680
he had a podcast so it was like three

63
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,039
years ago or something like that

64
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,759
i felt like it was a really long time

65
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,240
ago but it was the first one i was ever

66
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,439
on

67
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,438
and i was just talking about him before

68
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,959
we started recording and how how cringy

69
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,199
i felt i was

70
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,038
like rambling on and so on and so forth

71
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,878
so i'm totally glad you privated those

72
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,679
so nobody else can see that anymore

73
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,878
yeah i felt cringy myself i guess that's

74
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,920
probably why they're private but no it's

75
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:19,519
a great show and

76
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,280
uh having you on there was like an honor

77
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,000
because you're just a huge supporter of

78
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,439
the community

79
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,120

83
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,919
let's just

84
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,200
start with uh for the people that don't

85
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,559
know you if you just tell us a little

86
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,518
bit about yourself and kind of how you

87
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,560
got into growing

88
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,759
yeah so um in the cannabis community i'm

89
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,039
known as northwest j um my friends call

90
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,318
me jay

91
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,159
and um i basically popped my first

92
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,598
seed back in 94 that's the year i

93
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,159
graduated from high school so that does

94
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,119
date me

95
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,919
tells me i'm you know in my mid 40s but

96
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,239
it was um

97
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,958
nothing serious at the time um my my

98
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,120
buddies and i

99
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,560
literally were having like seed popping

100
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,080
contests like who can

101
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,318
and the way i did it is i would get like

102
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,719
a flat plate a little bit of water

103
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,919
a very clean sponge a brand new sponge

104
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,000
and i would put the seeds

105
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,559
in the holes of the sponge with a desk

106
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,959
lamp total college style

107
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,039
um and we would we'd make like little

108
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,598
bets with each other you know like

109
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,919
uh you know a little reward um but who

110
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,439
can pop the seed the fastest

111
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,000
and on average it was around two or

112
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,598
three days uh for us and it was cool man

113
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,598
we'd just be picking out

114
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,359
ceilings and then we'd go to the river

115
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,719
and stuff like that and plant them

116
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,879
nothing would happen of them we'd come

117
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,479
back and nothing you know so it was just

118
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:37,679
popping seeds so i started doing that in

119
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,919
94

120
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,519
and then around 98 i started taking it a

121
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,839
little bit more serious

122
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,000
nice nice so now you've got let's see

123
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,080
you've got a youtube channel you've got

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,360
instagram do you have two instagram

125
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,840
pages or just one

126
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,920
um i have a couple the other one one of

127
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,120
them is like on uh private and i get

128
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,798
so many requests um and i wish i can

129
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,480
respond to these requests and open it up

130
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,239
but i just i can't find the password to

131
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,000
this account it's just a backup account

132
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,878
because at one time my account was shut

133
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,799
down

134
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,318
um i think one uh it was like a day

135
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,159

a video libra it's kind of like goated

183
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,240
into it from my buddies

184
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,000
that grow with me and they were like

185
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,840
dude you have to do a channel like well

186
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,959
why don't you do a channel

187
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,478
and they're like well you're the one

188
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,239
that knows how to do like the editing

189
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,038
and the camera work and stuff like that

190
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,120
and i'm like

191
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,199
all right so i kind of started just

192
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,399
updating and

193
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,240
i don't know about you and the rest of

194
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:58,638
the community but it was around a time

195
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,319
when um you know oregon was one of the

196
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,160
not the first state to be decriminalized

197
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,520
but one of the first groups of states to

198
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,560
be decriminalized

199
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,839
and so we were allowed to start growing

200
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,199
four plants

201
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,799
and um i went down you know bought some

202
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,800
equipment and started growing but it was

203
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,520
around a time that you still were

204
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,720
afraid to type in marijuana into the

205
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,839
search engine

206
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,520
so i was deathly afraid to even post my

207
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,038
first video and when i did

208
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,399
uh you kind of like throw your phone

209
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:27,519
because i filmed everything at the time

210
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,719
on my phone

211
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,159
um you kind of want to throw your phone

212
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,199
under the bed shut it off throw it under

213
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,800
the bed and hide

214
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,319
you know once you load your first video

215
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,280
because you don't know what's about to

216
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,319
happen

217
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,599
so yeah 2016 was the first time i i

218
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,160

got into photography

262
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,719
by um instagram i was around 2017 i

263
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,000
think i

264
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,759
posted my first um uh picture on

265
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,360
instagram and it was for

266
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,720
it was because i was testing for a

267
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,240
genetics company and they wanted me to

268
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,680
show my work on instagram they actually

269
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,160
requested that i

270
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,000
started an instagram page and i didn't

271
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,879
know anything about photography uh

272
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,240
really um

273
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,039
in 2000 to 2003 i did go to a film

274
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,598
school

275
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,719
uh for three years uh won some awards

276
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,000
and and got to do

277
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,599
you know some some pretty cool things

278
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,399
um i actually have one one of my uh

279
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,439
projects was transferred onto 24

280
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,158
millimeter

281
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,360
uh film and it's just a policy trailer

282
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,718
it's like a minute long

283
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,759
but it plays uh before the movie starts

284
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,519
in all of these

285
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,278
uh movie theaters so it's just a trailer

286
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,839
like welcome to our theater

287
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,559
uh type thing but i got to do that

288
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,160
project

289
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,759
and so i did know a little bit about

290
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,079
camera and lighting

291
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,600
um so when i jumped onto instagram and i

292
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,080
started taking photos

293
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
i was like wow um because first of all i

294
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,519
don't know if anyone out there has tried

295
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,680
to actually take still photography of

296
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,320
cannabis it's not easy

297
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,278
um it is really hard because you see

298
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,800
everything that your

299
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,919
your plant is putting out but when you

300
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,278
take a picture of it

301
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,759
it just does not represent what you are

302
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:17,838
seeing

303
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,360
so it's really really really hard um

304
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,000
there's lighting involved

305
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,278
there's hundreds of shots that go into

306
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,039
one photo

307
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,240
for me and just to let people know to

308
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,639
get them to feel a little bit better

309
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,080
about

310
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,679
if they try to do cannabis photography

311
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,600
and this is not working out

312
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,719
to for me to get one photo that you see

313
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,320
on instagram that

314
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,560
people like it takes 20 30 40

315
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,760
to 100 shots and i literally will go

316
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,159
through them

317
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,480
and find that very best photo that has

318
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,919
that certain angle or just

319
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,360
you know that that certain you're

320
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,879
picking up that you know something a

321
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,919
little bit different than the other one

322
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,240
or you can actually see a little more

323
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,240
trichomes showing blah blah blah

324
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,159
but to answer your question it was when

325
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,959
i first started on instagram took my

326
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,719
first photo

327
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,559
and i just wanted to keep getting better

328
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,440
and better and better at it and

329
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,958
to this day i still strive to be better

330
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,959
at it and it's really hard

331
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,078
but it's super fun and that's kind of my

332
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,639
new passion right now

333
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,120
is uh cannabis photography that's

334
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,078
awesome

335
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,000
yeah i uh i definitely try to take good

336
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,679
pictures i'm personally terrible at

337
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
photography so maybe i can learn a thing

338
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,159
or two from you it's funny that people

339
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,200
think that you know i do videography

340
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,360
right and i make

341
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,879
pretty decent videos but when i go to

342
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,278
the photography side of things i'm just

343
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,120
so

344
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,320
bad and people automatically assume that

345
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,600
if you're good at one thing you're going

346
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,079
to be good at the other it's just not

347
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,040
the case

348
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,479
it's just so much other things to learn

349
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,000
uh when it comes to taking pictures

350
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,920
versus taking videos

351
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,519
yeah it really yeah and it's it's kind

352
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,679
of like singing and dancing like you may

353
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,560
be a great singer a horrible dancer or

354
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,838
vice versa

355
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:50,069
it's hard to be both but um to to

356
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,279
go along with what you're saying um

357
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,839
[Music]

358
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:56,240
i felt horrible at it and every time i

359
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,120
go to this day i go to take a picture of

360
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,720
a certain

361
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,480
plant uh man sometimes i'm like

362
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,920
cussing in the background like what the

363
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,680
hell is going on

364
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,039
you know with me today like i can't see

365
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,159
you know like now i'm wearing glasses

366
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,519
and stuff like that so i could see a

367
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,838
little bit better but

368
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,600
it's really really difficult um

369
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,399
sometimes i think some of us make it

370
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,839
look easy

371
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,519
but you're seeing the finished product

372
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,600
you're not seeing what goes into

373
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,120
getting that shot and it's really really

374
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,360
hard it's it's a challenge

375
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,639
absolutely um so switch it up i want to

376
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,399
talk about one more thing before we get

377
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,039
into the topic today

378
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,839
so you're part of a company called prism

379
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,559
labs right so

380
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
that's a genetics company right correct

381
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,278
can you tell me

382
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,639
kind of how that was born and what you

383
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,559
got going on there

384
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,078
yeah so the um so i actually just

385
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,838
recently stepped down

386
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:45,919
uh from co-owner uh uh of prism labs

387
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,360
and it's on good terms and it's because

388
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:50,559
we've kind of like branched off

389
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,480
onto another product um and it's candy

390
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,239
so but to answer your question prism

391
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,879
labs was started from um

392
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,759
i was a alpha tester for a genetics

393
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,799
company

394
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,559
about two years ago and one of the uh uh

395
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,559
co-owners of that company kind of

396
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,759
branched off um

397
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,919
and they're they're still doing their

398
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,879
thing um but he wanted to just do with

399
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,360
his own thing

400
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,000
and you know kind of make it like a um

401
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,200
uh

402
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,039
like you know his own strains his own

403
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,600
his own work and he brought me in he

404
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,679
says jay um you did great for us

405
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,720
um you built our website you do a lot of

406
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,239
photography

407
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,240
you know like you know print work you

408
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,079
know can be your thing with us

409
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,720
would you like to help create the

410
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,679
company and so i basically came in

411
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,480
and helped start up prism labs with

412
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:39,439
chronic 420 inc

413
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,920
and he is an amazing breeder um he put

414
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,519
out five strains in our first year

415
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:48,240
and um i basically just went in and

416
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,600
i he i also had the honor of helping

417
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,519
naming a couple of streams like curb

418
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,200
stomper and rubik's

419
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,720
i help name those strains so that i mean

420
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,920
that's those are opportunities that you

421
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,000
really don't have

422
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,759
because i'm not a breeder i've always

423
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,759
made the joke that chronic

424
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,039
is the uh fashion designer and i'm the

425
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,319
runway model

426
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:09,439
um i am not a breeder i know how to grow

427
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,399
the [ __ ] out of cannabis but i'm not a

428
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
breeder and i'm not even going to

429
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,600
pretend to be

430
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
so now that i feel that my job is done

431
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,200
at prism i help build the

432
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:20,319
the actual team we have testers from all

433
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,759
over the world

434
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,200
male testers female testers so it's like

435
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,078
a really good

436
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
um even group of just you know all sorts

437
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,559
of growers

438
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,560
and i still represent the team i still

439
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,119
will be growing their their genetics all

440
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:41,278
the way through at least 2021

441
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,440
um but um i'm moving on to um edibles

442
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,278
and um it was kind of branched off of

443
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,480
that so it's like the sister ship

444
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,240
from uh prism gotcha i actually have the

445
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,959
entire line growing right now

446
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,560
i've got uh is it five different ones i

447
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,319
think i've got growing i'm

448
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,159
fingers crossed that they're females

449
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,800
yeah i actually set them off for dna sex

450
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,639
testing

451
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,078
and i'm waiting to hear back oh nice to

452
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,320
see if they're male or female but

453
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,679
uh dude i'm totally pumped because the

454
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
the pictures i seen you on instagram

455
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,799
that just all looks fire every single

456
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,680
one of those strains looks absolutely

457
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,078
fire and

458
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,078
you know credit to cronic 420 for for

459
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,479
coming up with that he's

460
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,399
incredibly talented breeder for sure he

461
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,000
really is man and the lineup that he

462
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,480
created this time around

463
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,360
um is unique and i'm going to use the

464
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,278
word unique

465
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,360
and then you can judge for yourself once

466
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,439
you start to get flowers but

467
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,120
um well i know we're going to get into

468
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,040
this topic a little bit later but i

469
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,278
my last run i had i started off with

470
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,919
about 24 plants and ended up with 14

471
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,958
females

472
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,958
and i had 14 different phenos

473
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,239
and i had some crazy ones um i don't

474
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,119
know if you remember

475
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,639
uh sharpening your pencil in school and

476
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,360
it got full and you had to empty out the

477
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,600
little

478
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,720
uh sharpener container and it's you can

479
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,320
smell the lead

480
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,199
the wood pencil shavings i had a strain

481
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,160
um here or pheno uh here recently that

482
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,759
smelled and tasted like pencil shavings

483
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,078
you know i mean so like this is almost

484
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,759
like um the jelly belly

485
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,679
uh lineup like you're gonna get some

486
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,879
unique flavors i had another one that

487
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,879
tasted like uh

488
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,159
that smelled and tasted like ballpark

489
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,078
hot dogs

490
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,838
uh like you know like that steamy bun

491
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,120
with just the hot dog and ketchup and

492
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,760
mustard so

493
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,120
and and that's the sour diesel uh uh one

494
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,879
that you got there

495
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,839
um i had another one that tasted like um

496
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,480
bubble gum we've had a blueberry we've

497

just had

498
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,278
dank gassy flavors nice i think that's a

499
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,240
good transition into our topic today

500
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,078
female hunting

501
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,600
yeah so some of the questions for the

502
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,758
viewers some of the questions i asked

503
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,040
him i know the answers to

504
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,560
such as talk about what's phenotype

505
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,240
what's genotype but i'm still going to

506
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,399
ask him and kind of get his

507
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,399
uh answer on that one so i may have to

508
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,519
ask you what a genome

509
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,320
i'm joking sophino

510
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,240
pheno hunting pheno stands for phenotype

511
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,680
and when we talk about phenotype

512
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,560
i feel like we should also mention

513
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,799
genotype so what is a genotype

514
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,039
so genotype for me the best way to

515
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,439
explain it is when you have a seed

516
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,799
and that seed has a genetic code and

517
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,360
that code

518
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,359
is basically the blueprint to how your

519
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,680
plant will grow

520
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:21,039
once you have a structured plant

521
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,000
now you're into phenotype and a

522
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,759
phenotype can

523
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,879
be um like the physical traits like

524
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,000
smell

525
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,278
um color and that's what i like to bring

526
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,360
out in mine

527
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,198
is you know the beautiful colors uh

528
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,480
trichome production it could be

529
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,240
a tall uh

530
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,519
spears you know what comes with the

531
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,399
flower it could be chunky

532
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,720
you know those are your phenotypes and

533
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,519
your genotype is created from

534
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,519
the genetic code of its parents and

535
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,399
those parents genetic code is created

536
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,879
from

537
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,198
their parents and so on and so on uh

538
00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:00,078
phenotype is created from

539
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,078
gina or genetics and environment and

540
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:02,958
that's how you get your phenotypes and

541
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,438
depending on

542
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,558
climate and where you're at in the world

543
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,798
you might get

544
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,720
different traits come out of that

545
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,720
genetic code

546
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,919
you know depending on environment yep i

547
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,959
think it's a good way to explain it

548
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,919
genetic code

549
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,640
genotype defines the possibilities that

550
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,720
the plant

551
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,759
could have once grown right and then

552
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,640
phenotype is the

553
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,160
actual traits that the plants have you

554
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,520
know those possibilities that come

555
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,360
a reality uh you know phenotypes um

556
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,440
is what makes this particular taste

557
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:36,639
smell shape color

558
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,679
potency out of hundreds of different of

559
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,440
possibilities

560
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,440
in in the genotype so yeah i think that

561
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,919
was a good explanation of it

562
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,720
so what is pheno hunting then if you

563
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,720
don't mind me

564
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,720
just uh saying something real quick

565
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,120
about uh the geno phenotype

566
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,000
um i do want to add back when it was

567
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,639
like

568
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,599
you know my parents for them it was

569
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,679
sativa

570
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:02,480
and indica so there was

571
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,400
several uh different traits on the

572
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,240
spectrum there were possibilities that

573
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,798
can come out of that into a physical

574
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,880
plant nowadays we have thanks to indoor

575
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,839
growing we have hybrids

576
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,640
now the the the possibilities are

577
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,480
endless when you

578
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,400
put an indica and a sativa together and

579
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,079
now we have all of these

580
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,440
different creations coming down the

581
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,439
pipeline

582
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,360
it's really endless and that's how we

583
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,640
can get into pheno hunting and i think

584
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,519
that's what you're asking about right

585
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,360
now

586
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,079
and that's what makes final hunting so

587
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,759
fun um and right now that's what i'm

588
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,279
really into is final hunting

589
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:39,038
for a few reasons um i'm not really like

590
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,879
the guy that's going to be popping two

591
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:44,079
300 seeds

592
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,960
to fina hunt i have a 5x510

593
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,960
i have limited space so for any grower

594
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,038
indoors you have goals

595
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,798
and you have limited space and you have

596
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,679
to work with that

597
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,359
work with what you got and that's me i'm

598
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,880
no different than anyone else

599
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:03,439
uh that's inside of a a bedroom or um

600
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,720
an off uh uh room you know next to a

601
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,640
laundry room or something like that or a

602
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,839
garage or a basement i'm no different

603
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,919
than anyone else

604
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,079
i only have a certain amount of space

605
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,840
and you can only work with

606
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:18,558
that so i don't pop 300 seeds 500 seeds

607
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,119
in a 5x5 i might start off with trying

608
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,720
to pop

609
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,079
on average at least 30 seeds and i may

610
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,600
take a pack of something

611
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,678
and just it's a it's like it's like a

612
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,279
guess it's like buying baseball cards or

613
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,200
football cards you know you might spend

614
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,558
five dollars on that one special pack to

615
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,600
get that hundred dollar card back when

616
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,038
we were younger

617
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,798
you know looking for those special cards

618
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,079
that's kind of like what uh final

619
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,079
hunting is it's the same

620
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:44,639
thing um you you get a pack um

621
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,000
and you open it up and out of like this

622
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,160
orange cello pack right here

623
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,480
i will pop like five of these half the

624
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,279
pack hoping for at least one female

625
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,720
that's all i care about and so if i pop

626
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,359
30 seeds and i get

627
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,319
one female out of 30 and trust me it's

628
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,159
happened

629
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,000
i've had some very bad rounds where i've

630
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,120
gotten a lot of males and just like two

631
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,119
or three females

632
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,319
you make the best of it and that means

633
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,599
instead of growing in

634
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,720
31 gallon pots if you had 30 females i'm

635
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,399
gonna grow in

636
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,720
seven gallon pots i finally have three

637
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,038
plants and i'm gonna fill up that room

638
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,558
um so veg time might be a little bit

639
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,319
longer to get that plant

640
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:23,279
really big you know like you guys have

641
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:25,519
seen in the past on my uh one plant

642
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,200
uh one grow in that scrog and i think it

643
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,480
was iso eight that i did that scrugg

644
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
that veg and people

645
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,759
people freak out sometimes when i tell

646
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,079
them like that veg took about four

647
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,839
months to fill up that scrug

648
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,519
it is what it is that's why i'm not a

649
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,038
huge scrog fan and plus you know you

650
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,359
can't get over the top of it

651
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,158
um you have to work underneath it but

652
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,798
that was

653
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,200
uh a created strain um that was pheno

654
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:50,879
hunted out of like 500

655
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,640
seeds but me personally i just i just

656
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,600
i will pop five seeds um once it comes

657
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,520
up

658
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,199
then i start looking at is it easy to

659
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,558
grow that's one of my first things i

660
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,360
look at when i'm pheno hunting

661
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,399
how easy is this plant to grow um is it

662
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,158
just you show up

663
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,600
you feed it and it just produces from

664
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,520
seed to harvest that's

665
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,279
that's one good trait that i want to see

666
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,240
i don't have it's not fighting me

667
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,798
it's not giving me issues um i want that

668
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,038
plant

669
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,079
to grow and me you know tell my buddy

670
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,558
like man this thing

671
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,599
it grew itself so that's a nice trait to

672
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:23,599
have

673
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,639
another one is definitely the smells and

674
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,119
the looks

675
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,000
and the colors that it puts on another

676
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,319
trait that i look for

677
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,839
is it photogenic that's that's something

678
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,359
i'm looking for when i'm feeding pheno

679
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,279
hunting now

680
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,479
and um here recently now that i'm

681
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,759
working with the edibles

682
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:43,440
and the the candy lineup with no

683
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:46,319
nomad nomadic concepts

684
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,720
now we're looking for specific traits

685
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,519
and

686
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,640
and and that's um smell and taste and

687
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,240
and

688
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:57,840
the effects um we're looking for high

689
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,440
effects and you know really good numbers

690
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,439
and we're looking for anything that will

691
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,919
go good with candy like for instance we

692
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,200
have

693
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,000
mango um habanero so i'm actually gonna

694
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,919
be growing

695
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
uh from another grower that gifted me a

696
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,400
pack of seeds and i've grown them out

697
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,080
once but i'm gonna be growing out a

698
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,519
lemon mango haze

699
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,599
and i'm looking for a specific flavor

700
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,359
that goes with mango habanero so

701
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,279
anything that has like that mango taste

702
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,639
or that fruity taste or citrus taste

703
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,440
that's going to go into that

704
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,759
that specific piece of candy gotcha so

705
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,519
as far as like the number of seeds

706
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,200
you know some people who are phenotyping

707
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,038
female hunting they're

708
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,798
planting 100 seeds there's some people

709
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,558
that are planting 30 seeds some people

710
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,158
planting 10 seeds 5 seeds

711
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,158
you're saying there's really is there

712
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,120
like a minimum amount or a maximum

713
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,720
amount that people

714
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,479
should do for final hunting or is it

715
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,720
really subjective or what

716
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,880
for me in my opinion i i'll never tell

717
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,600
someone the right way or the wrong way

718
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,559
of doing it my if someone asked me like

719
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,199
hey jay how many

720
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,639
seeds should i plant if i'm going to do

721
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,440
a final hunt and i'd ask them what what

722
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,960
are your goals

723
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,558
like first of all how much space do you

724
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,440
have and they're like i have a 2x2 well

725
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,038
you can't put 500 seeds in a 2x2

726
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,240
unless you're out in the garage and you

727
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:07,759
want to do that but what are you going

728
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,159
to do with all those seedlings once they

729
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,919
start

730
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,159
popping you know what are you gonna do

731
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,400
like you only have a two by two space

732
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,000
you

733
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,640
physically cannot do that so you just

734
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,279
have to start checking the boxes and my

735
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,159
basic answer to you know is have fun

736
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,240
with it

737
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,640
if you're creating a strain you might

738
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,679
have to pop that many seeds to find

739
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,840
certain things because you're looking

740
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,159
for males and females i'm only looking

741
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,038
for females i'm not looking for males

742
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,559
at all um so my answer would be is just

743
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,400
have fun with it and that's exactly what

744
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,678
i do with it i just have fun with

745
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,440
it and like i said it's kind of like

746
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,480
opening up that pack of baseball cards

747
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,600
when you were younger you don't know

748
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,880
what's inside there

749
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,038
and you open it up and all of a sudden

750
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,480
you see that foil shiny card

751
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:47,919
and it's worth 100 bucks or something

752
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,798
like that you're like wow that's a

753
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,159
keeper

754
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:51,839
you know i can do something with that

755
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,159
but you didn't know it was coming you

756
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,240
know

757
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,760
don't i don't have expectations i i kind

758
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,240
of like i like that that

759
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,759
element of surprise and that's the fun

760
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,159
part of growing for me is i'm not

761
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,759
looking

762
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,640
i think if you start looking into it

763
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,200
like oh i have to have this i have to

764
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,799
have that

765
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,480
and this and that and it takes you uh

766
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,319
four or five months to get to that point

767
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,519
and you don't get there you're gonna

768
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,158
start hating

769
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,759
life in the when it comes to growing me

770
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,880
i love it completely because i'm not

771
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,839
expecting anything

772
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,400
and everything i produce i'm happy with

773
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,918
there's

774
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,919
i'm not saying everything uh you know

775
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,159
100 that i produce

776
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,759
um is you know i'm i'm happy with

777
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,679
because there's sometimes i've grown

778
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,278
beautiful plants that don't smoke right

779
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,720
and then i've grown some ugly plants

780
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:38,960
that i cannot uh

781
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,440
film or you know shoot photography with

782
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,159
but it's been some of the most amazing

783
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,600
um

784
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,360
you know smoke i've ever had so i just

785
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,319
say have fun with it if you're just a

786
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,599
home grower

787
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,399
and you're not looking to create a

788
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,158
business or create a strain out of it

789
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
take a step back and just have fun with

790
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,400
it like have fun with it and lower your

791
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,320
expectations because when you do get

792
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,840
that keeper

793
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:03,119
you know you're gonna be excited and

794
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,959
that's what that's what makes it fun and

795
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,719
that's exactly what i do i'm not looking

796
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,480
for anything in particular other than

797
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,200
like here recently i'd say in the past

798
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,480
year

799
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,880
i've been looking for like anything

800
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,480
fruity candy like a dessert i'm looking

801
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,720
for the desserts right now

802
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,400
so that's a great point so you know as a

803
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,919
fino hunter

804
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,080
um you know there are certain

805
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,679
characteristics that you know

806
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,519
the grower it's up to the grower to

807
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,400
determine what those characteristics are

808
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:27,599
right

809
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,519
and some people are going to be kind of

810
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,000
more strict than others

811
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:32,879
i feel like right when it comes to it so

812
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,480
you said you

813
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,159
as far as the characteristics i mean

814
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,720
there's several different things that

815
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,320
people can look at right um so some of

816
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,400
the things you had already mentioned

817
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,639
i do have a list here uh growth

818
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,798
structure you know the plant's height

819
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,679
weight build density and root strength

820
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:49,759
hardiness

821
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,919
the plant's reaction at temperature

822
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,558
dependence on water resistance to mold

823
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,880
and pests

824
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,639
overall strength terpene profile the

825
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,039
aroma coming from each flower

826
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,400
appearance the buds color and structure

827
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:01,759
trichomes

828
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,679
i don't know if you look that deep into

829
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,759
trichomes are they lanky with

830
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,720
small heads or short stocked with fat

831
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,038
heads

832
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,679
peak maturity some people look at how

833
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,200
early is the plant ready for harvest

834
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,320
so any of those things do you kind of

835
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,038
look at any of those things that i

836
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,119
mentioned or

837
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,319
all of it all right all of it yeah

838
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,759
everything you mentioned

839
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:23,519
i definitely um and but they're

840
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,278
you know those are groups within within

841
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,759
groups that i'm looking for but yeah

842
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,640
like i said as soon as like for example

843
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,759
example if i

844
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,400
uh pop a seed or let's say i pop 30

845
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,038
seeds

846
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,640
and all of them pop up day one okay

847
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:37,679
that's a good sign those are some pretty

848
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,679
strong

849
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,960
genetics there now i got some nice

850
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,200
little seedlings

851
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,880
um so we put them into dirt and all of a

852
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,720
sudden they're popping out of dirt

853
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,919
uh within a day or two now

854
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,880
in my experience and i've popped a lot

855
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,159
of seeds

856
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,200
i'm not gonna say thousands i'm gonna

857
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,960
say i've popped a few hundred

858
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,360
um and i know there's growers out there

859
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,240
that have popped thousands and thousands

860
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,319
and thousands

861
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,798
um i mean chronic the creator of uh

862
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:09,359
prism labs i know he has popped

863
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,038
thousands of seeds um and there's no

864
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,519
wrong or right answer to any of this

865
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,480
it's just

866
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,879
depending on what your goals are you

867
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,720
know

868
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,919
that's what you should be doing that's

869
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,960
how you should be judging your final

870
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,880
hunting and stuff

871
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,880
so when you put the seeds in the dirt

872
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,039
and they pop out in a couple days for me

873
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,480
in particular i'm not looking for like

874
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,480
the fastest

875
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,919
uh you know ceiling that sprouts and all

876
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,360
of a sudden it's two inches out of the

877
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,720
dirt and all of a sudden it's got its

878
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,000
first set of leaves

879
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,399
i'm looking for the one that's

880
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,119
struggling behind because in my

881
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:40,239
experience

882
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,879
these uh squatter plants these runts are

883
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,640
more

884
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,000
potent and um and i'm not saying all of

885
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,200
them i'm just saying in my experience

886
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,519
and usually those are

887
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,080
more go along with the lines of the

888
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,599
blueprint of that those are your females

889
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,119
um in my experience when i'm growing

890
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,158
plants and they're

891
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,639
boom oh man you know when they're in

892
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,399
that

893
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,600
they're developing their second or third

894
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,398
node of full leaves you're like wow what

895
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,480
a beauty

896
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:07,599
and then you go to flower and you and

897
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,440
you love all this

898
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,959
the stem rubs and you love the structure

899
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,320
of this thing and the leaves look great

900
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,600
and it looks bc

901
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,839
it's a boy nine times out of ten for me

902
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,798
it's a boy so i'm always looking for

903
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,678
when i final hunt

904
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,359
um i'm patient i'd never get rid of a

905
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,120
plant until i can

906
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,639
decide if it's male or female and i need

907
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,519
to see uh

908
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,278
exact evidence um i'm not guessing

909
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,679
because sometimes i've seen uh

910
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,278
calyx stretch and they look like they're

911
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,640
going to be male

912
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:38,000
but then there's that they keep

913
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,759
stretching and stretching and stretching

914
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,558
and all of a sudden boom a pistol comes

915
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,440
out

916
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,119
i've been fooled before so i am a very

917
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,278
patient man when it comes to

918
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:50,000
uh uh waiting for the male and the

919
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:53,200
females to identify themselves

920
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,919
but i've in my experience i

921
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,240
most likely when you have smaller plants

922
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,159
uh

923
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,599
smaller growth they're gonna lean

924
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,799
towards the female

925
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,240
end of it so that's something i'm

926
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,079
definitely looking for and then once we

927
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,079
get into like a fuller plant

928
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,240
i'm looking at stem rub and i only do

929
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,158
stem rubs in the same spot

930
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,679
i don't go all over my plant i kind of

931
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,360
just do it early on

932
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,519
on the stem and i smell it and if i

933
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:18,639
smell like skunky like

934
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,278
or or an uh a distinct odor coming off

935
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,559
of it

936
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,960
that's another good sign because i've

937
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,960
had others where i don't smell nothing

938
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,558
so then we look for like how you were

939
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,319
talking about how easy

940
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,839
is this thing to grow is it accepting

941
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,480
water um

942
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:32,879
you know uh on a schedule is it is this

943
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,919
thing

944
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,720
you know um a pain when it comes to like

945
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,240
you you know it's

946
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,159
it's on because i've had growers ask me

947
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,000
like hey jay what's wrong with

948
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,919
this plant it's on the same feeding

949
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,759
schedule as everything else

950
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,360
it's got the same light schedule it's in

951
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,519
the same environment

952
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,199
what is wrong with this plant it's the

953
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,759
only one that's giving me problems well

954
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,399
those

955
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,759
are some of the traits coming out of

956
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,558
that

957
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,759
genetic code saying there's an issue

958
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,720
with this plant it's a

959
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,200
[ __ ] to grow so that's something i

960
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,159
don't

961
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,960
look forward to but i do continue to

962
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,039
ride that

963
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,960
that bull like you would in the rodeo i

964
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,278
never get off of it i'm gonna grow it

965
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,360
out no matter how bad

966
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,599
um the growing experience was because

967
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,918
the end results for me is definitely

968
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,519
the smoke and i think a lot of us lose

969
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,679
sight of that sometimes we get so

970
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,759
into filming our plants and showing the

971
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,320
plants and the plants the plants

972
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:30,398
but my end results are what is that

973
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,879
effect how is that medicine

974
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:35,519
reacting to me and the people i give it

975
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,679
out to i give out a lot

976
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,759
of flour on a lot of my growers because

977
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,919
i want to know where i'm at

978
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:45,839
and um i haven't heard anything bad yet

979
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,038
i think the same compliments i get on

980
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,558
everything is

981
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:53,038
number one how clean it is how smooth

982
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,839
and then um uh the rest of the comments

983
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,558
are like you know

984
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,278
it was two hitter quitter um you know

985
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,720
lights out

986
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:02,240
so i really do look in when i'm final

987
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,399
hunting and if i'm gonna make a clone

988
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,480
to grow something again i'm really

989
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,558
looking um for like

990
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,839
basically how easy is it to grow and if

991
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,158
it's super easy to grow

992
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,519
and it shows off great colors and it's

993
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,960
uh i can get some nice

994
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,399
photos off of it and the smoke is great

995
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,399
i want to keep it and i want to grow

996
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,479
with it again so that's my type of

997
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:25,278
phenol hunting and i just let the plant

998
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,480
surprise me um you know with with its

999
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,640
results

1000
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,640
gotcha and you already kind of touched

1001
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,159
on my next question here but i kind of

1002
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,240
want to go back to it is is when do you

1003
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,600
start killing off plants now

1004
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,679
you know some feno hunters what they'll

1005
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,439
do is they'll plant a bunch of seeds and

1006
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,200
then once it passes in the medium

1007
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,840
they'll monitor that growth for the

1008
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,759
first you know 20 30 days or whatever

1009
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,359
and they'll start killing off plants

1010
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,200
pretty early like i know some phenol

1011
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:50,798
hunters they kill off seedlings

1012
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,038
um now you had mentioned that you wait

1013
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,119
all the way until the plant shows

1014
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,079
signs of sex so whether that be like lay

1015
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,558
veg or

1016
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:02,079
early flower once you you flip to 12 12.

1017
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,240
now you had mentioned earlier that you

1018
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:05,678
only pheno hunt females you don't phenom

1019
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,200
hunt male so i'm assuming that you're

1020
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,720
killing off once you see a

1021
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,440
a male you're immediately killing that

1022
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,960
off is that correct exactly yeah and um

1023
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,759
i have never killed a plant

1024
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,840
unless it was male and i'm i'm just not

1025
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,960
collecting them i'm not a breeder

1026
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,439
um like i said i'm the runway model you

1027
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,558
give me

1028
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,679
seeds i'll grow them out and i will pull

1029
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:29,119
uh that genetic code out of that seed

1030
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,120
to the best of my ability because one of

1031
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,439
the things that i think i pride myself

1032
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,558
on

1033
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,120
is environment i haven't had a single

1034
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,119
grow

1035
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,479
in about i'd say three years that has

1036
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:42,558
had a drop of tap water in it

1037
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,839
i'll take my wife's uh water bottles if

1038
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:45,440
i'm out of like water because i don't

1039
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,678
have an ro system i have water brought

1040
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,000
in

1041
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,440
in five gallon jugs and if i'm out of

1042
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,679
water and it's feeding day

1043
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,960
um we always have like a flat of like

1044
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,480
the alhambra

1045
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,200
um or the um aquafina bottles

1046
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,919
i'll start grabbing those and uh dumping

1047
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,399
them in there

1048
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,000
um but my plants have never had a drop

1049
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:05,278
of top tap water in it in over three

1050
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,359
years

1051
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:09,278
i'm always hitting perfect temperatures

1052
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,918
78 degrees

1053
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,038
when my lights go off i'm at that minus

1054
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,799
10

1055
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:16,720
uh night time temperature so like you

1056
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,960
know my if i'm at 78

1057
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,558
my lights are my temperatures don't drop

1058
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,000
below 68

1059
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:25,678
uh until late flower then that's when i

1060
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,159
start manipulating

1061
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,038
um you know but the point to what i'm

1062
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,679
saying is is

1063
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:32,879
uh my environment is how i basically you

1064
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,559
know control

1065
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,960
um my grows clean environment yeah

1066
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:40,639
got it got it so you kill off the males

1067
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,720
and then um you so you

1068
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,000
keep all the females all the way until

1069
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,600
the end huh you're not killing off

1070
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,599
females during the flowering stage

1071
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,798
i have never killed that nope i've never

1072
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:49,918
killed off a pla because i'm telling you

1073
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:51,839
the end result is like

1074
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,360
what are you killing if you haven't

1075
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,398
smoked it yet

1076
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:57,599
so for me uh i've never killed a plant

1077
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,918
unless it's a male

1078
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,519
and i pulled it out of it out of its uh

1079
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,440
out of the rotation

1080
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,120
and that's every time i've never ever

1081
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,919
kept a meal in my life

1082
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:09,918
um and but the females i don't kill them

1083
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,358
off until harvest time

1084
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,878
and some of them technically i'm not

1085
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:13,519
killing them off because i'm cloning

1086
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,159
them

1087
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,719
i clone everything before i send it into

1088
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,240
flower

1089
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,598
because you just never know like man i

1090
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,118
got that unicorn and i didn't even know

1091
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,119
it you imagine you finally found that

1092
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,000
unicorn that you've been looking for

1093
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,599
and you didn't clone it um so and i'm

1094
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,679
not really into re-vegging i did a

1095
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,599
re-veg here recently but that's such a

1096
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,240
pain man i'd rather just clone it

1097
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,440
before flower but i've never ever killed

1098
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,199
off a plant

1099
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,358
for being difficult one of the most

1100
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,719
difficult plants i've ever grown out is

1101
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:43,519
ice08 and i've

1102
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,838
i've grown that plant out uh four times

1103
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,440
i

1104
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:47,519
finally killed it off because i got

1105
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,679
permission from the breeder

1106
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,119
and we verified that he still had his

1107
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,878
cut so it's

1108
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,480
the cut is still out there the original

1109
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,719
cuts out there i no longer have it

1110
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,039
because i'm telling you it was

1111
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,000
it was like a rodeo with this this plant

1112
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,719
it was the most

1113
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,239
it was the heaviest feeder i've ever had

1114
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,759
and it's never happy

1115
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:10,319
um sometimes uh in veg you feel like man

1116
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,480
can i just keep pumping it you know with

1117
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,760
food i mean it hasn't had a water break

1118
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,760
in you know almost three weeks

1119
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,200
so and it's just it kept the more you

1120
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,119
feed it the more it wanted it and the

1121
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,358
more it wanted i hated it i hated

1122
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,400
i hated growing that plant so i never

1123
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,679
killed it off until

1124
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,838
i found out um it was um

1125
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,519
in someone else's vault and they had

1126
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:33,279
control over it

1127
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:36,000
but unless it's harvest time and i'm

1128
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,160
harvesting a plant um

1129
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,920
no i never ever in my life have killed

1130
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,679
off a plant i've even dropped

1131
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,079
equipment on plants and split them down

1132
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:47,039
the middle and duct taped them back and

1133
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,039
and finished the grows on them so it

1134
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,838
would have to be something really really

1135
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:51,838
bad

1136
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:52,880
for me to ever kill off a plant uh other

1137
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:54,639
than a male

1138
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,400
got it and correct me if i'm wrong you

1139
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:57,838
you grow all of them in soil

1140
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,920
and then do you do anything different

1141
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:00,320
with like feeding at all like i know

1142
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,240
some

1143
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,680
will like kind of stress their plants a

1144
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,399
little bit whether it be

1145
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:06,879
like make it deficiencies or you know

1146
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,240
maybe

1147
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,599
heavy feed or anything do you do

1148
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,358
anything at all different or just kind

1149
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,880
of the same like you normally grow

1150
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:14,400
i don't like to stress my plants out a

1151
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,119
lot um at all

1152
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,000
um the only type of stress that i'll do

1153
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,200
to a plant

1154
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,719
is defoliating a little bit on the

1155
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,639
bigger plants like so like a

1156
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:26,000
scrog or like the you know the big seven

1157
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,838
gallon pots and stuff like that

1158
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,760
or even like a three gallon plot pot

1159
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:32,719
that you know gets the big fat

1160
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,880
leaves and it's blocking uh lower nodes

1161
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:37,039
i will defoliate but i don't

1162
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,320
do a leaf strip i do what i call

1163
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,519
selective

1164
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,680
d leafing and um that's basically if you

1165
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,440
have uh your plant and there's a leaf

1166
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,719
set i won't take both leaves

1167
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,280
i'll take just one leaf from that set

1168
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,199
so you're still feeding that node with

1169
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,720
at least one leaf

1170
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,279
i don't strip everything down i'm not

1171
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,118
saying uh it's right or wrong or this or

1172
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,000
that but i'm more of a grower to answer

1173
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,480
your question i

1174
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,559
give my plants love i don't like to

1175
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,880
stress them out and when i do de-leaf

1176
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:09,119
i don't touch them other than feed them

1177
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,720
for at least seven to ten days i let

1178
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,480
them fully recover

1179
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:15,039
and then i'll try to manipulate them a

1180
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,760
little bit but um in a lot of my videos

1181
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:17,920
that i've done

1182
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,119
um i've actually shown the opposite of

1183
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,280
of um

1184
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,280
stress training i do low stress training

1185
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,760
so that's why you know you see me use

1186
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,880
pipe cleaners if you have i like the t5

1187
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,280
grow i did

1188
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,720
um i did like you know manipulated the

1189
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,040
plant a little bit with pipe cleaners to

1190
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:36,559
kind of open it up to get more light

1191
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:38,159
uh into that area but um

1192
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:41,039
i don't like to stress my plants out in

1193
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:44,480
fact when i have seedlings

1194
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:46,400
i bottle feed my sprouts

1195
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,679
all the way up until they develop about

1196
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,240
their second or third

1197
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:52,239
full node true leaves then i'll take

1198
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:55,759
them off the bottle that's no joke

1199
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:57,919
ph oral water uh

1200
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,040
spray bottles so i don't like to move

1201
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,880
that seedling around

1202
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,800
at all i don't like to disturb it i like

1203
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,358
it to get well rooted i don't mess with

1204
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,119
it

1205
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,279
and then when it gets into that certain

1206
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,838
um stage then i just let it

1207
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,359
live life and i monitor i used to

1208
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:14,480
monitor my pm's

1209
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:15,358
um you know the runoff coming out uh my

1210
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,679
ppms

1211
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,639
but i don't anymore with this new uh

1212
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:20,480
nutrient lineup

1213
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:22,239
that i'm using i'm using lotus nutrients

1214
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,679
and i don't have to ph anymore and i

1215
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:27,358
don't have to do

1216
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:30,078
um a parts per million runoff but

1217
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,199
to back up a little bit here i i used to

1218
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,119
be that grower

1219
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,399
every time i fed my plants i don't care

1220
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,680
if it's just straight water or

1221
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,800
food proper ph if you're growing in soil

1222
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:44,480
6.5 is my magic spot and then

1223
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,280
um i'd read the parts per million and

1224
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,440
depending on

1225
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,960
the growth your stage of growth whether

1226
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,039
you're in early vegetation or late

1227
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,320
vegetation early flower late flower

1228
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:57,440
i had a range even ceiling range um

1229
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,519
never to exceed um it's it's a runoff

1230
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,880
the part you know the ppm runoff so i've

1231
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:04,239
always been a girl with this

1232
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,000
monitored and uh no stress

1233
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,598
gotcha and then i kind of want to go

1234
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,559
back to the the stem rub that you had

1235
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,800
talked about um

1236
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,639
that's something that i've practiced in

1237
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,680
the past i did a small phenol hunt

1238
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,480
before

1239
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,679
i did it for a strain that hybrid that i

1240
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,559
created which is

1241
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:22,639
a briskeroo g by squaron genetics across

1242
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:25,759
pakistan valley by world of seeds

1243
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,480
i did a small smaller phenol hunt and

1244
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,480
steb roam

1245
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,559
the stem rub technique is something that

1246
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,159
i did do um can you explain what the

1247
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:34,960
step

1248
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:35,519
i cannot talk what the stem rub

1249
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,000
technique

1250
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:38,559
actually is and like tips on how to do

1251
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,119
it because

1252
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,400
you can't use the same finger right for

1253
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,079
all the different plants right because

1254
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,960
wouldn't that throw that off a bit

1255
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,560
you can't so um and there's no right way

1256
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,320
of doing this or wrong way of doing it

1257
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,440
but i will give you an example of what

1258
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,440
because i know what you're talking about

1259
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,119
you can't once you've used these two

1260
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,000
fingers and you've done a stem rub on

1261
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,880
one plant and you've got

1262
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,719
12 others that you want to do it to um

1263
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,119
one of the things i've started to do is

1264
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,838
i'll roll up my sleeves

1265
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,640
and i will take my arm and i'll lightly

1266
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:08,159
just brush

1267
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:09,838
a section of my wrist kind of like if

1268
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:11,679
you're trying on like if a female's

1269
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,039
trying on perfume or cologne

1270
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:15,598
they'll spritz that area and they'll

1271
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,440
smell it and then i'll do a stem rub

1272
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,880
not really a stimmer but the leaf you

1273
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,240
know the bottoms of the leaves the big

1274
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,519
i'll find the biggest leaf on the plant

1275
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,559
and i'll just rub my

1276
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:26,639
the underarm my forearm

1277
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:28,000
on it in different areas or the top of

1278
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,440
my uh hand

1279
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,719
or use these two fingers so you can get

1280
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:38,240
several and then you can sit there

1281
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:40,159
and literally smell the different

1282
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:41,279
uh you know traits that are coming out

1283
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:42,960
of these plants

1284
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,400
um that's the way i do it and i think

1285
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,760
that's actually pretty cool because it's

1286
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,280
kind of like a palette you

1287
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,720
you've built yourself a palette on your

1288
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,359
arms and that's how i do it and it's

1289
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,879
really

1290
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,199
it's generous on the plant you're just

1291
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,280
rubbing we've all reached in the garden

1292
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,199
to grab a pot or a tag to see

1293
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,880
okay what plan is that that's giving me

1294
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:01,039
issues back there oh it's

1295
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,559
such and such and when you reach back

1296
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:03,838
and you pull out and then you're sitting

1297
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,440
on the couch watching tv and all of a

1298
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,838
sudden you're like man

1299
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,838
it smells rich and you got to smell your

1300
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:10,799
arm you're like oh it's because i rubbed

1301
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:12,719
up against

1302
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,640
that plant so that's how i do my stem

1303
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,078
rubs i i don't really do it like on the

1304
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:19,440
stem stem

1305
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,720
except for like an early vegetation when

1306
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,240
the plants are like small

1307
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,000
but once the plants start getting bigger

1308
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,039
i just i just rub my um

1309
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,318
sections of my arm um on them and i

1310
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,519
really get those smells

1311
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,239
uh distinct smells so if you're pheno uh

1312
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:33,759
hunting

1313
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,759
100 different plants you probably need

1314
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,599
more than two arms

1315
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,760
you might want to bring yeah you might

1316
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,039
want to bring uh some handy wipes with

1317
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,560
yeah

1318
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,559
but that's hard that's hard to do man

1319
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:45,599
that's if if i was put in that position

1320
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:48,639
i'd have to do that

1321
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,039

everything like i write down everything

1332
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,358
i got logs of

1333
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:12,640
growths that i've done from 2008 2009

1334
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,318
um that i mean you name it i'll talk

1335
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:17,440
about the day

1336
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,079
the height how many nodes um issues it's

1337
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,119
having

1338
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,880
the exact uh uh ppm of food

1339
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,160
that i put into it so i get really like

1340
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,119
crazy with it sometimes

1341
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:27,838
it's we all have a little bit of add or

1342
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,559
ocd

1343
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:31,279
in us as a grower you have to and i hear

1344
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:32,799
that a lot

1345
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,319
um including from like the people that

1346
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,400
you've interviewed on your shows and

1347
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,239
people on my show

1348
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,000
you do hear people talk about that all

1349
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,838
the time and you're like wow

1350
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,280
i have that definitely as a grower and

1351
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,199
it kind of makes you a better grower it

1352
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,400
makes you focus on what you want to

1353
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,480
accomplish

1354
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,440
absolutely okay so you've done your

1355
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,800
phenol hunt

1356
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,079
you've grown you you killed out the

1357
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,680
males you've got you've grown the

1358
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,119
females all the way until the end

1359
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:58,239
at what point do you select the keeper

1360
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,318
pheno and

1361
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,759
do you only have one keeper do you have

1362
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,800
multiple keepers

1363
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,520
so for me again like i was talking about

1364
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,318
i don't ever kill off a plant until i've

1365
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:12,000
smoked it um i don't know what keeper i

1366
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:15,358
have until i've smoked it

1367
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,800
um and i have to you know harvest

1368
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:18,559
and then when you're harvesting it you

1369
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,480
know you you see things with it you're

1370
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,159
like okay that's nice ooh look at

1371
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,519
underneath these leaves and

1372
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:25,440
look at all the trichomes this thing's

1373
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,719
pulling off and blah blah

1374
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,559
um but then i will um after i

1375
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,399
harvest the plant i've trimmed it now

1376
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:35,119
we're into the curing

1377
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,720
and um i have a certain technique of

1378
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,400
curing that works for me

1379
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:40,000
um because of where i live here in

1380
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,519
oregon you know it's

1381
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,079
it's a little more um colder damper

1382
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:47,440
uh it's not as hot like how you know

1383
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,359
some of these people like you know

1384
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,800
live out in arizona and stuff like that

1385
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:51,759
your curing methods might be a little

1386
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,119
bit different

1387
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,319
drying methods might be a little bit

1388
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,559
different you know when you're when

1389
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:59,679
you're drying your plants

1390
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:02,078
but um after i've uh cured

1391
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,960
and i've done my burping and stuff like

1392
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,760
that and

1393
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,679
it's been about a month of curing then i

1394
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,480
start judging

1395
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,000
my clones that are in my room then i can

1396
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,480
sit there and i and i judge it

1397
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,079
in every different way possible i try it

1398
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,838
out of

1399
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:23,680
rolling papers i'll roll them up into

1400
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:24,318
blunts um i'll put them in the glass

1401
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,318
pipes

1402
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:28,960
uh plastic bongs i'll do it in every

1403
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:29,519
size style of smoking i can just you

1404
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,199
know to

1405
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:35,358
enjoy my smoke my flower that i created

1406
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:37,199
and then i really start picking it apart

1407
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:39,838
and if it's good smoke

1408
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,519
then i start asking myself okay what

1409
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:42,880
pheno is this and i'll go in the closet

1410
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:45,519
and i'll start looking at it

1411
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,800
and as a clone it still looks great it's

1412
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,599
not giving me issues

1413
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,039
it it looks like i can plant this thing

1414
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,720
um

1415
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:54,318
and then i started asking myself like

1416
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,879
was this one an easy grow

1417
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:57,838
and i'll start looking at my notes um

1418
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,200
most of the time though

1419
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:01,199
is as much time as you're with your

1420
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,000
plants like myself like the notes are so

1421
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,480
useless

1422
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,159
because you know what plant uh was the

1423
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,760
easy one to grow like because the entire

1424
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:08,960
time you open up your room you're like

1425
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,560
you're a proud parent you're like

1426
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,079
there's my all-star

1427
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:14,159
you know and if that's the one that was

1428
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,160
really easy to grow and you're enjoying

1429
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,480
the smoke out of all of them

1430
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,679
i'll keep it and i always have at least

1431
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,119
one keeper

1432
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:25,598
on me at all times um so right now

1433
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,119
currently i only have two keepers in my

1434
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,920
entire collection

1435
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,800
and i'm growing those right now and uh

1436
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,880
one of them there's

1437
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,039
it there's not like a lot of like

1438
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,400
distinct smells or anything like that

1439
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,480
but the smoke is

1440
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,519
fantastic i do have an orange cello

1441
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,719
keeper that is just

1442
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:44,480
amazing um and then i have a rubik's

1443
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,759
keeper and rubik's is like

1444
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:52,159
a very big yielder um the buds are

1445
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:55,040
massive but that one

1446
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,799
smells and tastes exactly like hawaiian

1447
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:59,599
punch and i'm not saying tropical puns

1448
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,280
i'm saying hawaiian punch like the drink

1449
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,960
that you know the red drink it smells

1450
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,000
and tastes exactly like that

1451
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,679
and that uh these two keepers

1452
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,119
that i have currently right now and

1453
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:11,440
right now they're in um

1454
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,400
uh each of them are in 10 gallon pots so

1455
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,800
they're

1456
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,000
currently being grown into huge plants

1457
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,960
um those are all

1458
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,960
for the candy lineup so we have the the

1459
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,440
blue diamonds which is the hawaiian

1460
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,240
punch

1461
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,679
and then we have um the orange cello

1462
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,159
that has been made into like all

1463
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:28,559
different

1464
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,199
types of flavors like the mango habanero

1465
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,440
and

1466
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,399
blackberry lemonade so those are my two

1467
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,480
keepers right now

1468
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,519
and then right and then when i have my

1469
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,199
current grow

1470
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,079
up and running for youtube in this new

1471
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:41,759
series i'm definitely looking for

1472
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,359
you know like more citrusy like lemon

1473
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,920
i'm looking for a lemon fino

1474
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:47,119
uh this run uh for sure and then you

1475
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,559
kind of touched on it but you want to

1476
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,000
dig a little bit deeper how do you keep

1477
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:51,838
track of all this stuff i mean you've

1478
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,519
got 30 plus plants or whatever i know

1479
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,159
you said you have notes that you keep

1480
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,679
do you keep notes uh like online through

1481
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:58,879
like an excel spreadsheet you just have

1482
00:46:57,679 --> 00:46:59,838
a notebook

1483
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,519
and then what are some of the things

1484
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,199
that you kind of put in the notes maybe

1485
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:06,159
like key things that

1486
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:06,960
you kind of track uh so yeah so um i i

1487
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:08,719
think i mentioned

1488
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,639
a little bit earlier but i basically i'm

1489
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:14,239
old school man it's a

1490
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,559
a bic pen and i got a blue one and a red

1491
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:17,279
one

1492
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,960
and if there's no issues everything's in

1493
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,160
blue and if there's issues you'll see a

1494
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,440
couple lines in red

1495
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:24,960
and the red might be i fed it um a

1496
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,358
certain amount of nutrients

1497
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,639
and the uh parts per million just was

1498
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:30,960
through the roof

1499
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,159
on the runoff and i'm like wow i'm way

1500
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,400
out of range

1501
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,719
that's gonna go in red like what did i

1502
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,160
do to get this plant so out of range but

1503
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:39,759
i don't panic

1504
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:41,358
a lot of people like oh i gotta flush my

1505
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,119
plant i gotta pull it out of the dirt

1506
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,239
and flush it in the toilet and you know

1507
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,400
whatever i gotta i gotta

1508
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:47,838
i gotta fix this thing no you don't uh

1509
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,800
when you're reading those ranges and

1510
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:50,078
they're out

1511
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,680
it doesn't mean you're gonna kill off

1512
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,039
your plant it just means that you have

1513
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:54,639
to water next

1514
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,558
and so maybe i have to just do two or

1515
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,799
three straight ph

1516
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,240
clean waters and it's not a run it's not

1517
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,480
a huge runoff

1518
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:03,919
um you know it's like a it's like a 20

1519
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,000
runoff it's kind of like

1520
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,240
if you're using like back in the days i

1521
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,239
used to use advanced nutrients a lot so

1522
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:14,078
that would be like a saltier

1523
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,399
uh synthetic type food um so i would do

1524
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,318
like

1525
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,160
uh in with the uh in with the new and

1526
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:20,400
out with the old i would

1527
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,519
i do you know dude a little bit of like

1528
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,440
20 leeching

1529
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:25,199
i guess you would call it and read the

1530
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,838
runoffs but um

1531
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:30,078
in my notes uh i basically just you know

1532
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:32,400
i'll do like a red pin on like okay

1533
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,160
you need the water two times in a row on

1534
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,079
this particular planet and all my plants

1535
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:37,519
are named so if i'm growing orange cello

1536
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,680
and i have six of them

1537
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:41,358
um they all read on like so one bucket

1538
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,558
on you know duct tape with a

1539
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:47,440
sharpie pin we'll say oc one oc

1540
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,319
two oc three all the way to six and then

1541
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,599
if i have

1542
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:54,239
uh you know if oc3 and oc6 are female

1543
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,280
and the rest are male in my notes even

1544
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:56,239
though it doesn't mean anything in the

1545
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,040
future i'll put

1546
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:00,558
oc1 was a male and i'm keeping these

1547
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:03,920
other two because they're female

1548
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,920
and then you know i got my female

1549
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,960
selected for the oc line you know the

1550
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,559
orange cellos

1551
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,920
my notes are just basically for me

1552
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,160
personally i don't load them on the

1553
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,000
internet i've had people request them

1554
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,199
hey jay i'm growing white widow can i

1555
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000

and it's not to be mean but it's just

1559
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:26,240
like if you i gave them my recipe

1560
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,760
in my environment in my climate they're

1561
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:28,639
not going to have the same results and

1562
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,800
next thing you know they're hitting me

1563
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:33,838
up like jay i gave this thing

1564
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,240
um you know a a quarter tablespoon of

1565
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,920
this and a you know teaspoon of this and

1566
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,919

1568
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,039
i had a different environment i had a

1569
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,480
different

1570
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:45,920
you know experience with it and then i

1571
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,280
start asking people questions all the

1572
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,838
time too like you know your

1573
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,960
your your water like what is your water

1574
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:54,159
well i live in uh

1575
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,240
oceanside california and my uh my my tap

1576
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:57,679
water is coming out at 750 parts per

1577
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:58,558
million well right there you're at a

1578
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:00,639
range

1579
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,319
if you're in week one a veg and you feed

1580
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:02,879
your plants tap water you're out of

1581
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:04,639
range

1582
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,400
like the range you're giving your your

1583
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:07,920
plants you know with that type of tap

1584
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,039
water you should be in like

1585
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,119
you know mid to late veg so

1586
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:15,279
lots of good stuff so what advice do you

1587
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,240
have to for someone who's maybe new to

1588
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,880
final hunting

1589
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:19,439
my advice would be just have fun and

1590
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,358
grow

1591
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,838
grow grow that's what i say at the end

1592
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:26,159
of all my videos and it's not to be

1593
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:26,960
you know cheesy or cliche or anything

1594
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:28,960
like that

1595
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,079
i say that because when i first started

1596
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,440
growing i was the

1597
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:35,839
absolute worst grower on the planet i

1598
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,960
guarantee it my first run ever was in a

1599
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:40,000
closet

1600
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,440
with um an actual 1000 watt lamp

1601
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,400
uh old-school butterfly hood um

1602
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,358
the magnetic ballast the things buzzing

1603
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,639
all night i mean

1604
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:50,159
my girlfriend would be with me in the

1605
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:51,759
room she's like what the hell is that

1606
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:53,440
sound in that closet it sounds like a

1607
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,079
bomb about to go off

1608
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,920
um it was the absolute worst man and

1609
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:59,440
then uh my seedlings would pop out of

1610
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,039
the dirt and i'd get like two or three

1611
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,358
nodes and i'd flip it into flower and

1612
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:05,199
try to do like the sea of green

1613
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,358
and by the time you're done i was

1614
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:10,799
getting like less than an eighth

1615
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:12,078
off of each pot so and i you know

1616
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,839
you don't know any better man i was

1617
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,359
giving it like miracle gross sticks you

1618
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:16,719
know you put the miracle growth sticks

1619
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,639
inside the dirt to feed it and just

1620
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:21,118
water it and stuff and

1621
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:22,879
it was a mess so i did get a hold of

1622
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,119
some uh dudes from humble

1623
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,800
uh county hung out with them i learned a

1624
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,079
lot of outdoor growing which i don't do

1625
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,000
but there was one dude that was like

1626
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,000
dude i do indoor growing

1627
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,280
uh blah blah blah and i'm like tell me

1628
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,880
what you got

1629
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:39,359
and um that's basically um

1630
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,920
you know how i got into got into growing

1631
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:45,358
uh on the level that i'm at now

1632
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:48,079
is just by making mistakes and grow

1633
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:50,159
grow grow you continue to grow so my

1634
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,400
advice to people pheno hunting would be

1635
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,159
just grow and have fun don't have high

1636
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,119
expectations

1637
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:58,879
and really enjoy what you did whether

1638
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,519
it's good or bad

1639
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,200
enjoy that end result uh you know roll

1640
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:06,880
it up and enjoy the end result

1641
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:08,639
and then um grow some more so just have

1642
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,119
fun with it would be my advice to

1643
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:11,679
anyone out there unless you have money

1644
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,240
involved

1645
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:15,838
and you have a facility and you have uh

1646
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:17,439
creations and a you know

1647
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,039
you know a business there's different

1648
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,358
goals for everyone

1649
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,159
so depending on who who you are and your

1650
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:23,519
goals i

1651
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:25,279
i would just say have fun with it if

1652
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:26,559

home grower like myself

1654
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,519
i think that's great advice so i

1655
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,800
definitely think we just kind of

1656
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:32,239
scratched the surface here we could

1657
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,079
probably talk about final hunting for

1658
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:37,118
three or four more hours but we'll we'll

1659
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,280

00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:01,039
instagram um and then on youtube i just

1671
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,960
have my one youtube channel

1672
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:04,639
um there's a couple other platforms like

1673
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,400
the weed tube and cannabis

1674
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,000
um i have been dipping my toes into

1675
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,838
those because

1676
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,838
you know man as a content creator for

1677
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:15,119
youtube it is difficult

1678
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:17,599
um i actually have a pretty high like

1679
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,599
you get those thumbs down blah blah blah

1680
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,318
and sometimes those can get to you they

1681
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,318
used to

1682
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:23,358
for me years ago when i first started

1683
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:25,199
i'm like wow

1684
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:26,799
i did a giveaway and i got three thumbs

1685
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:27,759
down like who puts a thumbs down on a

1686
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,800
giveaway like i'm

1687
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,440
giving away i'm shipping to you for free

1688
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,760
and i got

1689
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,800
those used to really make me upset

1690
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,839
because you're just trying to help the

1691
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,039
community you're just trying to give

1692
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,920
people opportunities to

1693
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:42,800
to you know to have something but um you

1694
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,240
can find me on youtube uh instagram

1695
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,960
cannabis and whatnot and the reason why

1696
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,799
i mention cannabis is because

1697
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,318
the youtube is just it's gotten to the

1698
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,318
point where

1699
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:54,000
you know you when you look at your uh

1700
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,639
your your numbers on youtube i actually

1701
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,559
have like a 96 percent approval rate

1702
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:00,480
so like my thumbs up versus thumb down

1703
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,200
is not that bad and i know that's gonna

1704
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,119
trigger

1705
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:05,039
people to go place the thumbs down i

1706
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,519
really don't care man i'm not doing this

1707
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:07,039
for

1708
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:09,440
any other reason other than i'm just

1709
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,279
sharing um i have a talent

1710
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,119
i know i got one and i'm just putting it

1711
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,079
out there and sharing and then it got to

1712
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,760
a point where

1713
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,280
i thought i built a library and i just

1714
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,880
disappear

1715
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,319
but there's people that actually care

1716
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,318
about you and you

1717
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:23,838
myself have developed relationships like

1718
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:26,800
with you

1719
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:28,239
mr canucks uh all three of us have lost

1720
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,240
and i'm not comparing myself to you or

1721
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:31,919
mr canucks in any way but i'm just

1722
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,838
i am in that category where all three of

1723
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,920
us have lost our channels at one point

1724
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:38,480
and we've had to lean on each other

1725
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,519
to get that community back to find out

1726
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,960
like hey

1727
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:43,440
mr grow lost his channel but you can

1728
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,039
find him here um northwest jay lost his

1729
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,000
channel there was a few times that

1730
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,079
canucks

1731
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,838
has lost his platform multiple times on

1732
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,400
instagram and

1733
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,039
youtube and um you know you do a shout

1734
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,358
out video

1735
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:56,480
and you know it's just how we support

1736
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:59,199
each other

1737
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,679
um but uh the reason why i'm mentioning

1738
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:04,318
cannabis again and i'm like

1739
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:06,159
ranting about it is that's kind of like

1740
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:07,519
my safe zone right now um

1741
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:09,679
so i don't have a lot of content on

1742
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:11,920
cannabis or the weed tube but

1743
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,440
i am starting to switch towards those

1744
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,240
platforms

1745
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,440
um and and kind of just um that way if

1746
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:18,639
something does happen to my youtube

1747
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,519
channel or instagram

1748
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:22,078
um which at this point hey it is what it

1749
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:24,159
is

1750
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,599
uh if it ever gets to that but um i do

1751
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,639
think i'm gonna be start hanging out on

1752
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,119
those platforms

1753
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:30,078
uh a little more and also showing off my

1754
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,358
photography

1755
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:35,280
um uh like you know i had the

1756
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:37,440
opportunity with you to be in the book

1757
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,960
uh leafly actually has reached out to me

1758
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,559
and said are we allowed to use your

1759
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,318
content and they have

1760
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,240
um and they've you know posted with my

1761
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:46,480
photos and stuff like that so

1762
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:48,318
i don't want to go away from this um i

1763
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,880
did take a break from youtube and i lost

1764
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:53,119
half

1765
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:54,720
of uh my um uh viewers

1766
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,440
um because most of them have learned on

1767
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:59,118
how to grow and they've they've moved on

1768
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,280
so if you're watching my channel it's

1769
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,559
because you enjoy watching me

1770
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,079
because you support my channel like

1771
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,798
yourself like you're not learning how to

1772
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,480
grow

1773
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:08,400
but my channel is basically to teach

1774
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,079
people how to grow with the basics

1775
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,519
you know using the basics and using what

1776
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,240
you got um

1777
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:16,400
i'm the first guy that'll tell you if

1778
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:18,078
you ask me an opinion on how to grow

1779
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,160
i will give you my advice but i'm also

1780
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:23,200
going to tell you go ask 10 others

1781
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:24,798
and get your way learn how you're going

1782
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:26,879
to grow with your environment and with

1783
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:29,199
the equipment you have

1784
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,480
i'm also one of the only growers not to

1785
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:32,078
like brag about myself but i'm just

1786
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,960
putting it out there that

1787
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:37,039
uh you know even though i had hps system

1788
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,440
metal highlight i still took bag seeds

1789
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:42,239
in a t5 just to show people

1790
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,440
it's not that serious you can i can

1791
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,078
pretty much grow with a high-powered

1792
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,720
flashlight

1793
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,400
in a bag seat at this point um and the

1794
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:49,679
reason why i'm saying that is because

1795
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,440
i don't think people out there should

1796
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:53,199
have they shouldn't have it in your head

1797
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,599
like oh i have to have

1798
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:56,399
the the most fancy led light i have to

1799
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,079
have

1800
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,000
these i have to have you know these

1801
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,599
soils and you know these nutrient lines

1802
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,838
you don't have to have any of that

1803
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,960
uh give your plants you know a good home

1804
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:09,039
a clean environment

1805
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:11,599
clean water and uh you know ph ph ph

1806
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:12,719
um if you need to but um just give your

1807
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,798
