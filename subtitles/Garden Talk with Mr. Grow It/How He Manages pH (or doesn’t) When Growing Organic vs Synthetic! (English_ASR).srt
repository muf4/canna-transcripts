1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,718
you have to adjust the pH at all that's

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,480
a common thing that people look at when

3
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:07,439
using synthetic nutrients is they'll mix

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,320
it up in their nutrient solution and

5
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:12,120
then they'll adjust the pH what does

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,719
your pH come out to before and and then

7
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:19,759
what do you adjust it to before I adjust

8
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:24,799
it it's usually around 68 7 and I try to

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:29,080
get that down to 6 58 6 around there 5.8

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,519
or 6.0 what do you use to adjust down uh

11
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,839
just the G

12
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:34,519
General Hydroponics pH Down got it I

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,320
believe that's a phosphoric acid but I'm

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,280
not 100% sure but yeah those acids are

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,079
very commonly used in order to adjust

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,160
the PH down now with the Organics are

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,320
you phing at all like are you monitoring

18
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:49,679
the pH

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,119
whether not at all that's thing about it

20
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,920
yeah I mean I know I can but the plant's

21
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:59,159
been showing me that she's doing good

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,719
and she's she's fine she's happy so I

23
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,639
don't think I need a change anything on

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,040
that side right now that's another way

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,239
that it makes things easier is you don't

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,080
have to adjust the pH at least in your

27
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,280
particular case I'm not sure you know

28
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,200
we'll talk about water here in a minute

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,920
but your initial water source is

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,240
certainly going to tell you whether or

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,599
not you need to do that pH adjustment

32
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,199
some people comes out of their tap at 8

33
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,679
pH or higher and like I have to adjust a

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,520
pH or else I come across problems but if

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,079
you're tap water or your filtered Oro

36
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,359
whatever water source you're using if it

37
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:32,078
falls within that you know 6 to seven

38
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,000
range roughly sometimes it can be up to

39
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,519
7.5 pH people swear that they add that

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,040
in and they don't do any sort of pH

41
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,118
adjustments and their plants are fine

42
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,439
yeah when when I check mine out the tap

43
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:45,399
it's at 7 but I still like I let uh I

44
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,199
let my reservoirs air overnight I'll

45
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,640
stick a AirStone in the in the water let

46
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,600
that sit for at least 24 hours before I

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,879
give it to any of my PLS yeah that's

48
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:57,399
also said to help eliminate some of that

49
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,039
chlorine that's in there all that extra

50
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,599
stuff that you don't want to give yeah

51
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:03,000
yeah depending on your water local water

52
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,798
source it uses either chlorine or

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
chloramine although if chloramine is

54
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,560
included that's one thing that people

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,959
really have to be aware of is that isn't

56
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,400
something that is just going to if you

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,319
have it sit overnight it disappears it's

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,800
more of a stable molecule versus the

59
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:21,199
chlorine a lot of people just let it sit

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,000
overnight some people let it sit and

61
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,958
have an AirStone in there like you do

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,400
some people put it in light they said

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,120
that helps with it dissipating well my

64
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,840
first 6 months when I started growing I

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,800
was buying water so I was just buying

66
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,159
the still water every day and that was

67
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,040
getting expensive after a while man so I

68
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,039
started testing with my tab water and

69
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,000
the plants didn't really give me too

70
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,919
much of a reaction to everything normal

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,400
the same so I just stuck with

72
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,518
that man I can only imagine yeah I had a

73
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
buddy who lived locally he was buying

74
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,039
water every time he was buying reverse

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,879
osmosis and it adds up I personally

76
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,079
think over time it's going to be worth

77
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,158
it to buy a system that you can actually

78
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,760
install like under underneath their

79
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,359
kitchen sink for example cuz they're

80
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:07,439
pretty small and uh a lot of these are

81
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,959
now a 1:1 ratio before a lot of the old

82
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,719
systems are 1 to three so what do I mean

83
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,360
by that it's basically for every one

84
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:16,719
gallon of RO water that you get out of

85
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,200
the the system there three gallons would

86
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,959
be wasted yeah now like I mentioned it's

87
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,359
a one to one so for every one gallon you

88
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:27,799
get only one gallon is wasted and so um

89
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,319
yeah buying that which is uh 200 250

90
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,000
bucks roughly for that particular system

91
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,438
I'm talking about the one to1 system it

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
can certainly save you money over the

93
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:38,719
long run versus going and buying either

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,519
reverse osmosis or just Ste it' be very

95
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,639
very costly doing that Avenue yeah I'm

96
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,640
definitely looking into getting

97
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,318
something different and picking up a

98
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:47,318
system for the house so I don't have to

99
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:49,598
worry about the lot anymore go to the
