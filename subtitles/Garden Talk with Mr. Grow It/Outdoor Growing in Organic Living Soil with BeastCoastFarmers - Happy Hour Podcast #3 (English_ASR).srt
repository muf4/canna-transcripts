1

channel this is episode three

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,719
of four on the happy hour podcast this

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,919
podcast was actually posted on a

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,839
different youtube channel

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,118
that youtube channel no longer exists

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,000
but i figured i would upload this

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:23,759
podcast

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,920
to this channel because there's a lot of

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,359
good information within these episodes

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,560
in this episode i talk with the beast

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,118
coast farmers

15
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,238
he is pretty big on instagram he is an

16
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,039
outdoor grower

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,479
he does no-till living organics those

18
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,719
are two highly requested

19
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,878
things for this channel outdoor growing

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,719
and no-till living organics

21
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,799
in beast coast farmers he has a ton of

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,160
information when it comes to this

23
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,078
he's more on the commercial side of

24
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,839
things he's managing hundreds of plants

25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,239
however nearly all of this information

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
can be applied to home growing so

27
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,839
if you're a home grower this is

28
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,159
definitely a good podcast to listen to

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,000
if you're either doing organics or

30
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,599
looking to get into organics i do

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,359
actually have video on this episode it

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,159
may not be the best quality but i do

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,000
have video

34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,320
the last couple episodes didn't have any

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,959
video so this is an improvement right

36
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,759
but enough of me rambling on let's just

37
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,679

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,640
cannabis how did you get into cannabis

57
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,879
and then also talk about how you started

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,680
growing how you got into growing

59
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,478
well um my growing came right after i

60
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,040
[ __ ]

61
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,920
like the same season that i had smoked

62
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,719
for the first time

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,359
i had started growing that same season

64
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,399
because there's

65
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,239
seeds in my blood but uh um

66
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,239
that i had a i had a i have an older

67
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,560
brother he's four years older than me

68
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,759
and so when i was 10 years old he was 14

69
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,920
and um he was

70
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,120
he was starting to smoke around then and

71
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,359
um so

72
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,439
i was blazing with him when i was 10. so

73
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,200
like i uh he threw away a lot

74
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,560
he threw away the seeds that he had

75
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,199
taken out of the bud

76
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,959
and um and i had remembered that those

77
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,518
seeds were in the trash

78
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,080
and i went through the trash and uh took

79
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,159
him out

80
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,160
and it was actually like right in summer

81
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,799
time it was like the end of june

82
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,560
and um i just you know jeremy i looked

83
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,319
up online dude straight up germinated

84
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,800
those seeds and put them outside

85
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,359
um and just started growing right from

86
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,840
there

87
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,280
right from right after 10 and right up

88
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,360
right every season after that

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,719
i you know i was able to get plants

90
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,560
either veg inside

91
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,759
start them outside start them outside

92
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,039
that season

93
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,878
because i didn't have anywhere to grow

94
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,719
indoors at the time but every season

95
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,079
after that i had an outdoor crop

96
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,000
and you know coming all the way until

97
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,080
now but uh

98
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,120
you know i the more i looked up looked

99
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,680
it up in line

100
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,640
and stuff and saw others doing it and um

101
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,360
you know

102
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,919
saw saw this industry coming coming

103
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,000
forward

104
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,199
and i knew that it was going to be you

105
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,039
know legit not just

106
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,039
you know for a job market you know and

107
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,120
um uh that's why i

108
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,400
that's why i like put my i don't know my

109
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,920
heart into it kind of

110
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,120
so your very first grow let's talk a

111
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,518
little bit more about that because

112
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,200
that's usually painful for people right

113
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,879
um your very first grow you said you

114
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,839
used basically bag seed

115
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,158
basic bag and you grew outside i had

116
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,519
like

117
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:44,239
um you know so i grabbed uh miracle grow

118
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,799
soil you know and uh just straight up

119
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,280
just

120
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,879
started doing trial and error like um

121
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,560
before that

122
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,639
before they were out they put were put

123
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,438
outside they were in a uh

124
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,559
a cardboard box they had like some cfls

125
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,199
in it i made like a

126
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,959
small exhaust and intake dude like this

127
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,958
is all when i was like 10 years old so

128
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,680
and uh it was in my closet and then my

129
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,158
mom finds it and they're like my mom's

130
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,760
like

131
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,438
get these plants out of the house you

132
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,959
know for sure and then right

133
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,359
the day after that like i already put

134
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,639
them right outside so like

135
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,400
yeah that's what kind of started my

136
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,199
outdoor growing like it kind of i was

137
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,959
like

138
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,400
in the beginning dude i was all about

139
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,360
chems it's funny like

140
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,399
hydroponics chems and growing indoor

141
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,800
completely sterile

142
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,918
you know my my organic side just kind of

143
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,919
like

144
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,079
came from just keep keep on growing

145
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,918
outdoor every single season just um

146
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,279
you know and like like you're saying you

147
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,399
know some people's first grows are

148
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,039
absolutely terrible and

149
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,079
stuff and stuff but um you know like

150
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,520
mine wasn't too bad

151
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,279
in the beginning you know i've had you

152
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,198
know some terrible [ __ ] happen indoor

153
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,638
but i had a lot of that trial and error

154
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,000
when i was a little kid you know like

155
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,079
learning like drainage and um and uh

156
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,680
just you know proper like weight you

157
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,000
know how much you should water a plant

158
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
and then

159
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,279
and stuff like that did you run into

160
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,080
like bugs and stuff outside when you

161
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,319
first started

162
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,839
like how did you deal with that i was

163
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,159
right about to mention that like

164
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,599
i uh i have never seen a a spider mite

165
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,400
in my outdoor garden

166
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,160
ever in my all my years are growing and

167
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,959

168
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,080

169
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,159
other places not far from my area and um

170
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,758
you know i've seen you know infestations

171
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,199
and [ __ ] so it kind of like

172
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,960
it's pretty funny to think about but i

173
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,520
also have like right next to me

174
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,279
uh cranberry bugs so they also spray

175
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,680
pesticides so that's just one thing i

176
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,279
can

177
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,800
i think that's been keeping them on bay

178
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,879
all these years you know maybe the

179
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,079
the cranberry bug pesticides that they

180
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,560
spray

181
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,599
got you yeah i have i've seen [ __ ] like

182
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,720
i have um

183
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,000
i have problems with um potato bugs

184
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,400
ever nope inch like in inchworms like uh

185
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,959
you know

186
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,679
there's uh the the tomato beetles too

187
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,879
and then those

188
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,720
those um uh those uh

189
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,519
corn boring worm the boring corn worms

190
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,919
they like bore

191
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,959
into the stem and like you'll they'll

192
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:00,639
leave like a

193
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,079
small hole looks like somebody took a

194
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,680
drill and it'll look like

195
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,120
some sawdust that's coming out of it and

196
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
what they're doing is like

197
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,319
just you know eating up the stem and

198
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,560
then just like taking that stuff and

199
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,360
shoving it out their hole

200
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,720
and uh those are a [ __ ] dude [ __ ]

201
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,319
what do you so what do you use them for

202
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,039
pesticides then

203
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,240
uh basically it's like um it's a fung i

204
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,079
use a fungicide

205
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,680
uh like i've used i've been using

206
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,959
serenade for a long time and that's a

207
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,079
bio fungal side

208
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,680
that's just um but uh insect for like

209
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,240
insects and [ __ ] it's usually like just

210
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,240
part of my

211
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,240
ipm management you know like i'll just

212
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,160
be like spraying them

213
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,918
especially after a rainstorm because a

214
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,000
rainstorm will wash off any uh

215
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,560
beneficial bacteria and yeast that's on

216
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,319
your

217
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,399
that's on your plant that's on the leaf

218
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
surface so like after rain you'll you'll

219
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,000
do ipm or foliar

220
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,519
and usually what i use is uh for my

221
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,079
foliar or ipm

222
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,719
um neem oil i emulsify neem oil with

223
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,038
yuccas

224
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,319
with yucca so like i also warm the water

225
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:56,959
first so i have a little bit of warm

226
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,280
water

227
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,560
and then mix my my neem and then yuck

228
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,719
into that

229
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,680
and that's what emulsifying means yeah

230
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,720
emulsify

231
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,680
will uh is um helping helping an oil go

232
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,080
into solution

233
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,079
and is like really good for that you can

234
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,079
also use potassium silicate

235
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:18,879
silicate um ag sil16

236
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,758
that stuff is a really good emulsifier

237
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,598
but

238
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,759
it's just good for also using that

239
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,680
silica will will raise the ph

240
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,160
of your leaf surface so that will

241
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,280
prevent mold and also

242
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,759
by using that neem oil and coating it um

243
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,439
also aloe vera so aloe vera and neem oil

244
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,199
those two things will coat your will

245
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,879
coat your leaves and your plant

246
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,720
and it'll actually make it so like

247
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,240
insects don't like to eat it so

248
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,400
if you have it on there before um

249
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,680
you know before these insects even come

250
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,519
you know then

251
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,120
then they won't even like to bite onto

252
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,680
it you know and

253
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,879
it become a snack for them you know um

254
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,280
also another thing

255
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,080
is having a healthy living cover crop

256
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,198
like i've found

257
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,120
like having that clover and

258
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,800
things living on top just makes it so

259
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,639
there's another food source other than

260
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,478
your plant for insects to eat

261
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,079
and it'll also make it for other insects

262
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,800
to come to the to it you know so

263
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,598
there'll be some

264
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,400
there'll be some uh um you know some

265
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,639
competition

266
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,000
and that brings us to like the next uh

267
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,400
part of this that i want to talk to you

268
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,759
about

269
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,839
and well one more thing about the

270
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,280
pesticides do you worry about spraying

271
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,399
that stuff like neem oil and stuff in

272
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,439
bloom

273
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,279
yeah so like um usually like the reason

274
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,479
why it's called ipm is because

275
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,679
um it's it's all it's all um

276
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,959
you know you shouldn't be able you

277
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,239
shouldn't have to use anything in bloom

278
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,079
you know you're preventing

279
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,680
you're preventing all okay happening the

280
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,320
whole time so that when you come to

281
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,079
bloom

282
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,000
um it should just be smooth sailing you

283
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,040
know and uh there's things that you can

284
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,440
do you know that

285
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,039
you know like straight you know which i

286
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,480
don't do like burn sulfur or something

287
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,719
like that i believe that

288
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,839
you know it'll it'll come onto your buds

289
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,040
and it's going to degrade

290
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,480
your product what i think with with pm

291
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,759
is you should just do better pheno

292
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:06,320
hunting and also better um

293
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:08,958
like ipm and also fully like um

294
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,760
just better pruning like pruning is just

295
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,000
like

296
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,679
you know if you're there every day then

297
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,559
usually [ __ ] doesn't go wrong you know

298
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,799
too much you know

299
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,559
it's like um something has to develop

300
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,199
over a few days for it to go wrong you

301
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,000
know

302
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,839
so it's like for you yeah for you to

303
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,440
have a priority on those plants dude it

304
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,920
helps so much especially when you're not

305
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,720
mixing

306
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,399
chemicals um and then giving it to them

307
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,680
the fact that you even have to dedicate

308
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,839
time and the ph

309
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,120
and do all that stuff you could be

310
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,959
searching for things that are going

311
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,679
wrong or something like that you know

312
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,199
and uh my experience with all um with um

313
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,799
visible pottery mildew

314
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,200
like you can you can um you can spray it

315
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:50,159
with

316
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:53,120
uh with um like a hot like a diluted

317
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,958
hydrogen peroxide um usually i get it in

318
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,720
like 30 plus percent

319
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,039
and then dilute it in there and then

320
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,800
it'll that'll that'll kill it on contact

321
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,639
but you need to follow it up with

322
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,240
something you know to um

323
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,078
what i say is like put the sun put a

324
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,039
sunscreen on after you wash it

325
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,159
wash everything off you know um because

326
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,240
because some people think that

327
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,360
pm is a systemic and it'll always be in

328
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,120
the plant but

329
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,800
in my and also my experience with

330
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,440
outdoor you could take a plant

331
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,958
dyeing a pm straight almost dead and if

332
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,000
you transplant it and as long as the

333
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,399
root system is still

334
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,720
healthy enough for it to take it take on

335
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,200
a new pot or take on into a new bed

336
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,200
then it'll it'll promote growth that new

337
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,320
vegetative growth that is unaffected by

338
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,440
the mutant

339
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,079
and then um also the uv light will help

340
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,800
literally kill the mutagen as new plant

341
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:40,559
is growing

342
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,559
so there will be a time where you can

343
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,278
take a cut of a fresh

344
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,078
of a freshly growing of freshly growing

345
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,000
plant matter

346
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,159
and then be able to re-sterilize that

347
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,799
and it'll be no pm you know i've i've

348
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,319
seen

349
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,919
i've seen cuts that have been brought

350
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,200
outside with pm brought indoor

351
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,439
and then now they're fine you know

352
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,480
because of that method right right

353
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,240
and dj short actually like um says that

354
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,920
a few things about that in his uh

355
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,560
in his bro journals about how the uv

356
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,078
light just kills pm outdoor and how

357
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,000
and how you can just take fresh cuts

358
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,679
like that who so you're

359
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,519
the uv light from the sun you're saying

360
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,319
yep the uv light in the sun so around my

361
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,320
area june

362
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,079
is the highest uv index so if you're

363
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,200
trying to [ __ ] pm up and you have an

364
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,039
indoor plant then

365
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,399
you should take all your plants out from

366
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,599
indoor and if you want to save them or

367
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,078
something like that then

368
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,839
put them outside in june transplant them

369
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:28,958
all june you'll veg them and you'll do

370
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,800
[ __ ] to them to uh

371
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,239
to help them and then take cuts off them

372
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,278
and try and save them usually like

373
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,039
people just

374
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,320
toss it you know like unless the

375
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,879
genetics are very

376
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,399
are very uh priceless or or valuable or

377
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,919
whatever

378
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,679
and um when i was looking at your

379
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,319
instagram most recently i saw you're

380
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,159
growing in

381
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,079
what looks like a lot of fabric pots and

382
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,639
you're you're doing the no-till method

383
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:50,319
with the

384
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,838
cover on top can you explain to

385
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,079
everybody like the like

386
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,480
the noobs what you know what that's

387
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,399
about yeah sure no problem so like um

388
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,839
you want to start with a base soil and

389
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,559
the base soil you can make in a few

390
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,240
different ways

391
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:09,919
like you can do a ratio of 100 to like

392
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,639
um 20 25 25 50 or you could do 33 33 33

393
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,679
um

394
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:17,360
of peat moss compost to

395
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,479
aeration and um and your variation being

396
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,399
like perlite

397
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,600
uh you can use perlite but in my opinion

398
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,600
probably the best two

399
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,440
is hydroton and pumice pumice being the

400
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,159
best and then hydroton being the second

401
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,360
best

402
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,600
and then um you you mix those those

403
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,519
those three things together um perfectly

404
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,440
you know and then you have base oil

405
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,560
and then what you add to that base oil

406
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,360
um is

407
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,719
amen dry amendments you do you do like

408
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,879
um

409
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,480
the i did clatimus coots a little bit of

410
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:48,000
a modified cladimous cou

411
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,959
recipe which is um it's a half you do a

412
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,320
half cup

413
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:54,638
two to uh per cubic foot of base oil

414
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,399
then you add neem seed meal kelp meal

415
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,440
crab meal insect frass

416
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,559
gypsum oyster shell flour and then

417
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,040
uh two cups of basalt and then

418
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,599
another thing that i added was um was a

419
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:11,278
half cup of uh alf alpha meal

420
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,639
um and uh once you mix that up you know

421
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:17,439
you let it you let it uh you let it cook

422
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,039
for six to nine weeks you uh you mix it

423
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,800
all up and you add you add like you can

424
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,799
add just water i had added just water

425
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:26,479
because i was lazy but you can mix up

426
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,799
a lactobacilli acid you can mix up uh

427
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,560
you know even a compost tea or fish

428
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,240
emulsion fish emulsion will definitely

429
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,078
help you know jump start it

430
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,879
and um like what i was saying about that

431
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,599
cooking like uh there's a lot of um

432
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,639
decomposition going on so uh and a lot

433
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,519
of like the

434
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,440
the fungus the mycelium it's uh it gets

435
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,278
very hot so like

436
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,279
um that's why you need to let it cook

437
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:49,600
like there will be a phase of the plant

438
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:51,919
where

439
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,079
um its root system knows that this

440
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,919
decomposition has gone on it goes into a

441
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:56,799
weakened state but it literally bounces

442
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,078
right back from it

443
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,078
you know but usually you just want to

444
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,439
wait until that um the temperature of

445
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,359
the soil has gone down

446
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,800
and the decomposition is starting to

447
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,399
slow um

448
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,240
but but that means since the

449
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,480
decomposition has been slowed

450
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,159
a lot of the plant availa a lot of the

451
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,120
available nutrients you know is now

452
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,120
plant available

453
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,039
um and not in a different phase in

454
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,120
addition a different form

455
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,078
um what i had what i had done for the

456
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,440
first the

457
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,439
so a 45 gallon pot is uh 1.5

458
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,880
cubic feet for the first foot at the

459
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,360
bottom i had put

460
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,198
um base soil i had put a super soil and

461
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,399
i let that cook in in those pots with

462
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,198
nothing on top for

463
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,958
for about about five weeks and then i

464
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,399
put and then i had um what i had done

465
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,119
recently is finally got

466
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,519
base oil the rest 0.5 feet in the rest

467
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,039
of the

468
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,480
75 45s that i had and um

469
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,240
and then because you don't have to make

470
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,959
your whole soil super soil you don't

471
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,799
have um

472
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,879
you can only make you can just make uh

473
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,039
three to six inches at the bottom layer

474
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,480
fill the rest up with base oil and then

475
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,399
just leave that top and then you can

476
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,120
just do like a top like

477
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,759
inch of super soil on the top and that

478
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,919
and that'll be

479
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,679
that'll that's a no-till pot you can

480
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,599
know you don't have to um

481
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,120
till that for its whole entire lifespan

482
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,480
you know like you mix it up once as long

483
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,879
as you mix it up well enough the first

484
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
time

485
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,240
all you got to do is top dress after

486
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,639
that what is your crowd

487
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,759
or your cover that you put on top yeah

488
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,000
so like um

489
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,679
i had i had made sure that that it was

490
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,519
very airy and i actually added a little

491
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,479
bit more pumice and hydroton on the top

492
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,799
but um

493
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,079
like i have this 12 seed cover crop

494
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:32,078
that's from build soil

495
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:33,278
i i i i maintain a living cover crop

496
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,719
and like what i was saying you know when

497
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,078
you have another food source then

498
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,440
insects literally won't even eat your

499
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:38,958
cannabis you know especially if you're

500
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,360
spraying your ganja with

501
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,879
a foliar it it doesn't make it taste as

502
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,720
good as things that aren't sprayed with

503
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,559
a foliar like your cover crop you know

504
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,240
all right that's what i'm thinking yeah

505
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,758
so they'll they'll um you know they'll

506
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,320
eat that and they'll literally just turn

507
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,079
into

508
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,000
insect frass right on your topsoil you

509
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:54,719
know making plant available nutrients

510
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,198
for you

511
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,839
um but another thing about the living

512
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,559
cover crop

513
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,000
is that its root systems will help move

514
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,958
macro micronutrients

515
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,078
around in the soil in that 45 gallon pot

516
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,638
for the client to use

517
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,359
so like if the if the ganja hasn't you

518
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,480
know said

519
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,560
hasn't gotten down to it yet and the

520
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,720
cover crop is starting to get um

521
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,078
nutrients on the sides it'll just bring

522
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,680
it right to where it's needed

523
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,319
um but uh you can kill you can kill that

524
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,319
cover crop

525
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,320
after it's gone to seed so like you keep

526
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,519
it alive you let the flowers come you

527
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,120
let all the um

528
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,039
let all those things turn to seed and

529
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,000
then you can just kill it you know

530
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,599
and put that mulch uh hay top layer on

531
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,799
on the top

532
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,720
um one thing that's really crucial is um

533
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,919
not letting the sun when you when you

534
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,839
say like um

535
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,679
when you're doing a selective weeding

536
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,440
and um there's some bad weeds there's

537
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,879
the grass is popping up and then you

538
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,399
uh you take it and you uh

539
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,078
you uh crush it up and then you put it

540
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,519
on top of your soil you don't want the

541
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,239
sun to hit it directly

542
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,159
if you can have some hay or something or

543
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,198
or mulch that you can put on top of that

544
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,879
um it'll since it was just living um

545
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,639
and it's still green and stuff and it

546
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,439
has a lot of nutrients still in it

547
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,160
um if the sun were to just uh hit it

548
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,759
directly

549
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,919
it would just bake that off and it would

550
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,000
um it would turn to carbon quickly

551
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,759
um if you had put that mulch layer on

552
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,798
top those plant available nutrients

553
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:21,439
will you know it'll stay wet for days

554
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,160
and then uh worms and mites and

555
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,038
everything will

556
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,360
will come to it and um since they're

557
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,480
that

558
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,719
it's like staying moist on the top layer

559
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,880
that's also you know another thing about

560
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,640
living keeping a living

561
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,240
mulch layer or even just any kind of

562
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,679
mulch layer the sun isn't hitting your

563
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,640
soil directly you know

564
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,080
so so like it promotes more root growth

565
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,559
towards the top it keeps your group

566
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,439
your top your top few inches at a cooler

567
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,798
temperature

568
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,519
for for um to stay homogeneous and wet

569
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,519
that's awesome man that's some uh next

570
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,839
level [ __ ] like

571
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,599
oh it's it's like you set it all up you

572
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,759
know like one a few times you know

573
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,839
and then it just sets it you know it's

574
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,079
like a smooth sailing after that

575
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,759
um there's so many more just one plant

576
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,000
in a 45 gallon pot

577
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,119
yeah exactly so like i have like all

578
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,720
those um

579
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,399
they're looking small it's just you know

580
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,279
that's for my winter crop all those will

581
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,798
be done

582
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,558
towards december you know the end of

583
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,639
december and they'll be uh

584
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,918
supplemented light all the way until you

585
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,799
know um until the

586
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,759
uh the beginning of november you know

587
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:25,359
and that's like

588
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,558
you're saying winter crops so he gave us

589
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,240
a little bit of details before the

590
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:28,639
podcast can you tell everybody about how

591
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,200
you're

592
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,840
going into your winter crop yeah so like

593
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,160
all those

594
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,759
all those plants are um are outside at

595
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,279
the moment until they can be moved into

596
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,319
my greenhouse my greenhouse is getting

597
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,599
its electrical done

598
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,119
but um like you want to supplement light

599
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,599
like we're getting into uh

600
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,279
we have about two weeks left of veg and

601
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,719
we're it's starting to transition into

602
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,000
flower naturally outdoor

603
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,839
um you know um we're getting about at

604
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,880
the end of this month we're about 14

605
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,119
hours of light and then

606
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,720
we'll get down to 13 and we won't even

607
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,839
achieve a a full

608
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,558
uh a full 12 12 until um november i

609
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,519
believe

610
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,038
um but the reason why i'm supplementing

611
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,558
supplementing light is to keep them in

612
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,319
that vegetative state you know

613
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,918
so you have lights in the greenhouse

614
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,079
that you're gonna use yes

615
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,600
uh i'm gonna i'm gonna have 10 uh

616
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,759
thousand watt double ended

617
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,879
and uh oh damn dude yeah hell yeah so

618
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,359
like uh

619
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,360
it's gonna be filthy yeah so um so and

620
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,038
also like if it's a cloudy day

621
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,639
you know i'll turn those all all 10

622
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,519
lights on and make the sun happen for

623
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,480
them you know

624
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,440
yeah yeah but um like that [ __ ] with the

625
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,880
winter crop man

626
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,880
like you just got to make sure you're

627
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,320
supplementing light properly if

628
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,240
you're if it's starting to get too cold

629
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,558
out then you know you need to you need

630
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,720
to

631
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,558
adequately heat them because environment

632
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,240
is so key dude you know like we're

633
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,160
just blessed when we come in the season

634
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,759
that that mother nature gives us you

635
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,519
know the perfect season but

636
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,519
um i'm definitely gonna have to have

637
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,000
like potentially a propane heater

638
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,279
i don't need a dehumidifier um i'm gonna

639
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,798
potentially

640
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,558
potentially need a humidifier for

641
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,798
wintertime uh to add

642
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,158
moisture to my greenhouse you know and

643
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,240
stuff like that but uh

644
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,080
it's gonna be really cool for sure it's

645
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,359
and not many people grow on a geodesic

646
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,439
dome a lot of people are growing you

647
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,918
know traditional hoops and uh

648
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,880
you know whatever the forever flowering

649
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,280
companies are

650
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,559
you got pictures of that up right yeah

651
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,119
yeah i don't have too many pictures of

652
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,879
the actual like geodump like i will

653
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,558
i will like a little bit further down

654
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,600
the road but like um

655
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,038
uh because of my area just because of my

656
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,240
area you know not many people

657
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,200
in my area and for the viewers watching

658
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,279
i don't know if you mentioned your

659
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,519
instagram yet it's at beast

660
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,399
coast farmers i'm looking at it right

661
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,558
now um

662
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,519
are you strictly an outdoor grower now

663
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,759
are you 100 percent outdoor or

664
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,038
i'm i'm moving towards that man like um

665
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,279
i i want

666
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:48,400
all production outdoor like i can have a

667
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,399
greenhouse where i can

668
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,919
be propagating and vegging and mothering

669
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,880
all that stuff and then have a

670
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,640
greenhouse where

671
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,000
because it'll it'll be continuously

672
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,759
heated you know all the time no matter

673
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,880
what it's no matter what the season

674
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:03,759
and um but by all means you can have

675
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,039
you know say cloning or mothers or

676
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,798
veggies inside but

677
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,558
i'm moving towards no flowering indoor i

678
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,798
haven't been flowering indoor for

679
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,599
for like two years now and it's been all

680
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,839
outdoor

681
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:18,639
so how many plants do you typically

682
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:20,720
run um indoor like um

683
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,400
well outdoor usually well outdoor it's

684
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,240
hundreds it's usually in the hundreds

685
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:30,159
wow and like last season i had done

686
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,079
uh like 250 and they're all in vary in

687
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,400
size and pots and beds

688
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,798
and at one location and i actually

689
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,880
seeded every single one

690
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,720
earlier in that earlier last year i had

691
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,400
been i i was bringing

692
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,000
my seed stock to maine to trade with

693
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,880
some growers and they actually got taken

694
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,159
by the police for me so i lost like like

695
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,120
five years of breeding

696
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,400
and then yeah well the last year last

697
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,759
year i was like all right well i'm just

698
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,559
gonna chuck pollen everywhere

699
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,319
and now i have seeds forever yo but at

700
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:58,879
the same time dude seed making dude it's

701
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,439
like

702
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,520
you know you don't have to make f2s f3s

703
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,880
if you do it right the first time like i

704
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:09,279
i had pheno hunted uh like 2000 seeds

705
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,120
so out of 2000 seeds i found five males

706
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,079
that were insane so i just let them hit

707
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,119
the wind you know

708
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,480
and out of those 2000 seeds i found 250

709
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,279
females that were you know

710
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,919
very very good like some of them you

711
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,599
could

712
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,440
you could be completely dry and they

713
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,959
don't wilt they just still pray

714
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,960
you know even though they're completely

715
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,000
dry and you can kick them over and [ __ ]

716
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,640
um that's that's just from unique

717
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,919
unique lignin uh structures and [ __ ]

718
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,840
dude it's

719
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,759
i think a lot of this dude like a lot of

720
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,399
growing and um

721
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,038
is having a phenotype for your area you

722
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,000
know

723
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,279
um say like if i take some cali southern

724
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,960
cali seeds and then

725
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,879
take them to northern you know like

726
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,159
maine or something you know you'll have

727
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,000
you'll have some adverse effects

728
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,159
happening

729
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,440
for sure or if you take clones that were

730
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,840
under sea level or

731
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,360
above sea level and do vice versa you

732
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,798
know that's why people need to have

733
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,199
acclimated strains

734
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,798
and make their own you know because um

735
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,640
making your own strains

736
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,639
they'll grow perfectly where you live

737
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,038
you know just by making a few

738
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,880
generations of them

739
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,200
so with with hundreds and hundreds of

740
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,640
plants that you're managing at a time

741
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,400
seems like a lot of work there what

742
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,759
advice do you have to people who are

743
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,480
trying to do the same thing

744
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,599
you know what management advice and dude

745
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,159
i i just

746
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,119
i recommend just doing the organic route

747
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,000
you know like

748
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,399
it's easy you know like there's like

749
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
less

750
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,679
things i need to do for them and the

751
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,159
plant health is

752
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,960
maintained you know on a larger scale

753
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,600
you know

754
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,798
um if you were to give plants chemins

755
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,480
you need to

756
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:47,679
um you know have every plant

757
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,079
being wet the same way and then flushed

758
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,798
or

759
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,319
whatever and also um a lot more plant

760
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,079
diseases and

761
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,399
um things can happen from that you know

762
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,759
so like i i just recommend going down

763
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,640
the organic road not

764
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,240
not going the chems and having to water

765
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,559
things in to achieve what you want you

766
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,679
know to final results and stuff

767
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:07,678
because you're just spraying them with a

768
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,120
hose at this point really right like

769
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,798
are you wanting to tap water or do you

770
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,359
have like a ro thing set up

771
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,278
i don't even have ro do like i i used to

772
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,278
do i used to do rl you know like

773
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,720
um i i don't i'm not working with city

774
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:20,000
water you know or anything like that or

775
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,919
chlorinated gotcha

776
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,278
i have i have two separate wells for

777
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,159
both my locations

778
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,599
and like it's you know well water the

779
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,240
wall water i'm pulling is

780
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,719
uh my first one is 80 tds and the other

781
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,640
ones

782
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,880
is 120 and um oh wow that's low

783
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,240
for especially for well water yeah and

784
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,360
um what's in it

785
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,000
is magnesium calcium uh

786
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:45,839
small amounts of iron silica you know

787
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,798
all [ __ ] that i'd be adding to it it's

788
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,199
pretty funny you know

789
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,720
and you'd even you even drink it or put

790
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,000
it on your skin it makes it soft from

791
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,319
its mineral content

792
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,400
so like just from that like giving that

793
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,839
to bacteria or or giving that to a

794
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,519
fungus you know stimulates it

795
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:02,079
um watering is definitely a key though

796
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,480
man

797
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,439
like i i don't just i don't always just

798
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,200
give them water like

799
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,960
the more you give a plant the better the

800
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,080
bigger you'll get in terms of

801
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,079
teas you know and brewing teas um but i

802
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,519
can by all means i mix up soil that can

803
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,480
just be sustained with just water

804
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,879
beginning to end

805
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,360
like that cute mix like from uh the

806
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,960
clatton's cooth recipe

807
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,079
i'm gonna have to look into that yeah

808
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,038
for sure like that's right on

809
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,038
bubblespoil.com

810
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,558
i had spent a lot of dough on build a

811
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:31,038
soil uh this season even though i'll

812
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:32,879
probably

813
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,798
try and uh source some things on the

814
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,440
east coast um and only have to order a

815
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,599
few things from them next year but um

816
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,440
but by i mean like they're the [ __ ] they

817
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,119
give you free information you know

818
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,480
in the whole nine yards what has been

819
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,918
your biggest yield

820
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,919
so far too big

821
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,278
probably 25 30 pounds

822
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,960
like that of of scentsy you know yeah

823
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,400
that's a that's a record breaker for the

824
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,038
podcast so far i'm pretty

825
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,320
sure that's like you know at one time

826
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:04,319
you know and uh

827
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,439
the the money that i had spent dude to

828
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,759
do that like it's

829
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,200
nothing dude it's like it's it's almost

830
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,919
it's almost nothing it's like

831
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,720
it's like my the ounces and the pounds

832
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,759
are

833
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,759
are the ounces are like pennies about um

834
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:18,960
with with using organics and using the

835
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,278
sun and [ __ ] like that

836
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,640
so that was that was an outdoor grow and

837
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,759
then how many plants was it

838
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,159
roughly that was off like 80 plants

839
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,359
okay like and but you know usually you

840
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,760
know like i can yield

841
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,879
off of one plant i can go over you know

842
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,879
like 2.5

843
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,039
you know and um bigger than that you

844
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,880
know it's all about the veg

845
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,400
it's all about filling in a screen you

846
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,760
know too

847
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,200
uh it's gonna be funny like this is this

848
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,400
season is the biggest season that i've

849
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,000
ever gone and then

850
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,720
like next season you know even bigger

851
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and bigger it's how it's always been

852
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,079
like uh i when i look at your instagram

853
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,839
like you talk about filling in a screen

854
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,879
you're not scrogging all these plants

855
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,000
are you

856
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,679
um no but the ones that are going to go

857
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,240
into the geodome that's going to be

858
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,559
a scrog net completely 500 like almost

859
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,720
531 square feet of scrog

860
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,000
and oh wow yeah and that's you know the

861
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,640
canopy will be six

862
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,079
up about six and a half seven feet tall

863
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,080
so you'll be on a step ladder

864
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,278
you know just looking at the canopy it's

865
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:22,480
gonna be sick

866
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:24,079
and you're going to um you're so

867
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,919
i noticed like you're doing like you're

868
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,839
you're training the plants and pulling

869
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,919
them down like the branches down

870
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,319
yeah like and i do that every day you

871
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,720
know i could i have uh the bamboo i just

872
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:38,319
found actually a local like uh

873
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,919
um bamboo spot to just go get mad bamboo

874
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,439
and like start doing

875
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,120
more training but um i i complete you

876
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,798
know you don't have to top your plants

877
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,599
either you can um

878
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,599
you can regul you can you can uh get

879
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,839
oxen to be

880
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,240
you know regulated just by bending the

881
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,319
plant oxen is uh the hor a growth

882
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,880
hormone that that uh

883
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,480
is responsible for the elongation and uh

884
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,278
when you when you take off the apical

885
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,558
meristem

886
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:08,558
uh you're you're you know um

887
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,158
it's like a shock to the plant you know

888
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:13,359
and it's i don't know

889
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,840
um it can be beneficial but by all means

890
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,879
all you

891
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:18,959
if the plant is able to just be bent um

892
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,278
and then held down in that bent position

893
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,079
then you're achieving the same thing you

894
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:23,839
know

895
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,359
but better you're you don't have to do

896
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,079
any kind of stress like cutting the

897
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,479
plant up

898
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,839
uh you're maintaining more growth matter

899
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,120
are there any books that you can like

900
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:32,558
reference that you've learned this stuff

901
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,558
from or is it all just from like

902
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:36,240
trial and error and the internet i've

903
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,639
i've definitely i've been

904
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,640
reading a few books like um teeming with

905
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,000
fungus teaming with microbes teaming

906
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,278
with nutrients

907
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
mycelium running uh

908
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:49,759
but you know and um a lot of a lot of

909
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,480
trial and error dude you know higher

910
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,038
hybrid

911
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,599
you know videos for so long dude and

912
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,480
like

913
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:58,000
i got i literally did a huge you know

914
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,880
like um

915
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,679
uh like 25 gallon like a few 25 gallon

916
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,480
dw

917
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,360
well uh rdwc all connected and [ __ ] and

918
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,440
uh and um

919
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,119
replicated his style you know and i love

920
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,880
it i still to this day i still love

921
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,639
hydroponics and i still respect it

922
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,880
but i just won't go down that route

923
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,080
again it's just uh it's too wasteful

924
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,679
you know you just you know

925
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:21,359
you don't you don't think about what

926
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,278
when it where it goes down the drain

927
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,639
on a small scale you know it doesn't

928
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:25,919
matter you know if you're not if

929
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,600
when you get to a larger scale and

930
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,480
you're dealing with hundreds of plants

931
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,000
then you should

932
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,360
you should be you should think about

933
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,079
what you're putting into the ground and

934
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,599
then where that

935
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,119
water going and all that because anyone

936
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,319
can just you know spend money you know

937
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:37,918
on chems and then just

938
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:39,519
spew them on anything you know to make

939
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,440
money or something like that but

940
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,720
that's not what it's about yeah for sure

941
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,120
bro i agree with you there

942
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,919
um and i agree that doing a large scale

943
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,678
with chemicals

944
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,038
is gonna be i mean like how are you

945
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,360
gonna be able to afford to do that

946
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,278
it's like yeah you know by all means you

947
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,199
know like unless you did you could spend

948
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,319
a thousand dollars and get 10 grand back

949
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,360
at you easily you know

950
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:01,759
over that you know with or whatever

951
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,278
it's it's funny how uh how much it

952
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:06,158
actually costs to make a pound

953
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:08,079
with chems it's it's not much money but

954
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,080
you're making waste you have a lot of

955
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,439
it's there isn't any kind of you need to

956
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,960
go back to the hydro store

957
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,960
when you're done you know and go get

958
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,200
more nutrients um

959
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,440
for sure you know it'll pay it off but

960
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,120
that product isn't as superior

961
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,640
the growth hormone regular in in the

962
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,519
pgrs and whatever they

963
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,399
they do give you a bud structure that it

964
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,440
looks better

965
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:31,678
than organically grown bud um

966
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,880
but it's not it won't smoke better it's

967
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,679
not going to be better for you in the

968
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,840
whole nine yards

969
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,880
terpene content the terpene content from

970
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,959
organic and

971
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,080
by using the sun it's unmatched you'll

972
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,919
never be able to

973
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,278
get the terpenes that you get from

974
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,120
outdoor indoor

975
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:48,480
you know just uh that's just the way it

976
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:52,000
is what was your biggest catastrophe

977
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,038
in growing definitely indoor

978
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,519
uh powdery mildew indoor you know i have

979
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,319
i've gone through fighting the battle

980
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,159
through flour

981
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,079
is that the third powdery mildew indoor

982
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,320
we've heard it seems like almost every

983
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,759
podcast powdery mildew is brought up

984
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,480
and then at least it's not like spider

985
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:12,079
mites or some [ __ ] you know yeah

986
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,480
um definitely pm dude it's insane like

987
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,798
it

988
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,159
what i think is just like um powdery

989
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,720
mildew for indoor dude

990
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,840
it's like it's if you even see that dude

991
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,079
it's like

992
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:24,158
catastrophic has catastrophe you know

993
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,558
like did it crush your yield or what

994
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,440
yeah it the fact that you see it it's

995
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,480
cutting your yield

996
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,120
like it's it's um you shouldn't fight

997
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,798
the battle

998
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,319
going into flour you know if you see it

999
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:38,319
in veg already don't flower

1000
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:40,480
you know it's like um cut everything

1001
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,240
uh get new genetics uh don't don't

1002
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,519
accept genetics from somebody you don't

1003
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,599
really know very well

1004
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,079
and then start or start from speed and

1005
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,319
start with a very stellar sterile room

1006
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:52,240
um sometimes doing that is this is the

1007
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:53,918
better option than fighting the battle

1008
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,120
anyone dealing with pm dude it's like

1009
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,880
you should really rethink about what

1010
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,319
you're doing you know because um

1011
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,559
it's it's just a battle not worth

1012
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:02,720
fighting you should always be doing ipm

1013
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,240
uh integrated pest management so you'd

1014
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,558
never see that [ __ ] you know

1015
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,319
you should have your you know a regiment

1016
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,879
that you you know everyone has their own

1017
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,439
regiment

1018
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,320
that they do and um it's it's crucial

1019
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,278
like um

1020
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,798
you can make a a lactobacillic acid very

1021
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,919
it's very easy to make you take

1022
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:21,278
um you take rice rice wash water so you

1023
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,440
all you do is you take rice

1024
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,119
and you add some water and you um and

1025
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,120
then you mix it around and then

1026
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,719
you strain out the rice and then you add

1027
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,918
it to uh

1028
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,399
raw milk at um a 1 to 10 ratio so one

1029
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,960
part

1030
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:35,918
wash water 10 part milk and then you let

1031
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,120
that

1032
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,759
you let that uh you let that sit for 48

1033
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:42,398
hours

1034
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,079
and within within 12 hours within 24

1035
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,558
hours it'll already start separating

1036
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,000
uh cheese curd at the top and then

1037
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,398
lactobacilli acid

1038
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,839
serum on the bottom and you just take

1039
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:54,479
the cheese curd you can make

1040
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:55,199
meat cheese out of it and then that

1041
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,759
serum

1042
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,880
on the bottom is is an ipm you know like

1043
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,119
you you should spray

1044
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,159
lactobacillus on your lactobacilli acid

1045
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:03,839
on your plants like

1046
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,760
almost every day you know like or like

1047
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,639
three times four times uh four times a

1048
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,679
week or something

1049
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,840
i feel like people are going to get a

1050
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,240
lot of value out of here in that well

1051
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,599
dude

1052
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,599
yeah and um uh like

1053
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:16,959
korean natural farming is like something

1054
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,359
that everyone needs to start doing

1055
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,120
for growing their food growing for their

1056
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,599
ganja and all that [ __ ] just

1057
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,439
the amount of money that it takes to to

1058
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:25,839
to make the end result you know it's

1059
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,080
just

1060
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,918
it's insane like too just low right

1061
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,398
you're saying mainly low dude like for

1062
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,640
like

1063
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:34,798
hundreds and hundreds of acres to

1064
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,960
adequately like water that with say

1065
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,079
fermented plant juice would probably

1066
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,000
cost you like

1067
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:41,359
maybe fifty dollars you know if you know

1068
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,319
for a hundred acre for like three

1069
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,519
hundred eight pm

1070
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:47,038
yeah and uh all you gotta do is grow the

1071
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,679
plant matter you know

1072
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:50,798
it makes sense yeah right so the smaller

1073
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,519
time people i don't know if they're

1074
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:53,119
gonna

1075
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,679
be getting into it like the newer i

1076
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,359
don't know like the new growers but

1077
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,798
yeah man i mean when i was a new grower

1078
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,639
like what i was saying it's all about

1079
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,158
chems so i was just looking into what

1080
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,399
company

1081
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,559
is doing you know it has the best prices

1082
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,480
and the best results and everything

1083
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:09,759
it's super easy to get like to walk into

1084
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,000
a grocery store

1085
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,440
yep like the first time i walked into a

1086
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,559
grocery store i bought

1087
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,039
like a lot more than i needed i know and

1088
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:19,679
like

1089
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,079
i'm sure they had smile on their face

1090
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,760
yeah

1091
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,119
like exactly i mean that's the thing

1092
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,879
about going in the grow shop and like

1093
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,280
looking at a magazine

1094
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,799
yeah is they're gonna try to convince

1095
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,720
you that you need to use as many bottles

1096
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,240
of nutrients as possible regardless of

1097
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,439
the company i mean they're all there to

1098
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,078
make money

1099
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,838
and so exactly but there's a reason

1100
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,480
there's ten part systems and not

1101
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:41,838
three parts yeah you'll see the organic

1102
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,440
side and it'll just be a little

1103
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,279
you know it'll be a little section you

1104
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,358
can go into and you know

1105
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,480
um everything else is chems everything

1106
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:50,559
you know chem's everywhere

1107
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,480
and the i'm sure the people in there

1108
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,119
won't won't

1109
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,240
you know um you know bring up anything

1110
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,400
about organics or

1111
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,519
or whatever if unless you ask or unless

1112
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,280
you're looking for it you know

1113
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,480
right because the margins aren't going

1114
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,200
to be as good for they're not going to

1115
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,880
make as much

1116
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:07,919
as much money selling you organic stuff

1117
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,160
and on top of that like the marketing

1118
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,838
that these companies are doing it's

1119
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,598
pretty cool like you go in there and you

1120
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,679
look at all the nutrient bottles like

1121
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,640
they'll make a bottle of salt look cool

1122
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,559
yeah for sure dude

1123
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,920
right and it's and everything's just you

1124
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,799
know got the same [ __ ] in it

1125
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,599
and in different quantities and whatever

1126
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,359
else

1127
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,280
or for sure it's easy to get lost in

1128
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:28,400
there yeah and to say that it's you know

1129
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,160
like um

1130
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,440
it's tested or it's um it's commercially

1131
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,279
you know it's used like advanced

1132
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,960
nutrients i was like contacted by the

1133
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,000
like east coast advanced nutrient guy

1134
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,440
and he's like oh

1135
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,199
you know you should start using a

1136
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,920
commercial nutrient or something like

1137
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,799
that i'm just like

1138
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,559
you know i always just delete that the

1139
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,480
years you know when i was younger like i

1140
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:49,519
had poured chems right on an organic

1141
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,320
garden you know like

1142
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,880
hot general hydroponics and i had

1143
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
yielded

1144
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,400
i had yielded more than i would have

1145
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,880
yielded but you know i had hurt that

1146
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,200
ground

1147
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,200
you know and it um and then it would

1148
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,519
need time to repair itself you know

1149
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,039
um and for those salts to fully leach

1150
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:08,320
off and drain off and

1151
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:10,239
for whatever else but like i saw like

1152
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,920
what i don't know like what the effects

1153
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,199
are since i've lived in the same place

1154
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,119
and that's another thing i actually have

1155
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,879
not moved my whole like i've moved one

1156
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,559
time from one when i was in third grade

1157
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,160
to where i am now and i haven't moved

1158
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:21,519
and i've grown bud here my whole life

1159
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,960
so like that's the reason why you know

like that like ever

1174
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,079
you know the soil wasn't as fertile and

1175
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,760
when you start when you start doing

1176
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,800
organics and you start getting better at

1177
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,400
it you promote life

1178
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,480
and you promote [ __ ] to come to your

1179
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,559
[ __ ] to work for you you know basically

that's awesome dude yeah for sure so

1181
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,239
having the knowledge that you have now

1182
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,039
if you can go back in time and talk to

1183
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,879
yourself before you start growing

1184
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:08,719
what advice would you give to yourself

1185
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,800
just go the living soil route

1186
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,799
[ __ ] hydro [ __ ] chemicals like

1187

with chems

1217
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,000
but i know i know um i'm confident in my

1218
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,920
abilities that

1219
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,199
that you know that chem grown blood is

1220
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,559
going to be dank you know

1221
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,480
dude i gotta join them out there man

1222
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:23,679
that's not that far to drive yeah for

1223
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,960
sure yo like um

1224
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:26,319
in massachusetts there's a lot of

1225
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,679
hurdles you gotta go through you can't

1226
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,720
grow straight organics in

1227
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:32,159
in and in commercially for massachusetts

1228
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,639
at least uh

1229
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,440
you got there's like too many um there's

1230
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:39,199
too many uh

1231
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,200
standards the like the heavy metals um

1232
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,799
and a lot a lot of other things it's

1233
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,239
just and also mold

1234
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,560
and things like that like if you have a

1235
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,479
living soil and you have uh mushroom

1236
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,480
sporulating in your indoor environment

1237
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,320
you'll have you'll have um

1238
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,000
uh mutanogen on it you know and it'll

1239
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,920
it'll it'll spark your uh

1240
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,199
and it won't pass or something like that

1241
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,320
so i got you

1242
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:02,719
you gotta like grow with water and

1243
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,079
rock wool and cocoa and all that and

1244
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,358
then flush it and then

1245
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,920
you know that's just the way it's going

1246
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:09,598
to be for right now but yeah

1247
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,599
tons of people do it and they succeed

1248
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,720
and ori origron

1249
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,160
um i i really admire his uh his way that

1250
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,039
he's

1251
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,440
that he's doing his um dispensary i'm

1252
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:21,279
sure

1253
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,358
i'm sure oregon has a high standards as

1254
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,560
well i'm pretty sure massachusetts has

1255
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:25,199
the highest standard in the whole

1256
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,400
country

1257
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:30,399
which kind of it's uh makes it harder to

1258
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,079
you know make a product to put it on the

1259
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,119
shelves but in my opinion that's cool

1260
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,480
because all the

1261
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,400
all of the patients will be getting a

1262
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,358
higher quality product but

1263
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,079
you know um what he does is he takes a

1264
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:41,679
pro mix

1265
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,640
just straight you know straight pro-mix

1266
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:47,279
and uh he uses dragonfly earth medicine

1267
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:49,440
um which is an organic water-soluble

1268
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,920
nutrient and that's it so all he uses is

1269
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,599
uh

1270
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,760
those two things you know and that's

1271
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,119
he's not using any kind of chemical

1272
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,000
um his by-product is uh three gallons of

1273
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,000
uh of

1274
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,838
of pro-mix you know which she piles up

1275
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,358
you know hundreds of those three gallons

1276
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,039
and piles them up and then uses it for

1277
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:07,519
outdoor organic views you know

1278
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,279
instead yeah they're using rockwool

1279
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:10,400
which takes like 4 000 years to

1280
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,040
decompose and

1281
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,639
it's glass and you know you know i've

1282
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:16,000
seen i've seen his instagram and shit's

1283
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:17,440
definitely legit i don't i might have

1284
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,119
even reached out to him but

1285
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,960
i don't doubt anyone that grows indoors

1286
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,960
with chems just because of

1287
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,880
um just because of how sterile you need

1288
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,639
to be and how careful you need to be

1289
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,358
with indoor

1290
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,279
and all you guys i mean mr growit like

1291
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:33,358
everybody who has a youtube channel

1292
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,800
and or an instagram that's just sharing

1293
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,960
their knowledge and information

1294
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,400
like you guys aren't really getting much

1295
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,599
out of doing that like you're doing it

1296
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,358
for the love of

1297
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,200
the industry like maybe someone maybe

1298
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:45,199
some people are making money now

1299
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,639
but after they've like grown a bit but

1300
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:49,279
like when you start doing that and you

1301
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:50,480
don't have any subscribers or like

1302
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,400
all these people are just doing it to

1303
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,280
share information and help the industry

1304
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,119
and so

1305
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,480
i definitely like a lot of my [ __ ] that

1306
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,400
i've learned has definitely come from

1307
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,599
you know my own trial and error but like

1308
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,160
i've definitely talked to the right

1309
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,039
people and and um and instagram has

1310
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,039
definitely helped me

1311
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:06,960
like tremendously meeting people you

1312
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:08,880
know and um seeing and you know coming

1313
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,519
to this final consensus of how i grow

1314
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,240
now

1315
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:14,000
like um putting information out there

1316
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:15,439
dude it's not like it's not a secret you

1317
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,199
know especially with

1318
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,559
growing this but growing bud it's not

1319
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:20,318
secret and people shouldn't

1320
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,159
have to hide their methods they should

1321
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,400
